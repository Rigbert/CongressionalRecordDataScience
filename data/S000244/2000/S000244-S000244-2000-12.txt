Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.  Mr. Speaker, title I of H.R. 4940 designates the museum operated by the Secretary of Energy in Oak Ridge, Tennessee, as the American Museum of Science and Energy and grants ownership of this name to the United States. It further provides legal remedies for the unauthorized use of the name.  Title I also authorizes the museum to accept gifts, operate a retail outlet, and lease space on its premises. In addition, it authorizes the museum to recruit and train volunteers.  The American Museum of Science and Energy is the second most frequently visited attraction in the Knoxville metropolitan area. Since the beginning of operations in 1949, the museum has hosted nearly 10 million visitors from all 50 States and more than 40 foreign countries. The Oak Ridge Convention and Visitor's Bureau estimates the museum generates $6 million to $7 million annually in revenue to the community.  The gentleman from Tennessee (Mr. Wamp) introduced H.R. 4940 on July 24, 2000. The bill has strong bipartisan support, and I would like to compliment the gentleman from Tennessee (Mr. Wamp) for its introduction.  H.R. 4940, as amended, also includes a second title. Title II is the modified text of H.R. 2086, the Networking and Information Technology Research and Development Act. The House passed H.R. 2086 by voice vote on February 15, 2000. The Senate passed it with some minor changes on September 21, 2000 as a part of another legislative vehicle.  It has strong bipartisan support and has been endorsed by 61 organizations, including the U.S. Chamber of Commerce and the Council of Scientific Society Presidents. I urge the House to pass this legislation.  Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.
