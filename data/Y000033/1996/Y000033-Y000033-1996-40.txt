Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.  Mr. Speaker, may I suggest respectfully, I have great respect for the gentleman from Massachusetts [Mr. Studds], and his efforts in the fisheries field. As many times as he has mentioned the subject, I think this bill will probably get that name through attrition more than anything else.  But I will say again that the gentleman from Massachusetts, it may be the last time he works on this floor on this type of legislation, and that I do thank him for his love for the sea and the fishermen he has served with, and the sense that he and I had a great deal in common with regard to the oceans. I believe we have worked well.  I cannot agree with him more about the actions of the Senate. I will defend my senior Senator. We worked on the bill, and of course they were threatened with, you know, holds and blocks, et cetera. This is not what I would have liked to have done, but it is the best thing we can do for our oceans today.  Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.
