 President, I wish to pay tribute to a distinguished Kentuckian who was a passionate advocate for and supporter of our Nation's military, especially the troops stationed at Kentucky's Fort Campbell and in the neighboring community of Hopkinsville, KY. Clarissa ``T.C.'' Freeman, a woman so devoted to our menand women in uniform that one chapter of the Association of the United States Army, AUSA, named an award after her, sadly passed away on May 19. She was 83 years old.  Freeman understood the importance of the men and women stationed at Fort Campbell and worked diligently to ensure that these servicemembers and her community got the recognition they deserved. Freeman was one of Kentucky's civilian aides to the Secretary of the Army since 2008, holding a ceremonial rank equal to a lieutenant general. However, her contributions to our servicemembers began long before that.  She first became involved as an AUSA volunteer as a young Army wife in Fort Hood, TX, welcoming her husband back home from his first tour of duty in Vietnam. Freeman felt her husband and others returning from Vietnam did not get the recognition and appreciation they deserved. T.C. was right about this, as she was about so many other important issues concerning our Nation's servicemembers.  She decided to do something about it personally. She took care of wounded soldiers. She coordinated welcome-home events. She advocated on behalf of Army families on housing and quality-of-life issues that affected them. The Freemans moved to Hopkinsville and took up the cause of soldiers at Fort Campbell after T.C.'s husband, Army COL Bobby Freeman, was named garrison commander at Fort Campbell.  T.C. Freeman's support for the 101st Airborne Division, headquartered at Fort Campbell, was crucial throughout the years, especially in 1985 when 248 soldiers died in an air crash in Newfoundland while returning from a peacekeeping mission.  In 2009, Freeman was among the first nine honored as a ``champion'' of Fort Campbell and saw her portrait installed in the division's headquarters building. She served as chapter president and board member of the Tennessee-Kentucky chapter of AUSA. She was also an honorary member of the 327th Infantry Regiment and the 160th Special Operations Aviation regiments and a distinguished member of the 502nd and 187th Infantry regiments.  T.C. and her husband, Bobby, raised two sons who served in the Persian Gulf and a daughter who was an Army wife. Elaine and I want to send our condolences to the Freeman family and to the many who knew and loved T.C. I am grateful for the long friendship I had with her, and I know she will be deeply missed--especially by the brave servicemembers she worked so hard to support and their families.  An area publication, the Kentucky New Era, recently published an article detailing T.C. Freeman's legacy. I ask unanimous consent that the article be printed in the Record.  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in the Record, as follows:               [From the Kentucky New Era, May 20, 2016]          T.C. Freeman, Tireless Fort Campbell Advocate, Dies                          (By Andrew Oppmann)       Clarissa ``T.C.'' Freeman, known and honored by generals      and privates alike as Fort Campbell's Mom for her devoted      service and advocacy of the U.S. Army, died at 7 a.m.      Thursday at Jennie Stuart Medical Center after a long      illness. She was 83.       One of Kentucky's civilian aides to the secretary of the      Army since 2008, Freeman battled pulmonary fibrosis for more      than five years. However, despite the debilitating effects of      the disease, her service to Fort Campbell rarely slowed.       Her husband, retired Army Col. Bobby Freeman, was a former      garrison commander at Fort Campbell.       Funeral services will be at 3 p.m. Sunday at First United      Methodist Church, Hopkinsville, and burial will be at 1 p.m.      Monday at Kentucky Veterans Cemetery-West. Visitation will be      from 4 until 8 p.m. Saturday at Hughart, Beard and Giles      Funeral Home, Hopkinsville, and from 2 p.m. until the funeral      hour at the church.       As a civilian aide to the Army secretary, Freeman held the      ceremonial rank equal to a lieutenant general. She used her      status as a platform to call attention to the service and      sacrifice of the soldiers of the 101st Airborne Division (Air      Assault).       Hopkinsville Mayor Carter Hendricks knew Freeman as a      ``tireless, tenacious and caring advocate'' for Fort      Campbell.       At welcome-home ceremonies, Freeman often was seen handing      off her cell phone to a young soldier who didn't have family      present but wanted to call home.       Freeman was on a Chamber of Commerce committee that hired      Hendricks to be the military affairs director in 2004. She      became a dear friend and supporter, he said.       No task was too small for Freeman, and she always followed      through on her promises, the mayor said.       U.S. Sen. Mitch McConnell, R-Ky., said, ``T.C. understood      the importance of the men and women stationed at the Kentucky      (post) and worked diligently to ensure that these service      members and her community got the recognition they      deserved.''       At a 2013 ceremony honoring Freeman, retired Gen. Richard      A. Cody, former post and division commander, said, ``T.C. was      an Army wife and Army mom and a model for everyone here. She      made a difference in the life of me and my family.''       In 2009, Freeman and her husband were among the first nine      honored as Champions of Fort Campbell, and their portraits      were installed on a wall inside the division's headquarters      building.       She was a life member of the Association of the United      States Army, serving as a regional president, as well as      chapter president and board member of the Tennessee-Kentucky      chapter. The chapter in 2013 named a brigade-level award for      membership participation in her honor.       Freeman worked as an aide to former U.S. Sen. Jim Bunning      and current U.S. Rep. Ed Whitfield and was a member of the      Kentucky Military Affairs Commission.       She was an honorary member of the 327th Infantry Regiment      and the 160th Special Operations Aviation regiments a      distinguished member of the 502nd and 187th Infantry      regiments.       As the wife of a decorated Vietnam aviator, and mother to      two sons who served in the Persian Gulf and a daughter who      was an Army wife, Freeman told an Army interviewer in 2009      that she knew what other spouses were going through when      their husbands and wives were deployed.       ``The first Army family I took care of was mine,'' she      said.       Freeman first became involved as an AUSA volunteer at Fort      Hood, Texas, as a young Army wife.       She told an Army journalist that when her husband returned      from his first tour of duty in Vietnam, she was disappointed      and saddened by the reception he received. She vowed to do      something about it.       ``They didn't understand how important our Army was,'' she      said in a 2009 article. ``I always feel the need to give      something back to our soldiers and to their families.''       And give back she did. She was involved in taking care of      wounded soldiers. She planned welcome-home events. She      tackled granular issues that troubled Army families, such as      ID card and housing problems.       She hosted luncheons, consoled families in their grief and,      as a champion of Fort Campbell, was a fierce advocate for      funding of the post that straddles the Kentucky and Tennessee      borders.       Cody, quoted by The Eagle Post in a 2013 article on the      AUSA award named in her honor, said Freeman was diligent to      greet soldiers as they returned or departed for duty      overseas.       She would look around for a soldier who had no one waiting      for him or her and would give him or her a hug and a thank      you.       ``When they (the soldier's family) can't, I stand in for      them,'' she said.       Maj. Gen. Jim Myles, at a 2009 ceremony covered by Army      journalists, called Freeman ``a national treasure and a      hero.''       When she was a VIP or special guest at an event, Myles said      she would always divert the spotlight to the soldiers.       ``I've watched CASAs like T.C. make a difference in      soldiers' lives in ways green-suiters couldn't do,'' he said.       Cody, in the 2013 article, recalled how Freeman ``wrapped      her arms around this great division'' after 248 soldiers from      the 101st died in air crash at Gander, Newfoundland, while      returning from a peacekeeping mission shortly before      Christmas in 1985.       The Freemans moved to Hopkinsville when Col. Freeman was      named garrison commander at Fort Campbell. They remained      there after he retired from the Army.       Freeman's passion for the soldiers of Fort Campbell never      ceased, even as her illness limited her mobility in recent      months. She was active on social media and often sent out      messages of support to the division while on bed rest.       ``There is a lot that can be done to help our soldiers,''      she told the Army journalist in 2009. ``There are no      boundaries to what goodness one can contribute for the      benefit of the soldiers.''                          ____________________
