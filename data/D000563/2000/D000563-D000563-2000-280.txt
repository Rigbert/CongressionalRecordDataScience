Mr. President, if there is no other Senator wishing to speak the first time onthis, I will speak briefly in conclusion. I have spoken to the chairman of the committee. It is my hope that I can ask for the yeas and nays and that we can schedule a final vote on the amendment, as well as on any other pending amendments at a later hour when all Senators reassemble. If that is acceptable, I will speak for a few moments in conclusion.
