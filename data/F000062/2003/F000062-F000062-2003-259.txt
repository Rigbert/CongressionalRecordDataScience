 President, I have never heard a speech that better charted the values of free peoples--not only of free peoples in our country but I think free peoples all over the world. I have never heard a speech that was as incredibly positive as this speech, thatcalled on everyone to rise to their best value, to stand to their best commitment, and to perform as free-loving peoples should everywhere.  On a scale of 1 to 10, Mr. President, that speech, in my book, was a 10. I have never heard better. And I have never seen a course charted that is sounder, truer, or can redound in better benefits for freedom-loving people.  I salute Tony Blair, the distinguished Prime Minister of the United Kingdom.  Thank you, Mr. President.
