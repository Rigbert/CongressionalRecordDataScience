President, I begin by not only thanking Senator Campbell for his leadership on the Appropriations Subcommittee on the Legislative Branch over the last 2 years but by congratulating him on today's events commemorating the opening of the National Museum of the American Indian. This is an opening that was long overdue. I know he has played a personal role, with Senator Inouye and many others, in the realization of this dream.  It is my understanding--and he has probably made reference to it--that there is the largest gathering of Native Americans and Indians in the history of Washington, DC, taking place on the Mall at this moment. Many of them were on the planes as we came to Washington. You could tell they were brimming with pride over the recognition they have received, a recognition which is long overdue.  Senator Campbell has been a great leader in so many respects for his State of Colorado and for the Nation. But he has really played an important role in the conversation and dialog of the Senate. He has been a steady and reliable voice speaking for Native Americans. He comes today to the floor of the Senate in tribal dress; I am sure proud of his heritage. When I got up this morning, I thought I would pick a tie that might be noticed. My guess is, in comparison to the chairman of the subcommittee, they won't even know I was here today.  I will say this: We are proud that he has made such a great contribution. I know this museum means so much to him personally.  He is going to be greatly missed as he enters his retirement. I wish him the best of luck. I only hope he will take an occasional break from visiting with his grandchildren and ride his Harley Davidson back to Washington to visit with us from time to time. He will certainly be a welcome guest when he does.  The fiscal year 2005 Legislative Branch appropriations bill which we are considering today is comprehensive, thorough, and fair, especially in light of the tight funding constraints we are operating under. Our allocation does not allow us to begin a variety of construction projects throughout the complex, but all safety-related projects are fully funded, as they should be.  I thank Chairman Campbell for including me as a partner in each step of the process. The highlights of the bill have already been alluded to by the chairman. There is no point in revisiting them. I thank him especially for two or three. One particular project, the Library of Congress Adventures of the American Mind, means a great deal to my State of Illinois and many other States and to many teachers. What we are doing is opening up the vast resources of the Library of Congress to be used as teaching tools across America in classrooms far and wide, in small towns as well as big cities. Without exception, every teacher I have spoken to is literally amazed at what is there in terms of primary documents easily accessible to teach children about the greatness of this country and to educate them to be better informed and more competitive in the 21st century.  Before I wrap up today, I thank Carrie Apostolou of the majority staff as well as Terry Sauvain, Drew Willison, and Nancy Olkewicz of the minority staff, and Pat Souders from my personal staff for all their hard work on this bill.  I yield the floor.                      Open World Leadership Center
