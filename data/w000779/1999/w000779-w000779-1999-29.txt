President, this is the eighth time in recent days I have come to the floor to talk about the issue of prescription drugs because, frankly, I think this is a priority for this session of the Congress and one we can tackle in a bipartisan way.  Senator Olympia Snowe and I have teamed up on a bipartisan bill. We were able to get 54 votes on the floor of the Senate for a concrete funding plan for our approach.  What I have been doing, as folks can see in the poster right next to me, is urging seniors to send in copies of their prescription drug bills. The poster is very clear. We would like seniors to send copies of their prescription drug bills directly to each of us in the Senate so we can emphasize how important it is that this be tackled in a bipartisan way.  Senator Snowe and I have heard again and again that this is an issue that just has to be put off until after the 2000 election. The Republicans and Democrats are going to just bicker about it and sort of have an ongoing finger-pointing exercise and nothing will get done.  I happen to think there are a lot of Members of the Senate who want to tackle this issue and want to tackle it in this session of Congress.  Since I have come to the floor of the Senate and brought this poster urging seniors to send their prescription drug bills in, I have heard from a number of our colleagues in the Senate. They have said we need bipartisan action. A number of them have asked for copies of the bipartisan Snowe-Wyden bill. They want to know more about it.  I am going to continue tonight to read from some of these letters, particularly from folks I am hearing from in Oregon. But I want to take a few minutes tonight to talk about some important issues relating to this question of prescription drug coverage for senior citizens and particularly ask about this issue of whether we can afford, as a nation, to cover prescription medicine.  Mr. President and colleagues, I believe America cannot afford to not cover prescription drugs. The reason that is the case is that drugs in the 21st century are going to be preventive. They are going to allow for patients to be treated on an outpatient basis and it will make part A of Medicare, the hospitalization part of Medicare, less expensive.  I mentioned a drug the other night, an important anticoagulant that helps to prevent strokes. It is a drug that would cost perhaps $1,000 a year to assist seniors. If we can prevent those strokes through the anticoagulant drugs, we can save $100,000 that might be incurred as a result of expenses associated with a disability.  There is one bipartisan bill before the Senate dealing with this prescription drug issue. It is the Snowe-Wyden legislation. My view is we can't afford to continue to pass up the opportunity to address these health care issues in a preventive way rather than incurring the extraordinary expenses for more institutional care.  I will mention a few of the drugs that will be particularly important to older people. One is Neupogen, which helps cancer patients and others with compromised immune systems boost their white blood cell counts and avoid hospital stays. Another is Glucophage, which is now being used to help those at risk for diabetes from getting that disease which causes so many other serious health problems.  My mom has had diabetes for a long time. I have seen the costs of these medicines. To think there is an opportunity with a particular drug to cover these seniors with their prescription drug bills seems to me to be an option as a nation we cannot afford to pass up.  Another drug is Vasotec, which treats high blood pressure and helps to stave off strokes and heart disease and other major problems.  These are all important medications. They do cost money, but the bottom line is we can use these medicines. When seniors receive these medicines, they are in a position to stave off much more serious and much more expensive problems. It is sensible, in my view, to make sure seniors who need these medications--that are preventive in nature--can get them. Under the bipartisan Snowe-Wyden bill, that would be done.  As far as I am concerned, in my reading of history, there is pretty much nothing that can get accomplished in the Senate that is truly important that isn't bipartisan. Our proposal gives each senior a chance at affordable prescription medicine. It ought to be recognizable to Members of Congress because a version of this model is what ensures good health for the families of Members of this body and the Congress.  Since my days with the Gray Panthers--I have been working on this prescription drug issue for many years now--I have seen how many seniors have to walk an economic tightrope, balancing their food against their fuel costs and their fuel costs against their medical bills. We have now more than 20 percent of the Nation's older people paying more than $1,000 per year for prescription drugs. The typical senior is using 18 prescriptions a year.  One constituent from Medford, OR, wrote that from a modest income he spent more than $1,230 so far this year on prescription medicines.  The typical senior is taking 18 different prescriptions. I hope, as a result of this effort to collect these drug bills from seniors, we can actually get some relief for people in this country who are facing such serious and urgent health care needs.  Some have said we ought to wait until after the next election, we ought to wait for comprehensive Medicare reform. I know the Presiding Officer believes strongly in this. There are a lot of Members who want to see broader, more comprehensive Medicare reform. Under the Snowe-Wyden prescription drug proposal, we are using the kind of principles that make sense for Medicare in the 21st century. It is choice-oriented. It gives a lot of options to older people. We use marketplace forces to contain costs.  It has worked for Members of Congress and their families. I think it can work for my constituents at home in Oregon. I think it can work for the older people of this country. I am hopeful in the days ahead we can make the case for why it is important the Senate Act in this session.  The question of prescription drugs and will Congress tackle it now--all of the political prognosticators have said this is an issue the Congress is going to punt on. They have said this is an issue that is going to have to be put off. I don't see how, when seniors are sending copies of their prescription drug bills, a Member of this body, a Member of this Congress, can say we ought to put this issue off when there is a model that 54 Members of the Senate have voted for, that has strong bipartisan support, that uses marketplace forces as a model. Let's not say this is something that ought to be put off.  I think we know what needs to be done. I think we can do it in a cost-effective fashion. Our bill doesn't involve price controls. Some seem to think that is the way to go. What troubles me about plans to deal with prescription drug costs that involve price controls, we will have massive cost-shifting. If we have Medicare acting as the buyer for all the medicine, it may be possible for the Government to negotiate a discount. I have always said that might be possible. What troubles me about that approach is we will have the cost passed on to someone else who might be 26 or 27--maybe a divorced mom who has a couple of kids--working as hard as they can, and all of a sudden they find out their prescription drug bill shoots up because Congress adopted an approach in this area that doesn't use marketplace forces.  Under the bipartisan Snowe-Wyden plan, the only bipartisan prescription drug bill now before the Senate, we reject those cost controls. We don't advocate a one-size-fits-all Federal approach. We use marketplace forces, the kind of forces that help deliver decent and affordable care to Members of this body and our families.  I want to read briefly from a couple of the other letters I have received from Oregon. I will keep coming back to the floor of the Senate again and again until we get bipartisan action on this prescription drug issue. I think the question of prescription drugs is the kind of issue that can leave a legacy for this session. It is the kind of important question that will help folks and help families at a time when a lot have fallen between the cracks. We know the economy is strong. We know a lot of people are doing well. If they happen to be in the stock market, most of the time they are doing very well. But there are a lot of folks who don't have the stocks in the technology companies, a lot of folks are on modest incomes. A lot of the seniors I have worked with since my days with the Gray Panthers are telling me and telling other Members of the Senate they just can't afford their prescriptions. That is what this is about. They can't afford their prescriptions.  There is a right way and a wrong way to deal with that issue. The wrong way, in my view, is to have a price control regime and produce cost-shifting with intervention by Government. I don't think that will work. I think a lot of people will end up getting hurt by that approach. I think there would be a lot of unintended consequences.  The right kind of approach, the one advocated in the bipartisan Snowe-Wyden prescription drug bill, uses marketplace forces. It gives seniors the kind of bargaining power that health maintenance organizations would have. Those big organizations, the health maintenance organizations, can go out and negotiate deep discounts. They use their bargaining power in the marketplace to get discounts. What happens is seniors get shellacked twice. They get hit once because Medicare doesn't cover prescription drugs.  Medicare started out as half a loaf back in 1965. It did not cover prescriptions and eyeglasses and hearing aids and a variety of needs older people have. But as a result of the escalating costs of health care, a lot of seniors are paying more proportionately out of pocket today than when Medicare began in 1965.  So seniors are not able to afford their prescriptions, and that senior purchaser, a low-income elderly widow, in effect has to subsidize the big purchasers, the health maintenance organizations that can negotiate discounts.  There is a right way and a wrong way to deal with the issue of affordable medication. The wrong way is to create a one-size-fits-all Federal regime and put the Government in the business of trying to orchestrate this entire program. The other is to use a model that we know works. Under our proposal--we call it SPICE, the Senior Prescription Insurance Coverage Equity Act--Senator Snowe and I, we reject this Government model. We use an approach that has private sector options and choices and gives seniors bargaining power.  We hope more older people will send us copies of their prescription drug bills. This poster really says it all to seniors and their families:       Send us copies of your prescription drug bills.  Send them to your Senator. Write to:       Your Senator, U.S. Senate, Washington, D.C.  I am going to wrap up tonight--because I know several of our colleagues would like to discuss matters important to them--with just a couple of other letters.  From the Oregon coast in the last few days, I received a particularly poignant letter. It is from an individual with an income of about $1,000 per month. She has to take prescription medicine, a number of prescriptions. Over the last few months, out of her $1,000-a-month income, she has had to spend almost $700. That is just over the last few months, from somebody who is on a very modest income.  Picture any one of us, or our relatives, trying to get by on an income of $1,000 a month and having to spend a significant portion of it, around $700 just in recent days, on prescriptions. We know they would not be able to do it. But that is the reality of what seniors on the Oregon coast are facing. That is the reality of what seniors all over this country are facing. That is what the bipartisan Snowe-Wyden prescription drug bill seeks to deal with. We want that person to get some real relief. We think it is time for the Senate to act on a bipartisan basis.  One other letter I received from the Willamette Valley, not far from my hometown, I thought was also particularly poignant. This was from a senior who sent me, really, all of his prescriptions. Just as we said in our poster, send us copies of your prescription drug bills, I think a lot of the seniors are doing it in a pretty detailed fashion. This is just an example of what I received from one older person in the Willamette Valley. She reports, on a very modest income, she is spending $236 a month on her prescription drugs. As she reports, that is without the over-the-counter medication she also has to take. She is 78 years old. She is concerned about whether or not the Senate is going to act. She is pretty skeptical, just the way a lot of other seniors are in our country. What we need to show is this Senate is willing to tackle these issues and do it on a bipartisan basis.  The time for finger pointing and scapegoating on this issue is over. We cannot wait for another year, another full year, for action on this matter. We ought to move now. There is one bipartisan bill before the Senate, one which I believe can bring Democrats and Republicans together. I am going to keep coming back to the floor of the Senate to talk about the SPICE Program, theSenior Prescription Insurance Coverage Equity Act. It is voluntary in nature. Nobody is required to change anything. No senior, no family, would be required to change anything in their buying practices should they choose to continue doing exactly what they are doing. But for millions of older people, the SPICE Program, the Senior Prescription Insurance Coverage Equity Act, will be a bargain. It will be a winner because it will give seniors the kind of bargaining power the big health maintenance organizations have had.  It is not right, in my view, to give those buyers significant power in the marketplace and just say seniors and families do not matter. In effect, that is what we are doing. We are telling them: You go on out and do your best, walk into a pharmacy, and even though you are subsidizing the big buyers, this Senate will not do anything about it.  I believe it is time for bipartisan action on this. I believe it is time to create an approach to cover prescription drugs under Medicare that uses the forces of the marketplace, that is bipartisan, and that helps hold costs down. I believe a lot of seniors cannot afford their prescriptions. There is a right way and a wrong way to deal with it. The bipartisan Snowe-Wyden legislation is what we think is the appropriate way to go. We are going to continue to come to this floor and talk about the need for action on it.  As this poster says, what will help is if seniors send in copies of their prescription drug bills. We urge seniors to send them to us and send them to their Senator here in the U.S. Senate, Washington, DC 20510, because that will help Members of the Senate to see how urgent is this need.  The need was great years ago, but it is getting even greater. Too many older people every week are having to make a choice between their food costs and their fuel costs and their fuel costs and their medical bills. Let us show we can deliver on this important issue. There is a bipartisan bill now before the Senate. We hope seniors, as this poster says, will be in touch with us to let us know their feelings on this important matter.  I intend to keep coming back to the floor of the Senate until we get action on this issue.  I yield the floor.  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Sessions). The majority leader.                          ____________________
