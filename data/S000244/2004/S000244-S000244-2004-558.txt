Speaker, on behalf of Representative John Conyers and myself, I wish to extend our thanks and gratitude to Ann Jemison, who is retiring this week after almost 30 years of service to the House of Representatives. We also wish to extend our very best wishes to Ann, on her upcoming wedding on September 25, 2004.  Ann hails from the Land of Lincoln and began her career on the Hill as an Assistant Manager and then Manager in the House Restaurant System from 1975 through 1994. She moved into the position of Staff Assistant/Receptionist, first, for the Committee on Public Works and Transportation in 1994, and then with the Committee on the Judiciary Committee in 1995.  Ann is the first smiling face you see when you enter the Committee's front door and the friendly and knowledgeable voice you hear when you call our office.  Mr. Speaker, Ann has served the House Judiciary Committee, the Congress and the American people over all these years with commitment, dedication and integrity. We thank her and want her to know that she will be missed.                          ____________________
