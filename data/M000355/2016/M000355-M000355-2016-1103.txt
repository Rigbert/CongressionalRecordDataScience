 President, I would like to say a word to Senators about our colleague currently in the chair. He has just passed an important milestone. He has now presided over the Senate for 100 hours. We all know what that means. He will be receiving the Golden Gavel, and I look forward to presenting it to him tomorrow.  Presiding over the Senate may not seem the most glamorous job around here to some people, but it is an important one. You learn a lot about procedure, you learn a lot about your colleagues, and because the use of electronic devices is prohibited, you rediscover the lost art of communicating with a pen and a piece of paper. I think we could all stand to benefit from that kind of practice.  Today's Golden Gavel recipient often dashes off notes for pages to bring to his staff while in the chair, and because today's Golden Gavel recipient is a doctor, it also takes his staff about 3 hours to decipher each of the notes he writes.  Here is the bottom line for our friend from Louisiana. Being in the chair reminds him of all the history in this Chamber. It brings to mind the many important decisions that have been made here over the years, and it gives him perspective.  ``Every now and then,'' Senator Cassidy says, he likes to just ``soak up the moment.'' I hope he will take the opportunity to do so now. He is the first Member of the class of 2014 to earn the Golden Gavel distinction, and all of our colleagues are pleased to acknowledge this accomplishment.                          ____________________
