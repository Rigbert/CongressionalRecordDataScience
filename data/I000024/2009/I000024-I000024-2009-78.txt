I am very upset that we have a lot of things in here I didn't want--the unemployment insurance loans, the Federal Housing Administration loan limit increase. That should not be there. The amendments failed. I wish they had passed. I voted for them.  The thing that bothers me more than anything else is the House put us in this position. They said: Here is the bill; you do it; we are leaving town. That is exactly what happened.  So this is the final vote. We have to have 60 votes. For all practical purposes, this is the final vote. I urge my Republican friends to support waiver of the point of order.
