This is a moving target. The fact is that there is a gap in coverage for prescription drugs built into this proposal so that the sickest seniors with the highest prescription drug costs will find some coverage on the front end of the year for their illness and then find themselves paying out of pocket $2,850, if I am not mistaken, before they get more coverage from the prescription drug benefit. So this so-called donut hole is one that I think seniors who are really sick and those who need expensive drugs should be aware of.  The bill we offered said Medicare will come in and compete for lower drug costs and the savings we can gather for lower drug costs will close this donut hole.
