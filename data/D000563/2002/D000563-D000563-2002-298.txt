President, one of the issues that continues to haunt Americans is the whole question of the cost of prescription drugs. I have been troubled, as I have traveled across my State of Illinois, at the number of people I have met who are facing serious hardship trying to pay for their drugs.  There was a hearing in the city of Chicago where a lady came forward to tell a sad story of how once she had received her prescription drugs from her doctor, she realized the cost of the drugs were so much that on her fixed income under Social Security she could not take it. This lady was facing a particular hardship because she had received an organ transplant. If she failed to take the antirejection drugs, she stood the chance of dying or having even a worse medical condition.  Mr. President, do you know how she answered that particular dilemma? She moved into the basement of her children's home. She is living in the basement of her children's home so she does not have to pay for rent or utilities so she can have enough money to pay for the drugs to keep that new organ in her body that keeps her alive.  That is a tale of desperation which unfortunately highlights the challenge facing Congress as we need to find a way to make prescription drugs not only accessible but affordable.  There are many projected ideas out there and some of them are valuable and worth pursuing and some of them are certainly not. We have to keep in mind it is not just accessibility to the drugs, but it is also the price of the drugs, to say to someone, you have a right to buy the drugs, and we will help you up to a certain extent, may be of little or no value if the price of the drugs is so high the person cannot afford it. That, unfortunately, is a reality.  Last year the cost of prescription drugs across America went up 16 percent.  Mr. President, try to imagine a program or even something in your home budget that you could deal with honestly with an annual increase in cost of 16 percent. So what we have tried to do on the Democratic side, as we address prescription drugs, is to go to the heart of the issue, to talk about the affordability of drugs, and to make certain the way we pay for these drugs is not at the expense of the people across America who need a helping hand.  Senator Debbie Stabenow of Michigan has been a leader on this issue. She held a press conference I attended last week and talked about a prescription drug approach which needs to be thoroughly considered. Right now across America pharmaceutical companies are buying ads on television, in magazines, and in newspapers talking about the importance of research for new drugs. Believe me, there is not a person in the Senate who does not agree with that.  We also know that many of these pharmaceutical companies are spending extraordinary amounts of money, in excess of their research budgets, for advertising. We see it every time we turn on the television, every time we open a magazine or a newspaper--full-page ads for new drugs. They show people dancing through a field of wildflowers and not sneezing, saying: Go to the doctor and ask for Claritin, or Clarinex, or Clarinet, or whatever happens to be the latest from Schering-Plough. When it comes to drugs such as Vioxx from Merck and other drugs, constantly we are bombarded with this information.  What Senator Stabenow has found is that pharmaceutical companies across America are spending two to three times as much on advertising as they are on research to find new drugs. Why should they be given a tax deduction for promotion, marketing, and advertising in excess of what they are spending for research? I do not think they should.  Frankly, I think we ought to call their bluff. If they tell us they need money for research, then for goodness' sake, put in it research. Give us the new drugs. Make the profits by giving us these kinds of blockbuster revelations of new drugs that can change our lives. But do not focus the money on advertising, promotion, and marketing when, frankly, all it does is create false need and false demand.  So as we consider the prescription drug challenge that faces us, let's be honest about the program we put together, that it is accessible and affordable, and let us also be honest about the source of the money. On the House side of the Rotunda, the Republicans have proposed a prescription drug bill which is paid for by taking money from hospitals under Medicare and doctors across America. That is not the appropriate way to deal with it. We have to deal with it in an honest fashion so that the people of America are not shortchanged in terms of their health care.  I yield the floor.                          ____________________
