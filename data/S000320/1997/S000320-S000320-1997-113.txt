 Nickles, and Mrs. Hutchison):  S. 953. A bill to require certain Federal agencies to protect the right of private property owners, and for other purposes; to the Committee on Governmental Affairs.              THE PRIVATE PROPERTY OWNERS' BILL OF RIGHTS  Mr SHELBY. Mr. President, today I rise to introduce legislation that reaffirms one of the basic principles that formed our Nation--protection of private property rights. The Private Property Owners' Bill of Rights is intended to reaffirm this constitutional right.  The right to private property is an essential freedom. While the fifth amendment to the Constitution recognizes that the Federal Government may take property for public use; it explicitly mandates that Government must compensate the private property owner. In recent years, this fundamental right has been blatantly ignored in the name of habitat and species preservation.  Since the inception of our Nation, ownership of private property has been a cornerstone of economic liberty and prosperity. The current Federal regulatory polices are an ominous cloud hanging over every landowner from the established developer to the hardworking generational farmer.  Myriad new environmental regulations stemming from the Endangered Species Act and the wetlands statues of section 404 of the Clean Water Act have rendered countless acres of private land useless. Thus leaving property owners deprived of the ability to farm, develop, or even repair existing structures on their own land. This bill does not challenge the integrity of the Endangered Species Act or the wetlands statutes; it simply attempts to shift the burden of enforcing these laws from the individual back to the Government. For too long, the policies of the Fish and Wildlife Service, the Army Corps of Engineers, or the Environmental Protection Agency, with respect to these statutes, have gone unchecked.  Property owners should not be singled out to bear the costs of public policies. If our Government determines that a certain parcel of land should be conserved or a species protected, it should purchase the land at a fair and just price. Current regulations punish individuals that happen to own land that the Government wants to manage without purchasing. Enforcement of land use statutes can range from exorbitant fines to the inability to use one's own land or even to time in prison. Currently, expensive and lengthy mitigation is the only recourse available to contest the Government's actions. Simply put, this is an intolerable situation.  Continuing the punitive approach to conservation will only serve to alienate those that are in the best position to assist with the efforts. It is estimated that three-fourths of these lands that meet the Federal Government's definition of a wetland through section 404 of the Clean Water Act, are privately owned. It is time to change the bureaucratic viewpoint that protecting a private property owners' constitutionally guaranteed rights comes at the cost of protecting the environment. Contrary to the Government's actions, both are intrinsically linked.  Throughout my tenure, I have heard countless stories of landowners being denied the right to use their own land--the very property that they purchased or inherited, cared for, developed and pay taxes on--because the Government determines there is a need to preserve the property for a wetland or species. These citizens find themselves in a regulatory nightmare--unable to live off the land yet unable to sell it to the Government, or anyone for that matter, for full market value. Only on paper is the land truly theirs.  For example, a farmer in Missouri was accused of destroying wetlands simply for moving dirt while repairing a broken levee on his family's property. In another disturbing instance, Texan Marge Rector spent $830,000 to purchase 15 acres of land for her retirement. Soon after, it was determined that her land was a potential habitat for the black-capped vireo and the golden-cheeked warbler. Within 5 years, her land was determined to be worth approximately $30,000. Her retirement dream turned into a nightmare.  Unfortunately these are not isolated cases, there are hundreds of individuals in similar predicaments across our country. This issue is not limited by geographical boundaries, socio-economic status or occupation. Any individual that owns land is subject to unexpected, unpredictable environmental regulation that--at the very least--will rob a person of the economic value of their land or, worse, force a landowner into prison for rightfully using their land.  Mr. President, the time has arrived to realistically address the matter at hand by creating a clearly defined policy for Federal agencies to follow. Abusing the rights of private property owners in the name of the environment must end. Congress needs to act before the economic future of more citizens is put at risk.  Therefore, I am pleased to reintroduce the Private Property Owners' Bill of Rights with my colleagues, Senators Nickles and Hutchison. This bill would reaffirm the Federal Government's constitutional responsibility to protect private property by requiring the Federal Government and its agents, to include private property owners in any process or action to take private land.  The Private Property Owners' Bill of Rights requires a Federal agency and its representative to give notice and gain consent from property owners prior to entering a property owner's land for the purpose of gathering information to enforce the Endangered Species Act or any wetlands statute. Private property owners also would be guaranteed the right to complete access to that information and the right to debate its accuracy prior to the Government's use of it.  Additionally, this legislation requires Federal Government agencies to create an administrative appeals process for owners of property adversely affected by environmental regulations. The Endangered Species Act will be amended to require that private property owners are notified and included in any management agreement that would affect their land. These provisions will assure that the landowner's voice is heard.  Most importantly, the private property owners' bill of rights guarantees compensation for landowners whose property is devalued by $10,000 or 20 percent of its fair market value by Federal action. Uniform guidelines would be created that all Federal agencies and landowners would follow when developing a compensation agreement. If disagreements arise between the parties, they may request arbitration. Inno manner does this option limit the availability of alternative legal measures. These are reasonable protections to ensure that landowners' rights, guaranteed under the Constitution, are not violated and that Government affirmatively meets its constitutional obligation to protect private property.  Our Nation is built on the principles of individual freedoms and rights. It is time that the Federal Government abide by the laws of our land and stop the practice of regulating private property without the benefit of compensation. These abuses must end. I urge my colleagues to join me in support of this effort.  I ask unanimous consent that the Private Property Owners' Bill of Rights Act of 1997 be printed in the Record.  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the Record, as follows:                                 S. 953       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of      the United States of America in Congress assembled,     SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.       This Act may be cited as the ``Private Property Owners'      Bill of Rights''.     SEC. 2. FINDINGS AND PURPOSE.       (a) Findings.--Congress finds the following:       (1) Our democracy was founded on principles of ownership,      use, and control of private property. These principles are      embodied in the fifth amendment to the Constitution, which      prohibits the taking of private property without the payment      of just compensation.       (2) A number of Federal environmental programs,      specifically the Endangered Species Act of 1973 (16 U.S.C.      1531 et seq.) and section 404 of the Federal Water Pollution      Control Act (33 U.S.C. 1344), have been implemented by      employees, agents, and representatives of the Federal      Government in a manner that deprives private property owners      of the use and control of their property.       (3) As new Federal programs are proposed that would limit      and restrict the use of private property to provide habitat      for plant and animal species, the rights of private property      owners must be recognized and respected.       (4) Private property owners are being forced by Federal      policy to resort to extensive, lengthy, and expensive      litigation to protect certain basic civil rights guaranteed      by the Constitution.       (5) Since many private property owners do not have the      financial resources or the extensive commitment of time to      proceed in litigation against the Federal Government, a clear      Federal policy is needed to guide and direct Federal agencies      with respect to the implementation by the agencies of      environmental laws that directly impact private property.       (6) While all private property owners should and must abide      by nuisance laws and should not use their property in a      manner that harms their neighbors, these laws have      traditionally been enacted, implemented, and enforced at the      State and local levels where the laws are best able to      protect the rights of all private property owners and local      citizens.       (7) While traditional pollution control laws are intended      to protect the health and physical welfare of the general      public, habitat protection programs in effect on the date of      enactment of this Act are intended to protect the welfare of      plant and animal species, while allowing recreational and      aesthetic opportunities for the public.       (b) Purpose.--The purpose of this Act is to provide a      consistent Federal policy to--       (1) encourage, support, and promote the private ownership      of property; and       (2) ensure that the constitutional and legal rights of      private property owners are protected by the Federal      Government and employees, agents, and representatives of the      Federal Government.

(b) Deadline.--Not later than 90 days after receipt of a      final decision of an agency head that deprives a private      property owner of the fair market value or viable use of      property for which compensation is required under subsection      (a), the private property owner may submit in writing a      request to the agency head for compensation in accordance      with subsection (c).

The      arbitration shall be conducted in accordance with the real      estate valuation arbitration rules of the association. For      the purposes of this section, an arbitration shall be binding      on the agency head and a private property owner as to the      amount, if any, of compensation owed to the private property      owner and whether for the purposes of this section the      private property owner has been deprived of the fair market      value or viable use of property for which compensation is      required under subsection (a).       (e) Judgment.--A qualified agency action of an agency head      that deprives a private property owner of property as      described in subsection (a), shall be deemed, at the option      of the private property owner, to be a taking under the      Constitution and a judgment against the United States if the      private property owner--       (1) accepts an offer of the agency head under subsection      (c); or       (2) submits to arbitration under subsection (d).       (f) Payment.--An agency head shall pay a private property      owner any compensation required under the terms of an offer      of the agency head that is accepted by the private property      owner in accordance with subsection (d), or under a decision      of an arbitrator under that subsection, by not later than 60      days after the date of the acceptance or the date of the      issuance of the decision, respectively.       (g) Form of Payment.--Payment under this section shall be      in a form agreed to by the agency head and the private      property owner and may be in the form of--       (1) payment of an amount that is equal to the fair market      value of the property on the day before the date of the final      qualified agency action with respect to which the property or      interest is acquired;       (2) payment of an amount that is equal to the reduction in      value of the property; or       (3) conveyance of real property or an interest in real      property that has a fair market value equal to the amount      referred to in paragraph (1) or (2).       (h) Other Rights Preserved.--This section shall not      preempt, alter, or limit the availability of any remedy for      the taking of property or an interest in property that is      available under the Constitution or any other law.       (i) Final Judgments.--If a private property owner      unsuccessfully seeks compensation under this section and      thereafter files a claim for compensation under the fifth      amendment to the Constitution and is successful in obtaining      a final judgment ordering compensation from the United States      Court of Federal Claims for the claim, the agency head who      made the final agency decision that results in the taking      shall reimburse, from funds appropriated to the agency for      the 2 fiscal years following payment of the compensation, the      Treasury of the United States for amounts appropriated under      section 1304 of title 31, United States Code, to pay the      judgment against the United States.
