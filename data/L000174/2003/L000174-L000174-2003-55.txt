I know the senior Senator from Nevada to be one who cares deeply about this institution and the way it works. He has been speaking at great length and on matters of great interest to all of us today.  I ask my distinguished friend from Nevada, is it not true the senior Senator from Nevada, like the senior Senator from Vermont and the senior Senator from Michigan who is on the floor, would have been very pleased if we had been doing the appropriations bills that by law we should have finished on September 30 rather than having to try to figure out the schedule the other side has put us in, a schedule that accomplishes, in this Senator's mind, absolutely nothing?
