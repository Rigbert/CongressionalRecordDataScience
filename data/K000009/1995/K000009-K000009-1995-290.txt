Speaker, I listened with great interest to my colleagues on the importance of keeping our national accounts in order. I have come to this well over the last decade of my service in the Congress echoing those very [[Page H384]] same concerns, especially as it relates to our people's ability to earn decent incomes in America and to benefit their families through their hard work as well as through gain-sharing in the workplace, where people in our country work very hard, they should gain from the productivity that they have been a part of increasing, and, therefore, I am a great supporter of all types of programs, for employee stock ownership, for worker gain-sharing so that people in our country can become self-sufficient. For too long Washington has turned a cold ear to so much of what has been happening across our country in the streets and blocks of our neighborhoods.  This evening I come to the floor to talk about the connection between people's jobs and their incomes and our foreign trade policy, because one of the biggest budget-busting items that is likely to come before us next week has to do with the bailout of Mexico that will be put on the backs of our taxpayers, and of all things they want to put it off-budget, which means that as we consider this vote next week, and as I understand it, no hearings are going to be held in the House of Representatives on this issue. This bill is going to be moved only through the Committee on Rules at the will of the Speaker and will be brought here to the floor without any of the hearings that are normal procedure for a measure of this magnitude which already has cost our people over $18 billion--that's with a B--in lines of credit extended to Mexico, largely to hold up, to prop up the speculators on Wall Street who wanted to make big money in Mexico but now are not willing to eat their own losses, and we are told a bill is going to come here next week ringing in somewhere over 40 billion additional dollars, pledging the full faith and credit of the taxpayers of this country. Yet we cannot even have hearings in the subcommittees and full committees of jurisdiction in this Congress.  What is wrong? What are people afraid of? How can we even think about having a debate on a balanced budget amendment when we can exempt major expenditures such as the bailout of the Mexican peso and the Wall Street speculators who now want to reach into the pocketbooks of our people?  I want to put on the Record tonight that for 1994, last year, the latest bad news unfortunately has come in on our Nation's continuing trade hemorrhage with the world. This means we are still sucking in billions of dollars of imports more than we are exporting goods abroad. In fact, the 1994 ledger is dripping with even more red ink and more good jobs lost in our country.  In fact, just in the month of November, America had a trade deficit of 10.5 billion additional dollars--that means more imports coming in here than our exports going out--and just in that month alone, over 200,000 more jobs lost in America.  For those who listened to my remarks yesterday, yesterday morning, 7:30 in the morning, in Medina, NY, Fisher-Price/Mattel Co. gave the pink slip to 700 more workers in our country who were told, ``It's time to go home. Your jobs are moving to Mexico.''                              {time}  1700  Fisher-Price/Mattel does not make one Barbie doll in the United States. Yet they have millions and millions and millions of dollars of sales in our marketplace, and their product is not cheap, $29 to $200 for one of those little dolls. Each little girl in American owns between 8 and 12 of those today. They basically have shut down their production in this country.  The trade deficit is related to your job, my friends, because if you do not have production located in your community and you have essentially out-sourced the real productive wealth of your community, you will have lower-wage jobs, you will have jobs without benefits, you will have part-time work, you will be downsized, you will be out-sourced. Until you understand the connection between international trade, your job and your pocketbook, 1994 will be known as the year in which the United States suffered the worst trade deficit in history. And for every billion dollars of trade deficit we lose an additional 20,000 jobs in this country. So that means for 1994 over 3 million more good jobs slowly disappeared.  Probably, unless you live in these communities, you do not even know it happened. It is like death by pin pricks as companies shut their doors, like Mattel did yesterday in New York, and the list goes on and on and on.  Nineteen ninety-four will be remembered as the year that NAFTA was implemented, and that trade agreement really kicked in and continued to put the tourniquet around the workers of the United States. It was the year GATT was signed and we will continue to lose more jobs. And the year that we ran up over $155 billion more in trade deficits, more imports coming in here than exports going out.  It is hard to find anything made in America. In fact today I had a rather humorous experience if you want to think about it. People here in Washington are running around with little pins on that say Contract With America. But look at the button, it was made in Taiwan. I just shook my head. We do not even make buttons in this country anymore.  Over 3 million Americans could have been more productive in our country last year if the trade deficit had not been so bad. And, you know, the amazing thing about it, prices are not going down in our country; profits are going up, prices are going up. The only thing that is coming down is workers' wages and their buying power.  Something pretty fundamental is happening to the economic wealth, productive wealth of this country, and Washington better understand it, because it is at the nub of the unrest across our country.  The latest trade data that has come in has special significance as Congress considers a bailout of the Mexican peso. And it is really a bailout of the Wall Street speculators because our former trade advantage with Mexico, which is what they said we had to pass NAFTA for, because America would continue to make money off of that deal, as that trade deficit got worse last year, guess which country we began moving into the red side of the ledger with? Our third largest trading partner, Mexico.  In the month of October, for the first time in a generation, America accumulated a negative trade debt with Mexico. And in November the red ink quadrupled to over $370 million in the red, just in November.  America's trade advantage, my friends, with Mexico, has now disappeared. The advantage has disappeared in less than a year, and now Mexico has its hand out to us to prop up that country's debts that are owed to our Wall Street investors.  When the peso fell 40 percent in December in value, the United States is going to see a continued slide into red ink with Mexico as their exports and the prices of those exports become more attractive in our market and our goods down there become too expensive for them to purchase. Mark my words, the slide is slickening every single month.  Let me now tell you more about the biggest budget buster that this Congress is going to be asked to vote on next week, with no hearings in the committees of this Congress, which essentially means you as a people cannot know. And it is going to hit our taxpayers very, very hard, in the wallet, with the jobs that they will lose to a much cheaper wage environment. You are going to pay in higher interest rates; you are already paying in higher interest rates because the market has discounted those losses. And you are going to pay in continuing obligations in increasing long-term debt that you will have to pay, because in effect what they are asking is for our people to become Mexico's insurance company, for the North American Free-Trade Agreement, NAFTA, sure is not free. We have lost a company a day to that nation since the agreement went into effect.  Most Americans did not realize that, when NAFTA passed, at its heart was an investment guarantee to the Wall Street speculators, the multinational corporations, and the megabanks that in fact you as taxpayers now have to back up.  If the gamblers went belly up in Mexico, the United States essentially had pledged your full faith and credit, and now the bills are coming due. Fifty-eight billion dollars for beginners.  In fact U.S. taxpayers are now going to pay dearly and not just in more lost jobs. That is bad enough. But without a [[Page H385]] vote of Congress, last week our U.S. Treasury and Federal Reserve opened our lines of credit to Mexico to the tune of $18 billion, your tax dollars, your deposits in the institutions of this country already sent to prop up the paper investments that the gamblers on Wall Street love to play with. And as far as the Government of Mexico is concerned, what this really amounts to is a new backdoor multibillion-dollar version of foreign aid, but they do not want to call it that, they do not really want you to see it as that, so they are using all kinds of fancy names, figuring most people have not gone to business school, most people do not have a degree in finance. So the $18 billion they extended they did not call what it really is, they called it a line of credit, they called it a swap.  Now they are coming up here next week with a bill they are going to call a guarantee, and backing up the guarantee will be fees. There will be a commitment fee, a basic fee, a supplemental fee. There are so many different fees, but essentially all it is putting debt on top of more debt on top of more debt on top of more debt with higher interest rates, and more debt with higher interest rates that you back up with your tax dollars.  No matter what you call it, you essentially are Mexico's insurance company. But ask yourself what is the collateral? What are your chances of getting your money back?  Last week the Clinton administration and the Federal Reserve started bailing out Mexico with that $18 billion of our currency through the U.S. Treasury, our Federal Reserve. It took no vote of Congress to do that, they do not have to come here for 6 months under the current law. Now the administration is asking us to guarantee this additional $40 billion in loans and there will be no hearings here in the Congress. Believe me, it is a bottomless pit.  The troubling fact about these speculators from Wall Street is they are the very same people who gave us junk bonds back in the 1980's, the very same people who put all of these leveraged buyouts together, who threw white collar workers, blue collar workers, pink collar workers out of work across America because these very same people were so greedy that they cashed out corporations, they bought companies, they dried up their pension funds, they diversified those holdings, they essentially bled out the wealth of this country, they put it in different nations around the world where there is no cheap labor and no democracy. And notice now they are sending those goods back here, and now they are trying to do the same thing as a result of this Mexican deal.  The troubling fact about being this kind of a banker, and I even hate to call it a banker, it is really a speculator form Wall Street, is that they can create money; I wish each of us could, even when there is no collateral to back it up. They have got powerful friends. Let me tell you, my friends, they have powerful friends in the Clinton administration, and they have very powerful friends inside this institution. They like to talk about free enterprise, and being beholden to the rules of the private sector.                              {time}  1710  But basically they are now coming and running to the Government because they are about to lose a big chunk of money. So when they have gotten in trouble, they have not followed the rules of the marketplace which is when you take a risk to that extent and you lose, you are big enough to eat the losses yourself and not come running to the taxpayers of our country.  The Clinton administration is doing this along with the top leadership of this institution and taking this unprecedented action and doing it very quickly so that you do not really understand it, so you cannot complain and really have input through your elected Representatives here because the value of Mexico's currency has fallen by so much.  Basically Mexico cannot pay its bills. It never has, and with the peso meltdown, keep this in mind, if you think about what is the collateral, its workers' wages have also been cut by 40 percent; the value of its people's savings accounts have been cut by 40 percent. Do you think they will be able to pay back what they owe us on top of all of the old debt that they still owe us?  And I see our colleague from Vermont has joined us, the gentleman from Vermont [Mr. Sanders], and we are so happy to have him here this afternoon without question, and I know he has traveled the world, as I have; the pain of our people who have lost their jobs, the pain of our families who are worried about affording their mortgages and affording sending their children on to college, when they need help, they do not have the Secretary of the Treasury running around the corridors up here. They do not have the Speaker of the House running around the corridors for them. They do not have the Chairman of the Federal Reserve running around the corridors up here. They do not even return phone calls.  But for this particular deal where their friends, and I underline friends, on Wall Street stand to lose $40 billion and should eat their own losses, believe me, they have worn out the carpets of reception up here. We may have to have a little congressional expenditure to replace the mats that have been worn out over the last 2 weeks as these meetings have occurred behind closed doors.  Why should the Mexican people and the people of our country have to pay for the mistakes made by the Wall Street kingfishers and their friends around the world? Why?  I yield to the gentleman, and I am so happy to see him here tonight.
