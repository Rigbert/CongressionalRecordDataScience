He and I share the view that the pension bill is a very important bill for employees and for employers. I know the gentleman has been working hard on it.  But in light of the fact you did bring it up, last week we talked about the inclusion of both parties in the deliberations. After our conversation, I had the opportunity to check with Mr. Rangel, and I don't think he has been included. I do believe that Senator Kennedy and Senator Baucus have been included, and there was a lot of discussion, but I will tell my friend that the information I have, which may be incorrect, is that at least in terms of this House, the ranking member has not been included in the deliberations. I think that would really be helpful when it comes back out so that our Members would be able to have the information from our ranking member as to his insights into what has been done, and I would hope that could occur.                          ____________________
