I don't know if we can be in contact with her this evening, but I would ask the Senator from Louisiana if he would consider allowing us to go forward with this unanimous consent request and hope we can still modify it tomorrow, if there is an agreement with Senator Mikulski at that point. I don't think that jeopardizes the right of the Senator from Louisiana to offer this at a later time during the course of this debate.  Based on that, I would continue to object.
