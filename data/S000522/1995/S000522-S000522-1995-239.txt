Mr. Speaker, thank you for this opportunity to speak out for religious freedom.  The worldwide religion known as the Baha'i Faith is one of the most peace-loving groups in the world--and yet one of the most consistently persecuted.  The Baha'i Faith began in Persia in the 1840's, and spread rapidly through the Mideast, where Islam has historically been dominant. Though the Baha'i Faith now has adherents all around the world, including all 50 States of the United States, its historic links to the Mideast have helped bring it repeatedly into conflict with Islam.  Islam, like most other world religions, teaches certain truths that its adherents take to be absolute. Baha'is take a different approach, seeing all religions as successive revelations, each with a partial truth.  These questions are faced, one way or another, by all men and women of conscience. And it is inevitable that many of us will come out differently on these questions. In decent societies--in free societies--we respect each other's freedom of conscience. If we seek to persuade one another, we do it in friendship, and with respect.  But in some parts of the world, force is still used to settle religious issues. In Iran, with its extremist regime, the fact that the Baha'is question Islam's claim to represent God's full and final revelation makes them a target of unceasing persecution. The fact that the Baha'i Faith arose on territory in which Islam has been dominant for some 1,400 years, and among ethnic groups with a long Islamic heritage, seems to be an unbearable irritant to the Iranian regime. They view the Baha'is as worse than mere adherents of another religion--which, in their eyes, is quite bad enough. They view them as something worse: as heretics, as conscious destroyers of Islam.  For those of us who have met Baha'i believers--even those of us who come from a religious perspective quite different from theirs--the notion that they would be destroyers of anything is simply absurd.  Yet Baha'is in Iran have no legal rights, despite being the largest religious minority in that country. More than 200 Iranian Baha'is, including women and teenage girls, have been executed for their faith since 1979. Thousands have faced torture and imprisonment for refusing to convert to Islam. Tens of thousands have lost their jobs, and been forced to repay past salaries or pensions. All Baha'i students were expelled from Iranian universities by 1982.  President Clinton has placed Iran's treatment of its Baha'i minority on a par with ethnic cleansing in the former Yugoslavia. Given the professed intention of the Iranian regime to block the progress and development of the Baha'i Faith. I would have to agree with the President on this.  I salute my colleagues for sponsoring this exhibition on the persecution of the Baha'i Faith community. I hope it will inspire all who see it to stand up for religious freedom.  Thank you very much.                            ____________________
