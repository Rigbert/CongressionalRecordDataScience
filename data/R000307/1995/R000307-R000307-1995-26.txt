 I rise in strong opposition to the gentleman's amendment. The amendment, while I am sure really redirects funds into an important program, and the gentleman and I have discussed this at length, for example, the cuts in the water and sewer programs which we all hope can be restructured, and we all hope that we can find additional funds for these very important programs, but the gentleman's amendment also restructures, or throws a monkey wrench is a better word, into an important reform of the crop insurance and disaster program that was just implemented by the Committee on Agriculture just this past year.  This major new reform that was designed to save the taxpayers billions of dollars and move our farmers away from dependence on the Government disaster programs really has not had a chance to work, and already the gentleman has simply brought an amendment that has not been considered by the authorizing committee. We have had no hearings, and it would fundamentally change the protections designed for the livestock industry.  We left the livestock disaster program in place because there was no other way to cover them. As I have indicated, it is entirely possible that some changes in the newly reformed crop insurance disaster protection program will be needed. As a matter of fact, we are going to have a major overhaul of the crop insurance program. It is underfunded, and it is mandatory, and we have several proposals that I think would be very, very salutory.  But these proposed changes should receive the same careful consideration as the original reform provisions. For example, this amendment does not make it clear how we are to treat a livestock producer who grows 25 percent of his feed and then purchases the rest. Is this producer to lose all of his disaster protection because he is prudent enough to provide a fraction of his own feed?                              {time}  0030  Mr. Chairman, these are exactly the kind of problems that caused us, after long thought, to design the program in its present state. Certainly a more careful consideration should be given before the program is changed or simply used for a bank for vitally needed sewer and water programs. We should reject this amendment.  I would only add that this amendment also abridges the agreement that the authorizers and the appropriators have reached, at least on our side of the aisle, after many, many meetings, and the $60 million that would be used by the gentleman would be into a situation where we would either double-score it and it would not count in regards to our scoring responsibilities or the Ag Committee is going to have to go find another $60 million to cut in regards to our budget responsibilities.  We have an agreement with the gentleman from New Mexico [Mr. Skeen] and the chairman of the committee, and the chairman of the Committee on the Budget that the appropriators will make the appropriate cuts in regards to their budget responsibilities and the authorizers in our pasture will make our cuts.  I know the gentleman is extremely concerned about the water and sewer programs. This is the wrong way to go about it. I will be more than happy to work with the gentleman to find some money in the appropriate discretionary account.  And one last thing: In the last several weeks we have had a real disaster in farm country more especially with our cowboys in reference to the terrible weather, 100 degrees, 105 degrees, 110 degrees. In feedlots all across the country and on ranches all across the country we have had heavy livestock losses, and all prices in the livestock sector are very depressed. This is exactly the wrong time to take the emergency program for livestock producers that we hope we will not use during a time when they are experiencing very heavy losses due to weather-induced conditions.  So, Mr. Chairman, I would urge the gentleman to perhaps work with us, perhaps maybe withdraw his amendment, but if he insists on going on ahead, we will have to oppose it very, very strongly.
