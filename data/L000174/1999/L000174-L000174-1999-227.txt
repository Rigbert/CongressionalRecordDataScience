President, so far, we have had one meeting of a conference to resolve differences in the Senate and House passed juvenile justice bills. I commented at that conference meeting, on August 5, 1999, about how unfortunate it was that the leadership in the Congress delayed action on the conference all summer. In fact, the conference met less than 24 hours before the Congress adjourned for its long August recess.  Unfortunately, we did not conclude our work but left this conference and important work on the juvenile justice legislation to languish for the last five weeks of the summer.  Due to the delays in convening this conference and then its abrupt adjournment before completing its work, we knew before our August recess that the programs to enhance school safety and protect our children and families called for in this legislation would not be in place before school began.  The fact that American children are starting school without Congress finishing its work on this legislation is wrong.  We had to overcome technical obstacles and threatened filibusters to begin the juvenile justice conference. It is no secret that there are those in both bodies who would prefer no action and no conference to moving forward on the issues of juvenile violence and crime. Now that we have convened this conference, we should waste no more time to get down to business and finish our work promptly.  We have seen the kind of swift conference action the Congress is capable of doing with the Y2K law that provides special legal protections to businesses. That Y2K bill was passed by the Senate almost a month after the Hatch-Leahy juvenile justice bill, on June 16th, but was sent to conference, worked out, and sent to the President's desk within two short weeks. That bill is already law. The example set by the Y2K legislation shows that if we have the will, there is a way to get legislation done and done quickly.  Those of us serving on the conference and many who are not on the conference have worked on versions of this legislation for several years now. We spent two weeks on the Senate floor in May considering almost 50 amendments to S. 254, the Senate juvenile justice bill, and making many improvements to the underlying bill. We worked hard in the Senate for a strong bipartisan juvenile justice bill, and we should take this opportunity to cut through our remaining partisan differences to make a difference in the lives of our children and families.  I appreciate that one of the most contentious issues in this conference is guns, even though sensible gun control proposals are just a small part of the comprehensive legislation we are considering. The question that the majority in Congress must answer is what are they willing to do to protect children from gun violence?  A report released two months ago on juvenile violence by the Justice Department concludes that, ``data . . . indicate that guns play a major role in juvenile violence.'' We need to do more to keep guns out of the hands of children who do not know how to use them or plan to use them to hurt others.  Law enforcement officers in this country need help in keeping guns out of the hands of people who should not have them. I am not talking about people who use guns for hunting or for sport, but about criminals and unsupervised children. An editorial that appeared today in the Rutland Daily Herald summed up the dilemma in this juvenile justice conference for the majority:       Republicans in Congress have tried to follow the line of      the National Rifle Association. It will be interesting to see      if they can hold that line when the Nation's crime fighters      let them know that fighting crime also means fighting guns.  Every parent, teacher and student in this country was concerned this summer about school violence over the lasttwo years and worried about when the next shooting may occur. They only hope it does not happen at their school or involve their children. This an unacceptable and intolerable situation.  We all recognize that there is no single cause and no single legislative solution that will cure the ill of youth violence in our schools or in our streets. But we have an opportunity before us to do our part. We should seize this opportunity to act on balanced, effective juvenile justice legislation, and measures to keep guns out of the hands of children and away from criminals. I hope we get to work soon and finish what we started in the juvenile justice conference. We are already tardy.                          ____________________
