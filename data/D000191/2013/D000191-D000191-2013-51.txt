 The Acting CHAIR. The question is on the amendment offered by the gentleman from Montana (Mr. Daines).  The amendment was agreed to.                              {time}  1930               Amendment No. 3 Offered by Mr. McClintock  The Acting CHAIR. It is now in order to consider amendment No. 3 printed in part C of House Report 113-215.  Mr. McCLINTOCK. Mr. Chairman, I have an amendment at the desk.  The Acting CHAIR. The Clerk will designate the amendment.  The text of the amendment is as follows:       Page 23, line 10, add after the period the following new      sentence: ``In addition, if the primary purpose of a      hazardous fuel reduction project or a forest health project      under this title is the salvage of dead, damaged, or down      timber resulting from wildfire occurring in 2013, the      hazardous fuel reduction project or forest health project,      and any decision of the Secretary concerned in connection      with the project, shall not be subject to judicial review or      to any restraining order or injunction issued by a United      States court.''.  The Acting CHAIR. Pursuant to House Resolution 351, the gentleman from California (Mr. McClintock) and a Member opposed each will control 5 minutes.  The Chair recognizes the gentleman from California.  Mr. McCLINTOCK. Mr. Chairman, I yield myself such time as I may consume.  An estimated 1 billion board feet of fire-killed timber can still be salvaged out of the forests devastated by the Yosemite Rim fire, but it requires immediate action. As time passes, the value of this dead timber declines until after a year or so, when it becomes unsalvageable.  It has been the practice of radical environmental groups to file lawsuits against such projects, with the objective of delaying salvage until the timber is worthless. This amendment waives judicial review of the salvage plans for the 2013 fires. This is exactly the same approach taken in legislation offered by Tom Daschle a few years ago to allow salvage of beetle-killed timber in the Black Hills National Forest.  Salvaging this timber would throw an economic lifeline to communities already devastated by this fire, as local mills can be brought to full employment for the first time in many years. It would provide a new stream of revenue for the Federal Government as this salvageable timber is auctioned.
