Anyone who has had a crying baby knows what a pacifier is. You try to get the pacifier in the baby's mouth so they will calm down. They may still be hungry or crying for some other reason, but you try to quiet them down. That is what we are hearing in response.  When people say drill in Alaska or drill offshore, they want to quiet us down because when we look at the numbers, the numbers do not compute. If we are going to be honest about energy sources, there is a limit to how much we can drill in territory controlled by America. There is much more we have to do to lessen our dependence on foreign oil. We are talking about domestic sources--ethanol, biofuels, diesel. We are talking about renewable and sustainable sources of energy such as wind power and solar power that would not destroy the planet with global warming. That is the big challenge.  Sadly, for 7\1/2\ years, this administration has ignored it. Now we are in a terrible situation. I wish this President would show leadership and bring in the oil company executives, sit them down in the White House, and tell them they can't keep demanding these high profits at the expense of American families and businesses. Tell them to start drilling on lands they are currently leasing; try to challenge America to move forward in a fair way to have affordable energy.  I am glad the Senator from Maryland joined me in this conversation. I know she has an important agenda she will initiate now.  I yield the floor.
