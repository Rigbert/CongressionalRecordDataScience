Speaker, as President Bush has said, Tuesday's attack on the World Trade Center and the Pentagon are nothing short of acts of war. No less than the Japanese attack on Pearl Harbor, they were a premeditated, secret, and carefully orchestrated assault on the American people and the great symbols of American power and influence in world affairs. These attacks will not go unanswered.  Since this dastardly attack, there has been a flurry of efforts in the House and Senate, proposed legislation, calls for hearings and oversight to find out what went wrong and what improvements can and should be made. While this is certainly understandable, any action by the Congress should not be taken in haste and should be coordinated, not piecemeal.  The timing of our action is most important for another reason. In a time of war, the executive branch, and in particular the President, must be allowed to focus solely on identifying, finding, and punishing those responsible. I therefore call on my colleagues, Members and committee chairmen in both the House and the Senate, to refrain from piecemeal legislation and oversight during this crisis and to support the President fully in addressing the challenges ahead.  As chairman of the House Committee on the Judiciary and entrusted with oversight responsibility for all Federal law enforcement, I am compelled to remind my colleagues the criminal investigation now being conducted is paramount. From that investigation, we will learn much about the identity of the perpetrators, the means by which these attacks were carried out, and even the most effective way to respond. This is not the time, however, to assess blame, to second guess, or to appear to do so. It is time to back the President, period.  I have therefore written the President to ask him to identify what law enforcement and investigative resources, including additional funding and legal authority, are needed to prosecute this effort. I have pledged to review those requests on an expedited basis.  I am also concerned about the multiple and duplicative briefings requested of law enforcement, which may have the unintended consequences of impeding, impairing, or distracting law enforcement from its core mission. At the same time, I recognize that Congress needs to be kept informed on the progress of the investigation.  I suggest, therefore, that there be organized, coordinated, and non-duplicative briefings that will allow law enforcement to carry on its critical mandate without undue interference from Congress. I intend to work with the Speaker, the Attorney General, and the FBI Director to provide regular law enforcement briefings to Members on the investigation.  These briefings will provide Members with the information they need to carry out their constitutional responsibilities without jeopardizing the criminal investigation. The investigation may very well provide insight into how the attackers evaded our intelligence and security networks. There will certainly be ample time for Congress to address those issues later. I have been informed that we may be assured that the Federal Government's law enforcement and intelligence officials are already taking steps to prevent future attacks.  I intend to work with the gentleman from Illinois (Speaker Hastert) to discourage House committees from holding premature hearings in the middle of a Federal criminal investigation of these attacks. Such hearings are likely to distract Federal resources from the immediate needs of a full investigation.  Right now, it should be Congress' priority to support President Bush's efforts to make an appropriate response. Regular briefings and restraints will permit Congress to be fully informed about the developments, provide information for consideration at the appropriate time, but, most importantly, will allow the President the latitude he needs to prosecute the campaign against those who carried out these outrageous attacks on our country and its citizens.  This Congress must rise to the occasion and act responsibly and wisely. History will judge us favorably from our prudence.  Mr. Speaker, I insert in the Record a letter written by myself; Senator Leahy, the chairman of the Judiciary Committee; and the ranking members, the gentleman from Michigan (Mr. Conyers) and Senator Hatch, to the President of the United States.                                                U.S. Congress,                               Washington, DC, September 13, 2001.     Hon. George W. Bush,     President of the United States, The White House, Washington,          DC.       Dear Mr. President: We write regarding the investigation of      the horrific terrorist attacks that occurred on September 11,      2001. This tragedy has resulted in a massive worldwide      investigation that is without question the most important      ever undertaken by the Federal Government. The Department of      Justice has mobilized thousands of federal and state      personnel and is coordinating myriad federal and state      agencies, a task that will utilize tremendous resources. We      commend the efforts of all the men and women of the      Department of Justice and all Federal and state agencies      investigating this horrific event.       We wish to make sure that the Department of Justice, the      FBI, and all Federal law enforcement agencies involved in      this investigation have all the resources and authority      needed to investigate these incidents and would like to know      whether additional resources or legal authorities are needed      to complete this mission successfully. The House and Senate      Judiciary Committees stand ready to review expeditiously any      requests made by the Administration in this regard and to      provide all appropriate resources.           Sincerely,     F. James Sensenbrenner, Jr.,       Chairman, House Committee on the Judiciary.     John Conyers, Jr.,       Ranking Minority Member, House Committee on the Judiciary.     Patrick Leahy,       Chairman, Senate Committee on the Judiciary.     Orrin Hatch,       Ranking Minority Member, Senate Committee on the Judiciary.                          ____________________
