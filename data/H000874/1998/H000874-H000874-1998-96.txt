It is simple to talk about wanting patients to have rights and access to care. It is another thing, however, to provide for that in legislation.  There are two contending bills. Let me go through them. Access to enforcement in State courts: The Democratic bill, yes; the Republican bill, no. Protection for women after mastectomy: Democratic bill, yes; Republican bill, no. Choice of doctors within the plan: Democratic bill, yes; Republican bill, no. Access to specialty care: Democratic bill, yes; Republican bill, no. Direct access to OB/GYNs: Democratic bill, yes; Republican bill, no.  There are other provisions that I will not be able to cover in this 1 minute. But as we hear this debate and people talk about patients' rights, hold them to the criteria of not just talking about patients' rights, but ensuring patients' rights.                          ____________________
