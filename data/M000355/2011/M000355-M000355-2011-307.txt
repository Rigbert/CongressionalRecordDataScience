 President, I rise today to pay tribute to the astounding achievements of a dedicated Kentuckian. Worthy of recognition for her contributions to the advancement of rural health care, Dr. Susan Stone has devoted much of her life to the practice of nursing and bettering the lives of women, children, and families around the country.  Dr. Stone received her first degree in nursing in 1974 and her bachelor's of science from the State University of New York. She obtained her doctor of nursing from the University of Tennessee Health Science Center, as well as her postmasters in nurse midwifery at the very school she is currently president and dean of, the Frontier School of Midwifery and Family Nursing in Hyden, KY.  Educated in many facets of medicine, Dr. Stone has worked as a nurse and a childbirth educator as well as a certified nurse midwife. Then in 2001 she found a way to make an even greater contribution to Kentuckians' health, as she was named president and dean of the Frontier School. Following in the footsteps of the Frontier School's founder, Mary Breckinridge, Dr. Susan Stone continues to seek to improve health care in Kentucky's rural and underserved areas. Expanding the school over the past 5 years to over 1,000 students from across the world, Dr. Stone has made a major impact on its growth. Expected to become the No. 1 education provider of advanced practice nurses in the future, the Frontier School now provides master's as well as doctoral degrees.  About 75 percent of students enrolled in the Frontier School are from rural counties, furthering Dr. Stone's vision of improving health education and the availability of health assistance around the State. And since her involvement with the school, it has recently received three prestigious rankings in U.S. News and World Report.  For her incredible hard work and devotion to medicine, Dr. Susan Stone was named the National Rural Health Association's Distinguished Educator of the Year 2011. Kentucky is fortunate to have driven, focused women like Dr. Susan Stone, as she continues to educate and aid more students who will take their practice of medicine around the world.  Mr. President, the Leslie County News recently published an article highlighting the life and achievements of Dr. Susan Stone. I ask unanimous consent that the full article be printed in the Record.  There being no objection, the article was ordered to be printed in the Record, as follows:              [From the Leslie County News, May 12, 2011]  Frontier School's President and Dean, Dr. Susan Stone, Named NRHA's                    Distinguished Educator of the Year       With great pride, the Frontier School of Midwifery and      Family Nursing announces that Dr. Susan Stone, the school's      president and dean, has been named the National Rural Health      Association's Distinguished Educator of the Year for 2011.      Dr. Stone was honored on May 5 during the 34th Annual Rural      Health Conference in Austin, Texas. Dr. Stone's devotion to a      career of advancing the education of rural health care      providers throughout the United States made her a deserving      recipient of this prestigious national award. Dr. Stone, who      has led Frontier as its president and dean since 2001, has      been instrumental in the growth and success of the Frontier      School, a distance-learning graduate school of nursing with a      historic campus in Hyden, Kentucky. Today, the school offers      nationally rated master's and doctoral degree programs and      educates nurses to become nurse-midwives, family nurse      practitioners and women's health care nurse practitioners.      Enrollment at Frontier has grown from just 200 students in      2006 to a current enrollment of over 1,000 students      representing all fifty states and many countries. Stone has      maintained a focus on educating nurses who will serve rural      and underserved populations which is evidenced by the fact      that 75% of students enrolled in 2010 resided in rural      counties and/or health professional shortage areas. Thanks to      Dr. Stone's commitment and leadership, Frontier graduates are      most certainly increasing access to quality healthcare for      those that need it most. The school was founded in 1939 by      the visionary Mary Breckinridge, who years earlier founded      the Frontier Nursing Service in the mountains of southeastern      Kentucky to provide healthcare to women, children and      families. Frontier is considered the birthplace of nurse-     midwifery and family nursing in America. Dr. Stone's passion      for the vision of Mary Breckinridge, who with her nurses      traveled on horseback to deliver care and attend births in      Appalachia, is evidenced by the school's continued commitment      to educate advanced practice nurses to serve in rural and      underserved areas. Mary Breckinridge wanted to see her work      replicated throughout the nation and world, and Dr. Stone has      embraced that vision by educating students from all 50 states      and several countries, taking Frontier's philosophy of care      across the globe. Like Frontier's founder, Dr. Stone has      devoted her career to improving healthcare for women and      families. Dr. Stone received her first nursing degree in      1974, later followed by a bachelor's of science in nursing      from the State University of New York. Dr. Stone worked as      nurse, a certified childbirth educator and later as a      certified nurse-midwife in New York, after receiving her      post-master's certificate in nurse-midwifery from the      Frontier School in 1991. During the '90s, while still      practicing, she served on the distance-learning faculty of      the Frontier School. Dr. Stone, who earned her Doctor of      Nursing Practice degree from the University of Tennessee      Health Science Center, has been instrumental in expanding the      Frontier School's outreach worldwide, through a unique      melding of online learning and real-world clinical      experiences. The school recently received three high-profile      rankings from US News and World Report: Frontier School of      Midwifery and Family Nursing is ranked #13 in Nurse-Midwifery      programs, #14 in Nurse Practitioner education programs and      #50 in Nursing--among all accredited schools in the country.      The work and commitment of Frontier graduates toward meeting      rural health care needs could fill an entire book. With Dr.      Stone's expert guidance, determination, passion and Frontier      school is poised to become the No. 1 education provider of      advanced practice nurses to serve rural areas, both      domestically and internationally.                          ____________________
