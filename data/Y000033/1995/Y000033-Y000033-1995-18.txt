Mr. Speaker, I have reserved the right to close, I believe, but I yield myself such time as I may consume to suggest if the gentleman had reached his point and not added all the little adjectives to it, I would have been much happier.  I will not disagree with some of the things he says, but I would suggest when he brings in the other appropriations bills, brings my leadership into question, when this is a two-party street, why did the gentleman not mention the President? That is all I suggested.  It means a great deal to me that we solve this problem of refuges and parks. And I hope on that side of the aisle, I hope Members understand if they vote against this bill what they are doing. It is not my fault, it may not be my colleagues' fault, but we are allowing the Secretary for the first time in history to deprive our taxpayers of the utilization of our refuges and parks, and tell me that is not political.  When Secretary Babbitt will run down and campaign in every district that has a Republican, and he has done that, and I have that documented, that is politics. I am tired of politics on this floor. I want to keep the parks open and the refuges open, because that is the taxpayer's right.  If my colleagues want to play politics, we will play politics. But let us leave this part of it out. This is for the parks and the refuges.
