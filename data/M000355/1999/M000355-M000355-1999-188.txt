 President, I rise today to honor a fine Kentucky businessman, Tom Rechtin, Sr., President of Tom Rechtin Heating, Air Conditioning and Electric Company.  Tom was recently named ``1999 Outstanding Business Person'' by the Northern Kentucky Chamber of Commerce for his community leadership and 35 years of education advocacy. The honor was given as part of the A.D. Albright awards program, which is named for Northern Kentucky University's president emeritus, who was known for encouraging educational excellence in the region.  The Albright Award recognizes Tom's commitment to supporting and encouraging educational activities in the workplace and in the community. His own company serves as a model for his philosophy, as his employees attend and participate in numerous classes and seminars he facilitates. Tom Rechtin's company also employs student interns who are seeking certification.  Tom was also recently named the ``1998 National Contractor of the Year''by the National Association of Plumbing, Heating and Cooling Contractors, and ``Kentucky Contractor of the Year'' by the Kentucky Association of Plumbing, Heating and Cooling Contractors.  Tom began working in the industry after high school and, over the years, moved through the ranks from an entry-level position to eventually owning his own company. Today, Tom is one of the most well-known and well-respected businessmen in the state, with over 12,000 customers in Northern Kentucky, Eastern Indiana, and Southern Ohio.  Tom is a three-time appointee by the Governor to the Kentucky HVAC Licensing Board, which oversees the licensing and continuing education programs for the state's HVAC journeymen and Master License holders. He has been an example to board members and the entire industry by implementing his own rigorous employee training programs. His leadership and success in the field is one of the reasons Tom has been named Vice President of the Kentucky HVAC Licensing Board.  My colleagues and I congratulate you, Tom, on your recent accomplishments and commend your many years of service to Northern Kentucky's business community. Best wishes for many years of continued success.  Mr. President, I ask that the following Campbell County Recorder article from June 17, 1999, be printed in the Record.
