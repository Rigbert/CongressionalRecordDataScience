President.  In fact, the very stated reason for this whole bill is to require Congress to do the people's business in the open.  A Senator may have a hold on a nomination or a bill or a unanimous consent agreement, and that hold is secret.  It is just as possible for a Senator to keep his constituents and Americans in general in the dark now about their holds as it was for House Members before I successfully led the charge for transparency in discharge petitions.  Indeed the Wall Street Journal was strongly in favor of my House efforts at that time.  Toward that end, I ask unanimous consent to have printed in the Record the Wall Street Journal's six editorials on the issue of discharge motions.  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in the Record, as follows:             [From the Wall Street Journal, Sept. 30, 1993]                           Real House Reform       On his first day in office in 1987, Rep. Jim Inhofe asked a      fellow Oklahoma Member how he could be so liberal and keep      getting elected in a conservative state. A third Congressman      interrupted: ``It's easy. Vote liberal. Press release      conservative.''       Rep. Inhofe took a big step toward ending such hypocrisy      Tuesday, when Congress voted 384 to 40 for his proposal to      end the secrecy of discharge petitions. Constituents will now      know who's signed up for the procedures necessary to      discharge a bill from committee and force a vote; Members      will no longer be able to posture one way and act another on      bills popular with the public but unpopular with fellow      legislators. Rep. Inhofe's overwhelming majority, after the      difficulty he had signing up 218 Members to discharge his own      proposal, is itself testimony to the difference between      smoke-filled rooms and the light of day.       At least the 40 opponents, whose names appear below, were      willing to stand up and be counted in favor of secrecy. ``I      think the whole thing stinks,'' declared Rep. John Dingell,      much-feared chairman of the House Energy and Commerce      Committee. General Dingell warned that reform ``means you      lay the basis for the entire bypassing of the committee      system.'' House Rules Committee Chairman Joe Moakley      railed against an ``aroused and enraged'' public that is      ``virtually impossible to engage in reasonable and      thoughtful debate.''       Watching Jim Wright's departure, the Keating Five scandals,      the House Bank and Post Office, much of the public doubts      that such debate is what goes on in Capitol corridors.      Indeed, it thinks it has some right to be aroused and      enraged. And when Congress routinely exempts itself from      rules it imposes on the rest of society, much of the public      thinks that something needs to be bypassed. So it's entirely      appropriate that this major reform of House rules be forced      on Congress by popular outcry.       The ideological bent of this outcry is also noteworthy. As      the 40 holdouts show, the drive to make Members accountable      was certainly not led by the liberals who have long thought      themselves the font of ``reform.'' We on this page were glad      to have played our part, and are equally glad to credit Rush      Limbaugh's broadcasts and the efforts of Ross Perot, whose      supporters held all-night vigils in front of Congressional      offices.       We would also note, though, the lack of interest from a      press that holds itself devoted to ``the public's right to      know.'' For a month after Rep. Inhofe's August 4 announcement      that he would publicize the names of Members who refused to      end secret discharge petitions, no network or other major      newspaper mentioned his crusade. Only after public agitation      forced a House majority to back Mr. Inhofe did our colleagues      at the New York Times and the Washington Post address the      issue. The Post noted that ``in a democracy, where elected      officials have an obligation to be candid and accountable,      there is no reasonable argument against this change.'' We're      grateful for the support, but wonder if they'd have joined      the battle before it was won had it been led by, say, Ralph      Nader.       It's also intriguing that secrecy was supported by Beltway      ``academics.'' Thomas Mann and Norman Ornstein complained we      had created ``a wildly inaccurate portrayal of Congress as a      closed, secretive institution dominated by committees and      party barons and unresponsive to popular sentiment.'' We      refer them to the respected Members now departing in disgust.      Rep. Tim Penny, the retiring Minnesota Democrat, says it took      him ``only six months in Congress to realize this place      doesn't operate on the level.'' In particular, he says, many      Democrats are themselves upset that House leaders ``rig the      rules to make sure they aren't challenged on the floor.''       To the Members, the academics and the press we say this:      Welcome to the age of instant communications. We doubt that      the discharge petition reform will be the last reform. In      particular, some 75% of the American people support      limitations on Congressional terms. Last week, after it      became clear that discharge petitions would be made public,      five Members signed the petition to discharge term limit      legislation. While defenders of Congressional secrecy predict      untoward and chaotic results, we trust the public a lot more      than we trust the Members.       In 1867, the British Parliament passed the Second Reform      Act, sponsored not so incidentally by Disraeli's      conservatives. It gave the vote to the likes of rent-payers,      and upon passage the Viscount Sherbrooke advised fellow      parliamentarians to ``prevail on our future masters to learn      their letters.'' In the popularized version this became, ``We      must educate our masters.'' If the John Dingells and Joe      Moakleys are really worried not about their own prerogatives      but the future of the republic, they would be well-advised to      adopt the constructive attitude affirmed by Viscount      Sherbrooke.

Jim Inhofe mobilized public opinion and forced      House leaders to allow a September 27 floor vote on his bill      to end secret discharge petitions, he knew they might try to      undermine him. Sure enough, there are signs that the      leadership hopes to placate the public by accepting Mr.      Inhofe's secrecy bill but then sneak through House-Rule      changes that would gut his reform. Should they try this      stunt, Members better be ready to take some real heat from      voters.       Only hours after Mr. Inhofe's first-round victory on      September 8, House Rules Committee Chairman Joe Moakley said      he planned an ``alternative'' to Mr. Inhofe's bill. No doubt      it would pay lip service to reform while it retains the      system that lets Congressional barons make certain that      popular bills never see the light of day.       House leaders may try to require that two-thirds of the      Members sign any discharge petition to bring a bill to the      floor, rather than a simple majority. Since less than 10% of      discharge petitions now reach the House floor, such      a ``reform'' would kill any chance of freeing popular      bills bottled up in committee. Exhibit A: Even though 75%      of voters and more than 100 Members favor term limits,      Speaker Tom Foley hasn't even allowed a committee hearing      on the issue.       The Rules Committee met last week to discuss altering the      Inhofe reform. It was suggested that successful discharge      petitions merely require a committee to hold hearings on a      bill. A floor vote would be mandated only if a committee      refused to take any action. But, according to the newspaper      Roll Call, House leaders rejected even that move. They fear      they'll lose iron control of the legislative process if a      majority of Members have a realistic way of bringing bills to      the floor.       The hearings then became a platform for Members to vent      their frustration with Mr. Inhofe's success at exposing the      gag rule that kept names on a discharge petition secret. Rep.      James Oberstar of Minnesota came to denounce Mr. Inhofe, but      ended up scoring points for him. He called Mr. Inhofe's      sunshine law a ``gimmick.'' However, he conceded that if      Democrats ``were in the minority, we'd probably be doing the      same.'' He also admitted that many Members introduce bills      only to get ``special interests off their backs.''       Mr. Inhofe says Mr. Oberstar's admission proves that secret      discharge petitions allow Members to say one thing at home      and then do something else in Washington. ``Standing up to      special interests is part of the job,'' he says. ``If you      can't, step aside and let someone who can serve.''       Rep. Inhofe says his battle to end secrecy has also      demonstrated the stranglehold that committee chairmen now      exercise over legislation. Before the August recess, Mr.      Inhofe's antisecrecy petition was only one signature short of      the needed majority. Then Chairman Moakley ``convinced'' six      Members to remove their names, forcing Rep. Inhofe to take      his case to the American people.       Virginia Democrat James Moran candidly explained why he      dropped off: ``When the chairman of the Rules Committee asks      me to do something and it's not in conflict with my      conscience, I think my ability to serve my district is      enhanced when I say yes.'' Mr. Moran then noted how powerful      Chairman Moakley is.       Thomas Mann, a Congressional scholar at the Brookings      Institution, opposes the Inhofe reform, but he advised the      Rules Committee not to amend it. ``That will only inflame the      public further,'' he told us. He noted that if problems      develop, the majority party will then have a good reason to      push for modifications. In short, the House should have      cleaned up its act years ago. Now the voters are going to do      it for them.                                  ____             [From the Wall Street Journal, Aug. 25, 1993]                       Asides: Discharge Rumbles       Some House Members have complained that we listed their      names among the 223 Members who haven't joined Rep. Jim      Inhofe's effort to end secret discharge petitions. Speaking      for the non-signers in today's letters column, Rules      Committee     Chairman Joe Moakley claims that ending secrecy would mean      more power for lobbyists and special interests (see related      letter: ``Letters to the Editor: Why Make It Easier For      Special Interests?''--WSJ Aug. 25, 1993). We'd have thought      that taking a stand against such forces came with the job. We      suspect that Mr. Moakley is fundamentally worried that his      Rules panel would lose its hammerlock on bills. Some Members      aren't listening to him. Democrats David Mann of Ohio and      Barney Frank of Massachusetts have told constituents recently      that they favor ending the secrecy rule. Rep. Frank says the      issue is simply about whether House Members support open      government. Three more Members will give Rep. Inhofe the      majority that he needs to let some sunshine into Congress.                                  ____             [From the Wall Street Journal, Aug. 19, 1993]                        Asides: Discharge Charge       Rep. Jim Inhofe's effort to end secret discharge petitions,      which allow Members to publicly claim support for a bill      while privately working for its defeat, is attracting some      big-name boosters. Rush Limbaugh alerted his listeners to our      publication this week of the list of 223 Members who refused      to join Mr. Inhofe's effort. The 50 state directors of Ross      Perot's organization have been asked to make discharge      petition reform ``a high priority.'' Mr. Perot himself will      discuss the subject on C-SPAN tonight at 8 p.m., EDT.      Outraged voters are already making an impact. Rep. Karen      Thurman, a first-term Florida Democrat, faxed Mr. Inhofe      yesterday to say she will now sign up. By the way, through a      production error Rep. Dave McCurdy of Oklahoma was omitted      from the list we published. His office confirms he is not      supporting Rep. Inhofe.                                  ____              [From the Wall Street Journal, Aug. 9, 1993]                        Asides: House Enforcers       House leaders could scarcely miss the danger Rep. Jim      Inhofe posed to them with his effort to end secret discharge      petitions, described in our editorial last week. Why, making      public the now-secret list of members calling for floor votes      on bills held by the Rules Committee would let constituents      check up on members. Leaders couldn't bottle up popular      bills.       On Friday, Rep. Inhofe had 208 of the 218 signatures needed      on a discharge petition for his own proposal to end this      hypocrisy. Then C-SPAN viewers saw House Committee Chairmen      Joe Moakley and John Dingell park themselves near the desk      where the petition is kept, where they ``persuaded'' several      Members to remove their names. We still plan to publish the      names of those Members who favor secrecy over open      government, and maybe constituents can do a little persuading      of their own.                                  ____              [From the Wall Street Journal, Aug. 5, 1993]                        Congress's Secret Drawer       The ongoing drama in the Capitol makes it clearer than ever      that Congress can't control either itself or its budget. A      large part of the problem is procedure, an arcane set of      rules evolved over the years to let Congresspersons protect      each other and keep constituents in the dark. Rep. Jim Inhofe      has launched a campaign against the keystone of these rules,      the veil of secrecy covering a device called the discharge      petition.       It works like this: The House conspires to bottle up in      committee all the bills that are popular in the country but      unpopular on Capitol Hill--balancing the budget or limiting      terms, for example. The Rules Committee is particularly      crucial, as it was in shelving civil rights bills in the      1950s. The Rules Committee simply sits on a bill, allowing      members to posture in public in support while never having to      vote on it, much less enact it.       The discharge petition is supposed to serve as a      protection; a bill can be forced onto the floor if a majority      of Members sign a petition. But that rarely succeeds, because      until the required number of 218 is reached, the list of      signers is kept strictly secret. So Members can still posture      in public and effectively vote the other way in secret, even      co-sponsoring a bill but refusing to sign its discharge      petition. Worse, only House leaders know who has signed, and      when a petition nears 218 they can pressure the most pliable      members to drop off.       Discharge petition procedures have the flavor of a covert      brotherhood rather than a representative body. Petitions are      kept locked in a drawer at the clerk's desk. The drawer can      only be opened during a House session and only a signing      Member can see a petition. Members cannot take any notes, and      can't even bring their own pens to the desk. They must read a      statement signed by the Speaker noting that disclosing any      names on the petition is ``strictly prohibited under the      precedents of the House,'' a prohibition imposed in 1931      by Speaker John Nance Garner, but never made part of House      Rules. Violators face disciplinary action, up to and      including expulsion.       Rep. Inhofe was granted floor time last night to dare House      leaders to carry out this threat. Mr. Inhofe filed a bill to      require that signatures on a discharge petition be made      public, and it was promptly assigned to the Rules Committee      for burial. So he started a discharge petition to bring it to      the floor, and quietly asked each signer to memorize other      names on the list; by now he's painstakingly assembled a list      of 200 signers, only 18 short of a majority. He revealed last      night that he will disclose the names of all Members who have      not signed the petition, and is ready to face any      disciplinary action against him.       As a public service, we've agreed to print his list as      Congress leaves Washington to visit its home constituencies.      Watch this space to learn if your Congressperson wants      secrecy or openness in government. Of course, Members not on      Mr. Inhofe's petition can sign up for openness before leaving      town. As he advised his colleagues last night: ``It's just      one short trip to the secret drawer to sign discharge      petition No. 2. Take a friend.''  After all was said and done, the Wall Street Journal noted, ``Members will no longer be able to posture one way and act another on bills popular with the public but unpopular with fellow legislators . . . While defenders of Congressional secrecy predict untoward and chaotic results, we trust the public a lot more than we trust the Members.''  Mr. President, that is again exactly what I am talking about here in this parallel instance.  I want to very strongly note that the Wall Street Journal is in favor of eliminating the secrecy of Senate holds at this time.  Toward that end, I ask unanimous consent to have printed in the Record this Wall Street Journal editorial that endorses the concept of eliminating secret holds, assuming no one puts an anonymous hold on this unanimous consent request:  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in the Record, as follows:             [From the Wall Street Journal, Apr. 29, 2005] Advise and Consign--The Filibuster Isn't the Only Procedure Senators                               Are Abusing       With a showdown looming over the filibuster of judicial      nominees, now is the time to point out another abuse of the      Senate's ``advise and consent'' power. It's called the      ``hold,'' whereby an individual Senator can delay      indefinitely a Presidential nomination, and it is seriously      interfering with the operation of the executive branch.       Call it every Senator's personal ``nuclear option.'' If he      doesn't like a nominee or, more likely, doesn't like a policy      of the agency to which the nominee is headed, all he has to      do is inform his party leader that he is placing a hold on      the nomination. Oh--and he can do so secretly, without      releasing his name or a reason.       Like the filibuster, the hold appears nowhere in the      Constitution but has evolved as Senators accrete more power      to themselves. Senate rules say nothing about holds, which      started out as a courtesy for Members who couldn't be present      at votes. Oregon Democrat Ron Wyden has said holds are ``a      lot like the seventh-inning stretch in baseball. There is no      official rule or regulation that talks about it, but it has      been observed for so long that it has become a tradition.''       Also like the filibuster--which was never intended to block      judicial nominees from getting a floor vote--the hold is      being abused by a willful minority of Senators. This being a      Republican Administration, Democrats in particular are using      it now to hamstring or stop its ability to govern. There's no      formal list of holds, but the current batch may well be      unprecedented both in number and degree. Here's our      unofficial list:       Rob Portman, U.S. Trade Representative. The Senate Finance      Committee unanimously backed the former Congressman this      week. But don't expect a floor vote soon. Indiana Democrat      Evan Bayh has placed a hold on his nomination in hopes of      forcing a vote on a protectionist bill he favors on trade      with China. (Think AFL-CIO and the 2008 Presidential      nomination.) Meanwhile, it looks like Mr. Portman will miss a      high-level meeting next week in Paris to jump-start trade      talks.       Stephen Johnson, head of the Environmental Protection      Agency. Senator Tom Carper says Mr. Johnson ``is qualified to      head the EPA and would serve the agency well.'' Yet the      Delaware Democrat placed a hold on him over a dispute      regarding the Administration's Clear Skies program,      regulating pollutants in the air. Mr. Johnson dodged an      earlier bullet when California Democrat Barbara Boxer      threatened a hold unless the EPA canceled a study of infants'      exposure to home pesticides. Mr. Johnson, who is acting EPA      head, canceled the program.       Lester Crawford, Food and Drug Administration Commissioner.      The sticking point here is Plan B, aka the morning-after      pill. Democrats Hillary Clinton and Patty Murray want Plan B      sold over the counter and say that the agency is stalling.      They say they won't lift their hold until the FDA makes a      decision.       Tim Adams, Undersecretary of the Treasury for International      Affairs. The person in this position is responsible for,      among other critical issues, the Chinese yuan and the World      Bank. But Democrat Max Baucus has higher priorities--     namely, trade with Cuba. He objects to a legal ruling by      an obscure arm of the Treasury that requires advance      payment by Havana for purchases of U.S. agricultural      products such as grain from the Senator's home state of      Montana. There are six more Treasury positions open--     including those responsible for tax policy, Fannie Mae     and terrorist financing. Mr. Baucus promises holds on all      of them. The Senator realizes he can't win a vote in      Congress on his Cuba problem, so he's resorting to this      nomination extortion.       Defense Department. Where to begin? With a war on, you'd      think Senators would want to keep the Pentagon fully staffed.      But John McCain, angry over the Air Force's tanker-leasing      deal with Boeing, last year put holds on numerous Defense      nominees, including two candidates for Army Secretary, the      comptroller and the assistant secretary for public affairs,      the long-serving Larry DiRita. Now that Mr. McCain's personal      punching bag, Air Force Secretary Jim Roche, has left the      Pentagon, the Arizona Republican has calmed down--though not      enough to lift his hold on Michael Wynne as Undersecretary      for Acquisition. President Bush gave Mr. Wynne a recess      appointment last month.       Meanwhile, Democrat Carl Levin has a hold on Peter Flory,      who was nominated almost a year ago as Assistant Secretary      for International Security Policy. Mr. Flory has the      misfortune to work for Undersecretary Douglas Feith, whom      Senator Levin has pursued like Ahab chasing Moby Dick. So Mr.      Flory gets harpooned, too.       Until Wednesday, John Paul Woodly was blocked as Assistant      Secretary of the Army for Civil Works by Alabama's two      Republican Senators. Jeff Sessions and Richard Shelby said      Washington favored Georgia in a decade-long dispute over      water rights. (We're not making this up.) And in March,      Mississippi Republican Trent Lott placed a hold on the      chairman of the Base Closing Commission, which he feared      might shut a military facility in his home state. The      President again had to use recess appointments to name all      nine members in April.       Once upon a time in America, such policy disputes were      settled in elections or with votes in Congress. But in      today's permanent political combat, Senators wage guerrilla      warfare against the executive. No wonder so few talented      people want to work in Washington. Senator Wyden and      Republican Charles Grassley plan to re-introduce legislation      next month to kill holds that are secret. Better yet would be      to get rid of all Senate holds.
