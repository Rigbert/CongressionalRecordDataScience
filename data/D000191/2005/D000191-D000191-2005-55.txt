  Mr. DeFAZIO. The Republican reconciliation bill, pretending to finally bring a sense of fiscal responsibility to that side of the aisle, having increased our debt by 62 percent in 5 years, actually is bleeding middle-income families, kids who want to get a higher education, $14 billion out of student loans.  Those youngsters in the elementary schools are eating too much. Cut student lunches for those kids. Foster care, the family values side, long-term care for seniors. Why are they cutting all that? So they can bleed the poor and the middle class in this country. And then as they create this giant sea of red ink, they will float the yachts of the wealthy on it by giving them $70 billion in tax breaks, actually increasing the deficit, having already stuck it to the middle class and struggling families.  They are going to increase the deficit in order to finance tax cuts for people who earn over $300,000 a year so their yachts can be a little bigger and float a little higher. They should be ashamed of what they are doing to America and what they are doing to middle-income and struggling families.                          ____________________[Page H10048]From the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]                     REPUBLICAN RECONCILIATION BILL  (Mr. DeFAZIO asked and was given permission to address the House for 1 minute.)
