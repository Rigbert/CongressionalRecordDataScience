But there is growing concern that evidence presented in this case could be excluded from any subsequent criminal case that might be filed by the U.S. Department of Justice.  Thus, I invite my colleagues to join me and several dozen Members in signing onto a letter to Attorney General Holder asking him to investigate Goldman Sachs and other related cases to ferret out and fight fraud in our financial system. Legal maneuvering to thwart justice should not be allowed through those who harmed our Republic so maliciously.  In addition, I urge my colleagues to sign onto H.R. 3995, which enhances the FBI's, SEC's, and Department of Justice's capabilities to investigate and prosecute fraud and other financial crimes. Our citizens demand justice. Those who committed financial crimes must be brought to justice. Our letter and H.R. 3995 lead exactly in that direction.                          ____________________
