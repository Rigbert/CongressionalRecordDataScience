Speaker, it is with great sincerity and respect that I offer congratulations of several of Northwest Indiana's most talented, dedicated, and hardworking individuals. On Friday, June 9, 2006, the Plumbers Local Union 210 will honor the graduating class of 2006 at the Annual Apprentice Graduation Banquet, which will be held at the Patio Banquet Hall in Merrillville, Indiana.  At this year's banquet, the Plumbers Local Union 210 will recognize and honor the 2006 Apprentice Graduates. The individuals who have completed the apprentice training in 2006 are: Nino Arredondo, Joseph Butcher, Robert DePyssler, Lloyd James, Jr., Michael Klaich, Todd Knight, Paul Lacy, William Lawrence, Eric Longoria, Milutin Miljus, Greg Monnier, Eugene Pazdur, Derrick Poper, Jason Powers, Luis Quintana, Sean Severson, Daniel Smith, Bertram Wagner, Adam Westlund, Robert White, and Raymond Zack.  Northwest Indiana has a rich history of excellence in its craftsmanship and loyalty by its tradesmen. These graduates are all outstanding examples of each. They have mastered their trade and have demonstrated their loyalty to both the union and the community through their hard work and selfless dedication.  Mr. Speaker, I ask that you and my other distinguished colleagues join me in congratulating these dedicated and hardworking individuals. Along with the other men and womenof Northwest Indiana's unions, these individuals have committed themselves to making a significant contribution to the growth and development of the economy of the First Congressional District, and I am very proud to represent them in Washington, DC.                          ____________________
