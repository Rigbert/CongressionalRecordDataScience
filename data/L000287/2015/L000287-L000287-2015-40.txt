Speaker, I rise in recognition of Dr. Valerie Camille Jones, Ed.D. an educator at the Ron Clark Academy located in my congressional district. I am proud to share that the President of the United States recently honored Dr. Jones with the Presidential Award for Excellence in Mathematics andScience Teaching (PAEMST), which is our country's highest honor in math and science for teachers.  For over 15 years, Dr. Jones has served her country and the people of Metropolitan Atlanta as a teacher. Dr. Jones earned her bachelor's degree in Mathematics at Spelman College and continued her studies by earning master's and doctoral degrees in Education from Georgia State University. As you may know, Mr. Speaker, both of these wonderful institutions are located in Georgia's 5th Congressional District.  Dr. Jones is greatly respected for her creative approach in making the most difficult subjects accessible and tangible to her students. Dr. Jones teaches her students how to effectively use mathematical models as communication tools. In the classroom, she develops art and video games simulations to connect students to math and coordinates field trips to provide real-life examples of angles and forces for struggling geometry students.  Not only does Dr. Jones' innovative and creative approach help students develop the critical skills they need to compete and thrive in today's world, but she also goes out of her way to share these effective teaching techniques with over 17,000 teachers across the country and around the world. As you can see, Mr. Speaker, Dr. Jones is a wonderful national and international model and practitioner in the field of education.  Today, I join the President, the administration, the Ron Clark Academy community, and Metropolitan Atlanta in congratulating Dr. Jones on this prestigious honor, and thanking her for her tireless work and support of the most precious and beloved members of our community--our youth--our future.                          ____________________
