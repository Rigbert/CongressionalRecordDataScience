Mr. Speaker, today I am introducing a bill to clarify the tax treatment of Settlement Trusts authorized by the Alaska Native Claims Settlement Act. This legislation is very similar to a bill that I introduced with my colleagues, Congressman George Miller and J.D. Hayworth, last Congress.  The bill has been further improved from last Congress and a companion measure was introduced in the Senate recently. This bill will be cited as the ``Alaska Native Claims Settlement Act Settlement Trusts Remedial Tax Act of 1999''.  Federal law first authorized settlement trusts in 1988 to permit Alaska Native Corporations to provide a variety of benefits to their shareholders in a long term permanent manner. Present law requires settlement trusts to report tax information to their beneficiaries on Form K-1, rather than Form 1099 which corporations use. This causes confusion to the beneficiaries and encourages misreporting of income. This legislation requires all settlement trusts to use Form 1099.  In recent years I have written to the Chairman of the Ways and Means Committee informing him that what had started as a simple proposition, promoted by Congress in the Settlement Trust legislation--to provide aid from a protected source to Alaska Natives who often have very little in other available assets to sustain them and in particular in their retirement years--had become a complex and bewildering situation which frustrated the use of the settlement trust provisions in law. This result stems from an IRS interpretation calling for the immediate taxation to potential beneficiaries when these trusts are established by Alaska Native corporations which have earnings and profits, as opposed to taxation when the money is actually received by the beneficiaries. Put simply, in the case of some beneficiaries, particularly the elderly, who have to prepay taxes in order to receive their benefits and, if they die prematurely, they will not even receive the amount of their prepaid taxes back. Needless to say, this is a substantial impediment to setting up and continuing such beneficial trusts.  But those Native corporations having favorable tax situations which enable them to make contributions to trusts which are not immediately taxable to their beneficiaries face other impediments. The IRS has taken the position that there is no authority to withhold tax from beneficiary payments, which prevents a simple way for a Native to pay his or her tax. The IRS requires that trust reporting to beneficiaries be accomplished via the complex so-called ``K-1'' form as opposed to the simple 1099 form, so familiar to most of us. As you can imagine, the requirement to use the former, particularly in rural areas in the state of Alaska where accountants may not be readily available, presents major reporting problems. We believe the IRS internally has been supportive of such a change but has advised in the past that it would need to be accomplished by statute.  Finally, the original authorizing legislation failed to provide a mechanism to encourage sustaining the longevity of these trusts dedicated to the goals enumerated. Such trusts are currently treated as regular trusts and penalized for accumulating income with an assessment of the highest marginal tax rate. Accordingly, from the standpoint of a settlement trust, it currently makes good tax sense to distribute all income to the beneficiaries rather than leaving it to be taxed at the current trust tax rate. This, however, does not make good social sense and encourages the opposite result one would envision for these entities, whose goal is to sustain the funds on a long-term basis in order to fulfill the objectives envisioned for Settlement Trusts.  Therefore, I am pleased that, on a bipartisan basis, I can join my colleague and Ranking Minority Member on the Resources Committee, Mr. Miller, and my other distinguished colleagues Mr. Hayworth, Mr. Kildee and at least 16 other cosponsors to introduce this important remedial legislation. I am attaching a brief summary and section by section analysis of the legislation.              SETTLEMENT TRUST CORRECTIVE TAX LEGISLATION       Federal law first authorized settlement trusts in 1988 to      permit Alaska Native corporations to provide a variety of      benefits for their Native shareholders in a long term,      permanent fashion. Although Alaska Native corporations are      not governments, they do provide many social services to      their shareholders. We have worked with the Treasury      Department on the proposed legislation, which clarifies      present law and provides an elective tax structure to      encourage use of these trusts as follows:       (1) Contributions to an electing settlement trust are not      taxable to the shareholders. Present IRS ruling policy is      that contributions to settlement trusts are deemed      distributions to the Native corporation's shareholders. If      that corporation has earnings and profits under the tax law,      the deemed distributions will then be taxable to the      shareholders even though they have not actually received any      money. The legislation eliminates this significant      disincentive by providing that contributions to an electing      trust are not currently taxable to the shareholders.       (2) Permit electing settlement trusts to retain up to 45%      of their annual taxable income without adverse tax      consequences. Present law imposes a severe penalty for      inflation proofing these trusts (which permits constant      dollar benefits to be provided), by taxing reinvested income      at the maximum individual tax rates (presently 39.6 percent).      The legislation provides that up to 45 percent of the trust's      annual income can be reinvested in the trust without current      taxation, but this reinvested income will be eventually      taxable at ordinary income rates to shareholders when      distributed. This treatment continues so long as the only      persons who hold the beneficial interests in the trust are      persons who could hold the Native corporation's own stock.       (3) Impose severe penalties on electing settlement trusts      which no longer benefit Alaska Natives. The settlement trust      election is intended to benefit Alaska Natives. In the event      that a settlement trust ceases to benefit Alaska Natives, the      trust will no longer be permitted to receive the elective      benefits discussed above. In addition, unless the trust      terminates through a distribution of its assets, a one-time      tax is imposed at the highest marginal income tax rates upon      the value of the trust's assets.       (4) Require withholding on certain trust distributions.      Present law does not require any income tax withholding on      trust distributions. Under the proposed legislation,      withholding on distributions by any settlement trust is      required to the extent the annualized distributions exceed      the basic standard deduction and personal exemption amounts      under the Tax Code.       (5) Modify information reporting requirements. Present law      requires settlement trusts to report tax information to their      beneficiaries on Form K-1, rather than Form 1099 which      corporations use. This causes confusion to the beneficiaries      and encourages misreporting of income. The proposed      legislation requires all settlement trusts to use Form 1099.                      Section-by-Section Analysis            ANCSA Settlement Trust Remedial Tax Legislation       Federal law authorized in 1988 Alaska Native corporations      to use their own funds to establish settlement trusts to      ``promote the health, education and welfare of its      beneficiaries and preserve the heritage and culture of      Natives.'' Although Alaska Native corporations are not      governments, they do help provide certain social services as      contemplated in the Alaska Native Claims Settlement Act      (ANCSA) to their shareholders. This proposed legislation      corrects several deficiencies in and clarifies present law      while providing an elective tax structure to lessen the      current impediments to the establishment and maintenance of      these trusts. The following is a section-by-section analysis      of the legislation:       Section 1 is the Short Title of the bill.       Section 2(a) (identification of ANCSA settlement trust as      eligible to elect tax exempt status). This provision of the      legislation provides a partial exemption from income taxes      for Alaska Native Settlement Trusts which make a one-time      election. The partial exemption is accomplished by adding      settlement trusts as entities which can be tax exempt under      Tax Code section 501(c), and then requiring that to qualify      for the tax exemption a settlement trust must currently      distribute at least 55% of its annual taxable income.       Section 2(b) (detailing new 501(p) elective tax treatment).      New subsection 501(p) has six paragraphs.       Paragraph (1) describes the taxation of both electing and      non-electing settlement trusts. Contributions to electing      trusts are not currently taxable to the beneficiaries; by      contrast, current IRS ruling policy is that contributions to      non-electing trusts are currently taxable to beneficiaries to      the extent of corporate earnings and profits. Electing trusts      will be tax exempt if they currently distribute 55% of their      income and if transfers of trust units are restricted      similarly to transfers of ANCSA corporate stock. Eventual      distributions to beneficiaries of the trust's exempt income,      as well as any other distributions by the electing trust, are      taxed to the beneficiaries at ordinary income rates. Non-     electing trusts remain subject to present law.       Paragraph (2) provides the basic mechanism by which a      settlement trust elects tax exemption. Paragraph (3) imposes      a rule to assure that primarily Alaska Natives receive the      benefits of this elective tax exemption, just as the Alaska      Native Claims Settlement Act (43 USC 1601 et seq.) limits      transferability of the stock in Native corporations to assure      that the benefits of stock ownership accrue primarily to      Alaska Natives. Under this bill, if at any time the      beneficial interests in an electing trust become transferable      in a manner which would be prohibited if those beneficial      interests were ANCSA stock, the trust becomes permanently      ineligible to continue the election. Also, a one-time penalty      tax equal to the highest marginal tax rate under section 1(e)      times the asset value of the trust is imposed. This tax can      be avoided by a distribution of the trust assets to the      beneficiaries before the close of the taxable year in which      the trust beneficial interests became transferable. Paragraph      (3) also causes the foregoing rule to apply if a Native      corporation which is not governed by the non-transferability      rules makes a transfer to an electing settlement trust.       Paragraph (4) imposes an annual distribution requirement      (55% of taxable income) on electing trusts. The consequence      of a failure to make these annual distributions is a non-     deductible tax at ordinary income rates upon the income which      should have been distributed.       Paragraph (5) describes the taxation of the beneficiaries      of both electing and non-electing trusts. All distributions      to a beneficiary of an electing trust produce ordinary      income. But for this rule, the character of income earned by      the trust would flow out to the beneficiaries and      distributions of capital and accumulated income would be tax      free to the beneficiaries. Distributions by a non-electing      trust are taxable to the extent required by Subchapter J of      the Tax Code, which generally limits beneficiary taxation to      the amount of income of the trust and flows the character of      the trust's income out to the beneficiary.       Paragraph (6) provides certain definitions applicable to      the election.       Section 2(c) (Withholding on distributions by electing      trusts). Present law does not require any tax withholding on      trust distributions. Many Alaska Natives have income levels      so low that they are not required to file income tax returns.      In such circumstances, requiring withholding on distributions      increases the administrative burden to both the government      and settlement trusts since these Alaska Natives would have      to apply for refunds of over collected taxes. Therefore,      under this legislation, withholding on distributions by any      settlement trust is required to the extent the annualized      distributions of the Trust exceed the basic standard      deduction and personal exemption amounts under the Tax Code.       Section 2(d) (Modify information reporting requirements.)      Under present law, settlement trusts report to their      beneficiaries on Form K-1s, which with extensions, can be      sent as late as October of the year following the taxable      year to which the information relates. Much of Form K-1 is      inapplicable to the typical settlement trust and can be      confusing to beneficiaries. Native corporations, by contrast,      have long reported to their shareholders on Form 1099s which      must be sent by January 31 of the following year. This      section requires all settlement trusts to provide annual      information on Form 1099s (rather than on Forms K-1s). In the      case of a non-electing settlement trust, the From 1099 would      differentiate among the different types and character of      income being distributed. Form 1099 reporting would be in      lieu of the requirement that a non-electing settlement trust      attach a copy of beneficiary Form K-1s to its own tax return.       Section 2(e) (effective date). In general, the provisions      of the bill are applicable to taxable years ending after the      date of enactment of the bill and to contributions to trusts      made after such date.                               ____________________
