Chairman, I claim the time in opposition.  The CHAIR. The gentleman from Oregon is recognized for 5 minutes.  Mr. DeFAZIO. Mr. Chairman, section 408 authorizes the Secretary of the Army to grant permission for the alteration of the Corps project if the Secretary determines that the proposed alteration would not harm the public interest or impair the usefulness of the project.  I think it is good that we know that proposed modifications do not impair the usefulness of the project or harm the public interest.                              {time}  1800  Now, I share some of the concerns the gentleman has raised. The Corps is woefully slow in going through these approvals. I have one pending in my own district; and, basically, they say there is not enough money in our budget, which was discussed rather exhaustively at the beginning here.  We could help the Corps out if we had a real harbor maintenance trust fund and if we were using the taxpayers' dollars for the purposes for which they were intended, which would take the pressure off of all parts of the Corps' budget. The Corps does have authority to accept--and I would hope the Corps would be listening to this--local contributions to speed up, with contractors or others or over time with their own employees, 408 projects. They have been loath to use that authority. They should use it.  I am not certain of the implications of this amendment as to whether it truly does protect the integrity of some of these critical projects, so that causes me concern. I think that this is worthy of attention, but in its current form, I am not quite certain of the impact.  Mr. Chairman, I reserve the balance of my time.
