 President, I associate myself with the excellent remarks of the majority leader about Senator Boxer and Senator Inhofe. They have worked together in a collegial way to bring us to this point on the highway bill.  The majority leader and I have worked out an agreement to go forward and handle the judges. Also, I am pleased that he has agreed to turn to the jobs bill next. I think that is something everybody in the Senate will be pleased about. So I am happy to say we have reached an understanding, whichwe will have an opportunity to explain to our colleagues.
