 President, yesterday we debated a welfare bill that will have far-reaching impacts, and I'd like to draw your attention to the words used in the debate, and to a handful of them in particular. One word you heard is the word ``children.''  For quite a while now, I have been amazed at how many debates happen on the Senate floor in which we do not hear this word, and do not spend enough time considering the actual children the word represents. It's ironic to me that so much of our attention in the welfare debate has been focused on children. I know everyone here cares; I know we have all strived, and tried to protect children. I want to be able to say we've done everything we can--and we almost have gotten over that line, but it is with great personal regret that I say I think we could have done just a bit more.  The bill we sent out yesterday will change the lives of all children in this country, and could have dire implications for many of them. All of us were children, many of us have children, and some of us are currently raising children--I know this word is not exclusive or partisan.  I just hope after today each of us will continue to use this word in other debates, and always keep children in our thoughts.  Another word you've heard quite a bit is welfare. I think people in this country have varying levels of understanding about all the services we call ``welfare'' and what they do. But it's obvious from the bill we considered that many Americans these days share a wish to end welfare programs.  In my view, the welfare reform debate here in the Senate will officially end with the final passage of this bill. I hope that it will finally be a bill we can all support. However, a whole new discussion must now begin--a discussion about the needs of children in families from any income category, and about how we as adults will create new opportunities for them.  I think the welfare reform debate we've been having is really part of a larger discussion about something people often mention here--personal responsibility.  I am in favor--and I've said this many times before--of asking Americans to remember not only their rights, but also their responsibilities. What we are asking from people in this country who are on public assistance, is to do every thing they can to contribute to our society and economy, in exchange for the help all other taxpaying citizens are making possible. Whether it's work, or training for work, we need people to end their own dependency on outside assistance and contribute to the work of this great Nation.  But when we talk about personal responsibility, all Americans must recall those eloquent words from President John F. Kennedy on this topic. Each of us in this country must think about our own responsibility, whether we are on public assistance, or are calling for its reform.  Whether you ask the American public generally, or people on public assistance themselves, you will hear about the problems with welfare. Welfare has created a cycle of dependence. Welfare sets up perverse incentives, which actually discourage work. Welfare has been around long enough for everyone to see its effects, but though it has helped many people, it has not turned around the prospects of thousands of poor people living in a rich Nation.  As long as we all know what we mean by welfare, I agree with these statements, and I think we are obligated to change this system to address these problems.  When I say we need to agree about what welfare is, I'm thinking of the many stereotypes, attacks and characterizations we hear. I think welfare has become a negative word in this country people use to beat up on poor women and children. And, if this week we have stopped supporting programs that create that kind of thinking, and started to support individual people in ways that will make them more independent, then we've made a good first step.  I'm also thinking about the real picture--at least in my State--of who is on welfare. In my State, the most common profile is a single mother, age 29, with two children. Three-fourths of the time she is white, more than half of the time she became a mother as a teenager. Almost 60 percent of the time, her youngest child is more than 3 years old.  We know that getting a woman who fits this description into a job is a little easier in my State than many others, but we also know we need different strategies to get many different types of people back into work, or into work for the first time.  We know that each of these women has prior experiences that affect their reliance on public assistance. We know their experiences with work are important, as are their experiences with education and skill training, and other factors such as literacy, learning disability, and domestic violence. We need to remember this as localities design different strategies, or it just won't work.  Despite all we know about our welfare system and people who are on public assistance, I think most of us still agree that what we have now isn't doing the job.  So, the people of this country are demanding new tools that work better, and the demand has been heard here. The will of the Senate is to change, fundamentally, the way public assistance will work. I just worry that we have not adequately protected the ones who are not making the decisions--the kids.  The effect of last night's Senate action will be to put the brakes on our current system of public assistance, so we can embark in a new direction. This will be difficult. People will need all of our help making this transition.  This is not an ending; it is a beginning. We must remember that previous Senates designed our current system in response to problems of chronic poverty and joblessness in our past. Those problems have not gone away. But we need new solutions. We need to end welfare, or at least the negative welfare debate, as it stands. But the basic health and educational needs of children don't go away, just because of the votes we take here.  The Senate debated many amendments, some of which passed, and some of which did not. As we debated these, I was preparing to support the bill. I wanted to amend the bill to improve it the point I could lend my support. As it turned out, each time we were able to pass an amendment, we seemed to lose another that had far-reaching impacts.  I will highlight some of these amendments now because they are very important to whether we ultimately send a bill to the President he can sign. Some things that we fought for yesterday we should keep and improve as the bill moves forward:  First, I have fought very hard along with my Democratic colleagues to stave off repeal of American's guarantee of health services under Medicaid. In my State, over a third of the people who get medical assistance aren't on welfare--they're in low-income working families.  I want all people who are served by Medicaid to work, or be in training, or contribute what they can. We have many people in this country who are not on public assistance, who don't get health insurance where they work. I want to make that easier. All children, regardless of income, should be free from worry about health care coverage.  But, in this bill as it came to the floor, the Senate put at risk the health care of hundreds of Washington State citizens, just as they are trying to get into the work force--where they face the prospect of minimal or no health insurance coverage.  Fortunately, the Senate supported the Breaux-Chafee-Murray amendment continuing this health coverage. We need to support people, so they can make the transition, and can add to the economy instead of subtracting.  Second, when this bill came to the floor, it still had potential to seriously damage the nutrition of many children and families in my State. About 250,000 children in my State now receive some food stamp benefit--and today we passed the Conrad-Murray amendment so that we do not to jeopardize the nutrition of these families while they make the transition from welfare to work.  Third, when we think of child nutrition, we frequently think of our important program that helps provide school lunch and breakfast. A related program makes sure kids who need it also have access to meals in the summer--at their community center, at a school, or wherever children and adults gather for summer activities. This is the Summer Food Program. Under this bill, these children faced a 23-cent-per-meal cut to this service, which could have forced 60 percent of the programs in my State to close their doors.  We know that children's hunger doesn't stop just because it's summer and they can't get school lunch. Children who rely on school lunch get from one-third to one-half of their daily nutrition from that meal. So, I offered and passed an amendment to seek improvement for the Summer Food Program. My goal is to keep more of the 25,000 children in Washington State in line for a nutritious meal.  Fourth, we must provide educational opportunity to people if we are trying to get them off public assistance. To send people who cannot read out looking for jobs that are not there is just too much to expect. We must allow adults to complete their basic education or G.E.D. We must allow people to stay in training for 24 months--that's the length of most training programs. And we must let States have a larger percentage of people in training. The Simon-Murray literacy amendment does these things, and I'm happy the Senate chose to include it.  I was also glad we held off amendments and efforts to use lack of education as an excuse to penalize people on public assistance. We've got to get them educated. States know how to do this and will achieve great things.  Fifth, we must give parents the peace of mind that when they have taken their daughter or son to the child care center, that at least the minimum health and safety requirements are being followed. Also, parents want quality in child care, not just safety, so I'm glad the Senate bill's deficiencies on these two topics were remedied through amendments.  There are other improvements, made by the majority party, made in committee, and made yesterday on the floor. I hope the final bill retains them. I hope I get a chance to support them out of the Senate, so the President can sign a bill that is very close to wide bipartisan agreement. Such a bill won't be overly detrimental to children.  Unfortunately, there are other areas where this bill still just did not meet my internal test. With the kids in mind, I simply could not support the following:  Item A: We are trying to shift from reliance on cash assistance. In Washington State, 186,000 children receive basic assistance under AFDC. Under a 5-year time limit, 60,203 children would be eliminated from the program, and that number would increase to 118,915 under a 2-year limit.  What we do for these children instead of AFDC will make the difference in their well-being, because they are still going to need help after this welfare bill is signed. By rejecting attempts even to allow States to provide non-cash assistance to kids, we made this bill impossible to support. I want the conference committee, when looking to create a bipartisan bill--at a minimum--to include provisions to allow States the flexibility denied them by one vote in the Senate yesterday.  Item B: Even with the Conrad-Murray amendment on food stamps, this bill cuts $4 billion deeper than the Senate-passed bill I supported. We've got to get people off public assistance, but the children must have food to eat, especially if the parents are in a struggle to change their entire way of life. The reality is, any deep cut to food stamps directly affects the children.  Item C: The bill's effects will fall on women 75 percent of the time.  Item D: Even legal immigrants face enormous challenges under this bill, and our communities will face similar challenges in assuring the public health because of it. These are people who are working toward citizenship, like all of our parents or ancestors. We should be firm about what we ask of people striving for American opportunity. But whatever we ask of these adults, we should have made allowances for their children, and so far, we have not.  Item E: As many as 300,000 American children with disabilities will lose social security income assistance under this bill.  Item F: The administration sent Chairman Roth a letter predicting as many as 1.5 million children could be thrown into poverty under last year's bill. We don't know the exact number for this bill, but we can assume it would be a bit lower and in the same ballpark. I have asked the administration for updated figures. I just could not support doing this when we did not have very clear answers about what will happen for those children whose parents cannot find success under the new system. We need to provide a few more handles for the kids of those Americans struggling to end this dependence.  All of these facts are why this Senate must remain vigilant in talks with the House. I go on record saying that provisions in these essential areas--of noncash assistance, of child nutrition, of child health, of child care, of adult education and monitoring are make-or-break issues for ensuring a workable final product. I support welfare reform. I thought yesterday's bill was going to be it. But, I could not, and cannot vote for a bill that fails children in this way.  Many of you know that I supported the Senate welfare bill last year, and I wanted to do it yesterday. I am in favor of welfare reform, and I think we are very, very close. Let me emphasize this one more time. We have not debated the merits of limiting the time a person can be on welfare, because we agree there should be strict limits. What we have been debating is what we do while someone is on welfare to prepare that person to enter the work force. At the end of this debate, the answer is not clear one bit.  The Senate must remain vigilant about the effects of this bill in the realworld outside these walls. The States, localities, and individual people in this country who have asked for this fundamental change must now take on the hard work and the responsibility they have demanded.  States and local governments and--best of all--community groups of regular American citizens, are showing that much of the best work of government is done locally, with direct input from the people served.  I have no doubt that States will work to get people on the path to success. Just to be sure, I am glad the Senate adopted the amendment Senator Kerry and I worked on, requiring States to take corrective action as soon as indicators show effects from this bill that increase child poverty.  I just want to make sure we all understand--inside and outside this building today--exactly what we are doing here as we move ahead with this bill, and what that will mean. This bill today only tells the people what the Federal Government is not going to do any more. In its wake, we will be left with a clear picture of how much work all of us have left to do.  Localities are clearly the best places to make many decisions in our Government. The Federal Government should be the place where national standards are set--so that a child in any State in this country gets what she or he needs to grow up healthy, educated, and able to contribute to society as an adult.  Every child needs these things, and our country's economy and heritage cannot afford not to make this so. As we sent this bill out of the Senate, we have tried to retain as many national standards as possible, and even though we have had some success, we have failed on others--and we are going to have to come back here in January and get to work on new ways to improve the standards we have.  If you ask any CEO of any company what this country needs to thrive, they will tell you we need more highly skilled, highly educated people making good decisions in the workplace, and we need less people out on the street doing crimes.  I met with a high school assistant principal last week who has spent years working with children and young people with behavior problems, who do not do what adults want them to do. He has found successful ways of helping these students to learn how to behave in accordance with our expectations of them.  But he said to me, and I think he is absolutely right: ``You can pay me now, or you can pay them later.'' Because our young people would much rather be an asset to our country than a liability, and the vast majority of them are. But, they are bright young people, all of them. And if they do not find success in school and the economy, they will find it by getting really good at breaking into your house.  To avoid this, we must keep the Federal Government in the business of assuring standards, and must improve the ones we have today. On top of this, each and every American must invest the time and energy it takes to make sure every child is healthy enough to learn, and educated enough to contribute to her or his community.  So, since we have passed this welfare reform proposal, we must be aware that America had problems before we voted yesterday, and we will have problems afterward, and that this is only the first step. If we really want a country where every child's well-being is secure, where every person can be a contributing member of our society and economy, where the world around us is healthy and beautiful and a great place to live--then we must start a discussion in every community and around every dinner table--a discussion that just has not happened lately in this Nation.  What is important to us as Americans? What do we hold dear? What do our children mean to us, and what is each of us committed to do about it?  Every American must be part of the discussion to determine what we can each do, now, to make things better in this country. What can each person, in front of each television set, or in each car, or in the stands at each sporting event, do to get America on the right track? What can each person who gets any assistance from her or his Government--be it a welfare check or a paved road or a tax incentive or a safe hamburger or a bank that will not one day close its doors--what can each person do today to join us in making this country great?  People on this floor often talk about the old days, a simpler time, when things were better. Well, I am here to tell you that Americans today are just as capable of solving problems as any past generation--it is the American spirit that is going to make this happen.  People at home are now watching the Olympics, where the best athletes in our Nation will compete against athletes from the rest of the world. And they will win gold medals for their efforts, and for our Nation. These people are heroes, and we should all rally around them. But we can not forget the other heroism in this great country that we have seen in the old days and that we see today--the heroism of the American spirit.  Thousands of people in this country grew their own food during World War II, in victory gardens, to diminish the drain on our resources. They collected every piece of metal they could find, so our brave men and women could have the best tools with which to win the war. They went, especially the women, out of their homes and into the factories to work for this country.  Hundreds of thousands of Americans, like my parents and grandparents, gave of themselves, through the Great Depression, through war, through the war on poverty in the sixties, for our shared future.  Many of them have not stopped giving. There are senior citizens in my State who go to school every week to help children and to help each other to learn about and work with computers. There are hundreds of young people, sixth-graders and college students, going into the community with hard work and good ideas. There are also kids who are truly heroic for just making it to school each day, or for not letting a bad family situation crush their hopes for the future.  I want to caution you all that the American people have spoken and demanded change to public assistance, but they still want Government to play a role in helping people when they need help, and the American people are capable of speaking again, loudly and angrily, if we do not make this work.  We have sent a bill out of the Senate. We put the House on notice that this bill needs to be bipartisan, and needs to be the best bill possible under the circumstances, when it comes to children. I have made several attempts to improve this bill, and I will tell you, it can still use improvement.  I appreciate that the majority party has sought compromise in some areas, that they have made some improvements. But again, it is the nature of this debate that we are not foreseeing all the possible effects of this bill. We are entering uncharted territory. We must remain vigilant. And we here in this body must call upon every one of our constituents to join the fight to make this work for the people around them.  We are leaving the discussion about welfare reform. We are entering a discussion about different ways to make sure all children are healthy, despite the income of their family. Poor health, illiteracy, antisocial behavior--these are not the exclusive domain of the poor--all Americans are subject to the ravages of these problems, especially our children.  We are entering a time when we need to focus on creating opportunity for our children, and meeting their basic needs--health, nutrition, education, so as adults they will contribute positively to the economic and social structure of this country.  Our country, compared to other industrialized nations does a very shabby job of assuring the basics. If we are no longer going to do it through public assistance in the same way we have done--then we need to find new ways to do it.  I do not think this bill brings promise for the people it will affect. We have improved it for sure, but it could be better. But the fact is, the bill will soon be the law of the land. In the face of this, I challenge each American to help us put something in place to protect children, as we tear apart this system that has created such dependency.  Especially where children are concerned, this bill cannot be allowed to come back worse from the conference committee. It is our moral obligationto hold the children as harmless as we can, no matter what we are asking of their parents.  After yesterday, I expect that all Senators will join in this new discussion--of what we must do to assure basic standards of health, education for children and all Americans.                          ____________________
