Mr. Speaker, I rise today because the Republicans are at it again. Our President has requested emergency funds to help flood victims in the Midwest. One more time the Republicans have put partisan politics above the needs of the American people. Republicans insist on trying to put their pet political projects into the emergency relief bill.  We are trying to help those who have lost their homes, their businesses and their possessions acquired through a lifetime of hard work. If there is a role for the Federal Government, this is it. We are a caring and compassionate nation. We must help those in trouble and stricken with misfortune.  It is a shame and a disgrace that once again the Republicans are holding flood victims hostage. Putting politics above the needs of the people is wrong, just plain wrong. Stop playing political games with people's lives, Mr. Speaker. Give this President a clean disaster bill.                          ____________________
