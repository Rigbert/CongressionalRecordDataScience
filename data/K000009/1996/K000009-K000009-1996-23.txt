Chairman, I wish to thank the dean of the Ohio delegation and the ranking member on the subcommittee for yielding me this time. I want to acknowledge his diligence and wise counsel during consideration of the entire measure, and I would also like to commend the distinguished chairman of our committee, the gentleman from California [Mr. Lewis], for being so very easy to work with during the last several weeks on this bill.  I ask unanimous consent that my entire set of remarks be placed in the Record.  Mr. Chairman, I want to commend this distinguished chairman of our committee, the gentleman from California [Mr. Lewis], for his cordial handling of this very complicated bill. I also want to acknowledge the diligence and wise counsel of the ranking member, the gentleman from Ohio [Mr. Stokes], on this bill.                              introduction  The programs under our committee's jurisdiction provide assistance and benefits that help millions of Americans achieve a better life. Included are programs for medical care and benefits for our Nation's veterans, affordable and decent housing for families and individuals of all incomes and circumstances, a safe and clean environment, and investments in technology and science. In addition, this bill also continues to fund one very big-ticket item, the space station, at the expense of other programs under the committee's jurisdiction, including ones designed to assist the poorest, the neediest, and the most vulnerable among us.  For the second year in a row, two programs, which I strongly support and will vigorously work to ensure the task for which they were intended, are carried out by the corresponding agency have not been funded in this bill: the John Heinz Neighborhood Development Program and the Health Professional Scholarship Program.              john heinz neighborhood development program  The John Heinz Neighborhood Development Program was authorized in the Housing & Community Development Act of 1992. It awarded Federal matching funds to nonprofit community-based organizations involved in neighborhood revitalization and economic development activities.  The program spurred local initiatives by hundreds of community-based development organizations in concert with the private sector and empowered local communities to address specific needs of their neighborhoods. Typically, 90 percent of the financing needed by the nonprofit neighborhood organizations is raised within the community itself by creating a partnership between the nonprofit neighborhood organizations and the business community. And most importantly, it built the technical capacity for small nonprofit neighborhood organizations to assist in the revitalization of their community. There are no narrowly delineated directives from the Federal Government about what specific projects qualify for the matching funds.  National competition assured that Federal help was based on merit. For every grant received there were four applications submitted. The maximum grant awarded is $75,000. Currently under HUD, there is no one program designed to perform the task of the JHNDP--to assist small nonprofit neighborhood organizations revitalize their own communities. In this age of empowering our communities to make decisions at the local level, this program does exactly that. It devolves responsibility in the hands of those who can make the differences. The JHNDP allows nonprofit neighborhood organizations the flexibility to tell us in Washington what is important to them, not vice versa.                health professional scholarship program  Last year, I was grateful for the chairman's willingness to work with me to fund the Health Professional Scholarship Program. This program assisted in assuring an adequate supply of trained health care personnel for the VA and the Nation. To date, the program has awarded more than 4,000 scholarships to students in nursing, occupation therapy, physical therapy, respiratory therapy, and nurse anesthesia. It was successful in providing a continuous stream of academically prepared health care professionals for VA employment. Upon graduation, students are required to complete 2 years of service in the VA health system, and the retention rate of scholarship recipients in VA medical centers is greater than 50 percent.  The flexibility to provide scholarships for the education of a variety of health professionals made this program particularly useful as changes have occurred in the delivery of health care services. As the program identified shortages in particular categories of health professionals, the numbers and types of scholarship awards have been shifted accordingly.  The restoration of this program is vital to the recruitment and retention of scarce health professionals in the VA, and it is necessary to be responsive to the health care needs of veterans who have courageously defended this Nation. The men and women who have served in our Armed Forces deserve nothing less. Unfortunately, once again this vital program has been eliminated. I am hopeful that I can work with the VA to maintain the concept of this vital program.                            ohio va cemetery  I am pleased to note that the bill funds the completion of the design phase of the VA cemetery in Guilford Township, OH, for the over 600,000 veterans and their family members, who are eligible for burial in a national veterans cemetery, who live in northeastern Ohio. Many of these individuals are World War II and Korean war veterans. The closest veterans cemetery is located near Dayton approximately 2 hours south of Cleveland. With this cemetery nearing capacity, many veterans groups believe that with the construction of a new cemetery, that Ohio veterans and their families will better be served by our Nation.                        drug elimination grants  I am pleased this year the subcommittee was able to fully fund the drug elimination grants for public housing. Drug elimination grants, which were pioneered by Jack Kemp while he was HUD Secretary, are provided to public housing agencies and Indian housing authorities to promote safe housing communities by ridding them of drugs and drug-related crime. In my own district, the Toledo, OH, Police Department saw a dramatic decrease in drug activity in areas with public housing as a result of these grants.                               conclusion  I also want to point out the excellent job that some of our smaller independent agencies are doing like Neighborhood Reinvestment Corporation and American Battle Monuments Commission.  I would merely say here that there is no question that the jurisdiction of this committee provides assistance and benefits that help millions of Americans achieve a better way of life, whether it is veterans, whether it is affordable housing, whether it is a clean environment; also investments in new technology and science, including space science.  I want to thank the chairman also and the ranking member for including the drug elimination grants which we fought so very hard for, making sure that those were incorporated in this year's measure, certainly for the veterans cemetery in Ohio, and I do wish to express concern about the Health Professional Scholarship Program and its importance.  I would like to engage the chairman in a colloquy regarding the importance of the activities that had been funded under the John Heinz Neighborhood Development Program. This program, which has not been authorized, spurred local initiatives by hundreds of community-based development organizations in concert with our private sector, as well as provided technical assistance for small nonprofit neighborhood organizations to assist in the revitalization of their community. Though the administration has not requested funds for this program, nor has it requested authorization for this program, nevertheless, in this age of empowering our communities and their people to make decisions at the local level, this program devolved responsibility into the hands of those who can really make a difference.  The John Heinz Neighborhood Development Program allowed nonprofit neighborhood organizations the flexibility to tell us in Washington what is important to them, not vice versa, and I know that the chairman agrees with this philosophy and would like to encourage it.
