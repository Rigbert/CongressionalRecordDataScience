 President, October 30, 2005, marked the 75th birthday of Clifford Benjamin Brown, one of this Nation's great jazz musicians. Born into a large, middle-class, African-American family in Wilmington, DE, Clifford Brown was the youngest of eight children and inherited his love and passion for music from his father, Joe Brown. He began to show interest in the trumpet at a young age, and by the time he turned 12, he was engaged in private lessons. He attended Howard High School in Wilmington, where he was encouraged to play music by ear. He studied math at the University of Delaware and music at Maryland State College.  His career as a jazz trumpeter was monumental. He performed alongside such music legends as Miles Davis and Fats Navarro, while combining his sounds and style with those of Art Farmer, Dizzy Gillespie and Dinah Washington. Clifford played in Chris Powell's Blue Flames Band and the Brown-Roach Quintet. Sadly, Clifford Brown's promising and extraordinary career was tragically cut short when a car accident took his life on June 26, 1956. He was only 25 years old.  But the legacy of Clifford Brown extended far beyond his years through the efforts of his wife LaRue, whom he had married in 1954. LaRue helped to launch the Los Angeles Jazz Heritage Foundation's program which served underprivileged children, and founded the Clifford Brown Jazz Foundation.  LaRue Brown Watson passed away on Sunday, October 2, 2005 at the age of 72. She is survived by her children, Clifford Brown, Jr., Adrienne Traywick and Brian Watson, her son-in-law Clarence Traywick, and many grandchildren, cousins, nieces, nephews and friends.  Today, I stand and lead the Senate in paying tribute to the life of the great Clifford Brown and in lamenting the passing of his widow, LaRue Brown Watson.                          ____________________
