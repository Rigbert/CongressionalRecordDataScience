 We are getting down to what we hope is the beginning of the end tonight. If people who have some amendments pending come over here and try to work with us, we might work some of them out. If we cannot work them out, maybe they can offer them and keep the process moving. It is 10 minutes to 6 now. We could be out of here in a couple of hours, maybe less, if people would cooperate. I know the Senator from Nebraska has been pushing it all day, and so have I. This is our third day on this bill.  I yield the floor and suggest the absence of a quorum.
