Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.  The Delaware Water Gap National Recreation Area is the National Park Service's largest outdoor recreation area in the Northeastern United States. This recreation area includes 67,000 acres along 40 scenic miles of the Delaware River in the States of New Jersey and Pennsylvania. With 5 million recreational visits each year, it is our 10th most visited national park.  Our colleague, Mr. Garrett, introduced H.R. 3476 to enhance citizen participation in the administration of the park by extending the recreation area's Citizen Advisory Commission for another 9 years to the year 2018. I am pleased to join Mr. Garrett in support of this legislation.
