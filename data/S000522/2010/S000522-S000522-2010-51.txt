Mr. Speaker, last week one of China's most heroic defenders of human rights, Chen Guangcheng, was transported from prison to his family's house. This was good news, but only a step in the right direction. We must not gloss over the fact that Chen, who in 2006 revealed to the world the massive violence and brutality of the one child per couple policy enforcement campaign in Linyi, Shandong province, remains under house arrest, imprisoned in his own home, which is surrounded by surveillance cameras and police. Foreign reporters attempting to enter his village have been beaten and driven away, and Chen is reportedly in need of urgent medical attention, having been regularly beaten in prison, where he lost a great deal of weight.  Just today a Radio Free Asia reporter spoke with Chen and his wife over a cell phone. Chen's wife said, and I quote, ``He has a sort of haunted look. And for the first few days after his release he couldn't speak at all.'' Think about it. This is a very, very tough and articulate man, yet for the first few days after his release he couldn't speak at all. Such was the brutality of Chen's imprisonment.  So it is all the more inspiring to read Chen's words. The Chinese Government may have broken his body in the laogai, but they have absolutely not broken his spirit. Chen got on the phone and called on ``international organizations and people of conscience'' to react to his continued arrest in a united manner. That's the house arrest. And, ``If they can help me today,'' he said, ``their actions will help another person tomorrow.''  A few words about Chen, Mr. Speaker. He is a self-taught lawyer, having been denied the benefits of higher education due to his blindness, and was known in Linyi for advising his neighbors on how to resist the government's injustices. In 2005 and 2006 he took the brave step that changed his life. He began interviewing people and gathering evidence about the massive violence and brutality of the one child per couple policy and its enforcement campaign that shook Linyi in 2005. What he uncovered was shocking: 130,000 forced abortions and sterilizations in Linyi County in that year alone, in addition to mass detentions and beatings.  In order to stop Chen's investigation, officials placed him under house arrest. But he managed to slip away and travel to Beijing, where he met with journalists from Time magazine and conferred with legal scholars about filing a large class action suit against officials responsible for the campaign. Officials soon abducted him back to Shandong, returned him to house arrest, and then convicted him on trumped up charges of property destruction. Chen served the full term of his 4-year, 3-month sentence, despite health problems indicating the appropriateness of medical parole.  Mr. Speaker, the Chinese Government's relentless pursuit of Chen corresponds to the continued violence of the one child per couple policy, which Chen bravely exposed. Sadly, what he documented in 2005 and 2006 is still going on today all over China. This year alone we have reliable reports of large-scale forced abortion and sterilization campaigns in Guangdong, Fujian, Yunnan, Zhejiang, and Jiangxi provinces. The campaign in Guangdong province was widely reported, the story having been broken by The Times of London in April of this year.  In Guangdong's Puning County, officials rounded up women and men, as well as the relatives of any resisters, detained them in cramped conditions, and working 20-hour shifts for 20 days, forcibly sterilized their quota of almost 10,000 people.  Mr. Speaker, Chen Guangcheng documented the fact that Chinese women are immensely traumatized by these campaigns and by the entire one child per couple policy. It's been estimated by the World Health Organization that some 500 women per day commit suicide--not per week, not per month, but per day commit suicide--in China, largely attributable to this horrific and barbaric policy called one child per couple. It is invasive. There is a crude surveillance of women's reproductive cycles, including monitoring their cycle per month. The strict birth limits drive sex selection abortion and the tragedy of what we call gendercide--the missing girls in China, which may be as many as 100 million girls since 1979, when this barbaric policy was first pushed on China by the West and by the United Nations.  It's been estimated that upwards of 40 million men will not be able to find wives by 2020 because they had been forcibly aborted as part of the China policy.  Finally, I appeal to our government, I appeal to our President, please speak out on behalf of Chen Guangcheng for his release so that this terrible nightmare he has had to endure will end.                            [Sept. 14, 2010]             Radio Free Asia: Blind Activist Calls For Help A Chinese lawyer is under constant surveillance following his release                               from prison.       Hong Kong.--Authorities in the eastern Chinese province of      Shandong are holding a Chinese legal activist under house      arrest though his jail term ended on Monday, prompting him to      call on concerned citizens to support him in protest.       Chen Guangcheng, 38, had exposed abuses by local family      planning officials, leading to a jail term of four years and      three months for ``damaging public property and obstructing      traffic'' handed down by a Linyi municipal court in August      2006.       Chen served the full term of four years and three months in      spite of repeated requests for medical parole.       ``Now that I have come out of jail, the authorities are      putting a lot of effort into keeping me under close      surveillance,'' said Chen, calling on the international      community to protest his treatment by the Chinese government.       ``I am hoping that international organizations and people      of conscience will react to this in a united manner,'' he      said.       ``If they can help me today, their actions will help      another person tomorrow,'' Chen said, calling on rights      activists and ordinary people to come to his house and      photograph the security personnel with their mobile phones.       ``If they take away A's cell phone, then B can take a      photo. If they go for B's cell phone, then C can record it,''      he said.                           Layers of security       Chen's wife Yuan Weijing said there are four different      layers of security personnel watching the family home.       ``Between the national highway and our home, there are four      layers of surveillance,'' she said. ``Yesterday I wanted to      go out to buy some food but they wouldn't allow it.''       ``I told them we have to eat, and that maybe they should      buy food for us, but they said that wouldn't do either.''       ``The moment I went outside, about 20 people got to their      feet and started to surround me,'' Yuan said.       She said friends and relatives who tried to bring food to      the family were being refused entrance as well, and only      Chen's 76-year-old mother was being allowed out to buy food      for the entire family.       Yuan, whose repeated requests for medical parole for Chen      were ignored by prison authorities, said she is still very      concerned about her husband's health.       ``I am most worried about the continuing diarrhea and the      persistent cough,'' Yuan said. ``For the first few days after      his release he couldn't speak at all.''       She said Chen had lost a lot of weight in jail. ``He has a      lot of grey hair and he has a sort of haunted look,'' she      said.       Chen suffered beatings while in Shandong's Linyi municipal      prison in June 2007 for ``being disobedient'' after launching      an appeal against his conviction to a higher court.                       ``Give his freedom back''       Chen, a self-taught lawyer, was detained repeatedly,      beaten, and kept under surveillance after he helped local      people take legal action against the Linyi municipal      government in cases of alleged forced abortion.       Beijing-based civil rights lawyer Li Subin said Chen should      have his freedom back now that his jail term has ended.       ``Instead, the state-run prison has followed him back home,      where he is still imprisoned under house arrest,'' Li said.      ``We have been working towards democracy and the rule of law      for 30 years in this country, and we can still see cruelty      like this today.''       ``But if everyone takes this issue seriously, I don't see      how the gangster behavior of the local government and the      banditry of the local judiciary can carry on for too long.''       Meanwhile, Rep. Chris Smith (R-NJ), a senior member of the      U.S. House Committee on Foreign Affairs, in a statement      called on the Chinese government to release Chen from house      arrest.       ``The prison release of Chen Guangcheng, one of China's      most heroic human rights defenders, is good news but only a      step in the right direction,'' said Smith.       ``The fact that Chen remains under house arrest, imprisoned      in his own home, and is reportedly in need of urgent medical      attention, must not be ignored. I appeal to the Chinese      government to let Chen move about freely and ensure that he      has access to the care he needs.''       Chen Guangcheng's work exposed a culture of secrecy and      impunity among Chinese officials about the enforcement of      China's population control policy.       Local officials have admitted to taking draconian measures      when they have difficulty meeting population targets imposed      by Beijing.                          ____________________
