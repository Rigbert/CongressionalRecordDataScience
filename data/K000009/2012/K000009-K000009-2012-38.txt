LaTourette) and so in a way I reluctantly rise in opposition to his proposal.  Let me mention that in a way we're into quite a 200-year extensive history of the rules of the House, but in essence the legislation as enacted works. Every single community that I represent that has ever asked HUD for any type of waiver, if the percentage was operating in there to their detriment, it has been granted. And so I think the legislation as is works. It keeps the focus on reinvestment. But if a mayor or if a council wants to use more of their funds for demolition, they merely ask HUD. And, quite frankly, HUD acts in quite an expeditious manner. So I think in a way this is a solution in search of a problem.  I think the gentleman, we welcome his concern about the neighborhoods of this country that have been devastated by the Wall Street-induced housing crisis and lack of regulation here in Washington, but I really don't think it is necessary, and I would support the subcommittee chair and ranking member in their concern by raising a point of order here.  I've expressed my interest in working with the gentleman on any community that you may represent that's facing this situation because every single one that we've had come to us, we have resolved with HUD's full cooperation. So I would support the subcommittee chair's invoking of a point of order on this amendment.  The Acting CHAIR. The Chair is prepared to rule.  The Chair finds that this amendment explicitly supersedes existing law, namely, the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009. The amendment therefore constitutes legislation in violation of clause 2 of rule XXI. The point of order is sustained and the amendment is not in order.
