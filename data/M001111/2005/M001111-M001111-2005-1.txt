 President, I rise today regarding the December 7 Korean Fair Trade Commission, KFTC, decision against Microsoft. A major employer in Washington, Microsoft is being unfairly penalized by Korea, but this decision goes well beyond Microsoft as the Korean Fair Trade Commission's decision is ultimately a decision against free and fair trade.  When the European Commission issued its competition decision against Microsoft in March 2004, I was one of many Members who expressed serious concerns about the decision and its impact on one of America's most innovative companies and its workers. Like many of my colleagues, however, I was also alarmed at the broader policy implications of the decision--that Europe would adopt a decision whose negative impact on trade was so clear, and which diverged so markedly from the Department of Justice's remedy addressing the same conduct.  I believe that the December 7 decision of the Korean Fair Trade Commission against Microsoft is yet another warning sign that our trading partners are limiting competition in order to benefit their domestic interests. In this case, the Korean Fair Trade Commission not only followed the EU's market-distorting, anticonsumer approach, but appears to have gone substantially further than the EU remedies in several respects. The KFTC's decision makes me wonder whether the Microsoft case is not a unique case but instead indicates the beginning of a trend among some of our key trading partners to use competition law as a means to pursue protectionist agendas or advance domestic industrial policy goals. If so, this should be of tremendous concern to every member of this body.  Last week I wrote to U.S. Trade Representative Portman about this issue, and I would like to ask unanimous consent to place that letter into the record.  The letter urges Ambassador Portman to work with others in the administration--including at the White House and the Departments of Justice, State, and Commerce--to develop and implement mechanisms for addressing these issues in a more coherent and effective fashion. At the same time, I urged Ambassador Portman to work with others in the administration to take whatever steps are still available to advance the U.S. perspective in the Microsoft case, so that theanticonsumer, anti-innovation decisions do not establish a precedent that harms U.S. competitiveness for years to come.  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in the Record, as follows:                                                  U.S. Senate,                                Washington, DC, December 12, 2005.     Hon. Rob Portman,     U.S. Trade Representative,     Washington, DC.       Dear Ambassador Portman: When the European Commission      issued its competition decision against Microsoft in March      2004, I was one of many Members who expressed serious      concerns about the decision and its impact on one of      America's most innovative companies and its workers. Like      many of my colleagues, however, I was also alarmed at the      broader policy implications of the decision--that Europe      would adopt a decision whose negative impact on trade was so      clear, and which diverged so markedly from the Department of      Justice's remedy addressing the same conduct. At the time, my      hope was that the Commission's decision was the counter-     example that proved the rule--namely, that comity was alive      and well among the U.S. and its trading partners, and that      the international community was increasingly moving towards      adopting U.S.-style antitrust principles and rules.       Recent developments, however, suggest otherwise.      Specifically, the December 7 decision of the Korean Fair      Trade Commission (KFTC) against Microsoft--in which the KFTC      not only followed the EU's market-distorting, anti-consumer      approach, but appears to have gone substantially further than      the EU remedies in several respects--makes me wonder whether      the Microsoft case is not a unique case, but instead      indicates the beginning of a trend among some of our key      trading partners to use competition law as a means to pursue      protectionist agendas or advance domestic industrial policy      goals. If so, this should be of tremendous concern to the      United States and your office.       I understand that your Office, and you personally, have      been following this issue closely, and that you and other      USTR representatives have expressed the Administration's      strong concerns on these issues with your Korean counterparts      on more than one occasion. As a Member who represents a State      with dozens of leading innovative companies employing several      hundreds of thousands of workers, please know that these      efforts are greatly appreciated. Clearly, however, the      results to date are not what we would have hoped.       I am deeply concerned that, without a strategy for      addressing these issues more effectively--not only in the EU      and Korea, but also more broadly--leading U.S. firms will      increasingly face competition rulings in foreign nations that      have little or no economic justification, but that make it      much more difficult for U.S. industry to compete in global      markets. With all of the other challenges facing the global      trading regime at the moment, the United States can ill      afford yet another barrier denying U.S. industry and workers      the benefits of international trade.       I would therefore urge you to work with others in the      Administration--including at the White House and the      Departments of Justice, State, and Commerce--to develop and      implement mechanisms for addressing these issues in a more      coherent and effective fashion. At the same time, I would      urge you and others in the Administration to take whatever      steps are still available to you to advance the U.S.      perspective in the Microsoft case, so that the anti-consumer,      anti-innovation decisions do not establish a precedent that      harms U.S. competitiveness for years to come.       I would appreciate your response to this letter and look      forward to continuing our dialogue on these issues in the      months ahead.           Sincerely,                                                     Patty Murray,     U.S. Senator.                          ____________________
