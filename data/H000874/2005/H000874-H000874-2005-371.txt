Speaker, reclaiming my time, we would appreciate that.  The other bills that I would like to talk about, the highway bill conference report the gentleman indicated as a possibility, can the gentleman inform us of the status of that conference and where we are on this bill?  I yield to my friend.  Mr. DeLAY. Mr. Speaker, I appreciate my friend yielding. I am very encouraged. I serve on the conference committee, so I am very encouraged by the accomplishments and progress that has been made over the course of this week.  I believe there is really only one major issue left to be resolved by the conferees, and that relates to transit funding. Hopefully, that can be resolved prior to the Wednesday night expiration of the current short-term funding measure, and then, as normal, there are a lot of smaller issues that can be resolved by then. I am very hopeful that we can pass that conference report before we leave here next week.
