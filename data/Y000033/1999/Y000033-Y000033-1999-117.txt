Mr. Chairman I rise in opposition to the amendment offered by the gentleman from California (Mr. George Miller).  I will not use the full time. I was very disappointed the chairman accepted the amendment. It is a bad amendment. See, my money is, in fact, guaranteed money to the CMI. I am sure he pointed it out. This is a mischievious amendment. It should never have been offered. I would suggest respectfully that the amendment should be soundly defeated. We will not vote on it because the gentleman has accepted it. But it better not be in the conference when it comes back to this House floor.
