President, I wish to pay tribute to an exceptional officer in the U.S. Army. LTG Michael T. Flynn will retire in August after more than 33 years of distinguished service to the Army and the Nation.  Throughout his career, General Flynn has personified the Army values of duty, integrity, and selfless service across the many missions to which he has contributed.  A native Rhode Islander, General Flynn graduated from the University of Rhode Island and was commissioned as a second lieutenant through the university's ROTC program. He was assigned to the ``All-American'' 82nd Airborne Division, and since then, has served in a variety of command and staff assignments, leading men and women during times of peace and war. Over the course of almost four decades of service, he has commanded at the platoon, company, battalion, and brigade levels.  As an intelligence officer, General Flynn was often deployed to Iraq and Afghanistan, serving as the director of intelligence for Joint Special Operations Command, U.S. Central Command, the Joint Staff, and the International Security Assistance Force-Afghanistan and U.S. Forces-Afghanistan.  For the past 2 years, General Flynn has served as the Director of the Defense Intelligence Agency, DIA, focusing on strengthening integration and collaboration with the Combatant Commands and making the agency more flexible and responsive to intelligence requirements. He has overseen DIA's rapid tactical, operational, and strategic intelligence support to U.S. warfighters as they confront a variety of threats--from militancy in North Africa and the crisis in Ukraine, to tracking terrorists and weapons proliferation.  In all of his assignments, General Flynn has provided outstanding leadership with integrity and has offered sound advice on numerous issues of importance to the Army and our Nation.  I know that he is looking forward to spending more time with his family in Rhode Island, and I wish Mike and his wife Lori the very best. On behalf of the citizens of Rhode Island and a grateful Nation, I thank General Flynn and his family for their many years of commitment, sacrifices, and service to our Nation.                          ____________________
