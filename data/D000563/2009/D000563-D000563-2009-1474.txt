President, I am pleased to join my colleague Senator Grassley in introducing the False Claims Act Clarification Act of 2009. This bipartisan legislation takes important steps to modernize and strengthen the federal False Claims Acts, FCA, and will help protect the government and taxpayers from waste, fraud and abuse related to government funds. Last Congress Senator Grassley and I introduced similar legislation, which was passed by voice vote out of the Senate Judiciary Committee. I look forward to working with Senator Grassley as well as our fellow cosponsors, Senator Leahy, the Chairman of the Judiciary Committee; Senator Specter, the Ranking Member of the Judiciary Committee; and Senator Whitehouse, to see this important legislation passed into law.  Since it was signed into law by President Lincoln in 1863, the FCA, or ``Lincoln's Law,'' has played a key role in enabling the federal government and qui tam whistleblowers to prevent unscrupulous government contractors from defrauding the nation's taxpayers. In 1986, Senator Grassley and Congressman Berman sponsored amendments to the FCA and its qui tam provisions that revitalized the effectiveness of the FCA as a fraud-fighting tool. Since 1986, the federal government and qui tam relators have worked together to recover over $21 billion in monies that would otherwise have been lost to fraud, waste or abuse in government programs. The recovery of this enormous sum is a victory for taxpayers, and a demonstration of the success of the FCA and its qui tam model.  Senator Grassley and I first introduced FCA reform legislation in September 2007 because several recent court interpretations of the 1986 FCA amendments had threatened to limit the Act's effectiveness. Our legislation was designed to correct erroneous interpretations of the FCA's presentment clause in the 2004 D.C. Circuit case U.S. ex rel. Totten v. Bombardier Corp., and the FCA's public disclosure bar in the 2007 Supreme Court case Rockwell International Corp. v. U.S. Our bill also sought to make further clarifications to the FCA's scope and application in keeping with the intent of the authors of the 1986 FCA amendments.  In the time since we first introduced this bill last Congress, the need to strengthen Lincoln's Law has become even more urgent. The economic recession has required massive expansion of federal assistance to various industries, and this has created an increased opportunity for waste, fraud and abuse by recipients of that assistance. As the federal government moves ahead with various economic recovery measures, it is important that we have effective anti-fraud provisions in place to deter and catch those who would abuse public monies and the public trust. We owe this to the American taxpayer.  Also, the False Claims Act Clarification Act of 2009 is further needed in light of the Supreme Court's June 2008 decision in Allison Engine Co. v. U.S.ex rel. Sanders. In Allison Engine, the Supreme Court read the 1986 FCA amendments to include a barrier to liability in subcontractor fraud cases that Congress did not intend. The Allison Engine Court held that in cases involving false claims submitted by a subcontractor to a prime contractor for payment involving federal funds, the plaintiff must prove that the subcontractor intended for the false statement to be used by the prime contractor to get the government to pay its claim. Our legislation makes clear that subcontractors are liable for knowingly perpetrating fraud involving government funds, regardless of whether that fraud was perpetrated directly upon the government or indirectly through another contractor. In light of the numerous levels of subcontractors used in many government contracting arrangements, this statutory fix is necessary to ensure accountability no matter where in the contracting chain the fraud takes place.  The changes that our legislation would make to the FCA are narrowly tailored, but will have a significant impact in catching and deterring fraud. I commend Senator Grassley, the Senate architect of the 1986 FCA amendments, for his devotion to ensuring the effective functioning of the FCA, and I will continue to work with him to better combat waste, fraud and abuse in government programs.  In sum, the False Claims Act Clarification Act will enhance whistleblowers' ability to shine a light on fraudulent conduct involving government funds, and to hold the perpetrators accountable through legitimate qui tam claims. The legislation we are introducing today will strengthen the legacy of Lincoln's Law, and I am pleased to serve as its lead Democratic cosponsor. I urge my colleagues to support its passage.                                 ______                                       By
