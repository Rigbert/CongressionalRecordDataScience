Dr. James P. Comer, M.D., M.P.H., has made many distinguished contributions to the field of child psychiatry throughout his prestigious career, and I take this time to welcome him back to Northwest Indiana, where he will serve as the keynote speaker for the 2008 Parent University on Saturday, October 11, 2008, at East Chicago Central High School in East Chicago, Indiana. This extraordinary event is sponsored by the School City of East Chicago, the City of East Chicago, the Lake Shore Chamber of Commerce, and Purdue University.  Dr. Comer was born in East Chicago, Indiana. In 1956, he completed his studies at Indiana University and went on to receive his M.D. in 1960 from Howard University College of Medicine. From there, he went on to complete his M.P.H. degree from the University of Michigan School of Public Health in 1964. Following this, he went on to Yale University, where he was trained in psychology at the School of Medicine's Child Study Center. Today, Dr. Comer serves as the school's Maurice Falk Professor of Child Psychiatry. As part of his preparation for his remarkable career, Dr. Comer also completed a one-year residency at the Hillcrest Children's Center in Washington, D.C.  While his contributions to his field are many, Dr. Comer is quite possibly most well known for the founding of the Comer School Development Program in 1968. The goal of this program is to promote the collaboration of parents, educators, and the community to improve social, emotional, and academic outcomes for children that will help them to achieve greater success in school. His approach to focusing on teamwork has been utilized throughout the country at more than 500 schools to improve their educational environments.  As if his work in research and teaching, not to mention the founding such an influential program, were not impressive enough, Dr. Comer is also the author of nine books and the writer of more than 150 articles for Parents Magazine and more than 300 other articles on children's health and development and race relations. He has also worked as a consultant for the Children's Television Workshop, which produces Sesame Street. Throughout the years, Dr. Comer has also committed himself to service on many local, collegiate, and national boards, and he has been recognized with an abundance of prestigious awards and accolades for his work, including an astonishing forty-six honorary degrees.  Madam Speaker, Dr. Comer has made extraordinary contributions to his field and to school systems throughout the United States. His dedication and devotion to the youth of our nation are to be admired. I respectively ask that you and my other distinguished colleagues join me in honoring Dr. James Comer for his lifetime of contributions to the American way of life through his work in the area of child psychiatry.                          ____________________
