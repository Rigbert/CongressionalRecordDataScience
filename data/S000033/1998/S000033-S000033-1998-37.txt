 Chairman, I thank the gentleman for yielding, and I just want to add one point.  The subsidies for fossil fuels are targeted in the Green Scissors 1998 report, which is supported by organizations representing more than 8.5 million environmentalists, taxpayers and deficit hawks. So this is a popular concept that we are addressing, and I thank the gentleman from Michigan (Mr. Stupak) for his strong support.
