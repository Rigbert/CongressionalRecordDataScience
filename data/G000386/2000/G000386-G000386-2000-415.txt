 I can assure him that during the conference with the House on S. 625, I will in good faith address the Judicial Conference's recommendation for the additional judgeships. The hearing in November was indeed useful in helping us assess the merits of authorizing these additional judgeships. Subsequent to that hearing, my staff and I have engaged in discussions with the Administrative Office to clarify some remaining questions and concerns. I can report that most of my requests have been satisfactorily addressed. However, I am still awaiting some additional information, and so I am reluctant to add these positions to S. 625 at this time.
