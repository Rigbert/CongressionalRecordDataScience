President, I would like to ask of the Committee on Banking, Housing, and Urban Development a question.  Is it Chairman Dodd's understanding that the definition of a financial institution in section 3(5) of the Emergency Economic Stabilization Act includes the holding companies of such institutions described as ``any bank, savings association, credit union, security broker or dealer or insurance company''?
