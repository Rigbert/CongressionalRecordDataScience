 President, today the House of Representatives completed final action on the S. 1932, the Deficit Reduction Act of 2005, DRA. I am pleased that this important legislation will soon be enacted into law.  It has been 8 years since Congress last passed a reconciliation bill. In crafting S. 1932, we worked hard to ensure that none of the changes made would adversely affect beneficiary coverage. The Deficit Reduction Act will allow States across the country to continue to offer these essential services to their beneficiaries.  The Deficit Reduction Act also includes a number of provisions to ensure that the Federal Government pays Medicare providers accurately and appropriately. One such provision relates to payment policies under the Medicare Advantage program. Specifically, Section 5301 of S. 1932 phases-out the budget neutrality adjustment for Medicare Advantage plans. Section 5301 and the joint statement which accompanied the conference report in the Senate requiring adjustments for differences in coding patterns is intended to include adjustments for coding that is inaccurate or incomplete for the purpose of establishing risk scores that are consistent across both fee-for-service and Medicare Advantage settings, even if such coding is accurate or complete for other purposes. This will ensure that the goal of risk adjustment--to pay plans accurately--is met.  I am also pleased that the Deficit Reduction Act includes the Family Opportunity Act. I have been working tirelessly on this legislation since 1999 with Senator Kennedy. The measure will allow States to create options for families who have children with multiple medical needs to buy into Medicaid while continuing to work. Families with children with such medical needs should not have to choose between providing for their children and their children's health care. This provision in the Deficit Reduction Act will help prevent just that.  I applaud the Congress for passing this important legislation today. Beneficiaries and taxpayers across the country deserve to get the highest value for every dollar that is spent on Medicare, Medicaid and other safety net programs. This legislation will help accomplish that objective.                          ____________________[Page S438]From the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]           HOUSE PASSAGE OF THE DEFICIT REDUCTION ACT OF 2005
