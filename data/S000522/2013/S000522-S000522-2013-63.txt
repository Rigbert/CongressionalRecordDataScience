I thank the gentleman for yielding and for raising that important issue.  The People's Republic of China doesn't have a pro-life movement per se. The government is a dictatorship. Regrettably, going back to 1979, they enacted with great push and encouragement from the United States and from the West, Europe especially, a one-child-per-couple policy where brothers and sisters are illegal, where women are systematically, forcibly aborted, and forced sterilization is commonplace to achieve quotas. Not only does a woman have to get a birth authorization from the Government of China to have a baby; if she has an out-of-plan birth, she is aborted forcibly.  Over the years, as chairman of the China Commission and as chairman of the Human Rights Committee of the Foreign Affairs Committee, I've chaired 43 congressional hearings on human rights in China; and many of those were focused on, as you pointed out, women who had to be behind screens to tell their story about the gross indignity, the exploitation, the crimes against humanity that had been committed against them.  In China today, there are approximately 100 million, maybe more, missing daughters, the direct consequence of sex-selection abortion and what is often referred to as gendercide, the deliberate killing of a little girl simply because she is a girl.  In her book ``Unnatural Selection: Choosing Boys Over Girls and the Consequences of a World Full of Men,'' Mara Hvistendahl traces the sordid history of sex-selection abortion as a means of population control. And almost no one knows about this. You'll never read about this in the local papers. You don't hear about it on the major news broadcasts. She writes:       By August 1969, when the National Institute of Child Health      and Human Development and the Population Council convened     another workshop on population control, sex selection had      become a pet scheme.  Hvistendahl writes:       If a reliable sex-determination technology could be made      available to a mass market, there was a rough consensus that      sex-selection abortion would be an effective,      uncontroversial, and ethical way of reducing the global      population.  What that means is that you kill the girl child in the womb, you end one life, and that girl who will never grow up to be a woman because she has been exterminated because she happened to be a girl, will never be a mother. So it is a means of population control. It is absolutely an egregious violation of human rights, and yet our own President refuses to support a ban on sex-selection abortion. He talked about we the people and inclusion yesterday. Where's the inclusion of all unborn babies, but those who are particularly targeted for elimination, the girl child?                              {time}  1650  And I would also add, finally, Live Action, an undercover sting operation that they had done--and it's on the Web, you can watch it, you can watch the raw footage, liveaction.org--in their series, ``Gendercide in America,'' they showed Planned Parenthood personnel in this country advising undercover female investigators how to procure sex-selection abortions. I watched that and was sickened by the admonishment, the so-called counseling that was all caught on tape.  One staffer tells the investigator to wait until her baby is 5 months along, get the ultrasound. That's when you can determine the gender of the child, boy or girl, and if it's a girl, that's when you can kill it.  And it was all made very clear. The investigators were laying out a scenario where, if it's a girl, I want the girl child to be destroyed. And there was Planned Parenthood accommodating that to the nth degree.
