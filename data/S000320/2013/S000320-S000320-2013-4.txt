 President, today I wish to pay tribute to Andrew Downs who, at age 15, has been named to the first ever National Youth Orchestra of the United States. Andrew is a native of Irondale, AL, and is a sophomore at the Alabama School of Fine Arts. He is the principal bassist for the Alabama Symphony Youth Orchestra.  The National Youth Orchestra of the United States of America is an initiative of Carnegie Hall's Weill Music Institute that brings together 120 of the most promising and talented young musicians from across the country to play together across the Nation and the globe. This year marks their inaugural session.  Andrew was selected out of a pool of 2,500 applicants from all 50 States, and is clearly one of Alabama's most talented young musicians. He is a member of the National Junior Honor Society and also plays the violin, cello, and piano. He hopes to one day pursue a career as a bass player for a symphony orchestra.  This talented young man will be the only Alabamian in the orchestra, as well as one of only 10 bassists selected. I am proud to represent a State that is home to promising young individuals such as Andrew, who are committed to displaying excellence in their education and the arts.  Further, I wish Andrew Downs all the best as he embarks on his journey playing with the National Youth Orchestra. This is a true honor bestowed upon a very deserving student.                          ____________________
