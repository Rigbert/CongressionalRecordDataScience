 President, I rise today with my colleagues Senators Leahy, Boxer, Durbin, Klobuchar, Murray, Udall, Franken, Wyden and Whitehouse to introduce the Cluster Munitions Civilian Protection Act of 2015.  Our legislation places common sense restrictions on the use of cluster munitions. It prevents any funds from being spent to use cluster munitions that have a failure rate of more than one percent.  In addition, the rules of engagement must specify that: cluster munitions will only be used against clearly defined military targets; and will not be used where civilians are known to be present or in areas normally inhabited by civilians.  Our legislation also includes a national security waiver that allows the President to waive the prohibition on the use of cluster munitions with a failure rate of more than one percent if he determines it is vital to protect the security of the United States to do so.  However, if the President decides to waive the prohibition, he must issue a report to Congress within 30 days on the failure rate of the cluster munitions used and the steps taken to protect innocent civilians.  Cluster munitions are large bombs, rockets, or artillery shells that contain up to hundreds of small submunitions, or individual ``bomblets.''  They are intended for attacking enemy troop and armor formations spread over a wide area.  But, in reality, they pose a far more deadly threat to innocent civilians.  According to the Cluster Munitions Monitor, over the past fifty years, there have been 19,419 documented cluster munitions deaths in 31 nations. The estimated number of total cluster munitions casualties, however, is an astonishing 55,000 people.  While cluster munitions are intended for military targets, in actuality civilians have accounted for 94% of cluster munition casualties.  Death and injury from unexploded ordnance left behind by cluster munitions continues to kill civilians to this day. Today, 23 States remain contaminated by unexploded ordnance left from cluster munitions.  Last year, nine of these countries suffered casualties from unexploded ordnance. They were: Croatia, Iraq, Laos, Lebanon, Cambodia, South Sudan, Sudan, Syria and Vietnam.  More tragically, despite the risk they pose to civilians, cluster bombs continue to be used in conflicts.  Since July 2012, Syrian government forces have used cluster munitions in 10 of the country's 14 governates.  Human Rights Watch has documented that the Syrian government has used seven types of cluster munitions to date, six of which were manufactured in the former Soviet Union and the seventh of which is Egyptian-made.  In 2012 and 2013, the Landmine and Cluster Munition Monitor recorded 1,584 deaths from government-launched cluster munitions in Syria. Approximately 97 percent of the deaths directly linked to cluster munitions were civilians.  For the first time, Human Rights Watch has also obtained evidence that the Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant, known as ISIL, has also used cluster bombs.  According to witness testimony and photographic evidence, ISIL used cluster bombs on at least two occasions near the besieged town of Kobani.  Terrorist groups and other non-state actors would not be able to obtain and use cluster bombs if the world adopted the Oslo Treaty on Cluster munitions.  The Oslo Treaty bans the production, sale, stockpiling and use of cluster munitions. It came into effect in 2010 and to date has been ratified by 88 nations.  Under the Treaty, 22 nations have destroyed 1.16 million cluster bombs and nearly 140 million submunitions.  Unfortunately, the United States is neither a signatory nor state party to the Oslo Treaty.  In fact, the United States maintains a stockpile of 5.5 million cluster munitions containing 728 million submunitions. These bomblets have an estimated failure rate of between 5 and 15 percent.  Rather than adopting the increasing international consensus that cluster bombs should be banned, the Pentagon continues to assert that they are ``legitimate weapons with clear military utility in combat.''  I respectfully disagree. The benefit of using cluster bombs is outweighed by the continuing threat they pose to civilians long after the cessation of hostilities.  The Cluster Munitions Civilian Protection Act would immediately ban cluster bombs with unacceptable unexploded ordnance rates and in areas where civilians are known to be present.  Passing this legislation would move the United States closer to abiding by the requirements of the Oslo Treaty, which has been ratified by many of our allies, including the United Kingdom, France and Germany.  Since 2008 the Congress has banned the export of cluster munitions with a greater than one percent unexploded ordnance rate. While banning the export of these indiscriminate weapons was a positive first step, I strongly believe the United States can do better.  This body cannot compel the administration to sign the Oslo Treaty. However, we can surely take steps to abide by its spirit. Passing the Cluster Munitions Civilian Protection Act would do exactly that.  I urge my colleagues to support this bill.                                 ______                                       By
