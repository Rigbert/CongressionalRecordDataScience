President, this weekend we witnessed an act of senseless violence in Moscow, ID, the home of the University of Idaho, where someone reportedly laid siege to a courthouse, killing a police officer andwounding a sheriff's deputy and another person. The gunman then retreated into a church, where he apparently killed a church sexton and then took his own life.  The attack at the courthouse in Idaho is another reminder of the need to provide resources and protections crucial to our Federal and State courts. It was 2 years ago when the mother and husband of Judge Joan Lefkow of Chicago were murdered in their home. Judge Lefkow's courageous testimony in our committee hearing in May 2005 is something none of us will forget. Later that year a Georgia State court judge was killed at a courthouse in Atlanta and there was an attack on a State judge in Nevada.  Last month, by a vote of 97-0, the Senate passed S. 378, the bipartisan Court Security Improvement Act of 2007. I introduced this measure in January along with Senator Specter, the majority leader, Senator Durbin, Senator Cornyn and others. House Judiciary chairman John Conyers introduced an identical measure in the House also with bipartisan support.  Among the bill's many protections are provisions expanding the access of State courts to grant programs for their security. The additional resources provided by this bill may not have prevented what occurred this weekend, but we must do what we can. I wish this legislation had been enacted last year. Despite our efforts, despite Senate passage of this measure twice last year, the House last Congress did not take up and pass these measures to improve court security. I expect that the new House soon will take up and pass S. 378 in this Congress. It should not be a struggle to enact these measures to improve court security.  Our Nation's Founders knew that without an independent judiciary to protect individual rights from the political branches of Government, those rights and privileges would not be preserved. The courts are the ultimate check and balance in our system. We need to do our part to ensure that the dedicated women and men of the Federal and State judiciary have the resources, security, and independence necessary to fulfill their crucial responsibilities. This weekend serves as another tragic reminder that we owe it to our judges and those protecting our courthouses to better protect them and their families from violence and to ensure that they have the peace of mind necessary to do their vital and difficult jobs.                          ____________________
