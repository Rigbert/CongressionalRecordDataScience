Speaker, It gives me great pleasure to congratulate Dr. Leslie Singer on receiving the 1997 Indiana University-Northwest Chancellor's Distinguished Service Award. This award was presented to Dr. Singer earlier this spring in recognition of his lifetime of service to Indiana University-Northwest.  An economics professor at Indiana University-Northwest for 43 years, Dr. Singer has made numerous contributions to the fields of financial economics, regional and industrial economics, economic forecasting, and economics of art markets. His ground-breaking scholarly publications in the area of fine arts, for instance, have received world wide recognition and have been cited by numerous scholars. Such publications as The Wall Street Journal and Business News often quote Dr. Singer's opinions and forecast on the prices of fine art. In addition, Dr. Singer has written two economics text books, and has been published in several distinguished journals, including ``The American Economic Review,'' ``The Social Science Quarterly,'' ``The Journal of Business Forecasting Systems and Methods,'' and ``The Journal of Cultural Economics.''  Through his extensive studies, Dr. Singer has also served to aid Northwest Indiana businesses, as well as Indiana governing bodies, in a variety of capacities. Throughout his career, he has written numerous articles pertaining to the local economy, with a specific emphasis on Northwest Indiana's steel industry. In addition, Dr. Singer participates in the Indiana Economic Outlook panel, which presents a forecast for the Northwest Indiana regional economy each year. Dr. Singer also served as an advisor to the budget committee of the Indiana General Assembly, as well as to the late U.S. Senator, Paul Douglass. Several major corporations and hundreds of local businesses have grown to rely upon Dr. Singer's expertise for location and market analysis.  Mr. Speaker, I ask you and my other distinguished colleagues to join me in commending Dr. Leslie Singer on his receipt of the 1997 Indiana University-Northwest Chancellor's Distinguished Service Award. His notable achievements in the field of economics have proven to be valuable assets to businesses within Indiana's First Congressional District and across the Nation.                          ____________________
