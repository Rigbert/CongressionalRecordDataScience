 I have an amendment I wish to offer. I understand it is not going to be appropriate until later on. I want to tell you what it is. It is a sense of the Senate on fully funding impact aid. I notice that S. Con. Res. 101 does address this. It says:       It is the sense of the Senate that levels in this      resolution assume that impact aid programs strive to reach      the goal that all local education agencies eligible for      impact aid receive a minimum of 40 percent.  Now my concern would be this. In the State of Oklahoma, overall, we are at about 36 percent now. However, we have some well below that and some above that. In this sense of the Senate, would it be assumed that those below 40 percent would be raised to 40 percent but not that those who are above it would be reduced to 40 percent, or some level lower than they are currently?
