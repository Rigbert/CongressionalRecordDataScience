I have taken his lead on so many issues involving the disabled because he is a recognized national expert on this.  My suggestion, another possibility, is we set this matter aside and start voting on some of the things we have already done. We finished debate, or all but the last couple of minutes of debate, on the Lautenberg amendment. Let's vote on that. Let's vote on something on the chairman's side of the aisle and maybe set it in such a way that those votes will come within a few minutes of each other.  During that time, Senators will be able to talk more. The Senator from Utah and I will be able to bring up the managers' amendment and then see if it is possible to have time agreements, but time agreements in such a way that Senators will know this amendment comes up at this time, this amendment comes up at another time, so there will be more focus.  I suggest that as a possibility. We also know that as much as we talk, oftentimes these things are worked out during a rollcall vote. That is one way we can do it.
