Speaker, I am pleased to be here with my colleagues to pay tribute to all of the civil servants involved in the Oklahoma City tragedy.  I had an opportunity of speaking earlier today as we passed the resolution expressing our outrage and our deep sympathy for that which happened in Oklahoma City during the last 2 weeks.                              {time}  1715  More than 550 Federal workers worked in the Alfred P. Murrah Federal building in Oklahoma City which, like Federal buildings across our Nation, provided an array of services to citizens in the region surrounding Oklahoma City.  It has long been my view that Federal workers are one of our Nation's greatest assets.  As President Lyndon Johnson once noted:       So very much of what we are as a Nation--and what we are to      achieve as a people--depends upon the calibre and character      of the Federal career people. In no other endeavor can you      more directly serve our country's cause--or the values on      which we stand--than in the public service.  We lost many of these fine men and women last month and I want to extend my heartfelt sympathies to all of their families, friends, their coworkers, their neighbors, and those they serve.  I had hoped to be speaking this week in celebration of public service recognition week, that special week each year when we recognize the enormous contributions made by public employees not just the Federal level, but at all levels of Government.  On Thursday, Friday, and Saturday, the mall will be filled with displays [[Page H4487]] that show all that is right with our government. Members, their staffs, and the general public will have an opportunity to see demonstrations and displays from virtually every agency.  Typically, this is a happy week, one in which we celebrate the many things that are right with our civil service which, regretfully, so many are so quick to criticize.  This year, however, there is a heavy cloud over the celebration. As we wander through the exhibits our thoughts will turn frequently to those we lost in Oklahoma City:  Like Julie Welch, a 23-year-old graduate of Marquette University in Milwaukee who was preparing to marry an Air Force lieutenant. She helped Spanish-speaking clients at the Social Security Administration's Office.  Or like Rick Tomlin, a special agent with the Department of Transportation, who had celebrated his silver wedding anniversary in February. He and his wife, Tina, have two sons.  Or Kenneth McCullough, an Army veteran who worked for the Drug Enforcement Agency. He won't be with us to see his son and daughter grow up.  Or Randolph Guzman, a 28-year-old proud member of the U.S. Marines.  Mr. Speaker, these are just a few of the fine people whose lives were senselessly wiped out by the act of a deranged, demented, evil person, or perhaps persons. These are not nameless, faceless bureaucrats, and, Mr. Speaker, let me be very blunt. I get angry, angry at those who denigrate our civil servants. Every time we need budget savings, we go after the civil servants. Every time we need a scapegoat for the failure of this body to address important issues, we blame the civil service. That is not fair.  Yes, there are nonperformers, just like there are at corporations and factories across our country.  But, Mr. Speaker, the great majority of these men and women are Americans with a deep love for their Nation who oftentimes have bypassed more lucrative careers to serve their fellow citizens.  So it is my hope that the politicians and the reporters and the televisions folks and all the other self-proclaimed critics will revisit their attitude about the civil service.  We will never forget this terrible tragedy in Oklahoma. If any good can come of this most disturbing situation, I hope that it will be a new found respect for public servants.  We owe it to those who perished in the explosion, to those incredible FBI and ATF agents whose expertise has led to early successes in the investigation, and to every Federal, State, and local official who has worked tirelessly on the scene to aid their fellow Americans.  Mr. Speaker, I think the Federal Times said it well in their special issue released this morning. In dedicating the issue to those who gave their lives in Oklahoma City, the editors note:       Many survivors of the blast became heroes as we learned of      their extraordinary efforts to rescue others.       Many of the dead and missing are heroes, too, though we may      never learn their stories. They are heroes of everyday life:      good parents, co-workers you could count on, people willing      to go the extra mile.  Mr. Speaker, as we celebrate Public Service Recognition Week, let us all remember that our Nation is blessed with heroes in the Federal office building not only in Oklahoma City but in Federal buildings across this great land, and, yes, I would urge my friends and colleagues: ``Yes, you get angry at the IRS; yes, you may get angry at law enforcement offices, but do not allow that anger to be directed at individuals. Let it be directed at policy. Let us be a civil society.''
