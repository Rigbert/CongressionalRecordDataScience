Frelinghuysen, as well as the ranking member, Mr. Visclosky, for allowing me this time.  I am going to ask for a vote on this amendment, but I am hoping that as this moves towards the Senate and final consideration that, as to some of those who just happened to get to the microphone earlier, we might find a way to move some of those dollars around to support an industry that truly is a cutting-edge industry for our country, which deserves the kind of support that this Congress should give to new technology to try to create good jobs in this country and help us wean ourselves off our chief strategic vulnerability--imported energy.  I ask my colleagues to support the Kaptur amendment on solar.  I yield back the balance of my time.  The Acting CHAIR. The question is on the amendment offered by the gentlewoman from Ohio (Ms. Kaptur).  The question was taken; and the Acting Chair announced that the noes appeared to have it.
