Speaker, I would like to insert the following articles into the Record.           [lsqb]From the New York Times, Oct. 17, 2002[rsqb]U.S. Is Putting Heavy Pressure on France and Other Skeptics for a U.N.                                Resolution                         (By Steven R. Weisman)       The Bush administration is mounting a campaign of public      pressure and private diplomatic and economic concessions to      persuade France and other skeptical members of the United      Nations Security Council to go along with a single resolution      threatening military force against Iraq.       With rising concern in Washington that time is short for      passage of such a resolution--many experts say military      action would be easier in the winter--talks on the      resolution's wording are accelerating at the United Nations      and in meetings and telephone calls in and between capitals.      ``There's no sense that the French don't want to do this,``      an administration official said, referring to a tough United      Nations resolution on Iraq. ``But there is a growing      frustration that we don't yet have an agreement.''       President Jacques Chirac of France, in another sign of      disagreement with the United States, appeared in remarks      published today to take issue with President Bush's arguments      that Iraq is cultivating links with Al Qaeda and wants, as he      said on Monday, to use it as ``a forward army.''       ``As far as I know, no proof has been found, or at least      been made official, for a link between Iraq and Al Qaeda,''      Mr. Chirac said in the interview in the Beirut-based, French-     language newspaper L'Orient-Le Jour. ``Even if certain      terrorists could have been able to find refuge in Iraq, we      must not mix up the issues. The first objective of action by      the international community is Iraq, and that means      disarmament.''       Last month, Mr. Bush won praise, especially among war      opponents in Europe, for promising to go to the United      Nations for approval before taking military action against      Saddam Hussein's government in Baghdad.       But after intense discussions and a certain impatience in      Washington, now France, Russia and China--which have vetoes      on the Security Council--remain opposed to giving the      administration an automatic option to use force if Iraq fails      to comply with new weapons inspections.       France wants the United States to go to a second stage and      get later authorization for using force if Mr. Hussein      rebuffs the United Nations inspectors.       France, which has a history of going its own way in NATO      and maintains strong links to the Arab world, has emerged as      a bigger stumbling block than Russia or China, which do not      consider themselves American allies, administration officials      said.       American officials express confidence that if they can      persuade Mr. Chirac to go along with a single United Nations      resolution, Moscow and Beijing will follow suit by either      agreeing to it or not vetoing it.       At least so far, officials say, France is resisting an      administration proposal to have the resolution threaten      unspecified ``consequences,'' rather than a more explicit      reference to force, if the inspection process collapses.       Diplomats familiar with the negotiations said the Bush      Administration could interpret the word ``consequences'' as      tantamount to pre-approval for military action. At the same      time, they said Washington was offering private assurances      that the United States would not ignore the Security Council.       ``This could end up with something that is not a one-stage      or a two-stage process,'' said a diplomat familiar with the      talks. ``The word is that it will be one-and-a-half stages.''       ``The French really do want to be with us,'' a senior State      Department official said. ``The French are worried that if      the first resolution authorizes all necessary means to      enforce inspections, we might go to war without checking with      them. What they want is to keep the Security Council in the      picture. We believe that can be done in the context of one      resolution. That's our goal.''       In a sense, the negotiations at the United Nations are      running along the same lines as Mr. Bush's talks with      Congress over the last month.       The administration won support of skeptical lawmakers in      part because of personal assurances from Mr. Bush that      Congress would be consulted in the event of a war. Similarly,      the United States is making promises of consultation with      United Nations allies if a conflict occurs.       In the background are firm and even threatening words from      Mr. Bush, who declared today that the United Nations must      ``face up'' to the danger from the Hussein government.      ``Those who choose to live in denial may eventually be forced      to live in fear,'' he said at a ceremony at which he signed      the resolution passed by Congress last week authorizing the      use of force against Baghdad. A White House official said he      was not referring to any particular nation.       Mr. Chirac, who was in Alexandria, Egypt, today for the      beginning of a Middle East trip, reiterated his support for a      two-stage resolution process. He said the Security Council      should authorize force only as a last resort if the Iraqis      were not acting in good faith.       A separate drama is playing itself out behind the scenes,      some administration officials said. That is the role of      Secretary of State Colin L. Powell, who is the      administration's main advocate of diplomacy as a means to      address Iraq, rather than simply threats of force.       Vice President Dick Cheney and Secretary of Defense Donald      H. Rumsfeld are said to be most skeptical that diplomacy can      work. Their fear, according to officials, is that Mr. Hussein      can drag out the diplomatic and inspection process.       Mr. Rumsfeld and Mr. Cheney are also the ones demanding a      single resolution at the United Nations that explicitly      threatens force if the inspection route fails, officials      said.       They are also said to want a swift timetable for      inspections and additional measures, like armed escorts for      inspectors and removing Iraqi scientists and their families      from the country for interviews.       Diplomats in and out of the government say France wants to      see the United Nations play a continuing role so that the      French can remain part of the process.       ``The French want to look like they constrained or shaped      what the United States ends up doing,'' said Dennis Ross, the      former Middle East negotiator in the Clinton and first Bush      administrations. ``They want to be relevant and to make sure      that the Security Council remains relevant. But they don't      want to be left out if the United States goes to war.''       Many experts say France's potential economic interests in a      future Iraq are a factor in its wanting eventually to be on      the side of Washington if Mr. Hussein is overthrown. Russia      also has strong oil interests in Iraq.       ``Obviously French oil companies would want to be major      players in Iraqi oil fields and in the export and refining of      Iraqi oil in a post-Saddam Iraq,'' said Paul Sullivan, a      professor of economics at the National Defense University in      Washington. ``The French signed oil deals in Iraq, but these      deals cannot be implemented until after the sanctions against      Iraq are taken off.''       The Bush administration has gone out of its way to assure      Moscow that in the event of a ``regime change'' in Baghdad,      Russian interests will be looked after.       Recently Secretary Powell told the U.S.-Russia Business      Council that the United States fully understood Russia's      desire to play a role in Iraq's oil industry. ``We are taking      fully into account the interest of the nations in the region      and the economic impact such a transition might have on      them,'' he said.                                  ____                                             [lsqb]From the New York Times, Oct. 17, 2002[rsqb]                          Iraq States Its Case                         (By Mohammed Aldouri)       Mohammed Aldouri is the Iraqi ambassador to the United      Nations.       After so many years of fear from war, the threat of war and      suffering, the people of Iraq and their government in Baghdad      are eager for peace. We have no intention of attacking      anyone, now or in the future, with weapons of any kind. If we      are attacked, we will surely defend ourselves with all means      possible. But bear in mind that we have no nuclear or      biological or chemical weapons, and we have no intention of      acquiring them.       We are not asking the people of the United States or of any      member state of the United Nations to trust in our word, but      to send the weapons inspectors to our country to look      wherever they wish unconditionally. This means unconditional      access anywhere, including presidential sites in accordance      with     a 1998 signed agreement between Iraq and the United Nations--     an agreement that ensures respect for Iraq's sovereignty and      allows for transparency in the work of the inspectors. We      could never make this claim with such openness if we did not      ourselves know there is nothing to be found. Still, we      continue to read statements by officials of the United States      and the United Kingdom that it is not enough that Hans Blix,      head of the United Nations Monitoring, Verification and      Inspection Commission, and his team of inspectors have      unconditional access. They say this is because the Iraqi      government may be hiding weapons that will not be found, or      is moving weapons from place to place, or is developing new      weapons in roving vans or in underground locations.       The United Nations officials with whom our government has      worked on these matters know that these concerns have no      foundation. In December 1998, when the United Nations weapons      inspection team left Iraq on the orders of Richard Butler,      the chief United Nations arms inspector at the time, it had      exhausted all possibilities after seven years of repeatedly      examine all possible sites; only small discrepancies existed.       It is now widely conceded that Iraq possesses no nuclear      weapons and that we could not develop them without building      facilities that could be spotted by satellite. Since 1999, we      have allowed the International Atomic Energy Agency to visit      Iraq. If it wishes, it can inspect any building anywhere. The      agency's inspectors will find nothing untoward.       Scott Ritter, who led many United Nations inspections, has      said that he questions whether Iraq possesses biological      weapons. Mr. Ritter also has been on CNN in recent months      explaining that his inspection team destroyed plants that      could produce chemical weapons. If these plants were      reconstructed, Mr. Blix and his team would quickly find them      out. Building such weapons costs billions of dollars and      requires enormous facilities and huge power sources. The idea      that such projects could be moved around in trucks or stashed      away in presidential palaces stretches the bounds of      imagination.       It is my belief that the American people are not aware of      this history because, in my opinion of my government, no      American political figure has been seriously interested in      discussing these matters with our government. The United      Nations was created in 1945 to provide a forum for nations in      conflict to come together to work out their disagreements. It      was designed expressly for the purpose of making the use of      force an absolute last resort.       For more than 11 years, the people of Iraq suffered under      United Nations economic sanctions, which have been kept in      place largely by American influence. According to statistics      compiled by the Iraq Ministry of Health, these sanctions have      caused the death of more than 1.7 million of our citizens.      The embargo has been so severe that we have been prevented      from importing chemicals needed for our sewage, water and      sanitation facilities.       At the same time, the last three American presidents have      stated that these sanctions could not be lifted as long as      our president, Saddam Hussein, remains the nation's leader.       Iraq is not a threat to its neighbors. It certainly is not      a threat to the United States or any of its interests in the      Middle East. Once the United Nations inspection team comes      back into my country and gets up to speed, I am confident      that it will certify that Iraq has no weapons of mass      destruction--be they chemical, biological or nuclear. Such      certification we hope, will remove the shadow of war and help      restore peace between our nations.                               ____________________
