Senator Coleman has been one of the most diligent members of the Governmental Affairs Committee on this issue. He came to virtually every hearing we had throughout the August recess, starting on the very first hearing on July 30. He is a cosponsor of the bill. He helped to write many of its provisions. I am very grateful for his leadership and support, and I look forward to hearing his comments.
