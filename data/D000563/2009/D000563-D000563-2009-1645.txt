President, one of the nominations just confirmed was that of Ray LaHood, former Congressman from the State of Illinois who, by this action, will become our next Secretary of Transportation in the Obama Cabinet. It was my great honor to introduce Congressman LaHood to the Senate Commerce Committee yesterday, along with former House Republican Leader Bob Michel. I had asked President Obama to consider this nomination because of my high regard for Ray LaHood, both personally and politically.  We served together for many years. He has represented my hometown of Springfield. Despite our clear partisan differences, we have become not only fast friends but real allies. Ray LaHood is an extraordinary person. Born and raised in Peoria, IL, he served as a schoolteacher before coming to work for Bob Michel in Washington, where he served as his chief of staff. He then succeeded Bob Michel as a Congressman from the district which had Peoria as its major city and proceeded to represent large portions of north central Illinois and most of the former congressional district of former Congressman Abraham Lincoln.  Ray LaHood is a person whom I not only respect but like very much. His word is good. He is a hard worker. He has the right values and politics. When politics in Washington became so corrosive and divisive, Ray LaHood led an effort in the House to establish dialogue between Democrats and Republicans. When I have worked with him on issues such as the Abraham Lincoln Presidential Library in Springfield, the future of the 183rd Air National Guard unit in Springfield's capital airport, and a variety of other issues, I have found him to be hardworking, diligent, and committed to the public good.  I believe President Obama has made an extraordinarily good choice for Secretary of Transportation. It is a department which will be very busy because the new Recovery and Reinvestment Act understands that we need new bridges, roads, airports, and mass transit so that America's economy can get back on track and grow. Ray LaHood is a great person to be heading up that department.  His wife Kathy and family were with him yesterday before the Commerce Committee. They are a great group. He is very proud of his children and should be. They have done extraordinarily good things in their lives as well. I am glad we moved quickly on this nomination for Ray LaHood as Secretary of Transportation. I know he is probably following this proceeding, and I wish him the very best. I know he is going to be exceptional in his service not only to President Obama in the Cabinet but also to the United States of America.                          ____________________
