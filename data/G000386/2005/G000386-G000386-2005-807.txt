 President, reserving the right to object, and I will object, but I would like to take just 30 seconds to explain that there are problems with the Coal Act. They are within the jurisdiction of the Senate Finance Committee, and we ought to look at all these issues in the context of a comprehensive review and a comprehensive solution.  So I would see a piecemeal approach, as is being done now through the bankruptcy bill, as, first of all, intervening in the jurisdiction of the Finance Committee, which as chairman I should protect, and, secondly, making more difficult the comprehensive solutions that we ought to find. So I object.
