Speaker, I rise today to let the American people know about a growing concern with the public's access to Government information. Throughout our country's great history, the Government Printing Office has been the source of all printing done by all Federal agencies. Under title 44 of the United States Code, all agencies are required to use the Government Printing Office for their printing needs. However, over the years, more and more of the executive branch agencies have been doing their own in-house printing, circumventing the system and neglecting to make all Government documents available to the Depository Library System and thus breaking the channel of information to the American people.  At a recent hearing of the Senate Rules and Administration Committee, it was stated that more than half of all Government documents printed by executive agencies were never sent to depository libraries. Well over 50,000 documents have not been made available in the public domain.  It is important that people know just how serious this problem is. The Office of the Superintendent of Documents at the Government Printing Office recently issued a report on the extent of the problem which I am placing in the Congressional Record for all to read. We must not allow this loss of public information to continue and must get all Government documents to our Depository Library System.                Fugitive Documents: Scope and Solutions                        the scope of the problem       According to 44 U.S.C. Sec. 1902, ``Government      publications, except for those determined by their issuing      components to be required for official use only or for      strictly administrative or operational purposes which have no      public interest or educational value and publications      classified for reasons of national security, shall be made      available to depository libraries through the facilities of      the Superintendent of Documents for public information.''      Depository libraries make these publications available for      free use by the public. Traditionally, most Government      publications of general interest, including legislative,      regulatory, business, and consumer titles, as well as many      scientific and technical reports and studies, have been      distributed through the GPO's Federal Depository Library      Program (FDLP).       Many publications produced by the Government fail to be      included in the FDLP. Documents that belong in the Program,      but which are excluded, are known as fugitive documents.      Their absence from depository library collections impairs      effective public access to Government information.       Although no study has resulted in a definitive answer, we      estimate that more than 50 percent of all tangible Government      information products are not being made available to the      Federal Depository Library Program (FDLP). Of these, we      estimate that there are about 55,000 scientific and technical      documents and reports which are neither printed through GPO      nor furnished by the issuing agencies to the FDLP as required      by law. The issuing agencies do, however, provide either a      printed copy or an electronic image file of each of these      documents to the National Technical Information Service      (NTIS).       In FY 1996, NTIS took in about 160,000 scientific,      technical, and business-related titles, most but not all of      which were published by the Government. We estimate that      about 70 percent, or 112,000, of NTIS's total intake belongs      in the Program. Compared with the 57,000 titles in the FDLP      in FY 1996, this leaves at least 55,000 fugitive titles which      should have been provided to GPO by the publishing agencies,      NTIS provides bibliographic access to the publications it      takes in through its abstracting and indexing activities.      This makes them available to the public and to depository      libraries on an on-demand basis from NTIS, but at a      significant cost.       In addition, there is an unknown number of fugitives which      are primarily general, public interest materials produced by      agencies using avenues other than GPO. It is virtually      impossible to estimate the total number of these titles, but      they may well number in the thousands and include, but are      not limited to, the publications of Federal District Courts      and Courts of Appeal, Federal Election Commission financial      disclosure statements, and Library of Congress Congressional      Research Service reports.       Recently, four major factors have contributed to increasing      losses of key general interest publications to the FDLP.      These are: (1) electronic information dissemination via      agency Web sites without notification to the FDLP; (2) the      decreasing compliance with statutory requirements for      agencies to print through GPO or to provide copies of      publications not printed through GPO to the FDLP; (3) the      increasing trend for agencies to establish exclusive      arrangements with private sector entities that place      copyright or copyright-like restrictions on the products      involved in such agreements; and (4) increasing use by      agencies of language in 44 U.S.C. Sec. 1903 that permits      publications to be excluded if they are ``so-called      cooperative publications which must necessarily be sold in      order to be self-sustaining.''       Even in cases where the FDLP learns about such fugitive      general interest publications, extensive negotiations and      even Congressional intervention have proved necessary to      ensure compliance with the depository library provisions of      Title 44. The following list includes some particularly      egregious examples of failure to comply with statutory      requirements. It should be noted that OMB's Office of      Information and Regulatory Affairs (OIRA) has not provided      any significant assistance to GPO in detecting or resolving      these problems.                u.s. international air travel statistics       U.S. International Air Travel Statistics was published by      the Department of Transportation using data derived from the      Immigration and Naturalization Service and distributed to the      FDLP. In FY 1996, Congress transferred the collection and      dissemination of this data to the Department of Commerce's      International Trade Administration (ITA). According to ITA,      this publication is available for sale from ITA's Tourism      Industries office, is a self-sustaining publication not fully      funded by Federal monies, and is exempt from distribution to      the FDLP.             handbook of international economic statistics       For many years, this publications was printed and published      by the CIA as the Handbook of Economic Statistics, sold by      the Superintendent of Documents Sales Program and distributed      to the FDLP. After 1992, the CIA no longer made it available      to the sales or depository programs. It is now sold by NTIS      and paper copies are not being offered to the FDLP. The 1996      edition of the CIA's World Factbook CD-ROM includes an      electronic version of the Handbook, but for such standard      reference works, the preferred format for depository      distribution is paper.        precursor systems analyses of automated highway systems       This CD-ROM product is being sold by the Department of      Transportation and is not being provided to the FDLP.      Although the FDLP may be receiving some of the printed      reports that form the basis of the CD-ROM, it is probably not      receiving all of the data included.                            order now cd-rom       This NTIS CD-ROM product includes two years' worth of      abstracts and indexes not available elsewhere. NTIS has      expressed a willingness to make the CD-ROM available as a      benefit to the public and as a promotional tool for their      sales program, provided GPO paid the retrieval software fees,     but has stated that ``[a]t no time did we consider this to be      a question of compliance with Title 44,'' apparently based on      the fact that the publication in question is electronic      rather than print.            toxic substance act chemical substance inventory       The last material associated with this EPA product that was      received by the Depository Program was the 1990 Supplement to      the 1985 edition. It is now available exclusively through      NTIS. When contacted, EPA said that it supplied data to NTIS,      not a finished product, and for this reason was not      responsible for depository copies. NTIS has not furnished      copies for the Depository Library Program. creating a government that works better but costs less: status report                                  cd-rom       This series has been distributed by the Sales and      Depository Programs in print but the CD-ROM, which includes      additional information, is available only from NTIS. NTIS has      not responded to requests for depository copies.                   export administration regulations       Despite a request in writing to the Bureau of Export      Administration requesting a copy of this database for      mounting on GPO Access, the agency has not responded. The      agency has, however, entered into an exclusive distribution      agreement for both print and electronic versions of the EAR      with NTIS, and has paid NTIS to mount the database. A year      ago, the Superintendent of Documents wrote to Bruce McConnell      of OIRA to request an OMB review of the agreement between      NTIS and the Office of Export Administration but did not      receive a response. Several months of discussion with NTIS,      as well as intervention by the Joint Committee on Printing,      were required before NTIS agreed to provide print copies of      this product.                          big emerging markets       Developed by the International Trade Administration and      printed by a private firm in a joint venture with NTIS, this      product was originally offered to the FDLP in microfiche      format. This was unsuitable due to the presence of color      charts in the product. Only after several months of      discussion and Congressional pressure did NTIS provide print      copies.                journal of the national cancer institute       This periodical is now published by Oxford University Press      under the terms of a Cooperative Research and Development      Agreement (CRDA) with the National Cancer Institute (NCI).      Initially the FDLP was told by NCI that this arrangement      rendered the Journal a non-Government product, even though      editorial work is still being performed by NCI employees.      After NCI officials discussed the matter with the Joint      Committee on Printing, Oxford University Press agreed to      furnish depository copies. NCI has not, however, returned      calls made by FDLP for the purpose of setting up a mechanism      to accomplish this.      hispanics-latinos; diverse people in a multicultural society       This title was first published by a private sector trade      association based in Washington, DC. Although the data was      gathered and prepared at public expense it was provided to      this private group, which then copyrighted the publication      and sold it for $10 per copy. Because Hispanics-Latinos was      not printed through GPO, it was not initially available to      the Depository Program. When this situation was brought to      the attention of the Census Bureau through Senate Rules      Committee hearings, the Bureau reprinted the book through GPO      so depository copies would be available.              a nation of opportunity/kickstart initiative       The United States Advisory Council on the National      Information Infrastructure issued two reports that were      initially published by West Publishing, a major private      sector seller of legal publications and databases, although      they were prepared by the Commission at public expense.      Initially these publications were not made available to      either the Superintendent of Documents Sales or Depository      Programs.       Once the Joint Committee on Printing was apprised of this      situation it contacted the Commission. As a result, the      National Telecommunications and Information Administration of      the Department of Commerce reprinted the publications through      GPO in a much less elaborate black-and-white format and both      the Sales and Depository Programs acquired copies.   population of states and counties of the united states: 1790-1990       This Census publication was printed by NTIS rather than      through GPO. Through what was described by Census as a      ``handshake agreement,'' NTIS asked that Census not make this      publication available to either the Depository or Sales      Programs for the first six months so as not to hurt its      exclusive sale by NTIS. As a result of Senate Rules Committee      hearings, GPO obtained a copy from Census shortly after its      publication by NTIS. The Depository Program printed copies      for its use and Sales acquired copies for sale to the public.              solutions to the fugitive documents problem       Since nearly all fugitives involve titles not printed or      procured through GPO, the simplest and most cost-effective      solution would be for agencies to obtain all of their      tangible information products through GPO. This would afford      the FDLP the opportunity to ride for depository copies. Any      agencies not obtaining their information products through GPO      would be in compliance with Sec. 1903 if:       The agency provides the requisite depository copies to the      FDLP, free of any encumbrances such as software licensing      fees or copyright-like restrictions       In the case of online services, the agency provides no-fee      access to the FDLP                        the costs of compliance       If delivered to the Superintendent of Documents (SoD) in      print format, these formerly fugitive titles would represent      a significant new workload that neither the SoD or the      libraries in the FDLP have adequate resources to handle. We      estimate that, based on the current mix of paper, microfiche,      and electronic formats being disseminated by the FDLP,      providing these fugitives in a similar mix would increase      costs by approximately $8 million. This, however, is an      unlikely scenario.       In our view, it is more plausible that the migration of      printing of electronic publishing already in evidence will      continue to grow. This scenario provides a unique opportunity      to bring additional information into the FDLP for no-fee      public use. When the source information is in electronic      format, the agency can either make it available on their own      Internet Web site, or can ask GPO to make it available via      the GPO Access service. Either of these approaches would      enable the FDLP to provide more information to the public,      while limiting the increased costs to the Government. In this      scenario, the projected decline in the amount of printed      material would gradually reduce the costs to the Program.       When an agency publishes via the Web, the major SoD cost      increases are for the provision of cataloging and locator      services so users can find the information; and for permanent      access services to ensure that the electronic content is      maintained for use in the future. We believe that these costs      should be funded out of the SoD appropriation. If an agency      provides electronic content for disseminating via GPO Access,      there will be costs associated with processing that      information and mounting it on the system. These      ``developmental'' costs may be borne by the originating      agency, by the SoD, or by a combination of the parties. In      any case, we would expect some cost savings to the Government      and the SoD from this electronic approach when compared to      the all-print scenario.       A low-cost solution for the FDLP may be at hand which would      make the scientific and technical information held by NTIS      available on a no-fee basis to depository libraries through      the use of electronic imaging technology. We are presently      participating in a pilot project whereby NTIS will provide      depository libraries access to these image files at no cost.      At issue that still needs to be resolved is that NTIS is      considering restrictions on the redissemination of these      files by depository libraries to prevent any adverse effect      on NTIS sales. Before the NTIS solution can be viewed as a      workable approach for large quantities of fugitive      information, NTIS' copyright-like restriction on      redissemination of the electronic version of the information      must be eliminated.       In addition, it is critical that any revision of Title 44      make clear that an agency's obligation to provide their      information to the FDLP is not overtaken by other      requirements, including any mandate to operate on a self-     sustaining or cost-recovery basis. For example, when an      agency charges users for access to Government information at      its Web site, there needs to be statutory language that      clearly directs the agency to provide no-fee depository      access.       Revisions to Chapter 19 of Title 44 must also provide for      advance notification of the FDLP by agencies when information      products are initiated, modified, or terminated on agency Web      sites, define Government information products so as to      include in the FDLP any publications produced under      agreements with private sector entities, and delete the      current exemption for ``cooperative publications.''                               ____________________
