 President, I am introducing today for Senator Helms and myself legislation to help the Administration better understand the importance of representing the US national interest. I am sending to the desk a bill on additional considerations for assessment of cooperation of foreign countries with United States counter-drug efforts. The purpose of this bill is to help the Administration get its act together when it comes to the certification process on illegal drugs. Recent statements by the Drug Czar and other Administration officials on certification, along with their actions in regard to such countries as Syria and Iran, show that they may have misplaced US national interests when it comes to drug policy. I want to help them find it again.  Over a decade ago, Congress passed measures in the Foreign Assistance Act that require US Administrations to certify whether other countries are taking serious steps to deal with major illegal drug production or trafficking in their territories. The view behind this legislation was to force an accounting, at least once a year, of what the US and other countries were doing to address a major foreign policy concern that, in the view of Congress, governments here and abroad would justas soon have ignored. Administrations do not like accounting for themselves. Not many foreign countries welcome it either. They would prefer that legislatures and the public give them the money and approval they want with no questions asked. It's less troubling than having to explain actions, account for shortfalls, or demonstrate that the money being provided is achieving anything. Congress, however, thinks differently. It should and it must, in my view.  Today, the Clinton Administration, like its predecessors, is trying both to ignore certification as a genuine responsibility and to undo it where it can. It has made efforts to get Congress to scuttle the requirement. It has poor-mouthed the idea internationally while denying it has done so. It has resorted to lawerly gimmicks and low tricks to drop from certification some of the worst countries imaginable. And lately it has been trying to broaden, as it says, the evaluation and accountability process in the Western Hemisphere to make it fairer by participating with the Organization of American States in the creation of what is called the Multinational Evaluation Mechanism (MEM). This is a subterfuge for trying to get rid of the process by calling it something else. Given this Administration's poor performance on international drug control, I am not surprised at an effort to disguise shortcomings in some artful bureaucratic way. I am not surprised, but I am disappointed.  As part of the effort to discredit certification, the Administration has resorted to distortions and misrepresentations about what it involves and has enlisted a set of arguments that, while sounding plausible, are really little more than the old magician's trick of ``watch the birdie'' while hoping that you will not notice what he is really doing with his other hand. Well, we deserve better than sleight-of-hand on an issue as important as this one. I thought it might be useful to provide an antidote to these shenanigans with a few home truths.  There are many arguments advanced against certification, and I have addressed many of these in earlier statements on this floor, but the best one argues that while certification may once have been  useful--time unspecified--it has served its purpose and is counter-productive because it hampers further cooperation with other countries that resent being subject to a unilateral, U.S. judgment of their performance. Mexico is often advanced as an example. This view is fine if you are working from the idea--which seems to be so much of the philosophy behind our present foreign policy--that we should be guided by everyone in the world's interests before our own or in spite of our own.  Now, I have no doubt that other countries resent being evaluated. In my experience, they resent being evaluated by any individual country or collectively. This is not new, whether we are talking drugs or policies on intellectual properties or nuclear proliferation. And I am sure that this resentment over being judged can complicate negotiations. Both these points, however, are irrelevant to the circumstances under consideration. As a matter of our national interest, we are obliged to make judgments about the actions of other countries whether they like it or not. Let me try to make this point clearer in a different context.  The United States is currently embroiled in a controversy with the European Union over rules governing the importation of bananas. I am not going to comment on the merits of the particulars of the case, apart from noting that the United States, the present Administration, has determined--has judged--that EU restrictions, quotas, and preferences on the importation of bananas are unfair and prejudicial. This, folks, is an evaluation. And it is one deeply resented in Europe, as an infringement of the rights of not just one country but of an association of many countries, which happen to be our major allies. Nevertheless, the Administration is prepared to pursue the case in the teeth of this resentment to force a change it wants. And in doing this it is prepared to invoke sanctions to achieve its goals.  Similarly, the Administration is prepared to condemn a gaggle of other countries for permitting the pirating of various intellectual properties, such as books, videos, and copyrighted products. It is prepared to pursue sanctions to achieve a remedy. I can extend this list to judgments about states that support terrorism or are engaged in systematic human rights abuses. This Administration involved this country in a major military engagement--the ultimate sanction--to stop what it regarded as gross violations of human rights. I have no doubt that Slobodan Milosevic and his cronies deeply resented U.S. judgments about the fitness of his actions and even more objected to the steps we took to change his behavior. I do not detect that this resentment at being judged or the knowledge that there were objections to the actions then taken based on that judgment carried any weight in the decisions made by this Administration to bomb and strafe military and civilian targets in the former Yugoslavia.  What these examples show is that even this Administration understands, when it wants to, that there are matters of such import requiring judgments about the actions of other countries and involving responses based on those judgments that resentment or objections by others do not signify when it comes to deciding what we should do to protect interests we regard as important. Now, certification only requires that we make the involvement of other countries in the production and transit of illegal drugs--which kill more Americans every year that all the terrorists have in the last ten years or more than Mr. Milosevic did at any time--a matter of judgment and possible action of a degree at least as important as bananas. I happen to believe that judgments about drugs coming to the U.S. are at least as much in our interest as judgments about bananas going to Europe.  I am puzzled by the Administration's reluctance to apply meaningful standards of judgment to the actions of other countries when it comes to drug policy. I am further puzzled by its willingness to be so moved by the resentment of other countries when it comes to judgments about drug policies and programs. The requirements in the law are not written in some mysterious dialect nor apply unfamiliar concepts. The idea is not so alien to our experience or even to this Administration's own actions as to be beyond comprehension. Yet, the Administration seems to have its own sources of bemusement when it comes to taking this issue seriously.  In essence, what the law requires is that the Administration determine first whether countries are major producing or transit areas for illegal drugs. You would not think this terribly difficult or controversial, or too intrusive on the feelings of others. It then asks for the Administration to determine whether these countries are acting in good faith to enforce their own domestic laws against these practices; are acting in conformity with any bilateral agreements with the United States to address these activities; or are doing what is reasonable and responsible to do in light of international law that governs the conduct of all countries on this issue. I am hard pressed to see how this infringes on the sovereignty of other countries or what in it is so outrageous as to occasion abandonment of the effort.  The law then requires that if, in the judgment of the Administration, any given country is not acting in good faith, it may then be subject to sanctions. The law does not require that the efforts of another country be successful in order to be certified. It does not require that judgments be without consideration of other national interests. It does ask, on this very important question, that the Administration supply to Congress and the American people at least once a year its considered opinion of whether other countries where a truly pernicious practice is being engaged in that affects directly the lives of U.S. citizens each and every day are, as a matter of fact, doing all that is reasonable to stop this practice. It then requires that if these countries are receiving U.S. assistance--that is, money from U.S. taxpayers--that this money be cut off--unless it is humanitarian aid or this self-same counter-drug assistance.  While I understand perfectly why an aid recipient might squawk, I do not know what act of imagination it requires to manufacture outrage on behalf of other countries threatened withlosing this assistance because in our judgment they are doing less than their best to cooperate with us. But that outrage is trotted out as an argument against certification. That aside, the most onerous part of the certification decision, and what other countries truly object to, is what world opinion makes of a U.S. judgment that a particular country is not cooperating with U.S. and international efforts to stop drug production or trafficking. What the Administration would have us do is forgo this judgment lest it hurt the feels of other countries. And yet, it is this judgment or the threat of it that has, in fact, been the primary impetus to encourage the very cooperation that the Administration says we do not need the certification process to achieve.  What the Administration would really like to do is to stop accounting to Congress and the public for its international drug policy. It knows that this is a non-starter. So it has proposed instead to bury this accountability in an elaborate ruse in cooperation with the OAS to neuter the process. In doing this, it has helped to devise through the OAS a list of over 80 evaluation items to help in developing a so-called multinational evaluative mechanism. There are, of course, no teeth in the evaluation  process, and each of the member states involved has an effective veto over any adverse judgments of their respective efforts. In this regard, I am reminded of the inhabitants of Garrison Keiller's Lake Wobegon, where all the children are above average. The details behind the evaluation are to be kept confidential, which is okay since no one has much faith in the ability of most of the countries party to the evaluation to actually collect and evaluate the information in the first place. The countries involved lack the necessary reporting mechanisms, the budgets to sustain them, or the staffs to ensure ongoing, consistent information. This farrago is then supposed, gradually, to substitute for certification, somehow being fairer and more likely to ensure cooperation.  Ironically, the premise underlying this process is the same as that informing certification, that is, that a judgment about performance does need to be made. The difference here is that somehow a multilateral judgment would be better, and it wouldn't be offensive since it would be collaborative. In my view, it won't be offensive because it won't be effective. You can make what you want to of a process that is supposed to involve judgments about the effectiveness of actions that are designed not to offend anyone being judged. But I am not reassured. And if this is the face of cooperation, then we are in for some rude shocks in our international relations.  Having said this, I am prepared to help the Administration in its efforts. In order to give the Multinational Evaluation Mechanism some chance of effective implementation, I am, along with Senator Helms, today introducing legislation that would require that in future certification decisions the Administration incorporate the MEM as part of its deliberations in determining whether to certify other countries or not. Taking the Administration at its word that the mechanism is not an attempt to replace certification, but rather an effort to complement it, I offer this bill to enhance the process.                                 ______                                       By
