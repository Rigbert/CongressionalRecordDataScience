 President, the Congress has wisely passed and will send to the President for signature H.R. 4733, the energy and water development appropriations bill for fiscal year 2001. I strongly urge the President to sign this vital legislation.  Proper management of our Nation's rivers is a concern for many Americans. Our rivers provide us drinking water, transportation, and recreation. They also provide habitat for aquatic life, wildlife, and birds. Good management techniques provide that all of these purposes are taken into account and managed appropriately and fairly. I firmly believe that H.R. 4733 provides for good river management. Specifically, section 103 prohibits the use of funds to revise the Missouri River Master Water Control Manual if the revision provides for increases in springtime water releases during springN O T I C EEffective January 1, 2001, the subscription price of the Congressional Record will be $393 per year or $197 for six months. Individual issues may be purchased for $4.00 per copy. The cost for the microfiche edition will remain $141 per year with single copies remaining $1.50 per issue. This price increase is necessary based upon the cost of printing and distribution.                                                              Michael F. DiMario, Public Printerheavy rainfall or snow melt. Many Iowans see this as just good common sense.  Increased spring water releases could easily cause the wild Missouri, and its many tributaries, to once again flood low-lying areas, including farmland and communities. Floods would cause a severe economic hardship on those affected. Farmers would be unable to plant crops, and home and business owners would experience property damage. Economic activity in the flood areas would decrease or cease during and immediately after the flooding, causing a loss of income for those impacted.  Many Americans forget what it was like to live along the Missouri prior to the construction of the dams. They forgot that the Missouri was truly wild. They forgot what it was like not to be able to safely plant your crops, grow them with some security that there would not be summer floods, and then be able to harvest them safely. They forgot what it was like to lose all or part of a crop. That meant the loss of your investment in time, labor, seed and other inputs. And that meant no income coming in after the harvest.  The folks in town were hurt, too. Houses and businesses were swept away. Basements were flooded with water, muck and other debris. Sometimes the water level went higher than that to the first floor, or even higher. Furniture and family keepsakes were destroyed. Businesses lost inventories. They could not serve their customers if the store was closed. Public drinking water system suffered damage, as did sewer systems. The economic devastation was high. The quality of life suffered. Increased spring water releases would also cause less water to be released during the summer months. The lower river levels would halt river barge transportation. Barges are a key part of the agricultural transportation system. Loss of barge traffic would delivery the western part of America's great grain belt into the monopolistic hands of the rail roads. Iowa farmers have clearly told me that this is unacceptable.  Loss of the use of barges to transport agricultural commodities will drive up farm transportation prices. That in turn will drive up the overall price of our agricultural goods that must compete in the international marketplace. This is unfair to our hardworking farmers, as it puts them in jeopardy of losing markets.  While the farm crops travel down-river to reach markets, the loss of barge traffic would also affect bulk commodities and other items that travel up-river to Iowa. They include fertilizer for farm use, salt for highways in winter, steel for processing plants, and the like. The potential for moving cement for construction purposes would also be lost with lower summer water levels. I have talked to many Iowans who live along the Missouri River. They have told me of the devastation left from past floods. That devastation was more than economic. It produced heartache and broken dreams. Though Iowans are a strong people, the past floods have left their scars on individuals and in community life. Those Iowans have joined together on a nonpartisan basis to say, ``No more floods!'' That is the message for the President to consider as he deliberates on the energy and water appropriations bill. The President is in a powerful position to either do good or to inflict harm. It is almost as if he were actually God, able to exercise the power to flood or not to flood. That is how powerful he is on this issue. It is an awesome power that I hope that he uses wisely. It is my hope that he will decide to prevent flooding. It is my hope that he will listen to our farmers and not make their jobs more difficult than they already are. It is my hope that he will sign this bill.  Mr. President, let the people live in their homes, work in their businesses and farm their farms in safety.  Clearly, the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service has violated Federal law in its ordering of the Corps of Engineers to begin a spring flood. It ignored the process set forth in the Endangered Species Act. These processes are there to protect everyone, and they were not followed. It has also based much of its opinion on speculation, not facts. The President must depend upon facts and protect due process. H.R. 4733 is good legislation which should be signed into law. It does not deserve a veto. Mr. President, please sign this important legislation.  President Clinton, one time, in private conversation with me, you told me how you understood the problems of the farmers more than most Presidents ever did because you had studied them so much.  Mr. President, you have been in the White House 8 years. I do not know how long it has been since you have visited a supermarket. But remember, food grows on farms, it does not grow in supermarkets. You have an opportunity here to help the farmers in the States of Iowa, Nebraska, Kansas, and Missouri to be able to put their crops in in the spring, to be able to take those crops out in the fall, to be able to ship the harvest down the river when it is most needed, so that the farmers are not the captives of a monopolistic railroad if the barge traffic isn't there for competition.  So, Mr. President, show us that you do, in fact, understand the problems of the farmers and sign this legislation.  Mr. President, I yield the floor and suggest the absence of a quorum.
