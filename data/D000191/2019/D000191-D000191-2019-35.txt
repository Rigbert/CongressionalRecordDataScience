Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.  Mr. Speaker, just in quick response to the gentleman, as I pointed out earlier, first off, the immigrants attempting to come to the United States seeking asylum or otherwise are walking up to border control points. They are not sneaking across the desert. Building a wall will do nothing.  As I pointed out earlier, drugs are not being smuggled in backpacks through the desert. We know they are coming by sea, and we know they are coming through our border control points; and we know we don't have the technology nor the personnel necessary to stop them.  Mr. Speaker, I yield 2\1/2\ minutes to the gentlewoman from Florida (Ms. Wasserman Schultz).
