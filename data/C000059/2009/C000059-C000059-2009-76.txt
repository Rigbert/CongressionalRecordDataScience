. 2647, the National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year, 2010.  Requesting Member: Congressman Ken Calvert  Bill Number: H.R. 2647  Account: Navy Research and Development--0604215N  Legal Name of Requesting Entity: U.S. Navy; Naval Surface Warfare Center, Corona Division  Address of Requesting Entity: Naval Surface Warfare Center, Corona Division, Corona, CA 92878-5000  Description of Request: I have secured $2,000,000 for the Measurement Standards Research and Development Program. The program includes testing for electro-optic and night vision systems; chem/bio and radiation detection systems; advanced sensor technologies; nano-technology. It also provides for improved and state of the art measurement calibration systems that ensure an accurate traceability of measurement from the weapon system parameter to National Standards maintained at NIST. Without adequate measurement capability, verification of performance for weapon and detection system readiness is not possible. This project results in the development of the measurement standards and calibration systems necessary to provide traceable measurements. These state-of-the-art measurements standards often reside at NIST and thus provide benefit to other federal agencies and industry as well. This project allows the Navy to make correct test decisions that ensure mission success and safety while reducing the cost of unnecessary rework. Substantial cost savings have resulted from past R&D projects funding through this program.  Requesting Member: Congressman Ken Calvert  Bill Number: H.R. 2647  Account: Army Research and Development--0602787A  Legal Name of Requesting Entity: Air Force Office of Scientific Research  Address of Requesting Entity: 801 N. Randolph Street, Arlington, VA 22203  Description of Request: I have secured 3,000,000 for the Military Photomedicine Program. Photomedicine is an emerging field of biomedical research that shows considerable promise in the ability to address many priority military medical problems, including treatment of drug resistant infections, light activated repair of severed nerves and blood vessels, non-invasive critical care monitors for hemorrhagic shock and compartment syndrome, self directed needles for vascular access, sealing of penetrating eye injuries, early detection of Traumatic Brain Injury (TBI), biopsy imaging without tissue removal for airway injury from smoke or chemical agent inhalation, real time imaging of tissue circulation for wound management and reconstructive surgery, and targeted accelerated wound healing. Through peer reviewed, competitive grant funding this program supports teams of scientists and health care professionals at academic centers in collaborations with DoD medical laboratories in the development of technologies identified by DoD as important to military personnel, with a specific focus on the wounded warrior priorities identified in the Department's Guidance for Development of the Force FY 2010-2015 document.  Requesting Member: Congressman Ken Calvert  Bill Number: H.R. 2647  Account: Military Construction; Air Force Reserve  Legal Name of Requesting Entity: March Air Reserve Base  Address of Requesting Entity: March Air Reserve Base, Riverside, California 92518-2166  Description of Request: I have secured $9,800,000 for the March Air Reserve Base Small Arms Firing Range. The funds would be used to construct an adequately sized and configured small arms firing range which is required for training and maintaining the standard of current Air Force preparedness. The project also includes office space, classrooms, and equipment with fire protection and security alarm, lightning protection and explosion proof electrical which would bring the facility up to current force protection standards. The existing firing range was built in 1942 and is sub standard as a training facility. It is located approximately 5 miles away from March ARB and creates security, safety, and health and maintenance problems. Without funding the current facility will deteriorate further and will not be able to meet the training and readiness requirements of the base. Security, health and safety will be a concern and may cause the existing firing range to shut down. The range closure will seriously impact the small arm training, Force Protection and Personnel Combat Arms requirement for Reserve and National Guard units.  Requesting Member: Congressman Ken Calvert  Bill Number: H.R. 2647  Account: Navy Operations and Maintenance--BA03-1804N  Legal Name of Requesting Entity: U.S. Naval Sea Cadet Corps  Address of Requesting Entity: U.S. Naval Sea Cadet Corps; 2300 Wilson Blvd, North; Arlington, VA 22201-3308  Description of Request: I have secured $650,600 for the U.S. Naval Sea Cadet Program. The Sea Cadet Program is focused upon development of youth ages 11-17, serving almost 9,000 Sea Cadets and adult volunteers in 387 units country-wide. It promotes interest and skill in seamanship and aviation and instills qualities that mold strong moral character in an anti-drug and anti-gang environment. Summer training onboard Navy and Coast Guard ships and shore stations is a challenging training ground for developing self-confidence and self-discipline, promotion of high standards of conduct and performance and a sense of teamwork. Funds will be utilized to ``buy down'' the out-of-pocket expenses for training to $120/week. NSCC instills in every Cadet a sense of patriotism, courage and the foundation of personal honor. A significant percent of Cadets join the Armed Services often receiving accelerated advancement, or obtain commissions. The program has significance in assisting to promote the Navy and Coast Guard, particularly in those areas of the U.S. where these Services have little presence.                          ____________________
