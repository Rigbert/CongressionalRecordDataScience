President, I want to thank the senior Senator from Illinois for what he said about my dear friend Senator Wendell Ford.  I was fortunate to come here to the Senate the same year that Senator Ford did. We were different in age, and I must say, different in experience. He had a lot more experience than I did, and I relied on his experience and his help. We traveled together, and we talked together so often. He had the unfailing characteristic of the best of the Senators--both Republicans and Democrats. He always kept his word. He was always very honest and direct with you. If he made a commitment, you could go to the bank with it.  I remember the night we had a dinner for his retirement. There was a dozen of us that came in that year. There were only four left and three were retiring that night--Wendell Ford, John Glen, and Dale Bumpers. It was wonderful to listen to the three of them reminisce about the Senate.  I said to Wendell Ford at that time: Save me a seat on that lifeboat as you are leaving. I thought how lonely it would be without him. Fortunately, I have a good friend like the senior Senator from Illinois to fill the void.  But Wendell Ford had probably more knowledge and sense of politics--not just knowledge but sense--of how to work things out, how to get liberals and conservatives, Republicans and Democrats together, than most people ever have.  He had a raspy voice, but he was good natured, with a sense of humor. And when I go back through the people I have met, the 300 or more Senators I have had the opportunity to serve with, I think of Wendell Ford as one who epitomizes what a Senator should be.  I had talked to him just a few months ago. I will speak more about him later on, but I think the Senator from Illinois has given probably as good a description of this wonderful man as any of the rest of us might, and I thank him for that.  I yield the floor.                              Quorum Call  I suggest the absence of a quorum.
