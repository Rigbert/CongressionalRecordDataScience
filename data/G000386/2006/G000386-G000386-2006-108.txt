 President, it gives me great pleasure to pay tribute to 16 outstanding scholars who have recently been announced as 2006 Davidson fellows. The Davidson Institute scholarships promote and reward students under 18 years old who have undertaken invaluable projects and studies for the greater good of our country and the world. These individuals are more than deserving of this great honor. Allow me to introduce each of the scholars and describe a bit about them and their projects.  At the age of 12, Drew Petersen, of Oradell, NJ, is the youngest student ever accepted into the Manhattan School of Music Conducting Program. He hopes to become a performing pianist, composer, and conductor. Drew's project is entitled ``Keeping Classical Music Alive.'' He hopes that he can reach audiences through his piano performances and inspire them to become more active and engaged listeners in all areas of their lives.  Shivani Sud, a 16-year-old from Durham, NC, discovered a technology to deliver chemotherapeutic molecules to cancerous cells with increased efficiency. Her project is entitled ``HIV-1 Tat and IGK-Chain Secretion Based Protein Transduction: a Novel Strategy for Molecule Delivery.'' Shivani's research can help combat cancer and infectious diseases through more effective chemotherapy treatments. A senior at Jordan High School, Shivani hopes to eventually perform research in the field of medicine as a physician scientist.  Heather Engebretson is a 16-year-old from Tuscaloosa, AL, who views music as a method of communication and a tool for social progress. Heather's portfolio, ``Music as a Universal Communication,'' showcases her wide range of prestigiously awarded musical talents. Heather will attend the University of Alabama this fall majoring in vocal performance, in hopes that the combination of this experience and the courses she has taken through the Johns Hopkins distance learning program will help her in someday fulfilling her dream of becoming an opera singer.  The discoveries of 17-year-old Michael Viscardi from San Diego, CA, can potentially aid in next-generation aircraft design, aerodynamics, medical imaging, astronomy, heat flow and fluid dynamics. Michael's project, ``On the Solution of the Dirichlet Problem with Rational Holomorphic Boundary Data,'' portrays his solution of the thermal equilibrium of a heated metal plate. Michael will attend Harvard and the New England Conservatory in the fall, majoring in mathematics and violin performance respectively, and I have no doubt that he has the potential to become both a successful mathematics professor and a professional violinist.  As a 17-year-old woman from Austin, TX, Stephanie Chen has already established herself as an award-winning musician. Stephanie explores each piece in her piano portfolio, ``A Musical Painting,'' by creating images in her mind then, in her performance, conveying this passion to the audience. Stephanie is entering her senior year at Westwood High School and would like to pursue medical studies in college and play the piano professionally.  Kyle Dacuyan is a 16-year-old young man from Sterling, VA, with a passion for writing. Kyle illustrates that he is able to empathize with other viewpoints throughout his portfolio entitled ``What Have You Been, Where Have You Gone.'' Kyle's work examines familial relationships, complexities and oddities, and exhibits his unflinchingly honest look at pride, love, and social class. As he enters his senior year at Potomac Falls High School, Kyle hopes to continue his lifelong passion for writing through his pursuit of college degrees in English and writing. Kyle also hopes to someday teach at the college level.  Seventeen-year-old Varun Kumar, of Bellaire, TX, is determined to improve diagnostics in the field of medicine through more effective magnetic resonance imaging, MRI. The implications of Varun's research, found in his portfolio entitled ``Novel Properties in Europium DOTA--tetramide Complex for use in MRI Contrast Agent,'' could provide a more comprehensive and less invasive form of diagnosis in almost every field of medicine. Varun is a recent graduate of Bellaire High School and will be attending Rice University in the fall. He plans to major in biochemistry and pursue a career in medicine or medical research, and I wish him the very best of luck.  Sheela Krishnan is a 17-year-old young woman from Suffren, NY, who analyzed Paenicbacillus larvae, the bacterium that causes American foulbrood disease, AFB, a fatal disease that attacks honeybee larvae. Sheela created a safe, non-invasive and inexpensive preventative measure to protect honeybees in vivo from AFB. Sheela portrays her work in her portfolio entitled ``Isolation and Characterization of a Potential Probiotic Cocktail for the Control of American Foulbrood in Domestic Honeybees.'' Sheela is a recent high school graduate and will be attending Brown University as a member of the 8-year liberal medical education program. She hopes to major in both anthropology and biology and then go on to become a doctor.  The research of 17-year-old Adam Solomon, of Bellmore, NY, can help unlock clues about stellar evolution and formation, the history of our galaxy, and the formation of planetary systems. Displayed in his portfolio entitled ``The Effects of Age on Brown Dwarf Spectral Features in the Near-Infrared'' is Adam's creation of an analytical tool for estimating a brown dwarf's age and mass. Adam will attend Yale University where he plans to major in astronomy and physics and hopes to move on to the University of Cambridge for a master's then on to Caltech or Harvard for a doctorate degree.  At the age of 17, Yi Sun, of San Jose, CA, applied combinatorial mathematics to derive a formula for the expected winding number of a random walk on a unit lattice. Scientists can use this research to predict how many times the polymer will coil around an obstacle, or rod, thus, indicating the strength of the polymer. Yi's astounding research is displayed in his portfolio entitled, ``Combinatorics: On the Expected Winding Number of a Random Walk on the Unit Lattice,'' and can be used in physics, computer science and material science. Yi recently graduated from The Harker School and will be attending Harvard in the fall. Yi plans to major in mathematics and physics and hopes to pursue careers in both fields.  Thirteen-year-old Travis Johnson, of Milwaukie, OR, has been studying classical guitar since he was 8. Travis is establishing himself as an award-winning musician, and his portfolio is entitled ``Trails of Hope: The Importance of Adding New Music to the Classical Repertoire.'' Travis is currently home-schooled and taught privately by teachers outside of the home. He studies music at Marylhurst University. Master guitar classes have played a large role in his life the past few years, and likely will play a role in his career ambition to become a classical guitarist.  Albert Shieh is a 16-year-old young man from Paradise Valley, AZ, who created a computational tool used to analyze genetic sequence variability in humans, which will help in developing a better understanding of gene sequence variations that occur when a single nucleotide in the genome sequence is altered. Albert's research portfolio, ``A Novel Algorithm for Automated SNP Genotyping,'' holds the promise to find the genetic basis for Alzheimer's disease, autism, and bipolar disorder with highly targeted, personalized treatments. Albert recently graduated from Chaparral High School and will attend Harvard in the fall and major in mathematics. Albert aspires to have a career as an intellectual property lawyer.  Anna Stalker, a 15-year-old young woman from Birmingham, AL, addresses the persistent search for truth through different literary expressions and experiences in her portfolio, ``The Reincarnation Journals.'' In imagistic works, Anna explores the search for truth and beauty through depictions of human interaction and the interactions of the larger cosmos. When Anna's individual pieces are gathered, a larger meaning emerges. Entering her junior year at The Alamont School, Anna's main source of academic and social enrichment is the Duke Talent Identification Program, TIP. Although she has no concrete career goals yet, she is sure of one thing--she wants her life to be a meaningful reflection of her passions.  A 17-year-old young woman from Beaverton, OR, Anarghya Vardhana worked in the field of number theory to develop new starting values for the Lucas-Lehmer primality test. Her theorem/method, found in her portfolio entitled ``Novel Method of Computing Jacobi Symbols for Mersenne Numbers,'' can directly contribute to the pharmaceutical, chemical, materials, financial and information technology industries. Her theory also has broad implications in cryptography, specifically enhancing encryption systems to protect against identity theft. A recent high school graduate, Anarghya will attend Stanford University in the fall, and is leaning towards a major in physics or biology combined with a math major or minor.  Xin--Cindy--Wang is a 17-year-old from Geneva, IL, and is a recent graduate of the Illinois Math and Science Academy. Displayed in her portfolio, ``nm2608A, A New Naturally Arising Mouse Model for Human Autosomal Recessive Achromatopsia 2,'' is Xin's identification of a gene responsible for complete colorblindness in mice. Spanning genetics and ophthalmology, her results may one day be used to help people with achromatopsia 2, the most severe form of colorblindness, in which people can only see in shades of gray. I wish Xin much luck as she begins attending Harvard in the fall, where she will be working towards a major in a biology-related field and becoming a college professor.  At the age of 16, Steven Wu, of Folsom, CA, is contributing to the scientific world in a major way. Steven designed a computer simulation algorithm that produces superior results when compared with the current commercial software in terms of better simulation of ion movement due to more accurate electrical field data. Steven's project is entitled ``Optimizing Quadruple Ion Trap Geometry by Computer Simulations.'' Advancements in ion trap geometry can improve all areas of laboratory science through mass spectrometry, as well as better monitoring of atmospheric pollutants and detecting hazardous chemical substances. Steven will be a senior at Mira Loma High School this fall. He plans to major in biomedical engineering/bioengineering, combining his interests in biochemistry and mathematics and eventually become a research physician/scientist.  As I said, these young men and women are more than deserving of the awards they have earned. Through hard work and determination, these individuals have already made changes in the fields of science, writing, and mathematics, which will no doubt improve the lives of the many others all over the world. As the President indicated in his State of the Union address, our country's future competitiveness in the global economy will depend on bright and promising young people. Learning about these 16 remarkable students makes me optimistic about our Nation's future. I thank the Davidson Institute for their efforts to encourage and nurture our future leaders in a variety of fields and I thank these young and talented scholars for all of their innovative contributions to society.                          ____________________
