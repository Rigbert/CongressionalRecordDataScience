  Mr. DeFAZIO. Well, we're hearing the howls from the Republican side. Their fat-cat supporters might be forced to pay a fair share of taxes in the future, millionaires and billionaires who today are paying taxes at a rate less than that of your average schoolteacher or an Army captain. They say that that's the secret for a strong economy. Those hedge fund managers on Wall Street are doing such a great job, the people who brought us the financial meltdown for the United States of America that's hurting average people while these people are still cruising in their yachts and building their seventh and eighth homes in exotic places around the world. They need those tax cuts. That's the nostrum for a failing economy: tax cuts, tax cuts, tax cuts for rich people.  No, how about tax fairness and how about dealing with a sea of red ink in this country. You can't do it without asking the wealthiest among us to pay their fair share. And restoring some programs that are important to the middle class. Yeah, that's right. The rich people don't need roads that are up to standard because they're in the back seat of a chauffeur-driven limousine. They don't care if they sit in traffic for a long time. They're in their private jet. They're in their walled community. What do they need for public safety? Their kids go to private schools. What do they care about public education? And, hey, they don't have to worry about the cost of health care. That's the Republican world. We're going to change that with this Democratic budget.                          ____________________
