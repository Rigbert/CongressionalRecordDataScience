Chairman, I rise in opposition to the gentleman's amendment.  The Acting CHAIR. The gentleman from Oregon is recognized for 5 minutes.  Mr. DeFAZIO. Mr. Chairman, I yield myself such time as I may consume.  This amendment would dictate to communities across America what form of transit they could put into their urban areas to solve problems of congestion and the efficient movement of people from place to place.  The gentleman mentioned tourist destinations. Yes, some may relate to tourist destinations; others may relate to medical facilities, as in Portland, Oregon, where the streetcar terminates at the Oregon Health & Science University. It also then utilizes a tram, which is at both the bottom and the top of the hill. It is used by many patients and others who have to get there. So these are not just toy things or things that are used for tourists. They are used to solve congestion problems in major urban areas. They are also incredible tools for economic development.  As for the fixed streetcar line in Portland, they revitalized a whole section of the city, which generated $3.5 billion in private economic development because the line was there. They didn't get any Federal money, but they built their projects adjacent to that line, which also provided a built-in ridership. Many people who reside in those pretty high-end apartments actually don't own cars, and they utilize the streetcar.  Salt Lake has already attracted $400 million in investment. Atlanta, Georgia, has a very successful program. Tucson, Arizona, has seen an incredible initial ridership, far exceeding projections. Cities across America are finding great success with streetcars; so to deny them this tool on some sort of arbitrary basis, I think, is unwarranted.  I reserve the balance of my time.
