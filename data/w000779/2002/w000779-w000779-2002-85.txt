. Customs Service, Customs, against a small Oregon business, GS Associates, Inc., GS. What has been allowed to happen to this company at the hands of the federal government is a shocking and ultimately disturbing example of what can happen to ordinary, hardworking Americans when an overzealous Federal bureaucracy is allowed to run horribly amok.  In 1973, imports of Japanese roller chain, not bicycle chain, potentially became subject to dumping duties, and in 1980, Congress instructed the International Trade Administration, ITA, to conduct complete annual administrative reviews of outstanding dumping findings to determine whether any dumping duties should be assessed. But ITA failed to complete its reviews on a timely basis. In fact, for my small Oregon importer, GS, the ITA wasn't just a day or two late in reporting the findings of its review of the company's Japanese supplier for shipments imported from April 1, 1981 through March 31, 1982, they were nine-and-a-half years late. When ITA finally got around to issuing a notice regarding its administrative review on September 22, 1992, a court challenge was initiated by the Japanese supplier and a court decision was rendered on July 11, 1995. Not surprisingly, ITA failed to publish notice of the court's decision in the Federal Register within ten days, as required by law. That was in 1995. The year is now 2002, and ITA still has not published that notice. And as if all of this ineptitude were not enough, ITA then failed to instruct Customs to begin assessing dumping duties on and to liquidate GS Associates' shipments until the Spring of 2000. When Customs finally began assessing duties, they added on enormous amounts of interest, dating back almost 20 years, in sums that were two to three times greater than the original dumping duty assessments. This outrageous pattern of conduct by the federal government threatens GS with bankruptcy.  The level of ineptitude displayed in this case by bureaucrats at ITA and the Customs Service is egregious bordering on negligence. Legitimate small businesses in this country should have the expectation they will be treated fairly and forthrightly by their federal government. ITA and the Customs Service deserve a very strong rebuke. GS Associates deserves to have its case resolved quickly and fairly, and that is the point of my legislation. It will liquidate once and for all the $1.7 million in duties and interest that have accumulated over the past 20 years on these imports because of federal government negligence.  I intend to work with the Finance Committee to assure that this measure is included in the legislation the committee is preparing on temporary duty suspensions, and hope that the duty suspension bill will enable this Oregon company to be able to put this terrible experience behind it.                                 ______                                       By
