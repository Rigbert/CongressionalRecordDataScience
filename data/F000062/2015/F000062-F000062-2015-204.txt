 President, I rise today to introduce bipartisan legislation with my colleague Senator Portman that would expand the definition of ``homeless'' used by the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development, HUD, to ensure all homeless children and families are considered eligible for existing Federal homeless assistance programs. This change in the definition would be in alignment with what is already currently used by the U.S. Department of Education.  According to the U.S. Department of Education, approximately 1.2 million children were homeless during the 2012-2013 school year, which accounts fora 6 percent increase from the 1,166,436 homeless students enrolled in the 2011-2012 school year.  In California, 259,656 children experienced homelessness last year. This increase is nearly four times the 65,000 homeless children that were reported in California in 2003.  Unfortunately, the numbers reported by the HUD ``Point-in-Time Count'' fail to accurately reflect the upward trend in homeless families.  According to the 2013 HUD ``Point-in-Time Count,'' there were only 222,197 people counted as homeless in households that included children, a fraction of the number reported by the Department of Education.  This issue is important because only those children and their families counted by HUD are eligible for vital homeless assistance programs. The rest of these children and families are simply out of luck and are turned away by providers that do not want to be reprimanded for not following HUD regulations.  The Homeless Children and Youth Act of 2015 would expand the homeless definition to allow HUD funded homeless assistance programs to serve extremely vulnerable children and families, specifically those staying in self-paid motels or in doubled up situations because they have nowhere else to go.  These families are especially susceptible to physical and sexual abuse, trafficking, and neglect because they are often not served by a case manager, and thus remain hidden from potential social service providers.  As a result of the current narrow HUD definition, communities that receive federal funding through the discretionary grant process are unable to prioritize or direct resources to help these children and families.  This bill would provide communities with the flexibility to use federal funds to meet local priorities.  I would also like to note that this legislation comes at no additional cost to taxpayers and does not impose any new mandates on service providers.  Finally, this legislation improves data collection transparency by requiring HUD to report data on homeless individuals and families currently recorded under the existing Homeless Management Information System survey.  I am pleased that Senator Rob Portman (R-OH) has joined me as an original cosponsor on this bill.  Homelessness continues to plague our Nation. If we fail to address the needs of these children and families today, they will remain invisible and stuck in a cycle of poverty and chronic homelessness.  It is our responsibility to ensure that we do not erect more barriers for these children and families to access services when they are experiencing extreme hardship. I believe this bill is a commonsense solution that will ensure that homeless families and children can receive the help they need.  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be printed in the Record.  There being no objection, the text of the bill was ordered to be printed in the Record, as follows:                                 S. 256       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of      the United States of America in Congress assembled,     SECTION 1.
