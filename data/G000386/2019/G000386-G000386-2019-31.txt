 President, on the Saturday before Thanksgiving, my wife Barbara and I traveled to Carroll, IA, for the induction of our youngest son, Jay Grassley, to the Iowa Girls Coaches' Association Hall of Fame. Jay earned this honor through his work over the last 29 years as a volleyball official. Jay has officiated the most Iowa high school volleyball finals in history with 14 games. With one exception, Jay has officiated at every Iowa State volleyball tournament since 1995. This outstanding record demonstrates Jay's dedication to his work as an official.  In addition to his officiating, Jay has been a coach and mentor to volleyball players for more than 30 years. His interest in volleyball started when he was a student at the University of Northern Iowa. Jay started the Six Pack Volleyball Club in 1990, and after years of building a strong reputation, his team earned the USA Volleyball 18s Division National Championship title in 2011.  As I travel across Iowa for my annual 99 county meetings, I often run into Iowans whose relationship with Jay has had a lasting impact. They commonly ask that I tell Jay ``hi'' and follow with a story of how he was a mentor and coach to them or one of their children. As a father, those are heartwarming sentiments for me to hear. Jay's kind nature and motivational spirit help him to connect with people of all ages and make his influence all the more worthwhile. At the hall of fame induction, Jay's fellow coaches and officials described him as ``one of, if not the best, official(s) out there.''  Barbara and I are very proud of Jay being named to the Iowa Girls Coaches' Association Hall of Fame.                          ____________________
