 Casey):  S. 799. A bill to combat the rise of prenatal opioid abuse and neonatal abstinence syndrome; to the Committee on Health, Education, Labor, and Pensions.  Mr. McCONNELL. Mr. President, next month I look forward to hosting our Nation's newest drug czar at a forum in Covington, KY. It is a forum that will allow Director Bottecelli to hear firsthand accounts of the devastating impact of one of America's most significant public health challenges and one that continues to hit my State particularly hard--the growing epidemic of prescription drug and heroin abuse.  It is hard to overstate the challenge. Drug overdoses, largely driven by pain killers, now claim more Kentucky lives than car accidents, and rising heroin overdose rates now account for nearly one-third of all drug overdose deaths in Kentucky.  While statistics such as these are devastating enough, they hardly paint the full picture because they don't account for the thousands of innocent children born dependent on opioids. The numbers are hard to hear. Nationwide we have seen a staggering 300-percent increase in the number of infants diagnosed with newborn withdrawal since 2000. But in Kentucky, we saw similar numbers grow by an almost unbelievable 3,000 percent.  It is a tragic challenge, and I say that especially as a father of three daughters. But it is a challenge we can do something about. If Washington enacts the bipartisan Protecting Our Infants Act that I am introducing today, along with Senator Casey of Pennsylvania, it is a challenge we will do something about.  This bipartisan bill will do a number of important things. It will direct the Secretary of Health and Human Services to develop recommendations both for preventing prenatal opioid abuse and treating infants dependent on opioids. It would direct the Secretary to help develop a strategy to address research and program gaps--a step recommended by GAO in one of their reports released last month--and it would encourage the Director of the CDC to work with States to help improve surveillance and data collection activities in this area.  Obviously, no piece of legislation would ever solve the challenge overnight, but the bipartisan Protect Our Infants Act can help move the country in the right direction. That is why it is supported by the March of Dimes, the American Academy of Pediatrics, the American Congress of Obstetricians and Gynecologists. That is why an identical bill will also be introduced in the House today by Congresswoman Katherine Clark of Massachusetts and Congressman Steve Stivers of Ohio.  I commend these Representatives and Senator Casey for their leadership on this issue. I look forward to working with them to advance this important measure through Congress, and I look forward to discussing it with Director Botticelli during his visit to Kentucky in the next few weeks.  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be printed in the Record.  There being no objection, the text of the bill was ordered to be printed in the Record, as follows:                                 S. 799       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of      the United States of America in Congress assembled,     SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.       This Act may be cited as the ``Protecting Our Infants Act      of 2015''.     SEC. 2. FINDINGS.       Congress finds as follows:       (1) Opioid prescription rates have risen dramatically over      the past several years. According to the Centers for Disease      Control and Prevention, in some States, there are as many as      96 to 143 prescriptions for opioids per 100 adults per year.       (2) In recent years, there has been a steady rise in the      number of overdose deaths involving heroin. According to the      Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, the death rate      for heroin overdose doubled from 2010 to 2012.       (3) At the same time, there has been an increase in cases      of neonatal abstinence syndrome (referred to in this section      as ``NAS''). In the United States, the incidence of NAS has      risen from 1.20 per 1,000 hospital births in 2000 to 3.39 per      1,000 hospital births in 2009.       (4) NAS refers to medical issues associated with drug      withdrawal in newborns due to exposure to opioids or other      drugs in utero.       (5) The average cost of treatment in a hospital for NAS      increased from $39,400 in 2000 to $53,400 in 2009. Most of      these costs are born by the Medicaid program.       (6) Preventing opioid abuse among pregnant women and women      of childbearing age is crucial.       (7) Medically-appropriate opioid use in pregnancy is not      uncommon, and opioids are often the safest and most      appropriate treatment for moderate to severe pain for      pregnant women.       (8) Addressing NAS effectively requires a focus on women of      childbearing age, pregnant women, and infants from      preconception through early childhood.       (9) NAS can result from the use of prescription drugs as      prescribed for medical reasons, from the abuse of      prescription drugs, or from the use of illegal opioids like      heroin.       (10) For pregnant women who are abusing opioids, it is most      appropriate to treat and manage maternal substance use in a      non-punitive manner.       (11) According to a report of the Government Accountability      Office (referred to in this section as the ``GAO report''),      more research is needed to optimize the identification and      treatment of babies with NAS and to better understand long-     term impacts on children.       (12) According to the GAO report, the Department of Health      and Human Services does not have a focal point to lead      planning and coordinating efforts to address prenatal opioid      use and NAS across the department.       (13) According to the GAO report, ``given the increasing      use of heroin and abuse of opioids prescribed for pain      management, as well as the increased rate of NAS in the      United States, it is important to improve the efficiency and      effectiveness of planning and coordination of Federal efforts      on prenatal opioid use and NAS''.
