 President, today we return to our legislative business following the Easter/Passover adjournment. This afternoon, we will be in a period of morning business so that Senators can come to the floor to make statements.  There will be no rollcall votes during today's session. Tomorrow we will begin work on the supplemental appropriations bill. Chairman Cochran will be managing that bill, and we encourage Senators who have amendments to contact Senator Cochran and the ranking member.  We are now in a 5-week legislative period, which we anticipate will be a busy stretch of work. We have a lot of important issues to address during this time. The majority leader will have more to say on the schedule tomorrow.  Having said that, I welcome everybody back and hope everybody is rested and ready for the weeks ahead.                          ____________________[Page S3405]From the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]                                SCHEDULE  Mr. McCONNELL.
