President, Margaret Blackshere was a trailblazer as the first woman to serve as president of the nearly 1-million strong Illinois AFL-CIO. In July, she passed away at the age of 79, and I rise today to honor her memory. I share the privilege with countless others to call her a friend.  Margaret and her sister were raised by their single mother, Frances, and Aunt Margie in North Venice, IL. Her mother made sure her daughters knew that they could do anything. There were no boy chores or girl chores; there were just chores. Laundry and rewiring a lamp were normal activities.  She started off studying to be a nun, but she changed course and ended up studying elementary education at Southern Illinois University, Edwardsville. Her religious convictions remained an essential part of her life, but education was her calling.  After college, Margaret began teaching in a school in Madison, IL. She and her fellow teachers were making only $3,000 a year and weren't treated with respect, but they noticed that the steelworkers and mineworkers in the area were respected and doing well because they belonged to a union and worked together to secure better working conditions. Margaret and her colleagues decided they needed to form a union and demand adequate pay from the superintendent. The superintendent refused so Margaret took action and organized a 5-week strike. One small issue--because she and the other teachers were public employees, their strike was illegal. Margaret and her colleagues were jailed, but the jail only had two cells. This meant that every day, Margaret arrived at the jail with her children, ages 3 and 5, and everynight, she went home because there wasn't enough space. Her fellow teachers saw her dedication and elected her president of the teachers' union in Madison.  Margaret went back to Southern Illinois University to earn a master's degree in urban education. She became focused on issues about children living in poverty.  Her work with the union and its attempts to earn greater pay for teachers opened the door to politics. She began working on local election campaigns. It wasn't just about money anymore; it was about having a voice. With her hard work, Margaret was elected vice president of the Illinois Federation of Teachers, IFT, and chair of its legislative committee.  Eventually, Margaret reluctantly gave up teaching, which she loved so much, and became a lobbyist for the IFT. She worked in Springfield to improve the salaries and working conditions of teachers. Margaret also began building networks and alliances. In 1993, the Illinois AFL-CIO needed a secretary-treasurer. Margaret was easily elected because she was respected by so many people from her time campaigning and working for the IFT.  In 2000, Margaret became president of the Illinois AFL-CIO. When Margaret came into office, she inherited a staff of 25. None of them was a person of color. The executive board had no women on it. Illinois AFL-CIO also didn't have health insurance that covered well-baby care or mammograms. Margaret brought these benefits into place. She also transformed the executive board by making it more diverse. Before long, seven African Americans, two Latinos, and eight women had positions on the board.  Under Margaret's leadership, the Illinois AFL-CIO helped lead the fight to raise the State's minimum wage--not once but twice. She led efforts to guarantee women equal pay for equal work, to expand healthcare, and to improve Illinois' workers' compensation system.  Margaret excelled at bringing people of different backgrounds together to achieve goals. She used to say, ``If you've got a good cause, people will join it.'' She helped create Transportation for Illinois with the Illinois Automobile Asphalt and Pavement Association, the Chicago Transit Authority, and other businesses, organized labor, industry, governmental, and nonprofit organizations to support strong transportation investments for Illinois. The groups may have fought each other on a host of issues, but she gave them a unified voice for infrastructure.  Margaret devoted much of her life as well to charitable organizations and served on many boards, including the Illinois branches of United Way and the American Red Cross, Alliance for Retired Americans, Voices for Illinois Children, Unemployment Insurance Advisory Board, and the Federal Reserve Board of Chicago. She served as an inspiration to the Illinois Women's Institute for Leadership alongside my wife, Loretta, encouraging and training women to become effective leaders in Illinois.  Over the years, Margaret received more awards and accolades than can be recounted here. She was delighted to be the guest of honor for Chicago's St. Patrick Day Parade in 2003. Margaret loved celebrating her Irish heritage.  Loretta and I will miss her great humor and her willingness to always wish others well unless they were playing her beloved St. Louis Cardinals.  Margaret is survived by her two sons, Michael and Thomas; her sister, Patricia; and four grandchildren.                          ____________________
