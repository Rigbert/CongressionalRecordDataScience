 I had the opportunity yesterday to speak at length on this bill and to commend my colleagues, Senator Kennedy and Senator Gregg, our colleagues from the other body, Mr. Boehner and Mr. Miller, and Senator Jeffords for his leadership as chairman.  I neglected to commend people who were much responsible for this legislation, and that is staff members, particularly my staff member Elyse Wasch who did a remarkable job.  I also extend my thanks and congratulations to Danica Petroshius, Roberto Rodriguez, Michael Dannenberg, Dana Fiordaliso, and Michael Myers of the majority staff and Denzel McGuire of the Republican staff.
