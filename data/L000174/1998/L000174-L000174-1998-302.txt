President, I know that consumers are becoming more and more concerned about the merger mania that has hit the United States--they see the potential for higher prices to consumers and poorer service as industries become far more concentrated in fewer hands.  I am also concerned about this trend, particularly when mergers take place between incumbent monopolies. Specifically, the mergers among Regional Bell Operating Companies, which continue to have a virtual strangle-hold on the local telephone loop, pose the greatest threat to healthy competition in the telecommunications industry.  Indeed, incumbent telephone companies still control over 99% of the local residential telephone markets. In other words, new entrants have captured less than 1% of local residential phone service.  The Telecommunications Act's promise of competition was a sales pitch that has not materialized to benefit American consumers. Instead of competition, we see entrenchment, mega-mergers, consolidation and the divvying up of markets. Even Edward Whitacre, Jr., the Chairman and Chief Executive Officer of SBC Communications, testified several weeks ago before the Antitrust Subcommittee that ``The Act promised competition that has not come.''  At a recent judiciary committee hearing on mergers, Alan Greenspan acknowledged that the Act has not lived up to its promises of lower consumer costs and more competition.  Since passage of this law, Southwestern Bell has merged with PacTel into SBC Corporation, and Bell Atlantic has merged with NYNEX. Now, SBC Corporation is seeking to purchase Ameritech. What once had been seven separate local monopolies will soon befour, with the possibility of more on the horizon. One of my home state newspapers--the Rutland Daily Herald--commented in an editorial that, ``It might even seem as if Ma Bell's corpse is coming back to life.''  I voted against the Telecommunications Act because I did not believe it was sufficiently procompetitive. I raised a number of concerns as that Act was being considered by the Senate. I said in my floor statement on the day the new law passed:       Mega-mergers between telecommunications giants, such as the      rumored merger between NYNEX and Bell Atlantic, or the      gigantic network mergers now underway, raise obvious concerns      about concentrating control in a few gigantic companies of      both the content and means of distributing the information      and entertainment American consumers receive. Competition,      not concentration, is the surest way to assure lower prices      and greater choices for consumers. Rigorous oversight and      enforcement by our antitrust agencies is more important than      ever to insure that such mega-mergers do not harm consumers.  I am very concerned that this concentration of ownership in the telecommunications industry is currently proceeding faster than the growth of competition. We are seeing old monopolies getting bigger and expanding their reach.  Upon completion of all the proposed mergers among the Bell companies, most of the local telephone lines in the country will be concentrated in the hands of three to four companies. This will affect not only the millions of people who depend on the companies involved for both basic telephone service and increasingly for an array of advanced telecommunications services, but also competition in the entire industry. The Consumers Union recently testified before the Judiciary Committee's Antitrust Subcommittee that the mergers between Regional Bell Operating Companies could lead to even more mega-mergers within this industry.  I know personally that at my farm in Vermont and here at my office in the District of Columbia and at my home in Virginia, I still have only one choice for dial-tone and local telephone service. That ``choice'' is the Bell operating company or no service at all. The current mantra of the industry seems to be ``one-stop shopping.'' But if that stop is at a monopoly that is not competing on price and service, I do not think it is the kind of ``one-stop shopping'' consumers want.  I have been concerned that the distraction of these huge mergers serve only to complicate and delay the companies' compliance with their obligations under the Telecommunications Act to open their networks. That is not good for competition in the local loop. Consolidation is taking precedence over competition. We need to reverse that priority, and make opening up the local loop the focus of the energies of the Bell Operating Companies. Then consolidation, if it happens, would not pose the current risk of creating additional barriers to effective competition.  Big is not necessarily bad. But the Justice Department in the late 1970's worked overtime to divide up the old Ma Bell to assure more competition and provide customers with better service at lower rates. It is ironic that the Telecommunications Act, which was touted as the way to increase competition, is having the reverse effect instead of promoting consolidation among telephone companies.  Before all the pieces of Ma Bell are put together again, Congress should revisit the Telecommunications Act. To ensure competition among Bell Operating Companies and long distance and other companies, as contemplated by passage of this law, we need clearer guidelines and better incentives. Specifically, we should ensure that Bell Operating Companies do not gain more concentrated control over huge percentages of the telephone access lines of this country through mergers, but only through robust competition.  As the Consumers Union recently testified, ``If Congress really wants to bring broad-based competition to telecommunications markets, it must rewrite the Telecommunications Act, giving antitrust and regulatory authorities more tools to eliminate the most persistent pockets of telephone and cable monopoly power.''  Today I am introducing antitrust legislation that will bar future mergers between Bell Operating Companies or GTE, unless the federal requirements for opening the local loop to competition have been satisfied in at least half of the access lines in each State. I look forward to working with my colleagues on this legislation to make the Telecommunications Act live up to some of its promise.  The bill provides that a ``large local telephone company'' may not merge with another large local telephone company unless the Attorney General finds that the merger will promote competition for telephone exchange services and exchange access services. Also, before a merger can take place the Federal Communications Commission must find that each large local telephone company has for at least one-half of the access lines in each State served by such carrier, of which as least one-half are residential access lines, fully implemented the requirements of sections 251 and 252 of the Communications Act of 1934.  The bill requires that each large local telephone company that wishes to merge with another must file an application with the Attorney General and the FCC. A review of these applications will be subject to the same time limits set under the Hart-Scott-Rodino Antitrust Improvements Act of 1976.  The bill also provides that nothing in this Act shall be construed to modify, impair, or supersede the applicability of the antitrust laws of the United States, or any authority of the Federal Communications Commission, or any authority of the States with respect to mergers and acquisitions of large local telephone companies.  The bill is effective on enactment and has no retroactive effect. It is enforceable by the Attorney General in federal district courts.  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be printed in the Record.  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the Record, as follows:                                S. 2207       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of      the United States of America in Congress assembled,     SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.       This Act may be cited as the ``Antitrust Improvements Act      of 1998''.     SEC. 2. PURPOSE.       The purpose of this Act is to enhance the authority of the      Attorney General to prevent certain mergers and acquisitions      that would unreasonably limit competition in the      telecommunications industry in any case in which certain      Federal requirements that would enhance competition are not      met.     SEC. 3. RESTRAINT OF TRADE.       The Clayton Act (15 U.S.C. 12 et seq.) is amended by adding      at the end the following new section:     ``SEC. 27.
