 President, today I pay tribute to a great patriot, RADM Andy Wilkinson, on the occasion of his retirement. Andy has led a life of great purpose, from his childhood days in Alabama to a dedicated military career and his time in the private sector in Huntsville, AL. A native of Selma, Andy is of the generation of military leaders in this Nation whose sacrifice and commitment preserved and protected our freedom from Vietnam on into the long decades of confrontation with the former Soviet Union, and beyond.  He began his distinguished 34-year military career in 1955 when he was commissioned as an ensign upon his graduation from the U.S. Naval Academy. He also graduated from the Armed Forces Staff College, the National War College, and he holds a Master's Degree in Engineering from the George Washington University. During his Naval career as a pilot, he held six commands, four of which were in operational aviation units, including command of Patrol Wings, U.S. Atlantic Fleet. Andy also served on the staff of the Deputy Chief of Naval Operations for Air and as Manager of the Anti-Submarine Warfare Systems Project Office in the Naval Material Command, supervising a budget of over $1 billion per year.  With an expertise in aviation, antisubmarine warfare, and mapping, charting, and geodesy, MC&G, Andy served as the Director of the Defense Mapping Agency, DMA. In this role, he was responsible to the Secretary of Defense for all service MC&G matters and managed the multi-billion-dollar DMA all digital modernization program. Andy has been awarded the Defense Distinguished Service Medal, the Defense Superior Service Medal, and two Legions of Merit Medals during his distinguished military career.  In 1985, Andy joined the Intergraph Corporation as a senior representative to the U.S. Government on relations with Congress and the executive department. After being promoted to vice president in 1987 and to executive vice president in 1994, Andy then served as Director of U.S. Federal Sales and Marketing until 1999. He currently provides leadership and expertise by overseeing all Government relations and Federal solutions business planning.  During his career, Andy has shown continuous dedication and played a major role in several large contracts and programs that have helped to improve government and the efficiency and effectiveness of a vast array of military programs. Andy was instrumental in the management and development of CAD-2 programs for the Naval Sea Systems Command, Naval Air Systems Command, and Naval Facilities Engineering Command, which provide information technology support and integration in the Navy and Federal government. Also, Andy served a vital role in developing the Depot Maintenance Accounting and Production System for the Air Force Material Command, AFMC. By facilitating data exchange between legacy systems, this program greatly enhanced AFMC's decisionmaking process and increased responsiveness to the warfighter and other support personnel.  Finally, I should also say that Andy distinguished himself in yet another way. He is one of those rare individuals whose word is his bond, and whose actions, both personal and professional, are based on a bedrock of integrity. He has earned the confidence and respect of countless Members of Congress, Senators, and his colleagues.  I ask my colleagues to join me in paying special tribute to Mr. Andy Wilkinson. I thank him for his service, and I wish Andy and his wife Sondra and their family the very best as they begin a new chapter in their lives.                          ____________________[Page S7816]From the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]        TRIBUTE IN HONOR OF RADM EDWARD ``ANDY'' WILKINSON, RET.
