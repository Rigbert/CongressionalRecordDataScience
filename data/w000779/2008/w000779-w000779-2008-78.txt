Ezekiel Emanuel and Dr. Victor Fuchs, physicians and distinguished scholars, have recently written a particularly important article that I wish to bring to the attention of the Senate.  These two gentlemen have a long and impressive track record on the issue of reforming our Nation's broken health system, and their recent article in the Journal of American Medicine (JAMA), ``Who Really Pays for Health Care? The Myth of Shared Responsibility,'' is one that every Senator should reflect on.  Drs. Emanuel and Fuchs assert in their article that when millions of Americans say that financing health care is a ``shared responsibility'' between ``employers, government, and individuals'' they are incorrect. The authors say there is actually no such thing as ``shared responsibility''--health costs in America come out of the hides of individuals and households. Emanuel-Fuchs point out, for example, that money employers spend on health care for their workers would otherwise go to workers' salaries and that Government cannot secure funds at all without reaching into our wallets for tax payments or money we lend to them.  The work of these two scholars is particularly relevant because recent public opinion polls show significant numbers of Americans would be content ``to just keep the health care they have.'' This seems understandable. Ifyou are not a regular reader of JAMA, you are likely to miss Dr. Emanuel and Dr. Fuchs describe how your take-home pay is going to keep going down without health reform that makes health care more affordable.  If Americans are kept in the dark about how much of the money spent on employer-based health care produces little value, naturally, during these times of economic uncertainty, many will be glad to just keep the care they have got.  Senator Bennett and I, along with six other Democrats and six other Republicans, believe it is time to modernize the employer-employee relationship in health care. If employers choose to offer health coverage in the future, and workers know how much money they are spending and can choose between the employer's health coverage and private sector alternatives, we are fine with that. Workers should, however, have the opportunity as Dr. Emanuel and Dr. Fuchs put it to ``consider alternatives''. Americans can get more value from the 2.3 trillion dollars being spent this year on their health care, and this article is an important part of the discussion as to how to bring that about.  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the article by Drs. Emanuel and Fuchs be printed in the Record.  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in the Record, as follows:                    Who Really Pays for Health Care?                 the myth of ``shared responsibility''    (By Ezekiel J. Emanuel, M.D., Ph.D. and Victor R. Fuchs, Ph.D.)       When asked who pays for health care in the United States,      the usual answer is ``employers, government, and      individuals.'' Most Americans believe that employers pay the      bulk of workers' premiums and that governments pay for      Medicare, Medicaid, the State Children's Health Insurance      Program (SCHIP), and other programs.       However, this is incorrect. Employers do not bear the cost      of employment-based insurance; workers and households pay for      health insurance through lower wages and higher prices.      Moreover, government has no source of funds other than taxes      or borrowing to pay for health care.       Failure to understand that individuals and households      actually foot the entire health care bill perpetuates the      idea that people can get great health benefits paid for by      someone else. It leads to perverse and counterproductive      ideas regarding health care reform.                   the myth of shared responsibility       Many sources contribute to the misperception that employers      and government bear significant shares of health care costs.      For example, a report of the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid      Services states that ``the financial burden of health care      costs resides with businesses, households, and governments      that pay insurance premiums, out-of-pocket costs, or finance      health care through dedicated taxes or general revenues.'' A      New America Foundation report claims, ``There is growing      bipartisan support for a health system based on shared      responsibility--with the individual, employers, and      government all doing their fair share.''       The notion of shared responsibility serves many interests.      ``Responsibility'' is a popular catchword for those who      believe everyone should pull their own weight, while      ``sharing'' appeals to those who believe everyone should      contribute to meeting common social goals. Politicians      welcome the opportunity to boast that they are ``giving'' the      people health benefits. Employers and union leaders alike      want workers to believe that the employer is ``giving'' them      health insurance. For example, Steve Burd, president and      chief executive officer of Safeway, argued that decreasing      health care costs is critical to his company's bottom line--     as if costs come out of profits. A highly touted alliance      between Wal-Mart and the Service Employees International      Union for universal coverage pledged that ``businesses,      governments, and individuals all [must] contribute to      managing and financing a new American health care system.       The Massachusetts health care reform plan is constructed      around ``shared responsibility.'' The rhetoric of health      reform proposals offered by several presidential candidates      helps propagate this idea. Hillary Clinton, for instance,      claims that her American Health Choices plan ``is based on      the principle of shared responsibility. This plan ensures      that all who benefit from the system contribute to its      financing and management.'' It then lists how insurance and      drug companies, individuals, clinicians, employers, and      government must each contribute to the provision of improved      health care.       With prominent politicians, business leaders, and experts      supporting shared responsibility, it is hardly surprising      that most Americans believe that employers really bear most      of the cost of health insurance.                  the health care cost-wage trade-off       Shared responsibility is a myth. While employers do provide      health insurance for the majority of Americans, that does not      mean that they are paying the cost. Wages, health insurance,      and other fringe benefits are simply components of overall      worker compensation. When employers provide health insurance      to their workers, they may define the benefits, select the      health plan to manage the benefits, and collect the funds to      pay the health plan, but they do not bear the ultimate cost.      Employers' contribution to the health insurance premium is      really workers' compensation in another form.       This is not a point merely of economic theory but of      historical fact. Consider changes in health insurance      premiums, wages, and corporate profits over the past 30      years. Premiums have increased by about 300% after adjustment      for inflation. Corporate profits per employee have      flourished, with inflation-adjusted increases of 150% before      taxes and 200% after taxes. By contrast, average hourly      earnings of workers in private nonagricultural industries      have been stagnant, actually decreasing by 4% after      adjustment for inflation. Rather than coming out of      corporate profits, the increasing cost of health care has      resulted in relatively flat real wages for 30 years. That      is the health care cost--wage trade-off.       Even over shorter periods, workers' average hourly earnings      fluctuate with changes in health care expenditures (adjusted      for inflation). During periods when the real annual increases      in health care costs are significant, as between 1987 and      1992 and again between 2001 and 2004, inflation-adjusted      hourly earnings are flat or even declining in real value. For      a variety of reasons, the decline in wages may lag a few      years behind health care cost increases. Insurance premiums      increase after costs increase. Employers may be in binding      multiyear wage contracts that restrict their ability to      change wages immediately. Conversely, when increases in      health care costs are moderate, as between 1994 and 1999,      increases in productivity and other factors translate into      higher wages rather than health care premiums.       The health care cost--wage trade-off is confirmed by many      economic studies. State mandates for inclusion of certain      health benefits in insurance packages resulted in essentially      all the cost of the added services being borne by workers in      terms of lower wages. Similarly, using the Consumer      Expenditure Survey, Miller found that ``the amount of      earnings a worker must give up for gaining health insurance      is roughly equal to the amount an employer must pay for such      coverage.'' Baicker and Chandra reported that a 10% increase      in state health insurance premiums generated a 2.3% decline      in wages, ``so that [workers] bear the full cost of the      premium increase.'' Importantly, several studies show that      when workers lose employer-provided health insurance, they      actually receive pay increases equivalent to the insurance      premium.       In a review of studies on the link between higher health      care costs and wages, Gruber concluded, ``The results [of      studies] that attempt to control for worker selection, firm      selection, or (ideally) both have produced a fairly uniform      result: the costs of health insurance are fully shifted to      wages.''                   the cost--public service trade-off       A large portion of health care coverage in the United      States is provided by the government. But where does      government's money for health care come from? Just as the      ultimate cost of employer-provided health insurance falls to      workers, the burden of government-provided health coverage      falls on the average citizen. When government pays for      increases in health care costs, it taxes current citizens,      borrows from future taxpayers, or reduces other state      services that benefit citizens: the health care cost--public      service trade-off.       Health care costs are now the single largest part of state      budgets, exceeding education. According to the National      Governors Association, in 2006, health care expenditures      accounted for an average of 32 percent of state budgets,      while Medicaid alone accounted for 22 of spending. Between      2000 and 2004, health care expenditures increased      substantially, more than 34 percent with Medicaid and SCHIP      increasing more than 44 percent. These increases far exceeded      the increase in state tax receipts. In response, some states      raised taxes, others changed eligibility requirements for      Medicaid and other programs, and still others reduced the      fees and payments to physicians, hospitals, and other      providers of health care services.       However, according to a Rockefeller Institute of Government      study of how 10 representative states responded, probably the      most common policy change was to cut other state programs,      and ``the program area that was most affected by state budget      difficulties in 2004 was public higher education. . . . On      average, the sample states projected spending 4.5 percent      less on higher education in FY 2004 than in FY 2003 and      raised tuition and fees by almost 14 percent on average. In      other words, the increasing cost of Medicaid and other      government health care programs are a primary reason for the      substantial increase in tuition and fees for state colleges      and universities. Middle-class families finding it more      difficult to pay for their children's college are unwittingly      falling victim to increasing state health care costs. Not an      easy--but a necessary--connection to make.                          policy implications       The widespread failure to acknowledge these effects of      increasing health care costs on wages and on government      services such as education has important policy implications.      The myth of shared responsibility perpetuates the belief that      workers are getting     something while paying little or nothing. This undercuts the      public's willingness to tax itself for the benefits it wants.       This myth of shared responsibility makes any reform that      removes employers from health care much more difficult to      enact. If workers and their families continue to believe that      they can get a substantial fringe benefit like health      insurance at no cost to themselves, they are less likely to      consider alternatives. Unless this myth is dispelled, the      centerpiece of reform is likely to be an employer mandate.      This is regrettable and perpetuates the widely recognized      historical mistake of tying health care coverage to      employment. Furthermore, an employer mandate is an      economically inefficient mechanism to finance health care.      Keeping employers in health care, with their varied interests      and competencies, impedes major changes necessary for      insurance portability, cost control, efficient insurance      exchanges, value-based coverage, delivery system reform, and      many other essential reforms. Employers should be removed      from health care except for enacting wellness programs that      directly help maintain productivity and reduce absenteeism.      Politicians' rhetoric about shared responsibility reinforces      rather than rejects this misconception and inhibits rather      than facilitates true health care reform.       Not only does third-party payment attenuate the incentive      to compare costs and value, but the notion that someone else      is paying for the insurance further reduces the incentive for      cost control. Getting Americans invested in cost control will      require that they realize they pay the price, not just for      the deductibles and co-payments, but for the full insurance      premiums too.       Sustainable increases in wages require less explosive      growth in health care costs. Only then will increases in      productivity show up in higher wages and lower prices, giving      a boost to real incomes. Similarly, the only way for states      to provide more support for education, environment, and      infrastructure is for health care costs to be restrained.      Unless the growth in Medicaid and SCHIP are limited to--or      close to--revenue increases, they will continue to siphon      money that could be spent elsewhere.                               Conclusion       Discussions of health care financing in the United States      are distorted by the widely embraced myth of shared      responsibility. The common claim that employers, government,      and households all pay for health care is false. Employers do      not share fiscal responsibility and employers do not pay for      health care--they pass it on in the form of lower wages or      higher prices. It is essential for Americans to understand      that while it looks like they can have a free lunch--having      someone else pay for their health insurance--they cannot. The      money comes from their own pockets. Understanding this is      essential for any sustainable health care reform.                          ____________________
