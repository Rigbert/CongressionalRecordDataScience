 President, I believe Senator Schumer and I have 15 minutes between us by unanimous consent agreement, and I ask that I be alerted when 8 minutes has passed.                   Expiration of Assault Weapons Ban  Ten years ago, I introduced an amendment to the crime bill which banned the manufacture and sale of semiautomatic military-style assault weapons. Senator Schumer, then a Member of the House, a member of the Judiciary Committee, introduced the same amendment in the Judiciary Committee. We were both successful. It passed the Senate, passed the House, was signed into law by President Clinton.  Over the past 10 years, gun traces to semiautomatic military-style assault weapons have decreased by two-thirds. The ban has worked. But 2 months from today, the Federal ban will expire.  Once again, new guns such as the Tec-DC9 will flood our streets. If you don't know what a Tec-DC9 is, I am going to show you. This is Gian Luigi Ferri, who walked into 101 California Street and killed six people, wounding eight. And this is the Tec-DC-9 he was carrying with a 30-round clip. He had 250 rounds in additional clips with him. He is dead here, shot on the floor, but not until after he had either killed or wounded 14 people. The ban will expire despite overwhelming public support to renew it.  Seventy-one percent of all Americans support renewing the ban. So do 64 percent of people in homes with a gun. The ban is going to expire despite overwhelming support from law enforcement and civic organizations. As you can see, nearly every major law enforcement and civic organization in our country supports renewal: the Fraternal Order of Police, the Chiefs of Police, the United States Conference of Mayors, National Association of Counties, and on and on.  The ban will expire despite the stated public support of President George W. Bush and Attorney General John Ashcroft. As you can see from this letter, the administration has reiterated its official support for renewing the ban time and time again. From the Department of Justice:       As the President has stated on several occasions, he      supports the reauthorization of the current ban . . .  And the ban will expire despite the support of a majority of Senators, 52. Despite all of this, it looks more and more likely that the National Rifle Association will win. The ban will expire, and the American people will once again be made less safe.  Although President Bush has said he supports the ban, the White House has refused to lift a finger to help us pass the renewal. They are instead playing political hot potato with the Republican leaders in Congress.  The Hill newspaper, on May 12, said that ``an aide to [the Speaker] has said privately that if the President pushes for it, the ban will probably be reauthorized. But if he doesn't, the chances . . . are remote.''  The Boston Globe reports that a White House spokesman said ``Bush still supports the ban but is waiting for the House to act.''  So the House will act only if the President asks them, and the President will act only if the House passes it. It is a classic catch-22.  One month ago, June 14, three former Presidents wrote to President Bush. Presidents Ford, Carter, and Clinton took the extraordinary step of writing a joint letter to President Bush asking him to work to renew the ban and offering their assistance to do so. Let me read just part of it:       We are pleased that you support reauthorization of the . .      . Assault Weapons Act, which is scheduled to expire in      September. Each of us, along with President Reagan, worked      hard in support of this vital law, and it would be a grave      mistake if it were allowed to sunset.  It goes on and expresses what this law means. I could not agree more. We cannot go back to those days. We know these guns are used by gangs, by criminals, by grievance killers, by troubled children to kill their schoolmates. We also know from al-Qaida training manuals that al-Qaida has recommended that its members travel to the United States to buy assault weapons at gun shows. Why? Because it is so easy to do so.  As the threat of terrorism around the world increases, how can we let the ban expire and make it that much easier for terrorists to arm themselves with military-style weaponry? And make no mistake, gun manufacturers and sellers are keeping a close watch.  In mid-April, Italian customs seized more than 8,000 AK-47 assault rifles on their way from the Romanian Port of Constanta to New York and then to Georgia. These guns had a value of more than $7 million.  Of course, shipping assembled AK-47s would be illegal under the ban and under a 1989 Executive order of the first President Bush that banned certain guns from importation. But according to ATF, importing these guns so they can be disassembled, sold for parts, and then reassembled would not be illegal, and now purchasers will be allowed to reassemble these guns into their banned form. This shipment was not an isolated example.  Here is an advertisement from Armalite, a company that makes post-ban rifles. As we can see from this advertisement, they are offering a coupon for a free flash suppressor for anyone who buys one of these guns so that on September 14, once the ban is expired, the gun can be modified to its pre-ban configuration. What do you need a flash suppressor for? If you have a flash suppressor on a gun and a 30-round clip in it and you are shooting at night at the police or at neighbors, you can't see where the gun flashes. The flash is suppressed. So if you are a criminal, you may need one. If you are a legitimate citizen, you don't.  This is the kind of thing we can expect, just 2 months from now: Companies gearing up to once again produce the deadly assault weapons, the high-capacity clips which are now banned, clips, drums, or strips of more than 10 bullets, and dangerous accessories we worked so hard to stop 10 years ago.  I hope that, before September 13, the President and the Congress can find the courage to stand up to the NRA, to listen to law enforcement all across the Nation who know that to ban these guns makes sense and saves lives.  Listen to the studies that show that crime with assault weapons of all kinds has decreased as much as 66 percent. The bottom line is that everyone knows this ban should remain law, but time is running out. We have 14 legislative days. Will the House of Representatives step up to the plate and find an opportunity to give the House an opportunity to vote to renew the military-style assault weapons legislation?  I ask unanimous consent to print the following editorials in the Record.  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in the Record, as follows:                 [From the Seattle Times, May 4, 2004]                   Extend the Ban on Assault Weapons       The clock is running out on a 10-year-old federal ban on      certain types of semiautomatic assault weapons. Without bold      action by President Bush, the common-sense law likely will      expire in September.       Bush has said he will sign a bill to extend the ban if      Congress approves one. But that's unlikely without his strong      backing, and he knows it.       A strong majority of Americans support the ban on the      manufacture, transfer and possession of 19 types of assault      weapons, such as the AK-47, the Uzi and the TEC-9. So do the      National League of Cities, the U.S. Conference of Mayors, the      National Educational Association, the American Bar      Association and many other organizations. They support it      because it makes sense.       Seattle Police Chief Gil Kerlikowske is one of hundreds of      law-enforcement leaders who back the ban. He says such      weapons serve no legitimate purpose for people who aren't      police.       He's right. These weapons aren't necessary for hunting or      self-defense. They are for drug dealers, gang leaders and      other criminals. They don't belong on America's streets.       In addition to banning 19 specific semiautomatic assault      weapons, the 1994 legislation identifies specific      characteristics that categorize a weapon as an ``assault      weapon.'' It also bans ammunition clips or magazines that      hold more than 10 rounds. At the same time, it exempt      hundreds of other weapons designed for legitimate uses.       The ban isn't perfect. Manufacturers can too easily get      around the law by altering their weapons. Still, the fight to      keep the ban in place is worth it. And it will be a fight.       The National Rifle Association is actively opposing      extension of the ban. Republican Majority Leader Tom DeLay      said there are not sufficient votes to reauthorize the law. A      bill that would have protected gun manufacturers from      lawsuits died in March when senators tried to include in the      bill the extension of the assault-weapons ban.       If the ban expires Sept. 13, the country could once again      manufacture and import these military-style weapons. We don't      need them.       President Bush has said he supports the ban. It's time for      him to start acting like it.                                  ____           [From the San Francisco Chronicle, April 22, 2004]                         Renew the Weapons Ban       The debate over the nation's assault weapons ban will be      repeated this spring, with Sen. Dianne Feinstein arguing the      need for extending her groundbreaking legislation. Lest she      need any more ammunition, tragic news has provided it--the      recent cold-blooded slaying of San Francisco police office      Isaac Espinoza at the hands of a killer wielding an AK-47      assault rifle.       That there is still strong opposition to extending the      weapons ban in spite of its obvious merits speaks to the      power of the nation's gun lobby, which has fought every      effort for sensible gun control. Earlier this year, Senate      Republicans killed their own bill aimed at granting gun      dealers and manufacturers immunity from lawsuits filed by      shooting victims rather than agree to extend Feinstein's      legislation.       But none of the rhetoric from the National Rifle      Association can stand up to the facts. The percentage of      assault weapons used in crimes since the original ban passed      has been reduced by two-thirds. There is simply no      justification for making military-style assault weapons      available to the general public.       While the NRA seems to gloss over the worst incidents      involving assault weapons, such as the horrific 1999      Columbine High School shootings, Bay Area residents cannot.      Feinstein's bill grew out of the 1993 massacre of eight      people at 101 California Street in San Francisco by a gunman      armed with two semiautomatic rifles. The shooting death of      officer Espinoza, allegedly at the hands of 21-year-old      assailant, serves as a chilling reminder of the availability      and danger of assault weapons.       The need for the ban is painfully obvious. Reasonable gun      control is in everybody's interest, even those citizens who      make up the NRA.                                  ____                  [From the Miami Herald, May 6, 2004]              Assault-Weapons Ban Is Itself Under Assault       If Congress allows the federal ban on assault weapons to      expire, the law's public-safety successes will disappear with      it. Lawmakers should not let that happen. The ban is saving      lives.       The law prohibits manufacture and importation of 19 types      of rapid-fire assault weapons and scores of copy-cats with      similar characteristics. In the 10 years since the ban was      enacted, its benefits have been undeniable: A U.S. Justice      Department analysis shows that banned assault weapons used in      crimes dropped by almost 66 percent between 1995 and 2001;      they dropped 20 percent in the law's first year, to 3,268 in      1995 from 4,077 in 1994. Murders of police officers by      assault weapons dropped to zero in late 1995 and 1996 from 16      percent in 1994 and early 1995.       For these reasons, police chiefs spoke as one last week in      press conferences across the country. They want U.S.      lawmakers to reauthorize the assault-weapons ban before it      expires in September. So do government officials and, several      studies show, the majority of Americans.       President Bush supports the ban, but he hasn't been vocal      about it. Under pressure from the National Rifle Association      to change his position, Bush appears reluctant to repudiate      openly a group that supported his candidacy in 2000. But the      data should given him ample reason to lead the push for the      law's extension. Simply put, we all are safer because of the      ban on assault weapons.       The ban will sunset on Sept. 13 unless Congress approves      new legislation keeping it on the books and Bush signs it      into law. Bipartisan legislation would extend the ban for a      decade. But reauthorization faces the same heated firefight      that the original proposal faced 10 years ago.       In 1994, the ban almost sank a multifaceted crime and      safety bill. In addition to the ban on assault weapons, the      bill contained other sensible measures: It added 100,000      police officers and funded programs to steer youths away from      crime.       The NRA fought hard to persuade lawmakers to reject the      ban. It argued that the ban trampled gun buyers'      constitutional rights. Its heavy-handed tactics backfired.      Several gun-owning lawmakers from both sides of the aisle      resigned NRA memberships, and a congressional majority voted      to approve the ban.       Lawmakers should stand firm again, rejecting a replay of      the NRA's electon-year fear-mongering. The law doesn't stifle      gun ownership; it makes killing machines harder to obtain.      The ban does not affect weapons owned before it went into      effect. In 1995, two Columbine High School students got their      hands on assault weapons. We know the carnage they left      behind.       Assault weapons have no place in civil society. Congress      should reauthorize the law that bans them.                                  ____            [From the Hartford (CT) Courant, June 11, 2004]                       Renew Assault Weapons Ban       Time is running out on efforts to extend the federal      assault weapons ban, which is scheduled to expire Sept. 13.       There's no good reason why civilians should be allowed to      own these rapid firing, military-style weapons, which are      favored by criminals. The weapons have no legitimate use for      self-defense or hunting.       Unfortunately, Republican congressional leaders are ready      to do the bidding of the National Rifle Association, which      has fought the ban since it became law a decade ago.      President Bush favors an extension of the ban, but unless he      pressures Congress to act, it's likely that nothing will      happen.       That would be tragic. Once again, the nation's cities would      be flooded with an array of high-powered weapons on streets      and in homes. Police officials across the nation have pleaded      with Congress to extend the ban.       Connecticut U.S. Reps. Christopher Shays, Rosa DeLauro and      John Larson are among more than 100 House co-sponsors of the      proposed extension. Sen. Christopher J. Dodd recently added      his name as a Senate co-sponsor. The remaining members of      Connecticut's delegation, Reps. Nancy Johnson and Rob Simmons      and Sen. Joseph I. Lieberman, should joint them.       The proposed extension also would tighten current law to      close a loophole that has allowed manufacturers to sell the      weapons simply by making cosmetic changes in the banned      models.       Passage of the 1994 ban was an important step toward      reducing mayhem with powerful guns. Let's not take a step      backward.                                  ____                [From the New York Times, June 21, 2004]                           Guns and the Gipper        On last reflection on the death of Ronald Reagan:        In the debate over who can lay claim to the Reagan legacy,      one aspect of the late president's record has gotten little      attention.        That was Mr. Reagan's willingness to stand up to the      National Rifle Association and support the cause of gun      control when he thought it was right.        A decade ago, when the proposal to create a federal ban on      military-style assault weapons was teetering between      Congressional passage and defeat, Mr. Reagan personally      lobbied Republican House members to take what he called the      ``absolutely necessary'' step of outlawing the bullet-     spraying semiautomatic guns favored by criminals. His effort      proved crucial, as the legislation passed the House by just a      two-vote margin.        True, it was only after Mr. Reagan left office that he      woke up to the need for sensible national laws like the      assault weapons ban and background checks for gun buyers. As      president, he signed legislation weakening federal gun laws.      Right now, President Bush has the chance to go the Gipper one      better by waging a principled fight to renew the 10-year-old      assault weapons ban, which is due to expire in September. The      president is on record as favoring the ban's continuation.      But he steadfastly refuses to do anything to rally lawmakers      to renew and strengthen its proven, life-saving provisions.      Mr. Bush may please anti-gun-control extremists by presiding      over the extinction of the assault weapons ban. We doubt it      would have pleased Mr. Reagan.                                       ____         [From the St. Louis (MO) Post-Dispatch, June 25, 2004]                         A Landmark Settlement                              gun control       A court in West Virginia has approved a settlement      requiring a gun dealer to pay $1 million in damages to two      New Jersey police officers seriously wounded by a robber who      bought a gun through a straw party in West Virginia. This      agreement marks the first time a dealer will pay damages for      supplying a firearm to the illegal gun market. The lawsuit      accused the dealer, Will Jewelry & Loan of Charleston, W.Va.,      of negligence and creating a public nuisance by selling a      dozen handguns to a straw buyer. The straw buyer bought the      weapons for convicted felon James Gray.       Dennis Henigan, an official at the Brady Center to Prevent      Gun Violence in Washington, noted that the injured officers      would have collected nothing had the U.S. Senate approved      legislation in March to shield gun makers and dealers from      civil lawsuits. For a time, it seemed that the National Rifle      Association would pressure Congress to pass this bill. That      was before Democrats succeeded in adding two amendments. One      would have banned assault weapons, and the other would have      required background checks at private gun shows. Furious      Senate Republicans pulled the immunity bill and vowed to      stall the two amendments by not allowing the House to      consider them this year.       President George W. Bush can make a difference in this      election year by keeping his promise to extend the 1994 ban      on military-style assault weapons. The existing ban expires      in September. Mr. Bush didn't mention the issue when he      invited sporting groups to his ranch in Crawford, Texas, in      the spring. Nor did Vice President Dick Cheney mention it      when he held an antique rifle at April's NRA convention and      accused Democratic presidential candidate Sen. John Kerry of      being an enemy of gun makers and users.       The president appears to want to have it both ways. He says      he favors instituting background checks and extending the      weapons ban, yet he had urged the Senate not to add either      rider to the gun immunity bill. Granted, some of the banned      weapons, including the one Mr. Cheney held at the NRA      convention, are prized by collectors. And gun enthusiasts      point out that many of the banned weapons are no more      dangerous than guns in general but have a bad reputation      because of movies that glorify gun violence.       Trouble is, this violence spills over into real life. The      memory of Columbine is still sharp for many Americans,      although the carnage happened five years ago. Images of      snipers picking off innocent people in the Washington, DC,      area won't soon be forgotten. And the reckless use of      handguns and rifles to maim and murder is a daily occurrence      in our country.       Mr. Bush should give his unequivocal support to extending      the ban on military-style weapons that are used mainly to      kill people.                                  ____                 [From the Baltimore Sun, July 5, 2004]                            The Line of Fire       They buried Carlos Owen, Harley Chisholm III, and Charles      Bennett last month. The three Birmingham, Ala., police      officers were serving an arrest warrant in one of the city's      blighted neighborhoods when they were shot and killed. And      the incident has left people in that conservative, gun-owning      part of the country wondering whether maybe some weapons      shouldn't be so widely available.       The gun that killed the officers was an SKS, a rifle      similar to the notorious Russian AK-47. It's a military-style      assault weapon and, according to the federal Bureau of      Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives, a rifle often used      against law enforcement officers. It fires a 7.62 mm round at      2,300 feet per second, a velocity that's capable of      penetrating police body armor. Earlier this year, two other      Alabama police officers were killed in the line of duty. An      SKS was used in both shootings.       Why is this cop-killing gun allowed in circulation in this      country? It's not outlawed by the 10-year-old federal assault      weapons ban. The AK-47 was, but the makers of the SKS found a      way around the ban by making some minor modifications. Yet      their gun still has some of the most troubling qualities of      an assault weapon--an ability to accept a high-capacity      magazine and, even as a semiautomatic, spray a large number      of large bullets powerfully and accurately.       That, and the fact that it's cheap and lethal-looking, has      made the SKS a popular gun among criminals. An SKS can be      purchased for as little as $200. A used magazine capable of      holding 40 rounds might cost an extra $5. It's not a      particularly useful gun for hunting. It's not even that      popular with the general law-abiding public. All models of      assault weapons represent less than 5 percent of the guns in      circulation.       Yet here we are just a few months shy of the day the      federal assault weapons ban is set to expire and there's      little hope it will be renewed. It should be renewed--and      expanded to cover guns such as the SKS. President Bush said      four years ago that he supported an extension of the assault      weapons ban. A majority of the Senate supports it, too.      Right-wing House Republicans don't. President Bush could      probably overcome that opposition, but he won't even talk      about the issue. Clearly, he'd rather the whole thing went      away quietly.       Of course it won't go away for the families of those      murdered Birmingham police officers. While a renewal wouldn't      take the existing SKS rifles off the street, letting the ban      expire in September would open the door to even deadlier      models. What message would that decision send to future cop-     killers? A lot of Americans, gun owners and police officers      included, have been left to ponder: What compelling reason is      there to allow bad guys to own assault weapons? And how can      the president of the United States continue to claim to      support a ban but not lift a finger for the cause?                                  ____                   [From the Oregonian, July 5, 2004]                        Back to Assault Weapons       Summary: Without pressure from President Bush and action by      Congress, the 1994 ban on military-style guns will expire.       When a man used an assault rifle to shoot three people at a      California community center in 1999, then-presidential      candidate George W. Bush declared, ``It makes no sense for      assault weapons to be around our society.''       It still doesn't. President Bush promised during his first      campaign to uphold a ban on assault weapons, but he isn't      lifting a finger now to prevent the popular law from      expiring. The assault weapons ban approved in 1994 by      Congress and signed by President Clinton was written to      sunset after 10 years. Time's up at midnight on Sept. 13.       The White House claims Bush supports extending the ban and      would sign a bill renewing the law if Congress sends him one.      But earlier this year, Bush helped defeat a gun bill that      included the ban on assault weapons. The president also has      done nothing to encourage Congress to act on the issue in the      dwindling days of this session.       That's a dangerous mistake. Bush was absolutely right when      he told voters that assault weapons have no place in American      society. These military-style weapons, with rapid-fire      capabilities and large-capacity magazines capable of holding      dozens of rounds of ammunition, are not hunting or sporting      weapons. They are designed for just one thing: shooting      people.       Polls show that Americans strongly favor renewing the ban      on these weapons. In late 2003 an NBC/Wall Street Journal      poll found that 78 percent of adults nationwide expressed      support for renewing the federal ban. A University of      Pennsylvania National Annenberg Election Survey found in      April 2004 that even 64 percent of the people in households      with guns favor the law.       Every major law enforcement organization in the nation      backs the ban on assault weapons, including the Fraternal      Order of Police, the National Sheriffs' Association and the      International Association of Chiefs of Police. Every police      agency understands the dangers of these weapons in the hands      of drug traffickers, gangs and terrorists.       Yet House Speaker Dennis Hastert, R-Ill., and other GOP      leaders seem determined to prevent the renewal of the assault      weapons ban from even coming to a vote. We strongly urge      members of the Oregon congressional delegation to join the      bill to reauthorize the ban and to pressure the leadership to      bring the matter up for a vote before the law sunsets in      September.       While several studies show a marked decline since 1994 in      assault weapons traced to crime, we'll concede that the      federal ban has not been a fully effective defense against      these guns. The law grandfathered existing assault weapons in      1994, and manufacturers have exploited loopholes in the law      by producing copycat weapons with only cosmetic differences.       A responsible Congress, and one not in the thrall of the      National Rifle Association, would tighten the law, fix the      loopholes and make the ban on these weapons permanent. If      that's too much to ask, we'd settle for the president to keep      his word on this issue and demand that Congress renew the      existing ban on assault weapons.                                  ____          [From the San Jose (CA) Mercury News, July 5, 2004]      Bush Is Doing Nothing To Help Extend Ban on Assault Weapons       The federal law outlawing some of the most dangerous      military-style guns will expire Sept. 13, leaving the nation      more vulnerable to horrific crimes.       The Republican leadership in the House has bottled up the      bill extending the 10-year-old assault-weapons ban. But      President Bush will bear part of the blame if nothing is      done.       The president has recently repeated his promise, first made      when running for president in 2000, to sign an extension.      But, unlike his push for the war in Iraq and a tax cut, he      has not lifted a finger to see that the bill reaches his      desk, and the gun lobby has vowed to keep it from getting      there. Bush wants to have it both ways.       The ban has been only modestly successful in curbing the      sale of rapid-fire semi-automatic weapons. Gun manufacturers      have devised ways around it; copycat models and high-capacity      magazines, imported from abroad, proliferate.       But the answer is to tighten and to expand the law, along      the lines of California's smartly effective 5-year-old      assault-weapons ban, and not to return to the days when a      wannabe drug dealer or cop killer could buy an Uzi at a local      gun shop.       Law enforcement groups are urging that the ban be      continued. It would be a travesty if officers once again find      themselves outgunned on the streets they are sworn to      protect.
