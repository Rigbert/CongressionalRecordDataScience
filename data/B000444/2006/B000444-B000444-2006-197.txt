 President, I thank the Senator.  I have been listening to the debate in my office, and I understand the concern the leadership is expressing. It seems to me it boils down to an inadvertent concern. But, folks, I think the Senator from Wisconsin has a point. I have had it as my practice since I have been in the Senate--and I don't think it is so hard--that when you sit down and have a meal, to just split the bill or you pay for it. I don't get that.  Now, I am going to vote with the Senator. I expect he is going to lose on a tabling motion. But maybe there is a way he can come back and tighten up this inadvertent piece. Because I do understand. I have been in a position where I have sat with someone, told them I cannot let them buy my lunch. They go ahead--and it is a friend or somebody who I have known for a while--and I found out later they paid with a company credit card. They told me they were.  Now, I know that is an exception. I know because the person is a friend, it would get me out anyway of the exception under this rule. But the point I am making is, I can picture someone saying ``Don't worry. I am taking care of my share,'' and it is a company credit card. If that is the worry, there ought to be a way to deal with that.  But I say, with due respect--there is nobody I am closer to and think has more wisdom than the Senator from Connecticut--but this one seems pretty simple to me. If someone buys you lunch, buys you dinner, buys you breakfast, you can say: Hey, I want half the bill.  I am going to support the Senator. But maybe if it loses, there is a way to come back at it a different way. I don't know.
