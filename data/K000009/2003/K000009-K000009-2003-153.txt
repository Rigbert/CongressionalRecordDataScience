Speaker, teamsters Union Local Number 20 celebrates its 100-year anniversary in 2003. For a century, hardworking men and women have come together for the good of the many as they strove to bring their families a better life.  Chartered in 1903, Local 20's first members were icehouse workers. Over the years, four Teamsters Locals came together to form the present-day Local 20, 7,200 members united. Teamsters Local 20 represents members in fifteen counties in Northwest Ohio, including not only truck drivers but nursing home workers, candy makers, and makers of fiberglass. Uniquely, in a truly representational form of operation, stewards from every shop the union represents form the Stewards Council, which sets the policy for the union.  As noted in the union's history, much has changed in the hundred years since Teamsters Local 20 has been chartered: horses were driven rather than trucks, one of two children died in childhood, women were denied the right to vote, there were no child labor laws, no civil rights, no Social Security, no workers compensation, no unemployment compensation, no federal protection for working rights and unions, no workplace safety requirements, no overtime pay or minimum wage, no right to bargain collectively, and no forty hour work week.  The history of our nation's social protection as these basic rights were guaranteed is the history of the Teamsters as well, for their struggles are intertwined with our nation's awakening to social justice. Without Teamster families, and the millions of others in the labor movement, we would yet be in those dark ages of the past. This 100th anniversary is a good time to remind all Americans that we would not enjoy the standard of living we enjoy now without the efforts of united labor. Daniel Webster said, ``Liberty and Union, now and forever, one and inseparable.'' Though he meant these words in another context, their meaning rings true for our own time. It is the union men and women who built this nation, who power it now, and whose prosperity must drive it forward.  I am pleased to recognize the 100th anniversary of Teamsters Local 20, and pay special tribute to its members as we commemorate this milestone. Thank you for your contributions to the labor movement, to our communities, our nation, and our future.                          ____________________
