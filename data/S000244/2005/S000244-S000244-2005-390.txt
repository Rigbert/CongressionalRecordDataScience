Chairman, I thank the gentleman from Georgia for yielding.  What the Kelo decision has said is that the land that the house of God is built on belongs to Caesar and Caesar can go condemn the land that the house of God is built on to turn it to into a strip mall or hotel or whatever will bring in more tax base, and that is wrong.  The amendment that the gentleman from Georgia has offered simply states that the tax-exempt status of a religious or nonprofit organization cannot be used for a taking under the Kelo case. The amendment is a good one. It ought to be supported, and I am happy that he offered it.
