President, I rise today to introduce legislation that seeks to remove barriers to learning by encouraging communities to coordinate community services through school-based or school-linked family centers. These centers would provide a comprehensive array of information, support, services, and activities to improve the education, health, mental health, safety, and economic well-being of children and their families.  As we strive to ensure the academic and future success of our students, we must recognize that the increasingly complex needs of children cannot be met by our schools and teachers alone. Children bring many social, health, and family problems to school, which leaves them in no shape to learn.  Some facts to illustrate this point:  Today, 7.5 million children under the age of 18 require mental health services, while the National Institute of Mental Health estimates that fewer than one in five receive the help they need.  11.3 million children--more than 90 percent of them in working families--have no health insurance.  It is estimated that nearly five million school-age children spend time without adult supervision during a typical week. Meanwhile, FBI data show that the peak hours for violent juvenile crime occur during the after-school hours of 3:00 p.m. to 8:00 p.m.  Also according to the FBI, juveniles accounted for 17 percent of all violent crime arrests in 1997, and juveniles are victims in nearly 25 percent of all crimes.  Programs and services exist to deal with these and other needs facing children--SCHIP, WIC, and after school programs, to name a few. However, too many children can't access such programs and services, and, consequently, too many children don't get the help they need. This is because these services are often too disjointed and fragmented, making it difficult for many families to find a point of entry. This problem is especially acute in low-income urban and rural areas.  To address these and other serious issues facing our children and families, a few states and localities have established centers and developed programs designed to provide families with access and linkages to needed social services, like health and mental health care, nutritional programs, child care, housing, and job training, in a location that is easily accessed by families--their children's school. The aim of my legislation is to support and expand such efforts.  Research indicates that school-linked family center programs are a cost-effective way to provide supports to children and families. According to a report by the Department of Education's Northeast and Islands Regional Educational Laboratory, school-linked services can also ``help to increase student achievement, save money and reduce overlapping services, reach those children and families most in need, make schools more welcoming to families, increase community support for the school, and help at-risk families develop the capacity to manage their own lives successfully.'' Moreover, according to a 1999 American Association of School Administrators Nationwide Survey, 82 percent of parents would like family centers in their schools to help improve their schools.  My legislation, the Child Opportunity Zone Family Center Act, builds on a successful model in my home state of Rhode Island, the Rhode Island Child Opportunity Zone (COZ) Family Center initiative, as well as Kentucky's Family Resource and Youth Service Centers, and Minnesota's Family Service program.  The Child Opportunity Zone Family Center Act, which is supported by more than 30 health, education, and children's organizations, would provide grants on a competitive basis to partnerships consisting of a high poverty public school; school district; other public agency, such as a department of health or social services; and non-profit community organizations. Partnerships would be required to complete a needs assessment, and then use this information to provide children and families with linkages to existing community prevention and intervention services in core areas such as education, child care, non-school hours care and enrichment programs, health services, mental health services, nutrition, family support, literacy services, parenting skills, and dropout prevention. In addition, partnerships would provide violence prevention education to children and families, as well as training to enable families to help their children meet challenging standards and succeed in school.  The guiding principle of Rhode Island's COZ Family Centers is to help children and families get the assistance they need so children are ready to learn in the classroom. This principle is reflected in my legislation, which contains accountability provisions to ensure that partnerships focus on improvements in student achievement, family participation in schools, access to health care, mental health care, child care, as well as family support services, and work to reduce violence among youth, truancy, suspension, and dropout rates in order to continue to receive funding.  As we again begin to consider the reauthorization of the Elementary and Secondary Education Act, I believe that it is critical that we do all we can to provide a seamless, integrated system of support for children and families. By giving families an opportunity to get the support they need, we can truly help children come to school ready to learn and in turn help children succeed in school and life. I urge my colleagues to cosponsor this important legislation and work for its inclusion in the upcoming reauthorization of the Elementary and Secondary Education Act.  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be printed in the Record along with a letter of support.  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in the Record, as follows:                                 S. 371       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of      the United States of America in Congress assembled,     SECTION 1.

Dear Senator Reed: The undersigned organizations,      representing parents, educators, early childhood      professionals, health professionals, pupil services      personnel, and education advocates thank you for introducing      the Child Opportunity Zone Family Center Act (COZ). The Reed      COZ bill would ensure the coordination of services in order      to remove barriers to learning. According to a report of the      Northeast and Islands Regional Educational Laboratory,      school-linked services ``help to increase student      achievement, save money, and reduce overlapping services,      reach those children and families most in need, make schools      more welcoming to families, increase community support for      the school, and help at-risk families develop the capacity to      manage their own lives successfully.''       Unfortunately, too many children today are struggling with      a variety of problems that make their ability to meet      challenging academic standards much more difficult.      Inadequate access to health care, lack of family and child      mental health services, poor nutrition, abuse, and other      social ills undercut these children's ability to succeed in      the classroom and in their daily lives. The coordination of      schools with the range of supportive services that children      and families need is particularly important in low-income      urban and rural areas. Families that need and would otherwise      be eligible to receive services simply cannot access them      without coordination at or through the schools.       The Reed COZ bill draws on successful efforts already      underway in some areas. Kentucky's Family Resource and Youth      Service Centers, Minnesota's Family Service program, and      Rhode Island's Child Opportunity Zone Family Center      Initiative need to be replicated more widely. The current      barriers to these important services are pervasive in every      state. We believe that these proposed grants are critical to      helping schools and school districts partner with communities      and parents to make possible the school-     linked or school-based coordination of the necessary services      for strengthening our nation's children.       Once again, we thank you for introducing the Reed Child      Opportunity Zone Family Center Act. We look forward to      working with you on this and many other important issues in      the future.           Sincerely,       American Association of University Women.
