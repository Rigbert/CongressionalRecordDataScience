Madam Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.  I want to thank the gentleman from South Carolina (Mr. Brown) and the ranking member, the gentleman from Maine (Mr. Michaud), of the Subcommittee on Benefits for their strong support and work in crafting this legislation; and to my good friend, the gentleman from Illinois (Mr. Evans), the ranking member on the full committee.  Madam Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.
