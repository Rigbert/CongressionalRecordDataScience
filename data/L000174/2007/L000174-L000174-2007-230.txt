Kyl (for himself, Mr. Lieberman, Ms. Collins, and Mr. Ensign)) proposed an amendment to the bil H.R. 2764, making appropriations for the Department of State, foreign operations, and related programs for the fiscal year ending September 30, 2008, and for other purposes; as follows:       On page 410, between lines 15 and 16, insert the following:                RULE OF LAW AND BORDER SECURITY IN EGYPT       Sec. 699B.  (a) The Senate makes the following findings:       (1) Fighting in Gaza during the summer of 2007 demonstrated      that the terrorist organization Hamas, which unlawfully      seized control over Gaza in June 2007, has been able to      achieve a dramatic increase in the quantity and      sophistication of arms at its disposal.       (2) Without these arms, the terrorist organization would      not have been able to seize control over the Gaza territory.       (3) There is substantial evidence that a significant      proportion of these arms were smuggled across the border      between Gaza and Egypt.       (4) The Egyptian military is a capable force, made possible      in substantial part by a close relationship with the United      States.       (5) Concurrent with the escalation of dangerous arms      smuggling across the border between Egypt and Gaza has been a      retrogression in the rule of law in Egypt.       (6) This loss of hard-earned ground has been characterized      by reports of harsh reaction by the Government of Egypt to      dissent, including the jailing of political opponents.       (7) The United States has provided aid to Egypt in excess      of $28,000,000,000 over the past three decades.       (b) The Senate--       (1) reaffirms its long-standing friendship with the people      of Egypt;       (2) believes that our friendship with Egypt requires the      Senate to address such vital policy concerns;       (3) urges the Government of Egypt to make concrete and      measurable progress on restoring the rule of law, including      improving the independence of the judiciary and improving      criminal procedures and due process rights and halting the      cross-border flow of arms to Gaza;       (4) believes it is the best interest of Egypt, the region,      and the United States that Egypt takes prompt action to      demonstrate progress on these matters; and       (5) urges the Department of State to work vigorously and      expeditiously with the Government of Egypt and the Government      of Israel to bring the border between Egypt and Gaza border      under effective control.                                 ______                                   SA 2787.
