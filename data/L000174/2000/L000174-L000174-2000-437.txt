President, I note we had discussion about whether people want to prolong this debate. We do want to have debate on the constitutional amendment. People have given tremendous speeches, pro and con, on this issue. I hope everybody will vote for cloture, for example. But let us not have any suggestion that anybody here is trying to stop a vote on this constitutional amendment. We all want it. But most Senators believe, if you are going to amend the Constitution, it requires at least more debate and more time than we might give to a simple resolution.  I yield 5 minutes to the distinguished Senator from Wisconsin.
