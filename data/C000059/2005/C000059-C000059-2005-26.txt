Speaker, I move to suspend the rules and agree to the resolution (H. Res 450) recognizing Space Shuttle Commander Eileen Collins, Mission Specialist Wendy Lawrence, and the contributions of all other women who have worked with NASA following the successful mission of Space Shuttle Discovery on STS-114, as amended.  The Clerk read as follows:                              H. Res. 450       Whereas the National Aeronautics and Space Administration      was created in 1958 under President Eisenhower and has, since      then, accomplished great things in the fields of science,      technology, aeronautics, and aerospace exploration;       Whereas women have worked since the 1960's for the right to      play a vital role in NASA's missions in outer space;       Whereas after more than twenty years of waiting, the first      American woman, Sally Ride, flew in outer space in 1983      aboard the Space Shuttle Challenger;       Whereas in 1984, Kathryn Sullivan became the first American      woman to perform a space walk aboard the Space Shuttle      Challenger during mission STS-41;       Whereas in 1986, Christa McAuliffe, who was to be the first      teacher and civilian in space after being selected from      11,000 applicants, and Mission Specialist Judith Resnick,      were killed aboard the space shuttle Challenger just 73      seconds after lift-off during mission STS-51L;       Whereas in 1992, Mae Jemison became the first African-     American woman to fly in outer space aboard the Space Shuttle      Endeavor during mission STS-47;       Whereas Shannon Lucid previously held the United States      record for the amount of time spent living and working in      space on a single mission aboard the Russian Mir space-     station for over 6 months in 1996;       Whereas in 1999, Eileen Collins became the first woman to      command a space mission when Space Shuttle Columbia deployed      the Chandra X-Ray Observatory;       Whereas in 2003, Mission Specialists Kalpana Chawla and      Laurel Clark were killed aboard the Space Shuttle Columbia on      reentry during mission STS-107;       Whereas we celebrate America's Return to Flight with Space      Shuttle Discovery's STS-114 mission, which Eileen Collins      commanded and on which Wendy Lawrence served as Mission      Specialist; and       Whereas great strides have been made in the Space Shuttle      and International Space Station era to increase the number      and prominence of women serving in the NASA Astronaut Corp,      thereby giving us hope for the future of American women in      space, including Ellen Baker, Yvonne Cagle, Tracy Caldwell,      Kalpana Chawla, Laurel B.
