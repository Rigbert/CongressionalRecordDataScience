President, today I recognize the achievement of the La Salle Academy Players, the theater troupe from my high school alma mater, which recently gave four performances of ``The Scottish Play: Macbeth'' at the Edinburgh Fringe Festival. This prestigious event, the world's largest arts festival, is held annually in Scotland.  The La Salle Players were one of only 43 high school troupes chosen to perform from among hundreds of high school drama programs by the American High School Theatre Festival. La Salle Academy was the first Rhode Island private high school and only the second Rhode Island high school to have been selected in the 14 years that the American High School Theatre Festival has participated in the Fringe Festival.  I am especially pleased to share that, by all reports, the young men and women of the La Salle Players conducted themselves with great talent and poise, representing both their school and their country with distinction.  I want to individually recognize the cast and crew, faculty, and staff, who were instrumental to this effort: Brother Michael McKenery, the president of La Salle Academy, served as producer. The student cast and crew included Trisha Moise, Tiia Groden, Gabbie Whitney, John Pleasants, Dan Tracy, John Coletta, Nick Oliveira, Nick Montecalvo, Ryan Zins, Cam Burns, Matt Petrarca, Mark Sullivan, Valentina Szlashta, Michael Commendatore, Alex Schlageter, Sean Walsh, Kevin Cronin, Molly B. Allen, Katie Ryan, Emily Maher, Colin Whitney, Ashley Smith, Stephen Zukauskas, JR McKenzie, and Michael Gebhart. Faculty and staff included Thomas Haynes, Elissa Cerros, Margaret Hayes, and David Cabral.                          ____________________
