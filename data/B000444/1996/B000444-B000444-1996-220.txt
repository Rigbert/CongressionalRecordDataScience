 We had won until he went back down in the well. This is a singular victory for the leadership. I compliment him, but I am just so sorry that he has now locked up the nomination and will not be out in the field more because it looked like I was winning there until three votes changed at the end. But I wish to congratulate the opposition and tell the cities they are not going to get their cops. I yield the floor.
