 President, I thank the Senator from Tennessee for his willingness to work with us to craft a solution to a very real problem. He shares with the Ranking Member and I a long history of concern for American taxpayers struggling with the overwhelming expense and other demands of severely disabled relatives. As the Senator knows, Special Needs Trusts, also known as Supplemental Needs Trusts, are a common estate planning tool for assisting in the planning for the long-term financial needs of the disabled.  The Senator and others have helped bring to our attention the fact that these trusts are unduly burdened by the current trust tax requirements of Section 1(e) of the Internal Revenue Code. We recognize that these Special Needs Trusts will receive some relief under the Relief Act of 2001, but that more help is necessary. Therefore, I commit myself to the Senator from Tennessee to work with him and others to craft a solution to reduce the income tax burden imposed on special needs trusts and, simultaneously, to improve the lot of affected disabled Americans.
