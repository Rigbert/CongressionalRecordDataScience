Speaker, we here in the Congress have just returned to conduct the Nation's business, and our hearts are with the families and individuals who have lost loved ones and are scattered across this country as a result of the terrible, terrible devastation of Hurricane Katrina.  The House of Representatives this evening met with the President's Cabinet for nearly 3 hours, and this evening I would like to address concerns regarding how the institutions of this Nation failed the American people and what can be done about it as we try to heal as a Nation and thank those who are extending their compassion and assistance and to try to give strength to those who have suffered so much. There is not a single American who does not feel just horrible about what has happened, and we in the Congress bear responsibility, as does this administration, for the response and its shortcomings.  There is a story today in the Wall Street Journal entitled: ``Behind Poor Katrina Response, a Long Chain of Weak Links.'' I would like to enter that into the Record and read from a key section of that article that talks about what went wrong.                              {time}  2245  Number one, the absorption of the Federal Emergency Management Agency into the gargantuan and terrorism-focused Department of Homeland Security, which I voted against as a Member of this Congress over 2 years ago; I served on the Committee on Appropriations where FEMA came before us. We had an agency that finally worked after 10 years of reform in the Clinton administration, and James Lee Witt, the director of that agency, did such a terrific job. All of that changed as FEMA was subsumed under this gargantuan Department of Homeland Security, which in essence had a very different kind of mission.  Just 2 weeks ago, as the Wall Street Journal article recounts, five State emergency managers brought a tough message here to Washington, this was before Katrina, and met with Michael Chertoff, the Homeland Security Secretary. And these emergency directors told them straight out that the administration was weakening emergency management with potentially dangerous consequences. In fact, Dave Liebersback, the Director of Alaska's Division of Homeland Security and Emergency Management, said that the Department's focus on terrorism was undermining its readiness here at home.  The article goes on to say that there were not firm procedures in place, for example, for directing people and materials when a national emergency such as Katrina would strike. And this article, along with other information that I choose to enter into the record this evening, shows that the appropriations for the funding of FEMA, as part of this major new department, were actually cut by over $600 million in the area of regional operations. These are bad decisions that need to be reversed. The American people and we here in this Congress must do this.  A few years ago, when the Department of Homeland Security was being debated here in the Congress, I stated, and reread for the record tonight, ``I do not want FEMA put in the Department of Homeland Security. Why? Because FEMA worked. It took us 10 years to fix FEMA back during the decades of the 1990s, so why do we want to stick FEMA into this big new department that will have 170,000 people in it, and we cannot even get direct communications up to the top? The United States fought World War II, and we did not need a Department of Homeland Security. We defeated the Communists during the Cold War, and we didn't need a 170,000-person Department of Homeland Security. We fought the Persian Gulf War, and we did not need it.''  But our words were not successful here in the Congress. And we ended up with a majority of Members of Congress passing a Department of Homeland Security that buried FEMA far underneath this mammoth administrative structure. I hate to call it a management structure because it became a mismanagement structure. And then funding for local responses was cut by over $600 million.  Interestingly, the Web site of the current Committee on Homeland Security here in the U.S. House of Representatives indicates a vacancy in the chairmanship, with the movement of Mr. Cox of California to the Securities and Exchange Commission. So even one of the key committees here in the House lacks the key chair as we move into this difficult period.  But the point is that there has been very bad decision making here in the Congress that relegated FEMA in terms of domestic affairs, and also, those put in charge over the last 5 years have had absolutely no hands-on experience with emergency management.  Mr. Speaker, as I mentioned previously, the articles I referred to earlier are submitted hereafter for inclusion in the Record.                            What Went Wrong?       Some reasons why the U.S. didn't adequately protect and      rescue its citizens from a natural disaster.       The absorption of the Federal Emergency Management Agency      into the gargantuan--and terrorism-focused--Department of      Homeland Security.       A military stretched by wars in Iraq and Afghanistan, which      made commanders reluctant to commit some active-duty units      nearby.       A total breakdown of communications systems.       Missteps at the local level, including a rudimentary plan      to deal with hurricanes.       A failure to plan for the possibility that New Orleans's      levee system would fail.                                       ____             [From the Wall Street Journal, Sept. 6, 2005]   Power Failure: Behind Poor Katrina Response, a Long Chain of Weak Links--Changing Structure of FEMA, Emphasis on Terrorism Contributed to                   Problems--a Shortage of Helicopters   (By Robert Block, Amy Schatz, Gary Fields and Christopher Cooper)       Just two weeks ago, five state emergency managers brought a      tough message to a meeting in Washington with Homeland      Security Secretary Michael Chertoff and his top deputies.       ``We told them straight out that they were weakening      emergency management with potentially disastrous      consequences,'' says Dave Liebersbach, the director of      Alaska's Division of Homeland Security and Emergency      Management. The department's focus on terrorism was      undermining its readiness for other catastrophes, said the      visiting officials, who included emergency managers from      Mississippi and Alabama.       Now that Hurricane Katrina has left the Gulf Coast flooded      and New Orleans in ruins, the question ricocheting around the      nation and the world is this: How could the world's biggest      superpower fail so badly in protecting and rescuing its      residents from a natural disaster so frequently foretold?       The answer is sure to receive intense scrutiny this fall in      Congress and around the nation, especially given revived      fears that the U.S. is ill-prepared for a terrorist attack.      ``We are going to take a hard, hard look at our disaster-     response procedures,'' said Republican Majority Leader Bill      Frist of Tennessee this weekend as he assisted patients at      the New Orleans airport.       Yesterday, the government moved aggressively to show it has      the situation in hand. President Bush paid his second visit      to the region in four days, visiting Baton Rouge, La., and      Poplarville, Miss. He asserted that federal, state and local      governments are ``doing the best we can.'' The major levee      breach in New Orleans, at the 17th Street Canal, was closed,      allowing the city to begin pumping out floodwaters, a process      expected to take about 30 days.       Meanwhile, thousands of federal troops appeared to be      firmly in control of the city, with most residents evacuated      and searches for survivors well underway. A Customs and      Border Protection aircraft operating as a flying      communication link gave first responders in New Orleans the      ability to communicate for the first time since Katrina      struck more than a week ago. In suburban Jefferson Parish,      thousands of residents were allowed to check their homes      under tight restrictions to evaluate what was left.       But the weekend's progress hasn't erased the troubling      questions left by the government's delayed understanding of      the scope of the damage last week and its initial slowness in      mounting rescues and bringing food and water to stricken      citizens. The problems include:       The decision to transform the Federal Emergency Management      Agency from a cabinet-level agency reporting directly to the      president to just one piece of a new, gargantuan Department      of Homeland Security, which altered FEMA's mission and      watered down its powers.       Too few helicopters stationed in the Gulf Coast area ahead      of the storm.       A military stretched by wars in Iraq and Afghanistan, which      left commanders near New Orleans reluctant to commit some      active-duty units at nearby Fort Polk, La., because they were      in the midst of preparing for an Afghan deployment this      winter.       A total breakdown of communications systems, an echo of the      problems that faced New York officials dealing with the 2001      terrorist attacks and a system the government has been trying      to fix for four years.       Poor coordination among federal, state and local officials      in the days immediately before and after the hurricane.       Failure at all levels of government to take seriously many      studies and reports over many years warning of the potential      disaster.       Indeed, despite many warnings of the dangers, Mr. Chertoff      and other administration officials have explained their poor      initial response by saying government planners didn't expect      both a serious hurricane and a breach in levees. ``This is      really one which I think was breathtaking in its surprise,''      Mr. Chertoff told reporters on Saturday.       Planners, he said, ``were confronted with a second wave      that they did not have built into the plan, but using the      tools they had, we have to move forward and adapt.''       Plenty of missteps at the local level contributed to last      week's disaster too, from a failure to take basic steps to      protect the telecom infrastructure to inadequate food and      water at the Superdome. New Orleans may be able to stage      events such as Mardi Gras and Jazzfest and provide parking,      crowd control and adequate toilets for millions of visitors,      but its hurricane plan was more rudimentary. ``Get people to      higher ground and have the feds and the state airlift      supplies to them--that was the plan, man,'' Mayor Ray Nagin      said in an interview yesterday.       But so far, the federal government is bearing the brunt of      criticism, given its vast resources and unique role in      responding to major disasters. Critics say the response shows      that the nation's disaster-response system, rebuilt in the      wake of the 2001 terrorist attacks, is woefully inadequate.      In a Washington Post-ABC News poll taken on Friday, the      public said by a 67% to 31 % margin that the federal      government wasn't adequately prepared for Katrina.       ``What the events of the last week have shown is that over      the last few years since 9/11 we have slowly disassembled our      national emergency response system and put in its place      something far inferior,'' says Bill Waugh, an academic expert      on emergency management at Georgia State University. ``We      reinvented the wheel when we didn't need to and now have      something that doesn't roll very well at all.''       Many of last week's problems are rooted in January 2003,      when the Bush administration, urged on by some members of      Congress, created the Homeland Security Department. It      amalgamated 22 agencies, from the Coast Guard to the Secret      Service, creating the largest government bureaucracy since      the Pentagon was formed in 1947.       From the start, emergency experts and even the Government      Accountability Office, the investigative arm of Congress,      warned that a special effort was needed to be sure FEMA's      traditional mission of providing disaster relief wasn't lost      in the shuffle.       But it was. FEMA's clout had long depended on its ability      to help states plan for natural disasters by providing      emergency preparedness grants and other resources. Under      Homeland Security, grant-making decisions were transferred to      a new, department-wide office in an attempt to consolidate      funding. As a result, FEMA lost control of more than $800      million in preparedeness grants since 2003, congressional      figures show. State emergency managers and congressional      investigators say the overwhelming focus for grants is now      on fighting terrorism. More money goes to local police and      fire departments for that mission than responding to and      recover from disasters.       Officials from Shelby County, Ala., for instance, last year      said they could get federal money for chemical suits. But      they were unable to get money for an emergency operations      center that could link computers, phones and televisions to      respond to tornadoes. Between 1957 and 2003, the county had      20 tornadoes that it said killed 11 people and caused more      than $32 million in damages.       Meanwhile, morale at FEMA has dropped since it was subsumed      by Homeland Security. Several key jobs are unfilled and its      executives are overtaxed. Its acting chief operating officer      in Washington, for instance, is also the director of FEMA's      Atlanta region; his seat there is being held by another      acting director. That area includes much of the hurricane-     prone Southeast.       In July, Mr. Chertoff unveiled a departmental restructuring      that would cement FEMA's reduced role. Among other moves, the      plan restricted FEMA's purview to disaster response,      stripping away longstanding functions such as helping      communities build houses outside flood zones.       The plan, he told Congress, was ``to take out of FEMA a      couple of elements that were really not related to its core      missions, that were generally focused on the issue of      preparedness in a way that I think was frankly more of a      distraction to FEMA than an enhancement to FEMA.''       On July 27, Alaska's Mr. Liebersbach, in his role as the      head of the National Emergency Management Association, an      association of state emergency management directors, warned      in a letter to Congress that Mr. Chertoff's plan was nothing      short of disastrous. It would have ``an extremely negative      impact on the people of this nation,'' he wrote.       ``The proposed reorganization increases the separation      between preparedness, response and recovery functions,'' the      letter said. ``Any unnecessary separation of these functions      will result in disjointed response and adversely impact the      effectiveness of departmental operations.'' It was the letter      that prompted the meetings with Homeland Security officials      in late August.       Last week's response certainly revealed cracks in the      current system. Though President Bush declared a state of      emergency before Katrina made landfall on Monday, officials      appear to have underestimated the severity of the damage      caused by the storm. By Tuesday it became clear that the      response was not meeting needs and that FEMA and Louisiana      emergency teams were overwhelmed. Then the flood waters hit      in New Orleans. It still took several more hours for Mr.      Chertoff to declare the disaster an ``incident of national      significance.''       Even then, some requirements hampered speed. Because of      worries that terrorists could take advantage of such chaos,      FEMA now must abide by post-9/11 security procedures, such as      putting air marshals on flights. That meant stranded      residents couldn't be evacuated from the New Orleans airport      until FEMA had rounded up dozens of Transportation Security      Administration screeners and more than 50 federal air      marshals. Inadequate power prevented officials from firing      up X-ray machines and metal detectors until the government      decided evacuees could be searched manually.       In the hours before and after Katrina struck, there weren't      firm procedures in place for directing people and materials.      Dan Wessel, owner of Cool Express Inc., a Blue River, Wis.,      transportation company that contracts with FEMA to move      supplies, said he didn't get a green light to send trucks to      a staging area in Dallas until about 4 p.m. Monday, hours      after Katrina made landfall. That was too late to meet a      deadline of getting trucks to Dallas by noon Tuesday, he      said.       Once the trucks arrived, drivers often found no National      Guard troops, FEMA     workers or other personnel on hand to help unload the water      and ice, Mr. Wessel said. ``I almost told the guys to leave,      but people are wanting the water,'' he said. ``The drivers      distributed it.''       Inside New Orleans, said Dr. Joseph Guarisco, chief of the      emergency department of Ochsner Clinic Foundation, a 580-bed      hospital in New Orleans above the water line, said there was      confusion about where to direct evacuees seeking shelter.       For a couple of days, Dr. Guarisco said, he directed a      stream of patients to what he understood was a FEMA mass-     casualty tent at the intersection of Interstate 10 and      Causeway Boulevard. ``A number came back and said, `there's      no one there.' '' Dr. Guarisco said.       Some critics have blamed the war in Iraq, and the      deployment of thousands of troops, including National Guard      members, to that effort. President Bush has vehemently denied      that charge. The administration has said problems on the      ground were due to an unexpectedly severe storm and      unanticipated flooding.       Four weeks before the hurricane, Lt. Colonel Pete      Schneider, of the Louisiana National Guard, told WGNO, a      local ABC affiliate, that when guard members left for Iraq      last October, they took a lot of needed equipment with them,      including dozens of high-water vehicles, Humvees, refueling      tankers and generators that would be needed in the event a      major natural disaster hit the state.       ``You've got combatant commanders over there who need it,      they say they need it, they don't want to lose what they have      and we certainly understand that,'' he said. ``It's a matter      of us educating that combatant commander [that] we need it      back here as well.''       Col. Schneider also said the state had enough equipment to      get by, and that if Louisiana were to get hit by a major      hurricane, the neighboring states of Mississippi, Alabama and      Florida had all agreed to help. In the end, those states were      hit by Katrina as well.       The U.S. Army has a large facility, Fort Polk, in      Leesville, La., about 270 miles northwest of New Orleans.      Officials at Fort Polk, which has nearly 8,000 active duty      soldiers, said their contribution so far has consisted of a      few dozen soldiers from the 10th Mountain Division manning      purification equipment and driving half-ton trucks filled      with supplies and equipment. The first contingent of      soldiers didn't receive orders until Saturday afternoon.       A spokeswoman at Fort Polk said she did not know why the      base received its deployment orders so late in the game.      ``You'd have to ask the Pentagon,'' she said. A senior Army      official said the service was reluctant to commit the 4th      brigade of the 10th Mountain Division from Fort Polk, because      the unit, which numbers several thousand soldiers, is in the      midst of preparing for an Afghanistan deployment in January.       Instead, the Pentagon chose to send upwards of 7,500      soldiers from the 1st Cavalry Division at Fort Hood, Texas      and the 82nd Airborne Division from Fort Bragg, N.C., along      with Marines from California and North Carolina. Soldiers      from the 82nd Airborne Division are able to deploy anywhere      in the world in 18 hours. It took several days for them to      arrive on the ground in Louisiana.       There, no piece of equipment was more necessary than      helicopters. But in the first 48 hours after the levees were      breached, the shortage of helicopters became acute. FEMA      wanted choppers to save stranded residents, while the Army      Corps of Engineers needed the aircraft, known as ``rotary      wing'' in military jargon, to repair the breaches. The Coast      Guard, the primary agency responding to the disaster in New      Orleans, had a total of 20 aircraft in the area, mostly      helicopters, which focused solely on rescue operations.       ``We have very limited aviation assets and rotary wing is      what we need to put materials into those breaches, and that's      the very asset we need to do search and rescue and save      victims, so our efforts became something of a second priority      and our initial plan was delayed a bit because of that,''      says Lt. Gen. Carl Strock, commander of the Army Corps of      Engineers.       A FEMA spokesman said the Coast Guard and National Guard      had adequate numbers of helicopters on hand, but that rescue      and supply operations were hampered by other factors,      including limited airspace around New Orleans, which is      geographically small. ``You put in 30 helicopters in that      area and you create a dangerous situation,'' said the      spokesman, Marty Bahamonde.       On the supply front, helicopters flew food to the      Superdome, he said, but the helipad there could only      accommodate small aircraft, wnich couldn't hold many      supplies.       Communications systems also broke down, as they did at the      World Trade Center in 2001, preventing emergency officials      from communicating with each other and the military. That led      to the odd juxtaposition of top federal officials praising      the rescue effort and denying problems at New Orleans'      overcrowded convention center while TV cameras showed people      there crying for help.       Flooding and power shortages appear to be behind most of      the serious communications problems, but incompatible radio      systems didn't help. Emergency responders in New Orleans and      three nearby parishes all use different radio systems. New      Orleans and nearby Jefferson Parish both use radios that      operate on the 800 Mhz band, according to a Louisiana      State Police interoperability report, but they were      manufactured by different vendors. That means officials      there had up to five channels on which to talk to one      another.       ``Communication is always difficult in emergency situations      because of increased traffic,'' says William Vincent of the      Lafayette Office of Homeland Security and Emergency      Preparedness, about 135 miles from New Orleans. Emergency 911      dispatchers in Lafayette fielded calls from New Orleans      residents who still had working cellphones but couldn't reach      local police.       New Orleans officials had equipment at the fire      department's communication center that could link otherwise      incompatible local and federal systems. It was reportedly      knocked out by flooding.       Another problem: Even after 9/11, local officials and      federal emergency responders don't typically use the same      radio frequencies, which can make communication difficult      until agreements are reached on sharing channels.       As handheld radios began losing power in New Orleans,      police officers and other emergency responders had no way of      recharging them. Unlike radios used by firefighters combating      wild fires, which can be powered by disposable batteries      found in any grocery store, a typical handheld police      emergency radio uses rechargeable batteries similar to those      powering cell phones, according to Ron Haraseth, director of      automated frequency coordination at the Association of      Public-Safety Communications Officers.       FEMA itself seemed to frequently have bad information. At a      Tuesday press conference Bill Lokey, federal coordinating      officer for FEMA and the agency representative on site,      downplayed the severity of the flooding caused by the      breaches in New Orleans, saying the water wasn't rising in      most areas. ``I don't want to alarm everybody that, you know,      New Orleans is filling up like a bowl,'' he said. ``That's      just not happening.''       Within hours, much of the city was under water, and Mr.      Lokey was calling Katrina the most significant natural      disaster to hit the United States.''       The possible problems had long been trumpeted. In June      2004, FEMA spent more than half a million dollars to      commission a ``catastrophic hurricane disaster plan'' from      IEM Inc., a Baton Rouge-based emergency-management and      homeland security consulting firm. A report analyzing results      of a mock hurricane hitting New Orleans, dubbed ``Hurricane      Pam,'' was envisioned and a response and recovery plan was to      be drawn up.       During a five-day mock exercise in July 2004, emergency-     management responders huddled in Baton Rouge to plan a      response to ``Hurricane Pam,'' a Category 3 storm which      featured 120 miles per hour winds and a storm surge that      topped New Orleans's levees. For reasons that aren't clear,      the mock exercise never anticipated the levees giving way,      despite such warnings. Even-so, the mock hurricane--destroyed      500,000 buildings in New Orleans and displaced one million      residents.       The group developed a plan to get stranded residents out of      the way and construction of a ``command structure'' with      enough space for upwards of 800 rescue workers. A report,      dated Jan. 5 of this year, detailed recommendations from the      exercise and was provided to FEMA, an IEM spokeswoman said.      FEMA has not released the report.                                  ____                  Title III: Preparedness and Recovery       The DHS Emergency Preparedness and Recovery functions are      intended to improve the nation's capability to reduce losses      from all disasters, including terrorist attacks.
