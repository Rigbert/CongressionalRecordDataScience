 President, I rise today to introduce legislation that will correct an error in the Native American Technical Corrections Act of 2004.  The intent of section 121 of the 2004 law was to put a parcel on the northern edge of the Barona reservation, in San Diego County, into trust for the tribe. Unfortunately the bill identified a parcel on the southern edge of the reservation and put that in trust.  The mistake is compounded by the fact that the land north of the reservation is owned by a non-Indian property owner. The landowner now cannot sell or modify his property without permission from the tribe and the Department of the Interior.  The Barona Band of Mission Indians Land Transfer Clarification Act corrects this mistake.  The bill removes the private property on the northern side of the reservation from trust status; and the bill places the correct parcel in trust for the Barona tribe on the southern edge of the reservation.  The Barona Land Transfer Clarification Act closely follows an agreement brokered by Congressman Duncan Hunter and his staff. Congressman Hunter, and former Congressman Duncan Hunter, Sr. before him, brought the Band, the County of San Diego and the neighboring homeowners to the negotiating table.  The agreement they reached, embodied in this legislation, is a product of compromise. The end product is something that everyone agrees is better than the status quo. That is how compromise works.  The Tribe supports the legislation. The Homeowners and the County have reviewed and approved the language.  For the County and Homeowners, the findings section is the most important part of the bill.  This section addresses the ongoing water dispute between the tribe and its neighbors.  The fourth finding is particularly important if--the tribe uses the land to bring additional water into the area, the effort is only authorized if it also addresses the water needs of the neighboring off-reservation property.  Homeowners in the area have noticed diminished groundwater supplies in recent years, and they have looked to the tribe to help resolve the issue. In this arid part of the State, this is a significant concession on the part of the Tribe, and it is the cornerstone of the entire agreement.  I am hopeful that we can quickly pass this legislation and undo this unfortunate mistake. By enacting the Barona Land Transfer Clarification Act, all parties will gain some certainty that their issue will be resolved.  Finally, I am proud that my colleague from California Senator Boxer, and Senate Indian Affairs Committee Chairman Daniel Akaka have joined me as original cosponsors.  Once this legislation is sent over to the House, I know that Congressman Hunter and the San Diego Delegation stand ready to join our fight to resolve this issue.  This strong, bi-partisan, bi-cameral support gives me confidence that this simple, straightforward piece of legislation is one that the Senate can pass very quickly.  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be printed in the Record.  There being no objection, the text of the bill was ordered to be printed in the Record, as follows:                                S. 3193       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of      the United States of America in Congress assembled,     SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.       This Act may be cited as the ``Barona Band of Mission      Indians Land Transfer Clarification Act of 2012''.     SEC. 2. FINDINGS; PURPOSES.       (a) Findings.--Congress finds that--       (1) the legal description of land previously taken into      trust by the United States for the benefit of the Barona Band      of Mission Indians may be interpreted to refer to private,      nontribal land;       (2) there is a continued, unresolved disagreement between      the Barona Band of Mission Indians and certain off-     reservation property owners relating to the causes of      diminishing native groundwater;       (3) Congress expresses no opinion, nor should an opinion of      Congress be inferred, relating to the disagreement described      in paragraph (2); and       (4) it is the intent of Congress that, if the land      described in section 121(b) of the Native American Technical      Corrections Act of 2004 (118 Stat. 544) (as amended by      section 3) is used to bring water to the Barona Indian      Reservation, the effort is authorized only if the effort also      addresses water availability for neighboring off-reservation      land located along Old Barona Road that is occupied as of the      date of enactment of this Act by providing guaranteed access      to that water supply at a mutually agreeable site on the     southwest boundary of the Barona Indian Reservation.       (b) Purposes.--The purposes of this Act are--       (1) to clarify the legal description of the land placed      into trust for the Barona Band of Mission Indians in 2004;      and       (2) to remove all doubt relating to the specific parcels of      land that Congress has placed into trust for the Barona Band      of Mission Indians.     SEC. 3. LAND TRANSFER.
