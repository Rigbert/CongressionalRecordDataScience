 President, yesterday we had another opportunity to move the energy security and water infrastructure funding bill forward, and I was disappointed to see it stalled once again.  I wish to reiterate what Senator Alexander, the chairman of the Energy and Water Subcommittee, said. Advancing this funding bill is important--not only for policy but also for process. Members worked in committee and arrived at a bill they reported out unanimously. Many more Members had their voices heard on the floor, where we processed 17 amendments from both Democrats and Republicans.  Now, after much research, debate, and input from both sides, we are almost ready to move this bill across the finish line. We have one outstanding issue to address. It is the amendment authored by Senator Cotton, and we will have a vote on it no later than tomorrow. Senator Cotton was rightly concerned about the administration's recent announcement that it would purchase so-called heavy water from Iran, so he filed an amendment that would keep the funds we are appropriating through this bill from being spent on future heavy water purchases from that country.  Let me repeat that point. This amendment does not impact the current heavy water agreement. Instead, it aims at preventing future funds from going to Iran--funds that country could use to procure ballistic missiles or air defenses that could be used against us or our allies.  I agree with Senator Cotton's objective, and I will be supporting his amendment, which aims to keep Americans safe. But regardless of Members' positions on this issue, we will each have an opportunity to have our opinions count with a vote. Whether or not Senators support the amendment, this is the way the process works.
