While it appeared to be a sudden turnabout, today we learned the administration had made the decision in June and that ``it was considered in a very careful way for a while.''  This is a direct contradiction to previous testimony before Congress. Every single time that we asked the administration witness if implementation was on track, they looked us in the eye and said, ``Absolutely, yes.''  Why did the ``most transparent administration in history'' mislead Congress and try to dupe the public? Because it knew that the law is bad for business and bad for jobs.  Today, we give the administration authority in full view of the American public to delay the employer mandate for a year. The House will stand up for the millions of young adults, working families, and older Americans who cannot afford the health care law's looming rate shock. Fair is fair. If businesses aren't subject to the same burdens and penalties under the health care law next year, average Americans shouldn't face them either.  Many middle class families are going to pay dramatically higher premiums as a result of the Affordable Care Act. The Energy and Commerce Committee surveyed 17 of the Nation's leading insurers and found many consumers in the individual market could see their premiums nearly double, with potential highs eclipsing 400 percent.  The broken promises are many. Missed deadlines and delays have become routine. This law is so off the rails that the administration is now disregarding entire sections of the statute. This debate is about jobs and it is about fairness.  We continue to believe a permanent delay of these damaging policies is the best course of action. For today, let's join together and protect Americans for at least another year.  I ask my colleagues to support H.R. 2667 and H.R. 2668 so that we can delay and dismantle these policies that will hurt American jobs.  Mr. McDERMOTT. Madam Speaker, I yield back to the gentleman from Michigan (Mr. Levin).
