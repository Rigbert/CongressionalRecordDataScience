 That is from the L.A. Times editorial today.  It seems from what I can gather that many who support this provision believe these national treasures, these national forests are there for the exploitation of private companies rather than the legacy which we owe to our children and future generations.  To allow these companies to come in and run roughshod over millions of acres of America's national forest land for their own profit and to do this at the last minute in an anti-environment rider strikes me as a harsh commentary on the values that this Senate is putting in this bill for the appropriations process.  I salute the Senator from California. Thank you for having the political courage to stand up and make a point about an issue that really is going to have an impact on America for generations to come.
