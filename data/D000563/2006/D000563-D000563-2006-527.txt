I am glad this day has finally come. This matter has been on the calendar for over a year.  For over a year, millions of Americans have been wondering when the Senate will take this up. Finally, it has been scheduled. A lot of people outside this Chamber had a lot to do with it being scheduled. First Lady Nancy Reagan stood up and spoke up when she saw the late President suffering from Alzheimer's. Her voice has made a difference. I salute her for that. Christopher and Dana Reeve, both gone now, in their lifetime, the dedication and energy they put on this issue made all the difference in the world.  There are three votes tomorrow. There is only one that gets to the heart of the issue. There are some that are going to address a lot of different issues from different perspectives, but there is only one that counts when it comes to stem cell research. The Stem Cell Research Enhancement Act is the only bill that expands Federal funding for embryonic stem cell research, the type that holds out so much promise.  The other two bills are well intentioned. I am not going to say anything negative about them. I will vote for them because, frankly, they make little or no difference. One of them bans practices that presently are not being used. I guess that is a good thing to do. I will vote for that bill.  The other one, by Senator Santorum of Pennsylvania, won't accomplish much. This was the question I asked of Dr. James Battey of the National Institutes of Health about the Santorum bill: Can you tell me whether S. 2754 authorizes research on stem cells at the NIH that currently is not permissible or legal?  He answered: No, it does not.  So it does not give new authority to NIH, and it does not expand research. It has some motive other than medical for being offered.  William Neaves, a leading stem cell researcher, has it right:       This is not a contest between adult stem cells and      embryonic stem cells. Instead, it is a contest between      society and disease.  I have listened to some of the arguments in the Senate. Some of the arguments are that adult stem cell research has great potential. I believe that is true. I believe we should pursue it aggressively. However, the argument seems to be that if that is the case,then we do not have to concern ourselves with embryonic stem cell research.  I am a liberal arts lawyer and do not profess to know about medical research, but why foreclose a whole area of research with embryonic stem cells that the greatest minds in America tell us is so promising? Why wouldn't we do both, both adult stem cell research, as well as embryonic stem cell research? From that point of view, I cannot follow the logic in opposing this bill.  Former Senator John Danforth is another person who has thought about this issue. I respect him a lot. He is an ordained Episcopal minister and a longtime opponent of abortion. Like tens of millions of Americans, he comes from a family that knows the pain of disease. He lost one of his brothers to Lou Gehrig's disease. He wrote this in the St. Louis-Post Dispatch:       A choice between two understandings of human life. On one      hand, we have millions of people who suffer from ALS,      Alzheimer's, juvenile diabetes, Parkinson's, spinal cord      injuries and cancer--and the loved ones who care for them and      suffer by their sides. On the other hand, we have tiny      bundles of unfertilized cells existing in petri dishes.  He went on to write, the people who oppose stem cell research:       should explain to the afflicted and their loved ones why      they care more about those cell bundles than they do about      the people.  This Stem Cell Research Enhancement Act has been supported by so many groups. I ask unanimous consent, Mr. President, to have the names of some of those groups printed in the Record.  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in the Record, as follows:                         Who Supports H.R. 810       The Stem Cell Research Enhancement Act is supported by more      than 200 patient groups, scientists and medical research      groups. They include: American Medical Association, American      Association for Cancer, American Diabetes Association,      Juvenile Diabetes Foundation, American Pediatric Society,      March of Dimes, the ALS Association, Parkinsons Action      Network, Alzheimer's Association, Parent Project Muscular      Dystrophy, Kidney Cancer Association, Coalition for Pulmonary      Fibrosis, and the Society for Neuroscience Research.
