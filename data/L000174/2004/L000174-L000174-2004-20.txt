President, at the end of this Congress we will bid farewell to distinguished members of this body who have served their States and their country with honor. I rise today to pay tribute to the Senior Senator from Florida, a man who has been a leader in the Senate on national intelligence issues, prescription drugs and the environment and has been a strong voice in this body on behalf of the interests of his fellow Floridians.  For more than four decades Senator Graham has been a leader in Florida politics, serving his State as a State representative and Senator, as Governor and as a United States Senator. For 18 years Senator Graham has compiled an impressive record of leadership while serving as chairman and ranking member of the Veterans Affairs Committee, chairman of the Intelligence Committee, chairman of the Democratic Senatorial Campaign Committee, and as a senior member of the Senate Finance Committee.  Since 1974, Senator Graham has completed more than 400 ``Workdays,'' with Floridians around his State. During these workdays the Senator spends working alongside his constituents, the personal interaction helps him understand the challenges that Floridians face. These visits clearly have provided Senator Graham with an opportunity to recognize the community values and hard work that are exhibited and shared by his constituents. These jobs have gone everywhere from garbage loader to short order cook. No Senator has done anything similar.  From his position on the Senate Finance Committee, Senator Graham has picked up the torch for causes supported by another respected Floridian Claude Pepper, the former Senator and Congressman. He has supported providing affordable prescription drugs to Americans and has advocated for a common sense approach to Medicare that focuses on wellness and preventative health. Senator Graham has increased access to the Children's Health Insurance Program and has pushed Congress to live up to its commitment to support social services.  Both as Governor and Senator, Bob Graham has been dedicated to protecting the environment. He has helped direct millions of dollars to protect the Everglades, restore wetlands and promote responsible development. In the Senate, Bob Graham has voiced opposition to drilling on the Outer Continental Shelf and for an end to the harmful practice of dredging in the Apalachicola River.  For those of us that have served with Senator Graham in the Senate we have admired his hard work and dedication to his constituents. We join him now in celebrating his eighteen successful years in this body, a period of time that is one part of a career of service to the State of Florida. As Senator Graham moves out of the public eye, he leaves behind a legacy of accomplishment that will be forever remembered by his fellow Americans and Floridians. He also leaves a reputation of integrity and insight. History will show that this country should have listened to his warnings about the failed intelligence leading up to the war in Iraq.                              John Edwards  Mr. President, I rise today to recognize the service of Senator John Edwards of North Carolina.  Because of his time on the campaign trail, Senator Edwards' biography is well known to most Americans. He is the son of a mill worker and was the first in his family to attend college. Before coming to the Senate, John fought for victims' rights against insurance companies for more than 20 years in North Carolina. He enjoyed great success in that career, but seeking to do more for the people of his State, he decided to run for the Senate in 1998. John ran against, and defeated, an incumbent Senator, Senator Faircloth. Immediately upon arriving in the Senate, Senator Edwards began to make an impact.  Only a few days after Senator Edwards was sworn in, I asked him to help depose witnesses in the impeachment trial of President Clinton. I wanted to make sure we had the best, and I thought he was. It was John's career experience that made him an ideal choice to assist in the depositions, and he had recent experience working in the trenches. In that pressure filled situation John won the respect of all of his colleagues, both on this side of the aisle and the other.  From his seat on the Health, Education, Labor and Pensions Committee,Senator Edwards advocated for lowering the cost of prescription drugs for all Americans by improving access to generic medications. In 2001, he authored the Patients' Bill of Rights which would have guaranteed that people in HMOs and other insurance plans get the health care they pay for. Unfortunately, this was passed in the Senate but blocked by the White House. In addition to serving on the HELP Committee, Senator Edwards served on the Intelligence, Small Business, and Judiciary Committees.  As a member of the Judiciary Committee, Senator Edwards worked closely with me on a number of legislative efforts. He was a cosponsor of the Innocence Protection Act, the National Amber Alert Network, and a strong voice on judicial nominations. Senator Edwards has stood up to efforts by this President to pack the courts with people whose records do not demonstrate that they will be fair judges to all who come before them, rich or poor, Democrats or Republicans, or any race or background.  In September of 2003, Senator Edwards announced that he was running for President. John ran a great campaign, raising issues important to the American people. He frequently referred to the division of America into two halves, that of the haves and that of the have-nots. John focused on the struggles of the middle class and many of the same issues that he was a leader on during his time in the Senate. Throughout the campaign, John was a positive voice for our party, and he was an excellent choice as a running mate for John Kerry.  In an interview, John once said that he had an ideal image of what a U.S. Senator should be. He said that ``I think about a fiery advocate, someone who works passionately for his constituents.'' For the past 6 years, John has been exactly that. Be it health or education reform, supporting farmers or North Carolina's economic interests, John Edwards has been an incredible leader and advocate for his State. I will miss John's friendship here in the Senate. I know that he has a wonderful wife and three beautiful children, and that whatever steps he takes next that he will be just fine as long as he has their support.
