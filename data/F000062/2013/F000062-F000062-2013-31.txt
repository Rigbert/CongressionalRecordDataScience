 President, I rise today on behalf of myself and Senator Collins, to introduce the Child Care Infant Mortality Act. This is bipartisan legislation that would allow states participating in the Child Care Development Block Grant, CCDBG, to use part of this funding for child safety training.  Currently, states participating in Child Care Development Block Grant, CCDBG, are required to set aside at least 4 percent of funds to improve the quality of the programs offered in their states. Our bill would simply ensure that strategies to enhance child safety, including disseminating information related to prevention strategies for sudden unexpected infant death, are included in as an allowable use of funds.  According to the Centers for Disease Control, CDC, and the American Academy of Pediatrics, half of the approximately 4,500 SUID cases in the United States are entirely preventable with effective training and implementation of correct sleep practices. It is estimated that child care settings account for 20 percent of all SUID fatalities in the United States. Life-saving sleep strategies, first aid and CPR are successful in preventing infant death and are easily implementable; yet training is not currently an allowable use of funds under the Child Care and Development Block Grant Act.  Nationally, over 4,500 infants die suddenly with no immediate obvious cause every year. These deaths are not highly publicized by the media because of the severe pain it causes families. A large percentage of child care providers are unaware of the risks of sleep associated infant deaths until they come face-to-face with a death of a child under their care. The more aware providers are of safe sleep practices, the more likely they are to follow suggested guidelines. In particular, posting safe-sleep practices and offering required training can further cut the number of infants we lose every year to sudden unexpected infant death. Beyond safe sleep practices, child care provider training in CPR and first aid will allow providers to identify and address potentially harmful situations for infants.  The Child Care Infant Mortality Prevention Act of 2013 expands the list of allowable uses for CCDBG funding to permit states to use this funding on activities to improve child care quality. Our bill would also require the Secretary to update and make widely available-training, instructional materials, and other information on safe sleep practices and other sudden unexpected infant death prevention strategies.  I am proud that Senator Susan Collins has joined me as an original cosponsor of this bill.  It is essential that this issue is addressed by building upon the existing structure and capacity of the networks of Child Care providers participating in the Child Care and Development Block Grant. It is critical that we work to ensure that child safety is a primary goal of the block grant, and that appropriate and adequate training on safe sleep practices, first aid, and CPR are included in the training regimen promoted by this Act.  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be printed in the Record.  There being no objection, the text of the bill was ordered to be printed in the Record, as follows:                                S. 1494       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of      the United States of America in Congress assembled,     SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.       This Act may be cited as the ``Child Care Infant Mortality      Prevention Act of 2013''.     SEC. 2. FINDINGS AND PURPOSES.       (a) Findings.--Congress finds the following:       (1) For millions of today's working families, child care is      an essential ingredient of their success. Child care helps      children, families, and communities prosper, and helps the      Nation maintain its competitive edge.       (2) Close to 12,000,000 children under age 5, and      10,000,000 over the age of 5, are in some type of child care      setting each day.       (3) More than 60 percent of children are cared for      regularly in a child care setting.       (4) Recent polls of working parents found that parents are      primarily concerned about safety and quality of care,      followed by cost.       (5) Nationally, the most common form of death among post-     neonatal infants under age 1 is death occurring during sleep,      as a result of incorrect sleeping practices.       (6) According to the Centers for Disease Control and      Prevention, each year in the United States, more than 4,500      infants die suddenly of no immediately obvious cause. Half of      these sudden unexpected infant deaths are due to Sudden      Infant Death Syndrome, the leading cause of sudden unexpected      infant deaths and all deaths among infants who are not      younger than 1 month but younger than 12 months.       (7) Researchers estimate that child care settings account      for at least 20 percent of sudden unexpected infant deaths in      the United States.       (8) In its 2011 report on child care center licensing      regulations, Child Care Aware of America, formerly known as      the National Association of Child Care Resource and Referral      Agencies, noted that--       (A) extensive research and recommendations from      organizations like the American Academy of Pediatrics and the      National Centers for Disease Control and Prevention favor      simple life-saving safe sleep strategies to eliminate serious      risk factors for Sudden Infant Death Syndrome and sudden      unexpected infant death; and       (B) the strategies noted in subparagraph (A) are not      universally required under the Child Care and Development      Block Grant Act of 1990 nor in the majority of State child      care regulations.     SEC. 3. GOALS.       Section 658A(b)(5) of the Child Care and Development Block      Grant Act of 1990 (42 U.S.C. 9858 note) is amended to read as      follows:       ``(5) to ensure the health, safety, development and well-     being of children in programs supported under this subchapter      and to assist States in improving the overall quality of      child care services and programs by implementing the health,      safety, licensing, and oversight standards established in      State law (including regulations).''.     SEC. 4. APPLICATION AND PLAN.       Section 658E(c)(2)(F) of the Child Care and Development      Block Grant Act of 1990 (42 U.S.C. 6858c(c)(2)(F)) is amended      by striking clause (iii) and all that follows and inserting      the following:       ``(iii) minimum health and safety training appropriate to      the provider setting, including training on cardiopulmonary      resuscitation, first aid, safe sleep practices and other      sudden unexpected infant death prevention strategies.''.     SEC. 5. ACTIVITIES TO PROMOTE CHILD SAFETY AND IMPROVE THE                    QUALITY OF CHILD CARE.       Section 658G of the Child Care and Development Block Grant      Act of 1990 (42 U.S.C. 9858e) is amended--       (1) by striking ``choice, and'' and inserting ``choice,'';      and       (2) by striking the period and inserting ``training      (including training in safe sleep practices, first aid, and      cardiopulmonary resuscitation), and other activities designed      to ensure and improve the health and safety of children      receiving child care services under this subchapter.''.     SEC. 6. DISSEMINATION OF MATERIALS AND INFORMATION ON SAFE                    SLEEP AND OTHER SUDDEN UNEXPECTED INFANT DEATH                    PREVENTION STRATEGIES.       Section 658K of the Child Care and Development Block Grant      Act of 1990 (42 U.S.C. 9858i) is amended--       (1) by striking the section header and inserting the      following:     ``SEC. 658K. REPORTS, AUDITS, AND INFORMATION.''     ; and       (2) by adding at the end the following:       ``(c) Information on Sudden Unexpected Infant Death      Prevention Strategies.--The Secretary, working with the      Director of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention      and the Director of the Eunice Kennedy Shriver National      Institute of Child Health and Human Development, shall--       ``(1) update training, instructional materials, and other      information on safe sleep practices and other sudden      unexpected infant death prevention strategies; and       ``(2) widely distribute the training, materials, and      information to parents, child care providers, pediatricians,      home visitors, community colleges, and other individuals and      entities.''.                                 ______                                       By
