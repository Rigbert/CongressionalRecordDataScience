President, I am pleased to introduce legislation authorizing an exchange of lands between the U.S. Forest Service, the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service, and Lake County, OR. I believe that this exchange project is a win-win proposition for both the Federal Government and Lake County.  Under my bill, the U.S. Forest Service will deed about 290 acres of national forest land, comprising the Warner Canyon ski hill, to Lake County. In exchange, Lake County will deed roughly 320 acres of land within the Hart Mountain National Antelope Refuge to the Federal Government. The refuge is managed by the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service.  The specific acreage offered by the county will be determined upon a specific appraisal of all the lands in order to provide for an equal value land trade.  While there is a commonly held notion that western ski areas resemble Oregon's Mt. Bachelor or Colorado's Vail, the fact is that there are many dozens of very small, financially marginal ski hills in the backyards of many small western towns. Warner Canyon is one of them.  The Warner Canyon ski hill has been operated by the nonprofit Fremont Highlanders Ski Club since 1938. It's one of America's last nonprofit ski hills. It has one lift--a T bar. It has 780 vertical feet of skiing. The ski area is about 5 miles from the town of Lakeview, which has a population of roughly 2,500.  The people of Lakeview believe that this legislation is necessary to keep the ski area viable. The Federal requirements for managing ski areas are more in tune with the Vails than the Warner Canyons. I'm told that under county ownership the liability expense alone should be reduced tenfold. The forest supervisor tells us that it costs the Forest Service about $10,000 per year to administer the ski area permit, yet the area generates just more than $400 per year in ski fee revenues to the U.S. Treasury.  I also want to emphasize the benefits of this bill to the Hart Mountain Antelope Refuge. As my colleagues well understand, too many of our national wildlife refuges contain private land inholdings over which the Federal Government has essentially no control. These lands can be sold or developed at any time. If Lake County were ever strapped for cash, it would certainly be their prerogative to sell these parcels to the highest bidder. With this acquisition we move closer to the permanent protection of this important Oregon wildlife refuge.  I am pleased to be joined in this effort by Senator Gordon Smith.  At this time, Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to be printed in the Record the bill and my statement, a document from the Lake County Board of Commissioners entitled ``Reasons to support Warner Canyon Ski Hill Ownership Transfer,'' and letters of support from the Fremont Highlanders Ski Club, Inc., and the Lake County Chamber of Commerce.  There being no objection, the items were ordered to be printed in the Record, as follows:                                 S. 881       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of      the United States of America in Congress assembled,     SECTION 1.

Pardue, Chairman; Jane O'Keeffe, Kathleen Collins      reasons to support warner canyon ski hill ownership transfer       Lake County agrees to accept the ownership of 280+-acres of      land which is the location of the Warner Canyon Ski Hill with      all encumbrance.       Lake County offers 320+-acres of land in the Hart Mountain      National Antelope Refuge as the mechanism to equalize the      value for the Federal Government.       Lake County desires to have the proposal completed by      November 1, 1997 to allow this winter season to come under      our ownership.       The exchange will benefit the U.S. Forest Service, Fremont      National Forest by removing management costs that exceed      return generated by the Special Use Permit to the Fremont      Highlanders.       U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service benefits by having ownership      of 320+-acres of inholdings within the existing refuge      boundary. (Lake County owns additional land within the refuge      that can be sued to facilitate this proposal if necessary.)       The Fremont Highlanders Ski Club, operator of the ski area,      benefits from lower cost of liability insurance, no cost      operating permit and possible supplemental funding from      special county recreation funds.       The Lakeview community benefits from the long term stable      operation of the ski hill to provide family winter recreation      opportunities, facilities for high school ski race team, part      time seasonal employment opportunities during high      unemployment periods.       Lake County acquires a parcel of land that is adjacent to      an existing 40 acres of county land over which the ski lift      crosses. This is an opportunity for the county do demonstrate      its desire to support the recreation and tourism industry and      possibly enhance and expand winter recreation potential. The      county receives R.V. registration fee rebates from the State      of Oregon for use at county owned park or recreation areas.      The Warner Canyon Ski area will be eligible for supplemental      funding from these funds.     Robert M. Pardue, Chairman.                                  ____                           Fremont Highlanders Ski Club, Inc.,                                       Lakeview, OR, June 5, 1997.     Charles Graham,     Forest Supervisor, U.S. Forest Service, Lake County          Commissioners.       Dear Mr. Graham and Lake County Commissioners: The Fremont      Highlanders Ski Club is in full support of the land trade      involving Warner Canyon Ski Area between Lake County, the      U.S. Forest Service and the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service.      Warner Canyon Ski Area is one of the few remaining non-profit      ski areas in the United States. The Fremont Highlanders have      operated this ski area for over 50 years. However, increasing      regulations, fees, and insurance costs have severely impacted      our ability to operate. We believe the land trade will reduce      our costs of operating our ski area and will allow us to      better serve our communities recreational interests.           Sincerely,                                                    Michael Sabin,     President.                                  ____                                                      Lake County,                                          Chamber of Commerce,                                       Lakeview, OR, June 6, 1997.     Bob Pardue,     Chairman, Lake County Commissioners,     Courthouse, Lakeview, OR.       Dear Bob. On behalf of the Lake County Chamber of Commerce      Board of Directors, we would like to congratulate you on your      recent decision to make a land trade with the Fremont      National Forest, regarding the Warner Canyon Ski Area.       Maintaining the level of operation, to provide a quality      skiing experience for recreational skiers in Southeast      Oregon, has been a difficult challenge for the Fremont      Highlanders Ski Club. Liability Insurance has been a real      obstacle, as well as sporadic snow conditions. Thanks to      Collins McDonald Trust Fund, as well as other generous Lake      County businesses and citizens, we have been able to      financially survive.       Three years ago the chamber received a grant to promote      winter recreation in Lake County. The success of Warner      Canyon Ski Area is an important component to that promotion,      which impacts the local economy during the usual slow months.       We are very supportive of this trade and look forward to      many successful ski seasons in the future.           Sincerely,                                                       Barb Gover,                        Director, Lake County Chamber of Commerce.                                 ______                                       By
