  It is with the deepest appreciation that I pay tribute to retired Sergeant Richard Burton Murphy. May 16, 2008 marked the day Sergeant Murphy retired from the Toledo Police Department.  Sergeant Murphy began his career in law enforcement for the City of Oregon, Ohio Police Department, in January 1967. Two years later, he was appointed to the Lucas County Sheriff Office as a road deputy. In 1971, Sergeant Murphy traversed to Ft. Lauderdale, Florida to obtain a new position; however, he returned to Toledo, Ohio in 1973. In March of that year, he was appointed to the Toledo Police Department where he served for 35 years. After hard work and dedication to the Toledo Police Department, he was promoted to Sergeant in 1979. Among other achievements, Sergeant Murphy served as the official and unofficial public information officers for 12 years. Additionally he performed duties in patrol, communication, and in the chief of police's office during these years. While I have the honor to acknowledge his years of public service, the citizens of Toledo, OH have given Sergeant Murphy many exceptional reports. From the Toledo/Lucas County Safety Council, he obtained the Citizen Policeman Award in 1975, Certificate of Appreciation in 1976, Good Samaritan Award in 1992, and Heroism Reward in 1996. He was presented a proclamation from the Mayor's office of the City of Toledo in 1998 and 1999. Sergeant Murphy is a U. S. Navy Veteran who fulfilled active duty from 1962 to 1964, completing four years of reserve duty to follow. He is married to Patricia Ann Murphy, has two daughters Robin and Jill and 6 grandchildren. He is a member of Ottawa River Yacht Club, and plays in 3 golf leagues.  All of Toledo thanks Sergeant Murphy for his commitment to public service and helping keep safe the community of Toledo. When an officer in blue goes to work in the morning, that officer never knows if they will return home at night. Our community values and recognizes the valor, patriotism, and community-mindedness of Sergeant Murphy and his colleagues, who protect and serve a broader community beyond their family. May he find happiness and satisfaction as he enters into a new milestone of his life.                          ____________________
