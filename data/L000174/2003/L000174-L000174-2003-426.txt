President, this nomination from Washington State has the support of the Democratic Senators from that State. Senator Murray and Senator Cantwell have both worked hard to establish a bipartisan process for making recommendations to the President for Federal judicial vacancies in their State. They are to be commended for their work. They support the nomination of Lonny R. Suko, whose nomination is a product of Washington's bipartisan selection commission.  With this confirmation today, the third so far this week, the Senate will have confirmed 136 judicial nominees of this President. These include 36 confirmed just this year. That number equals the number of judges confirmed during all of 1997, exceeds the 34 judges confirmed in all of 1999, and is more than double the number of judges confirmed in the entire 1996 session. Thus, we are well ahead of the pace that the Republican majority used to maintain when reviewing President Clinton's nominees.  We have reduced judicial vacancies to the lowest number in 13 years and currently have more Federal judges on the bench than at any time in our history.  Working with home State Senators from both parties helps make the confirmation process proceed more smoothly as we have demonstrated over and over and demonstrated again today.  I congratulate the nominee and his family on his confirmation today
