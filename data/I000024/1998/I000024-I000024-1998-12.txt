President, I would like to point out to the Chairman that Section 606 contains a provision that appears to grant priority status to a single carrier at Chicago O'Hare for the return of slots previously withdrawn for international service. If it is the intention of this provision to give one carrier at O'Hare preference in slot allocation, the Senate conferees must act in conference to remove this provision.  This provision appears to hand over roughly 35 slots that the dominant carrier at Chicago previously sought to obtain from the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) but was twice denied.  This provision would advantage a single carrier, which knew of the priority of slot withdrawal and should have planned its hub operations to take into account the effects. It strengthens a single carrier's position at O'Hare, a situation which the Congress should not legislate.  As this legislation goes to conference, the Senate is relying on the conferees to ensure Congress is even-handed in these matters.  Mr. McCAIN. I understand the Senator's concerns, which others have raised as well. I appreciate the Senator from Oklahoma expressing these views.                       death on the high seas act
