 As I traveled around in August to talk to people in my State, where we have been severely impacted--we have the third highest unemployment in the Nation--I talked to students just out of high school who cannot afford to go college because of tuition increases and who do not have the skills to simply enter the workforce. It is very different than talking to a young father who is 35 years old with three young kids, who was an engineer at Boeing, who will not get that job back and doesn't have the computer training skills to get into another job that will provide him with the income to sustain a family with three children.  There are different programs funded in my State which we have worked on and which were supported in the HELP Committee. They are different for dislocated workers or for adults or for youth.
