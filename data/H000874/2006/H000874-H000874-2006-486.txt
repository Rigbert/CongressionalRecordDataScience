I know the majority leader has a history in dealing with his bills of pursuing them in that fashion, and we have appreciated it, as the gentleman knows. I have expressed that to him in the past. It has not always been our experience. Clearly, these bills are of extraordinary consequence to working men and women in this country, particularly as it relates to the pension bill as well as the tax reconciliation.  Without trying to catch you up on your words, but if I could just somewhat, perhaps humorously, I hope, butyou said that you are not moving ahead rapidly, but you will let us know, and you will not do so until the Democrats are in the room. Frankly, Mr. Leader, our concern is, and the concern of Democrats has been, that once the Democrats get back in the room it moves exceedingly rapidly, without really an opportunity for Democrats to make substantive contributions, whether they win or lose in the conference.  I yield to my friend.
