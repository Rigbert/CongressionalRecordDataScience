Speaker, reclaiming my time, I said yesterday that for the past 2 days, all of America has paid its respect, its admiration, and its thanks to two heroic officers, two officers who themselves acted in the defense of freedom and this institution, but who also symbolize those who every day place themselves in harm's way to ensure civil order in our democracy, civil order which is absolutely essential if our democracy is to function as our Founding Fathers conceived it.  Mr. Speaker, this resolution, if adopted as I expect it to be unanimously, will provide an additional way in which we can honor those two officers through contributions to this fund that will ensure that the families who have sustained an inestimable loss will nevertheless be, to the extent that we can as a generous Nation provide for them from an economic standpoint, that the loss that they sustained will be to that small degree diminished. It is an appropriate resolution, an appropriate action, and I would be pleased to again, under my reservation, Mr. Speaker, to yield to the distinguished gentleman from California (Mr. Thomas), chairman of the Committee on House Oversight.
