On Sunday, January 28, the Union Memorial A.M.E. will be celebrating her 139th Anniversary.  Since the church's original dedication in 1868, the first African Methodist Episcopal Church in the Twin Cities of Benton Harbor and St. Joseph has stood as a symbol of faith, hope, and compassion for the citizens of Berrien County and the surrounding area. Its 139 years of commitment have had a tremendous impact on its congregation as well as the greater community.  The African Methodist Episcopal Church has had a proud history since starting in the home of Steven Busby in 1868. This small Christian assembly back then was known as the ``House of Praise.'' The area was home to two A.M.E. churches in the 1890s, and in 1901 the church in Benton Harbor was destroyed by a fire. The church was rebuilt and in 1929 the Benton Harbor and St. Joseph churches united under the name Union Memorial African Methodist Episcopal Church. In 1969 the church moved to its current location at Empire and Crystal A venues.  In its 139 year history, the church has never wavered from the ministry of saving lost souls, preaching the gospel, feeding the hungry, helping the homeless, and reaching out and renewing the spirit of folks in need. I want to commend the members of Union Memorial African Methodist Episcopal on their anniversary and on their commitment in the future to serving the greater community.                          ____________________
