 First let me say to all Members that I advise them to advise their schedulers not to schedule Fridays in June or July. We're off, obviously, for a week in July for the July 4 work period, but other than that, I would urge all Members to make sure their schedulers understand that we may well be here late into afternoons on each and every one of the Fridays. Now, why? First of all, we're going to consider the Defense Authorization bill and the State Department Authorization bills. But in addition to that, we will be considering the appropriation bills.  It is my hope and objective--and Mr. Whip, you and I have briefly talked and we are going to talk again about the scheduling of these bills--to pass all of the appropriations bills, as Senator Inouye has indicated he would like to do as well, pass all the appropriations bills, individually, through the Senate and through the House so that we might conference those bills and have them on the floor in the regular order. Those, obviously, 12 bills will take up much of those 2 months.  In addition to that, of course, the committees are considering major pieces of legislation dealing with energy independence and global warming, as well as health care. Now, we do not know whether or not they might be ready for the floor or when they might be ready for the floor, but Members ought to know that those are bills that are clearly on our radar screen to be put on the agenda when they are ready.
