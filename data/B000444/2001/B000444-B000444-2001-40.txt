  Two months ago, in barbaric attacks in New York and Washington that we will never forget, the world changed before our eyes. In an instant, the fight against terrorism became our top national security priority. That new reality requires us to undertake a thorough review of our national security priorities. That effort is underway across the executive branch and in several committees of Congress. President Bush acted decisively to create the Office of Homeland Security and in naming Governor Ridge to be its head. Congress acted quickly to tighten aviation security and to give federal law enforcement new tools to counter terrorism.  These measures are just initial steps in what will surely be a major reorientation of the ship of state. As we begin to reorient our government, I believe we must engage in a thorough assessment of the range of threats that we face and the priorities which we should accord such threats in our national security strategy.  Terrorism is undoubtedly the major threat to the United States. In that regard, we must have a full understanding of the types of terrorist threats we face and of their relative probability. This week, the continuous reports of anthrax being discovered in various parts of the country, including here in the Senate, have focused the country on the threat of bioterrorism.  Unfortunately, this is not the only threat we face. Terrorists proved their deadly ability to turn airplanes into weapons of mass destruction. They have used truck and car bombs in the past. And we know that terrorist organizations are seeking materials necessary for the production of chemical or nuclear weapons. What we need to know is the priority we should accord those threats. That is the purpose of this proposed commission.  There are, to be sure, other threats that remain to our territory and to our national security interests. Russian weapons of mass destruction stockpiles and expertise pose the risk of accidental war or of proliferation to rogue states and terrorist groups. Ballistic missiles in developing countries can threaten U.S. forces overseas and could someday threaten our homeland. And international narcotics trafficking continues to threaten many countries, including ours. Terrorism is not the only threat. But after September 11 it is clearly the preeminent threat.  The proposed National Commission on Threats to the Homeland and United States National Security will not seek to reinvent the wheel. Rather, it would build on the work of several recent blue-ribbon commissions which have assessed various threats, both collectively and individually, to U.S. national security.  In seeking the creation of this new commission, neither Senator Lugar  nor I wish to discredit this earlier work and the ideas that flowed from it. Instead, we seek to use that work as a foundation in constructing a comprehensive threat assessment and a resulting U.S. national security strategy. It is therefore instructive to quickly review the major findings of some of these earlier commissions and hearings.  Perhaps the best-known is the U.S. Commission on National Security/21stCentury, better known as the Hart-Rudman Commission after its two cochairs, former Senators Gary Hart and Warren Rudman. In its final report, issued in 2001, the Hart-Rudman Commission offered a chilling prediction borne out only months later: ``States, terrorists, and other disaffected groups will acquire weapons of mass destruction and mass disruption, and some will use them. Americans will likely die on American soil, possibly in large numbers.'' The Hart-Rudman Commission urged making the security of the American homeland the primary national security mission of the U.S. government and called for the creation of a National Homeland Security Agency to coordinate these efforts.  Two commissions have focused on the specific threat of international terrorism and dealing with the consequences of a terrorist attack with a weapon of mass destruction, WMD.  The National Commission on Terrorism, chaired by Ambassador L. Paul Bremer, recommended a series of measures to expand the authorities of U.S. intelligence and law enforcement, steps now under consideration in the anti-terrorism legislation before Congress. It also urged the United States to use all the instruments at its disposal, diplomatic, financial, economic, and military, in targeting states that sponsor international terrorism.  The Advisory Panel to Assess Domestic Response Capabilities for Terrorism Involving Weapons of Mass Destruction, better known as the Gilmore Commission after its chair, Virginia Governor James Gilmore, focused on the need to develop a national strategy of domestic preparedness to respond to any act of WMD terrorism. This commission also called for the creation of a central office within the White House to coordinate federal efforts, which closely resembles what President Bush has decided to do in appointing Governor Ridge to a new ``homeland czar'' position.  The Russia Task Force of the Secretary of Energy's Advisory Board, better known as ``the Baker-Cutler Task Force'' after its co-chairs, former Senator Howard Baker and former White House Counsel Lloyd Cutler, looked at the particular threat posed by unsecured nuclear weapons and fissile material in the former Soviet Union. This task force declared the deteriorating situation as ``the most urgent unmet national security threat facing the United States today'' and called for spending approximately $30 billion over the next 8 to 10 years to adequately secure these weapons and related materials.  Finally, with the emergence of several anthrax cases in several locations in the United States, the threat has become all too real. The Committee on Foreign Relations held a hearing on this subject the week before the September 11 attacks. Former Senator Sam Nunn, now heading the Nuclear Threat Initiative, Dr. D.A. Henderson, the architect of the international campaign to eradicate smallpox in the 1970s, and other experts testified on the nature of the threat and what we can do in response. As they made clear, a mass destruction bioterrorism attack is a low-probability event with high consequences. The right answer is not panic, but rather the foresight to implement a set of commonsense measures to strengthen our public health system, including our emergency care capabilities and our vaccine stockpiles, to handle a bioterrorist attack if and when it occurs.  The Commission that we envision would, I repeat, build on the fine work done by the foregoing panels. It would assess the current threat, in light of the attacks on September 11, and in light of the assessments and analyses performed by government agencies and the panels I have just discussed. The commission would be a small group, just six distinguished Americans with experience at the highest levels of national security, law enforcement, and public safety. It is my hope that the commissioners chosen for this task would include former cabinet secretaries, and even former Presidents.  The bill we introduce requires two reports, an interim report to be produced within 180 days of enactment of the legislation and a final report to be produced by September 11, 2002, one year after the attacks on our country. The reports should provide a roadmap for our national security strategy, what the major threats are, the likelihood such threats will result in attacks on the United States, the potential damage to the United States or U.S. interests, and the current U.S. capabilities to counter and respond to such threats. From this assessment we can build a national security strategy for the coming decades.  I appreciate the support and assistance of the Senator from Indiana in developing this legislation. I urge my colleagues to support it.  I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be printed in the Record.  There being no objection,the bill was ordered to be printed in the Record, as follows:                                S. 1735       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of      the United States of America in Congress assembled,     SECTION 1.
