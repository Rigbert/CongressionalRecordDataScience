Chairman, I move to strike the last word.  Mr. Chairman, I wanted to just stand and to commend the gentleman from Massachusetts (Mr. Tierney) for his concern, genuine concern, about genetically modified foods. As a result of his initiatives and his constant prodding of the committee, I want to just put on the record that in the report that accompanies this bill we are calling for the U.S. Department of Agriculture and the Food and Drug Administration to work together to improve the methods of testing and reviewing genetically modified foods, as well as providing more information to consumers.  We think that it is important that these two major agencies work together and though we probably have not done enough to completely satisfy the gentleman, I want to reassure him and the people of the State of Massachusetts that he represents, that there could be no more vigilant leader here on trying to protect the public's safety in food consumption with adequate information. I wanted to publicly state that and to thank the gentleman for coming to us and for leading us forward in our own efforts.
