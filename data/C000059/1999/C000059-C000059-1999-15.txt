Chairman, I yield myself the balance of my time.  Mr. Chairman, in closing, it is constitutional, it is common sense, it is constructive. I have been for this since I have been in Congress. I am in my fourth term. I was for this in my first term, and I am still for this. It is a good idea. Give your citizens a greater voice and vote for this amendment.
