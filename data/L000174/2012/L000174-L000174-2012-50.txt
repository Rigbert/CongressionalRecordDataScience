President, first, I wish to join my thoughts on those of the two Senators from Connecticut and the Senator who just spoke, Senator Blumenthal. He and I talked this weekend during these terrible times, and I told him the Judiciary Committee and the Department of Justice, on behalf of all the victims, were standing by to help them in any way they can.                          ____________________
