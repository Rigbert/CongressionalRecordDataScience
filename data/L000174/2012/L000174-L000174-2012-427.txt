I could not agree more with the distinguished senior Senator from Florida. He notes that 4 months ago, when Judge Adelberto Jordan came out of the Senate Judiciary Committee with every single Republican and every single Democrat voting for him, after the work done by the distinguished senior Senator from Florida and his colleague from Florida, the Senator from Florida, Mr. Nelson, made a commitment that every single Democrat would vote for this Cuban American immediately. Four months later, having had the cloture vote the Senator from Florida just mentioned--there was overwhelming support for him--he is still being held up. This is beneath the Senate of the United States of America. I agree with the Senator from Florida.
