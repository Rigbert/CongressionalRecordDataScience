 President, today I am pleased to introduce the Cell Phone Contraband Act of 2009. This bill would close a loophole that currently exists in Federal law by prohibiting the possession of cell phones and other wireless devices by prisoners in Federal facilities.  Currently, cell phones found in prisons are not specifically defined as contraband material. As a result, guards and inmates found smuggling or in possession of a cell phone in a Federal prison are rarely punished.  This bill would close this loophole by defining cell phones as contraband material under Federal law. As a result, any person smuggling or in possession of a cell phone could potentially serve up to a year in prison.  A cell phone should never be in the hands of a prisoner. The presence of these cell phones poses a grave safety concern for staff, inmates, and the public. We know that inmates use these phones to conduct criminal business outside of prison walls, including directing gang hits, controlling drug trafficking operations and even conducting credit card fraud. Corrections departments across the country are reporting a sharp increase in the number of cell phones being smuggled into prison facilities.  In May, California Inspector General David Shaw released a report on inmate cell phone use in California state prisons. The report found that cell phone seizures have increased tenfold in two years--from 261 in 2006 to 2,811 in 2008. According to the California Department of Corrections and Rehabilitation, cell phone and electronic communication device possession, ``is one of the most significant problems facing the Department today.''  So far this year, authorities have discovered over 4,000 cell phones among inmates in California prisons. There are presumably thousands more that were not discovered. Smugglers receive hundreds of dollars for each cell phone and more money if the cell phone contains a camera.  Staff members who smuggle cell phones for inmates often receive more in compensation for the contraband phones than they do from their paychecks. The California Inspector General's report on inmate cell phone use found that inmates pay $500 to $1,000 per cell phone and noted that one corrupt correctional officer received approximately $150,000 in 1 year to smuggle cell phones to inmates.  The cell phone problem is not limited to California. Maryland, Kansas, Massachusetts, Oklahoma, South Carolina, Tennessee, and Texas are just some of the states that have reported serious incidents coordinated by an inmate with a cell phone.  In Maryland, an inmate used a cell phone from jail to order the assassination of a witness testifying against him.  In Tennessee, a corrections officer was killed as a result of an inmate using a cell phone to plan an escape.  Department of Homeland Security Assistant Secretary Dora Schriro told my office, and I agree that cell phones in prison are ``a more serious threat than drugs or other contraband.''  The problem in our Nation's Federal prisons is no better. In 2008, the Federal Bureau of Prisons confiscated 1,519 phones from Federal prison camps and 255 cell phones from secure Federal institutions. I expect that these numbers will continue to increase unless we take proactive steps to stop the problem.  In July, I became a cosponsor of the Safe Prisons Communications Act of 2009, authored by Senator Kay Bailey Hutchison. This bill would enable state and Federal prisons to petition the Federal Communications Commission and request to operate a wireless jamming device to block inmates from using cell phones to conduct criminal business from inside prison walls. Before granting permission, the FCC would have to first determine whether the jammer would interfere with emergency or public safety communications outside of the prison walls.  If enacted, the bill will provide another necessary tool in the effort to ensure that the growing problem of cell phones in prison does not turn into an epidemic. It is my hope that this will serve as a strong deterrent to those who would profit from smuggling cell phones and other wireless devices into our Federal prisons.  Our Federal prisons house some of the most dangerous criminals in our Nation. Cell phones allow prisoners to traffic drugs and carry out murders from within our prisons and that is unacceptable.  I urge my colleagues to support this important legislation.  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be printed in the Record.  There being no objection, the text of the bill was ordered to be printed in the Record, as follows:                                S. 1749       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of      the United States of America in Congress assembled,     SECTION 1.
