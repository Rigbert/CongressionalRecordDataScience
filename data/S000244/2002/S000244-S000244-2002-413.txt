Chairman, I am pleased to support the amendment. I think she has a very constructive amendment in giving both the INS and the Congress statistics relative to denials.  What we want to see in this restructured INS is a uniform application of the law, which means that if one applies at one INS office or restructured INS office, one should not get a different result if one applies at another office with the same set of facts and the same background. I think there is a great deal of suspicion that there is different strokes for different folks, depending upon what office one goes to or, even within an office, what immigration inspector ends up doing the adjudication. Having these statistics I think will help both the restructured agency in having uniform application of the law, as well as giving the Congress the data that is necessary to determine whether any further changes in the law are necessary.  So I am pleased to support the amendment, and I hope that it is speedily adopted.
