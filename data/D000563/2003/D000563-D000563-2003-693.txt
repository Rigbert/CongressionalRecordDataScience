President, if I may ask the Senator from Nevada, if the argument has been made by the Republicans that if we give the President another tax cut for elite investors and wealthy people that this will somehow create jobs, is it not fair for us to look back and see how successful the President was the last time he made this promise?  If I recall correctly, we gave this President a $1 trillion--some say $2 trillion--tax cut just 2 years ago. If I am not mistaken, we have lost jobs. Under this Bush administration, we have lost somewhere in the range of 2 million jobs. In my State of Illinois, under the Bush administration, we have lost 191,000 jobs, 20,000 manufacturing jobs in the last 12 months.  If the President's plan of tax cuts for wealthy people is exactly the medicine to cure our problems, how do we explain the fact that the economy is still so sick 2 years after the President tried this tax cut the first time?
