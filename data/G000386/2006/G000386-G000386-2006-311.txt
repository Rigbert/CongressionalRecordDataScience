 President, I would like to speak for 20 minutes on immigration.  Immersed in the routines of daily life, many people don't make an extra effort to track legislation as it winds through Congress. It usually takes an issue that hits close to home before it motivates people to take notice.  This issue has hit home to many. We have dived into a very passionate and emotional debate in the U. S. Senate. Our country was founded by immigrants, and continues to be a Nation of immigrants. We have benefited from the achievements of many new residents. And, today, people in foreign lands want to be a part of this great country.  Generation after generation tirelessly pursues the American Dream. We should feel privileged that people love our country and want to become Americans. We are a wonderful nation, and it is evident by the number of people who want to come here.  But it is hard to empathize with those who thumb their noses at the rule of law. Estimates say more than 11 million undocumented immigrants already live in the country.
