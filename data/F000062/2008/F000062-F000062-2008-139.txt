 It is very flexible. It is loaded with these chemicals.  So you can see Max is a little bit older, chewing on a teether. Tests found that teether contained a high level of phthalates.  In 2006, the San Francisco Chronicle sent 16 common children's toys like this teether to a Chicago lab to test whether they contained phthalates. They did, in fact.  The results should alarm parents everywhere. One teether contained a phthalate level of five times the proposed limit. A rubber duck sold at Walgreens had 13 times the amount of phthalates now permissible under California law. The face of a popular doll contained double California's new phthalates limits.  Another study tested 20 popular plastic toys. The results were equally troubling. A Baby I'm Yours doll sold at Target contained nearly 32 percent of phthalates. A toy ball sold at Toys R Us was found to contain 47\1/2\ percent phthalates. Three types of squeeze toys--a penguin and two ducks--contained high levels of phthalates. They were also bought at Wal-Mart and Target.  So I would like to, if I can, if I will be cleared to do it, send an amendment to the desk. The amendment would replicate what will be California law in 2008 and ban the use of the chemical phthalates in toys as California has done and eight States are continuing to do.  The European Union banned phthalates in 2006. That is all these countries: Austria, Belgium, Bulgaria, Cyprus, Czech Republic, Denmark, Estonia, Finland, France, Germany, Greece, Hungary, Ireland, Italy, Latvia, Lithuania, Luxembourg, Malta, the Netherlands, Poland, Portugal, Romania, Slovakia, Slovenia, Spain, Sweden, and the UK. They have all banned the use of these chemicals in children's toys. Fiji, Korea, and Mexico have also banned or restricted phthalates in children's products.  Beginning next year, toys containing more than trace amounts of phthalates cannot be sold in California stores. My home State was the first State to ban phthalates in toys and other children's products. Governor Schwarzenegger signed the legislation, which, as I say, will become effective in January of 2009. Eight States are following California's lead. Legislation has been offered in Washington State, Maryland, Hawaii, Illinois, Vermont, West Virginia, Massachusetts, and New York.  Unfortunately, toys containing phthalates are still available to children across this country. I think it is time for the rest of the country to follow the lead of California, the European Union, and other nations because without action the United States risks becoming a dumping ground for phthalate-laden toys that cannot legally be sold elsewhere. I think American children deserve better. Parents in every State should be able to enter any toy store, buy a present for their child, and know they are not placing their son's or daughter's health at risk.  This amendment follows the same standards already set by the European Union and California. It bans the use of six types of phthalates in toys. Three of the phthalates are banned from all children's toys; three others are banned from toys children place in their mouths. The amendment clearly states these chemicals cannot be replaced with other dangerous chemicals identified by the Environmental Protection Agency as carcinogens, possible carcinogens, or chemicals that can cause reproductive or developmental harm.  Now the science. The science involving phthalates is still evolving; however, we know exposure to phthalates can cause serious long-term effects. Some of the potential health effects and defects are highly personal and difficult to discuss. They are problems no parent would ever want a child to experience.  I have two anthologies here which I will make available, a phthalates research summary and a paper which summarizes several of the works of science.  Here are some of the effects: Pregnant women with high levels of phthalates in their urine were more likely to give birth to boys with reproductive birth defects. That is a University of Rochester 2005 study. Phthalate exposure has also been linked to the premature onset of puberty in young girls as young as 8 years old. That is a 2000 study published in Environmental Health Perspective. A 2002 study linked phthalate exposure levels to decreased fertility capacity in men. And phthalates found in household dust have been linked to asthma symptoms in children. That is a Swedish study. The evidence that phthalates cause health problems continues to mount. Young children whose bodies are growing and developing and extraordinarily sensitive are particularly vulnerable when exposed to phthalates in the toys around them.  Now, many American toy retailers have already stepped up when it comes to phthalates. I am very grateful for this. Target has already eliminated phthalates from baby changing tables. Late last year, they announced that most toys they sell will be phthalate-free by fall of 2008.  Wal-Mart and Toys R Us announced they will voluntarily comply with California's standard nationwide. These are two huge retailers that will voluntarily comply with the California standard. They informed toy producers that beginning in 2009, they will no longer sell toys that contain phthalates.  These retailers should really be commended. I would like to do so. Thank you, Wal-Mart, thank you Toys R Us and thank you, Target.  This action also underscores the emerging uneasiness about those chemicals, with toy retailers acknowledging that parents do not want to unwittingly provide their young children with toys that could prove hazardous to their health. The amendment I hope to enter levels the playing field in the toy industry, requiring every toy store and manufacturer to comply with the standards being voluntarily put in place.  I do wish to underscore an important point: This voluntary action, while highly commendable, should not take the place of an official regulatory standard.  Candidly, I can't imagine why we have waited this long. We always wait until the States take action. Some manufacturers have marketed products as phthalate free, but tests conducted by independent laboratories have found phthalates. Parents wishing to purchase phthalate-free toys must be able to know what it is they are buying. I firmly believe only a legal standard with the full weight of the law and potential legal consequences behind it will make that guarantee.  I wish to read from a letter from the Breast Cancer Fund:       On behalf of the Breast Cancer Fund and our 70,000      supporters across the nation, I am writing to express our      strong support for your amendment to the Consumer Product      Safety Commission Reform Act . . . which would prohibit the      manufacture, sale, or distribution in commerce of children's      toys and child care articles that contain phthalates.  It goes on to describe phthalates. It is signed by Jeanne Rizzo, R.N., Executive Director.  I ask unanimous consent to have this letter printed in the Record.  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in the Record, as follows:                                                    March 3, 2001.     Senator Dianne Feinstein,     U.S. Senate, Hart Senate Office Building, Washington, DC.       Dear Senator Feinstein: On behalf of the Breast Cancer Fund      and our 70,000 supporters across the Nation, I am writing to      express our strong support for your amendment to the Consumer      Product Safety Commission Reform Act (S. 2663) which would      prohibit the manufacture, sale, or distribution in commerce      of children's toys and child care articles that contain      phthalates.       Phthalates are a family of industrial chemicals used in a      wide variety of consumer products including plastics, nail      polish, perfumes, skin moisturizers, baby care products and      toys, flavorings and solvents. These chemicals don't stay in      the plastics they soften or in the countless other products      in which they are used. Instead, they migrate into the air,      into food and/or into people, including babies in their      mother's wombs. Phthalates have been found in indoor air and      dust and in human urine, blood, and breast milk. What's      especially troubling about phthalates is that they are      powerful, known reproductive toxins that have been linked to      birth defects in baby boys, testicular cancer, liver problems      and early onset of puberty in girls--a risk factor for later-     life breast cancer. The European Union and 14 other      countries, including Japan, Argentina and Mexico, have      already banned these chemicals from children's toys.       BCF was one of the primary sponsors of AB1108--a bill      recently signed into law by Governor Schwarzenegger which      made California the first State in the Nation to ban the use      of phthalates in toys and other childcare articles. Now 12      other States have followed suit and have introduced--or are      considering introducing--legislation to ban phthalates in      toys and other products.       Obviously, there is nothing more important to the future of      this country, and the world than ensuring our children are      healthy today. By supporting your amendment, Congress has the      opportunity to protect children from dangerous, unsafe and      unnecessary exposures to toxic chemicals in the products they      play with every day such as teethers, toys and childcare      items. Thank you for your critically important leadership on      this issue.           Very truly yours,                                                     Jeanne Rizzo,                                               Executive Director.
