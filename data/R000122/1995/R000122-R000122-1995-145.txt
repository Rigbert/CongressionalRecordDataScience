Speaker, It gives me great pleasure to rise today to pay tribute to a man who has dedicated his life to the battle against hunger. Mr. Alan Shawn Feinstein is a businessman, philanthropist, and humanitarian. Mr. Feinstein is the founder of World Hunger Program at Brown University, the first university center for research and education addressing the issue of world hunger. He also found 10 community food banks throughout Providence and is a contributor to 30 other food banks across Rhode Island.  However, his efforts go far beyond simply providing contributions and food to battle hunger. Mr. Feinstein has been instrumental in elevating the plight to end hunger to statewide and national attention. His belief that on one should go hungry has been his motivation to get other people involved, in particular our Nation's youth. In 1990, he established the Youth Hunger Brigade in Rhode Island--a statewide initiative to involve eighth-grade students in the study of the causes and effects of hunger and the development of programs. The Congressional Hunger Center, of which Mr. Feinstein is the honorary chairman, is now working to establish this program in schools nationwide.  As a former public school teacher, Mr. Feinstein has always recognized that our children are one of our most important assets, and he has continually worked to improve the lives of many Rhode Island students by establishing community service projects, scholarships, and grants for self-developed programs. He has committed over $1 million to high schools throughout Rhode Island in order to start public service programs and to give students the chance to put their ideas to work. His support has enabled students to design, develop, and implement their own programs to fight hunger. Mr. Feinstein has also committed $1 million to teach community service and its rewards to children in elementary schools across Rhode Island.  Author of one of the most widely circulated financial newsletters with over 350,000 subscribers world-wide, Mr. Feinstein has also authored several best-selling financial guides, a novel, and several children's books. He has been the recipient of numerous awards and citations for his dedication to the cause of world hunger. With all of these achievements under his belt, Mr. Feinstein continues to strive to [[Page E620]] bring people together to learn about world hunger and empower them to take action. His financial contributions have been great, but it is his compassion and sense of humanity which has been the force behind his actions.  Mr. Speaker, it gives me great pleasure to commend this individual today, and I would ask my colleagues to join me in saluting Mr. Feinstein.                          ____________________
