 Here is a full page ad today, in the Washington Post, paid for by a gazillionaire named Jerome Kohlberg who firmly believes everybody's money in politics is tainted except his. His money, of course, is pure. This is the same individual who spent $\1/2\ million in Kentucky in 1998 trying to defeat our colleague, Jim Bunning, and I have defended his right, obviously, over the years to do what he wants to do with his money.  It further points out that no matter what we do in the Senate, people of great wealth are still going to have influence. You are not going to be able to squeeze that out of the system.
