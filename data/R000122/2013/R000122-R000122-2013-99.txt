President, today I pay tribute to an exceptional library advocate and public servant in Rhode Island, Howard Boksenbaum, who is retiring from his position as the State's chief library officer after a long and distinguished career.  Howard graduated with a linguistics degree from Washington University in St. Louis and Waseda University in Tokyo, earned a master's degree in library and information science from the University of Pittsburgh, and started his career working at various library positions in Pennsylvania before moving to Rhode Island.  His service to Rhode Island libraries began nearly 34 years ago at the Island Interrelated Library System, which, at the time, was one of five regional library systems in the State. In 1988, he joined the State's Department of State Library Services, which later became the Office of Library and Information Services, OLIS. After serving in various capacities within these agencies, and as assistant director for Central Information Management Services at the Rhode Island Division of Information Technology, Howard became the state's chief library officer in 2007.  During his more than three decades working for Rhode Island libraries and the State's library agency, Howard helped improve Rhode Island's libraries in many important ways. His focus on and passion for technology brought our State's libraries further into the digital age. He worked to consolidate Rhode Island's regional library networks into a single statewide system and created Ocean State Free-Net, a public access computer network. He also played a major role in other statewide technology initiatives, including working on the state's website launch and helping to establish the statewide public safety communication network, RISCON. Howard was also part of the Rhode Island Library Association and the Coalition for Library Advocates.  His view of the importance of libraries to our citizens, to our communities, and to our Nation can be found in a quote of his soon after he became chief library officer:       A library is bigger than the web because it includes it,      bigger than its users because they grow there. Unlike a      school, a library is elective, unlike a store, a library      belongs to its users, unlike the World Wide Web, a library is      people, is history, is culture, is connection. A library is      the past and the present and will be changing again to be the      future.  Rhode Islanders have been fortunate to have Howard devote more than three decades of service to the state and its libraries, and especially for the past 6 years he served as chief library officer. I have also had the benefit of his knowledge and insights about libraries, and worked with him on legislative initiatives to enhance federal support for libraries.  I would also like to recognize Howard's wife Judith Stokes and his three daughters Anna, Martha, and Emily. I join many others in the State in thanking Howard for his dedication and service to our State's libraries, and I ask my colleagues to join us in commending Howard Boksenbaum on his long and accomplished career. I wish him fulfillment and continued success in his future endeavors.                          ____________________
