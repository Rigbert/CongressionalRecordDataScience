Speaker, I would hope the majority leader might give us some idea. Obviously, everybody in this town and around the country believes the possible legislation that might come forward is a version of, revision of, the American Health Care Act that has been pending for some time not necessarily on the House floor, but in this House.  Can the gentleman tell me whether or not Members ought to prepare for a debate on that bill tomorrow? And if so, does the gentleman know whether there will be a CBO score on the bill that might be brought to the floor, and thirdly, the timing for tomorrow so that Members might plan on what the schedule would be?  I yield to my friend.  Mr. McCARTHY. I thank my friend for yielding. I appreciate his questions.  As has been reported in the press, we have made significant progress on our healthcare bill. When we are ready to bring the bill to the floor, I will make an announcement and relay scheduling information to all Members.
