 President, there are a couple of items on the Executive Calendar cleared. I ask unanimous consent that the Senate immediately proceed to executive session to consider the following nominations on today's calendar: Calendar No. 61 and 362. I further ask unanimous consent that the nominations be confirmed; that the motion to reconsider be laid upon the table; that the President be immediately notified of the Senate's action; and that the Senate then return to legislative session.
