 Speaker, in the United States of America millions of our citizens should not be forced into worrying about how they are going to heat their homes in this record breaking cold weather winter.  In Vermont and throughout this country we have had nights of 20 below zero, 30 below zero, and even 40 below zero.  The LIHEAP Fuel Assistance Program has provided over 24,000 Vermont households, and 6 million low-income households nationally, including many senior citizens, with the fuel assistance they need to survive the freezing weather. Three-quarters of the households on LIHEAP have incomes of less than $8,000 a year.  Today, I am sending Appropriations Committee Chairman Robert Livingston a letter with over 115 congressional signatures, Democrats and Republicans, asking him to make certain that the continuing resolution that is passed by Friday contains full funding for LIHEAP--and that the remaining $200 million that was appropriated is released.  This is America, and 80-year-old senior citizens should not be forced to go cold in the winter.                          ____________________
