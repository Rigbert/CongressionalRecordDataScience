  Mr. DeFAZIO. Mr. Speaker, ``emergency,'' an unforeseen combination of circumstances or the resulting state that calls for immediate action.  Today the House of Representatives, under Republican leadership, will declare an emergency, $4.5 billion for the decennial census. Since that is requiredin Article 1, Section 2 of the Constitution, Thomas Jefferson could have predicted that we would have to do a census next year, but not the Republican leadership. No.  This is the second of at least three emergencies they are going to declare this year: The war in Kosovo, with a whole lot of things added in; the drought, a real emergency; and now, the census; more than $27 billion.  The emergency is, they want to deny the reality of the budget. That reality is, we now have a deficit looming next year and for years to come because of faulty assumptions and emergency spending and other needs of the government.  The emperor has no clothes, and the Republicans have no surplus to spend on tax cuts for the wealthy. But they continue to deny that reality with shenanigans like emergency spending for routine, constitutionally-required government duties. It is a very bad joke.                          ____________________
