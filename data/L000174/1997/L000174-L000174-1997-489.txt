President, I join as an original sponsor of the Law Enforcement Officers' Bill of Rights Act of 1997.  Our State and local law enforcement officers are the backbone of our nation's anticrime, antigang and anti-drug efforts. Together with local prosecutors and an energized public, our local law enforcement officers are responsible for much of the good news we have had over the last few years, as crime rates across the county have declined. The President's community policing program, which is assisting local law enforcement to add 100,000 additional cops on the beat, is paying off. More police officers are patrolling our neighborhoods, towns, cities, and rural areas, and it is helping communities across America.  On the first day of this Congress, I joined in sponsoring S. 15 with the minority leader and other Democrats. With that bill, we hope to take the next step against crime by redoubling our efforts against youth gangs and drugs. State and local officers are essential participants in these initiatives.  When I was privileged to serve as state's attorney for Chittenden County, I had the good fortune to work alongside a number of dedicated State and local officers. These public servants literally put their lives on the line each day to protect all of us. Since coming to the Senate, I have tried to do my best to support local law enforcement. Their responsibilities require split-second judgment, dedication, timing, and guts. We hold the men and women who serve in law enforcement to the highest standards because public respect for the law is so critical.  This legislation is an effort to spell out what the Constitution's guarantee of due process means to law enforcement officers subjected to administrative disciplinary proceedings. It is our hope that these standards will serve the public by helping specify fair, prompt procedures for determining whether a rule relating to an officer's service has been violated. This measure should make unnecessary prolonged litigation challenging whether disciplinary procedures were sufficient to satisfy officers' constitutional rights to due process. These kinds of fair processes should provide the public and law enforcement officers with confidence in both the outcome of such administrative proceedings as well as the fairness of the procedures used to determine questions of possible misconduct.  When a law enforcement officer engages in wrongdoing, it reflects badly on all law enforcement. No one is harder on those few officers who go bad than fellow law enforcement officers. This bill will do nothing to protect those wrongdoers. Officers under criminal investigation or those subject to immediate suspension because there is probable cause to believe they committed a felony or pose a threat to public safety will find no comfort here. This bill should not affect criminal investigations, nor for that matter, civil lawsuits against officers.  The procedural protections provided by this bill attach in administrative proceedings. They provide officers with a minimum threshold of due process protection by requiring that the officers be informed of charges against them, have a right to a fair hearing, be allowed representation, be advised of the results of internal investigations and be afforded an opportunity to review and comment on adverse actions.  I hope that we can make progress on this bill and look forward to working with representatives of State and local government, police chiefs, sheriffs, troopers, and other interested parties as we proceed. As a cosponsor, I will work to improve this bill. For example, I would like to be able to provide greater privacy protection for officers' medical records as well as for the financial information already included in the bill. At the same time, I remain concerned that disciplinary actions be open to the public. When a hearing is justifiably closed, its results should nonetheless be made public. I am confident that we can work out such details in a consensus, bipartisan effort.  I am convinced that it is worth the effort to reassure those who serve us that we respect their rights and reputations. While no one is above the law, everyone is entitled to be treated fairly.                                 ______                                       By
