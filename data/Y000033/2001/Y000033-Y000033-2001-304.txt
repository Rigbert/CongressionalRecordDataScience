Mr. Chairman, I make a point of order against the language found at page 23, beginning on line 20 and continuing to page 24, line 2, which begins ``Providing further, that notwithstanding section 3008 of Public Law 105-78'' and ending on page 25, line 2, with ``capital investment grants.''  This language violates the guarantees of TEA-21 to provide funds for the Clean Fuels Bus formula grant program to the other discretionary grant program. This language supersedes existing law and clearly constitutes legislation on an appropriations bill in violation of clause 2 of rule XXI of the rules of the House of Representatives.
