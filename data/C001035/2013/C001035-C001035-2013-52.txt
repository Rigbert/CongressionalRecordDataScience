President. I rise today to commemorate the 250th anniversary of the Town of Fryeburg, ME, the first town established in the beautiful White Mountains of Maine and New Hampshire. The same spirit of determination and resiliency that carved a community out of the wilderness two and a half centuries ago still guides Fryeburg today.  In 1763, the Seven Years' War between France and Great Britain for control of North America ended with a resounding British victory. In recognition of his courageous service, GEN Joseph Frye, an American-born militia commander, was rewarded with a homestead grant in the White Mountains region. He chose the place where the great Saco River tumbles from the mountains on its journey to the sea, a place of vast forests and fertile farmland. That first settlement of seven lots soon grew into a thriving town, incorporated in 1777 and named in General Frye's honor.  That first settlement was built on the foundation laid a half century before by another early American hero, CPT John Lovewell. His valiant deeds to secure the colonies' northern frontier--including the legendary Battle of the Pond in 1725--were celebrated by such authors as Longfellow, Hawthorne, and Thoreau. From those long ago days to the present, the Veterans Honor Roll in Bradley Park memorializes the more than 1,200 patriots from Fryeburg who have served our Nation in times of peril.  As the town of Fryeburg became a bustling center of industry with lumber and grain mills, the townspeople invested their prosperity in education and in 1792 established Fryeburg Academy, one of America's oldest preparatory schools. Among the academy's first teachers was Daniel Webster, before he began his remarkable career as a statesman in the U.S. Senate and as America's Secretary of State. Fryeburg's connection to the world of ideas was strengthened in 1997 when the International Musical Arts Institute was established, bringing world-class musicians and conservatory students together every summer for concerts that enrich the community.  The coming of the railroads in the mid-19th century made Fryeburg, with its spectacular scenery, mountain breezes, and pristine waters, a favorite destination for city dwellers escaping the summer heat. Among those who found their way to Fryeburg during that era was the legendary Arctic explorer Robert Peary, who sharpened his navigation skills while surveying the town as a young civil engineer. Today, visitors and residents alike enjoy Fryeburg's many quiet parks, beautifully maintained historic buildings, and exciting outdoor recreation opportunities. The annual Fryeburg Fair, Maine's largest agricultural exhibition, keeps the town's origins and traditions alive.  The celebration of Fryeburg's 250th anniversary is not merely about the passing of time. It is about human accomplishment. We celebrate the people who, for longer than America has been a nation, have pulled together, cared for one another, and built a great community. Thanks to those who came before, Fryeburg, ME, has a wonderful history. Thanks to those there today, it has a bright future.                          ____________________
