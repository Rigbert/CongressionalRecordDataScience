President, I tell my distinguished friend, the senior Senator from Nevada, that I checked. I know his office also checked on our side of the aisle. Everybody is in favor. We were told that the Democratic side of the aisle wanted to let it go through in wrap-up last week. I am told there is a lot of legislation in here sponsored by distinguished members of the Republican Party who support it. But the hold has been a continuing hold on the Republican side. I can't understand why. This is as close to a motherhood bill as I have seen here in years.
