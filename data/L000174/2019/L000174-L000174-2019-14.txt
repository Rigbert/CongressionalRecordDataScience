President, I will be brief.  I agree with the distinguished senior Senator from Alabama. The Paul amendment imposes a 1-percent across-the-board cut over last year's funding level to the vast majority of discretionary spending for the duration of the CR.  I hope all Members--Republican and Democratic alike--will oppose it because it would mean arbitrary cuts in defense and other national security programs, cuts to veterans' healthcare, education, childcare, opioid programs, just to name a few. It is a simplistic tool that ignores the complexities of our Federal budget. It is not a way we should govern.  We have the hard work of making hard choices to fund programs each year based on reality. That is what we should do. That is what the American people deserve.  I support increased investment in our Nation's infrastructure. I would be happy to work with Senator Paul to ensure these programs receive the resources they require.  I hope he might be able to get some support from the Trump administration, which has consistently proposed cutting resources to improve our Nation's infrastructure. I hope he might be able to get that kind of support, but funding it through an across-the-board cut on all other programs, including veterans healthcare, national security, and education programs is irresponsible. It is not the answer.
