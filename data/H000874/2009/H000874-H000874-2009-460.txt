Mary's College of Maryland. Unfortunately, both of them have chosen to move on to new challenges and will be leaving this summer, so I wanted to reflect on the incredible contributions they have both made to the College.  Jane Margaret O'Brien leaves as the president of St. Mary's College of Maryland, having served in that capacity since 1996. Maggie is a personal friend and I want to salute her years of leadership as President, along with Torre Meringolo, who has served during much of that time as Vice President for Development. Together, they brought to St. Mary's College a strong reputation for excellence in scholarship, research, and community engagement.  Dr. O'Brien received her bachelor's degree from Vassar College in 1975 with a major in biochemistry. She completed a Ph.D. in chemistry at the University of Delaware in 1981. In her early academic career she was a member of the chemistry and biochemistry department at Middlebury College where she also served as dean of the faculty. She was president of Hollins University from 1991-96.  Dr. O'Brien received a Kellogg National Leadership Fellowship from 1989-92, served as an International Fellow with the American Association of Colleges and Universities in 1990-91, and was an Eisenhower Fellow to Malaysia and Hungary in 1999. She is a member of Phi Beta Kappa and the science honors society Sigma Xi. After stepping down as president, Dr. O'Brien will continue to work for the College with the Centre for Medieval and Renaissance Studies in Oxford, England.  Dr. O'Brien assumed her post in July 1996 and dedicated herself and the College to the newly adopted Honors College Curriculum. She provided critical guidance to the College's external relations and fundraising, which included the $40 million Heritage Campaign in support of the faculty's academic leadership, the extension of the residential college, and the enhancement of community programs. Fundraising during Dr. O'Brien's tenure reshaped the College's scholarships, professorships, lecture and learning series, and arts, athletic, and community programs. External support made possible the Paul H. Nitze Scholars Program, the annual River Concert Series, over 40 new scholarships, nine endowed professorships and chairs, and many student and faculty awards presented at the annual Awards Convocation.  The Center for the Study of Democracy was established with a $2 million NEH grant and challenge matches. Private funds now support the William Donald Schaefer Internships, the Ben Bradlee Lectures, the Andrew Goodpaster Lecture Series and the Patuxent Defense Forum.  In honoring the successful accomplishments at St. Mary's College under Maggie's leadership, we should also recognize the accomplishments of Torre Meringolo, who has been instrumental in carrying out much of Maggie's vision for the College. Torre also leaves this month after serving most of his 15 years at St. Mary's College as the Vice President for Development. He has accepted the position of vice president for university advancement and external relations at the University of Mary Washington.  Torre leaves a proud record of accomplishment at St. Mary's. Hired originally as director of the library and information services, he directed a comprehensive modernization effort that encompassed library partnerships with the University of Maryland System, raised $2 million for library endowment, and provided the foundation for a contemporary IT system. Torre's previous employment at the University of Massachusetts at Amherst, Penn State University, and UNC Charlotte brought a strong knowledge of information systems to St. Mary's, which he deftly adapted for a smaller-scale campus with modest resources.  In concert with Trustee Terry Rubenstein, chair of the board's development committee, Torre led a professional development team that successfully completed a $40.4 million campaign. During his time, endowment funds at the College grew to over $24 million. Torre worked to create a modern, professionally run Foundation, which granted over $16 million for the College's programs over the past 10 years. His passion for supporting students with financial needs made possible the graduation of many alumni.  Under Torre's leadership, the Alumni Office now serves 11,000 proud alumni with regular events and mailings to keep alumni involved and informed. His work has led to the creation of major campus events such as Reunion Weekend, Governor's Cup, Madrigals, and now the River Concert Series on the Townhouse Greens, all successful programs that bring thousands of alumni and friends to the College annually.  As Maggie O'Brien and Torre Meringolo depart, St. Mary's College is today a nationally recognized leader. Newsweek has called it ``an Ivy-level College with a public-school price tag.'' It is now consistently ranked as one of the best liberal arts schools in the nation by U.S. News and World Report, and the Princeton Review named it a ``best value college'' this year.  I want to congratulate Maggie and Torre for their contributions to higher education. Their accomplishments at St. Mary's College of Maryland have greatly benefitted their community and our State of Maryland. Both of them will be sorely missed.                          ____________________
