 President, the Senate is about to pass a short-term highway extension. This 3-week extension will allow the House and Senate to go to conference on our bipartisan bill and allow that to be signed into law by November 20.  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the Senate proceed to the immediate consideration of H.R. 3819; that the bill be read a third time and the Senate proceed to vote on passage of the bill with no intervening action or debate; that upon disposition of H.R. 3819, the Senate proceed to executive session to consider Calendar No. 356; that the Senate vote on the nomination without intervening action or debate; that following disposition of the nomination, the motion to reconsider be considered made and laid upon the table with no intervening action or debate; that no further motions be in order to the nomination; that any statements related to the nomination be printed in the Record; and that the President be immediately notified of the President's action and the Senate then resume legislative session.
