 President, I rise today to pay tribute to a fellow Iowan, Marine Cpl Jarrod Maher, who gave his life for his country in Iraq, and to express my heartfelt sympathy to his family. A native of Imogene, IA, Corporal Maher was serving in the Baghdad suburb of Abu Ghraib as a member of the 1st Battalion, 4th Marine Regiment, 1st Marine Division, 1st Marine Expeditionary Force stationed in Camp Pendleton, CA. Only 2 weeks after his graduation from Shenandoah High School, Maher became a marine. Corporal Maher is survived by his father and mother, Kevin and Jacque Maher, as well as numerous siblings.  Jarrod Maher will be missed by a great many people. His service and sacrifice represent Iowa at its best. In describing him, his father, Kevin Maher said, ``He loved being a Marine, but he also loved coming home. He loved the farm. He loved to help.'' In honor of Jarrod's spirit of selflessness, I ask my colleagues in the Senate and my fellow Americans to join me in paying respect to Marine Cpl Jarrod Maher.                          ____________________
