Speaker, I rise today to honor and pay tribute to the remarkable Douglas Magnon who passed away on Wednesday, February 4, 2015 in California. Doug was a pillar of the community in Riverside, California and he will be deeply missed.  Doug was a man of many passions, most notably was for motor racing. Sparked early on in his childhood through accompanying his father, Raymond, to races at the Riverside International Raceway, Doug was inspired to launch the Riverside International Automotive Museum. By means of his active leadership and profound knowledge of automobiles, the museum quickly received resounding support from the greater racing community that still continues today. The Riverside International Automotive Museum is one of the most highly regarding racing collections in Northern America with its extensive collection of unmatched artifacts and materials from throughout racing history. However, Doug did not stop there. In 2013, with the support and partnership of friend Paul Kinsella, the two opened up Newport Italian, a motorcycle dealership specializing in Vespa, Moto Guzzi and Aprilla.  When not hitting high speeds, Doug could often be found honing his culinary skills and sharing his Italian recipes with the community. In 2012, Doug and his sister opened the family restaurant Magnone Trattoria & Market, for which Doug not only created the menus, but also served as executive chef.  As an avid supporter of the Riverside community, Doug also freely gave his time and talents to many local organizations such as the Riverside County Philharmonic and the University of California, Riverside. In addition to serving as a mentor to young and aspiring individuals, Doug would often inspire anyone he crossed paths through his generous heart and unabashed enthusiasm for life.  Doug was the loving husband to Evonne, son to Raymond and Elaine, brother to Deanna, Cheryl, Patti and Ryan, and devoted uncle to many nieces and nephews. On Sunday, February 15, 2015, a memorial service celebrating Doug's extraordinary life will be held. Doug will always be remembered for his incredible contributions to business, his work ethic, generosity, and love of family. The way in which Doug lived his life should serve as reminder to others that the power of an individual with drive, perseverance and a strong work-ethic can do great things. His dedication to his work, family and community are a testament to a life lived well and a legacy that will continue. I extend my condolences to Doug's family and friends; although Doug may be gone, the light and goodness he brought to the world remains and will never be forgotten.                          ____________________
