 President, I rise in opposition to the Enzi amendment. I congratulate the chairman and the ranking member for the work they have done on this bill. But this amendment significantly disadvantages at least nine jurisdictions facing HIV/AIDS crises throughout the country because it essentially would prevent any stop-loss provision enacted by the House from going into effect.  Senator Enzi, Senator Kennedy, and the rest of the HELP Committee worked tirelessly for most of last year to reauthorize the Ryan White CARE Act. I voted for this reauthorization, and I recognized at the time that the method of counting HIV/AIDS victims had to change to more clearly reflect living victims. However, this then mandated huge cuts to vital programs, despite the fact that States and eligible metropolitan areas were assured that no jurisdiction would face destabilizing losses.
