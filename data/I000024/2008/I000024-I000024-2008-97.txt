 I am going to object, as I said earlier, to any of our speakers going over because they would be doing that at the expense of those who have not had a chance to speak. So let me renew that unanimous consent request, that the times for the next speakers will be Senator Vitter for 10 minutes, Senator Corker for 10 minutes, Senator Sessions for 5 minutes, Senator Domenici for 15 minutes, Senator Inhofe for 10 minutes, then Senator Boxer for 5 minutes, and Senator Inhofe for 5 minutes.
