President, very quickly, the Senator from North Carolina worked very hard to get legislative language in the bill which has a study of the sufficiency of the airlift requirements for the units stationed at Fort Bragg, NC. This legislation would take several aircraft that are at Little Rock and move them up to North Carolina. It would not effectively help the mobility of our forces. It would micromanage the use of military aircraft. As such, I would ask that there be a ``no'' vote.  I ask for the yeas and nays.
