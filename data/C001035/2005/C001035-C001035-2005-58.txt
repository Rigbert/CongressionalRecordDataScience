President, if I may respond to the Senator from Virginia, the distinguished chairman of the Armed Services Committee, first, let me commend the chairman of the Armed Services Committee for his thoughtful approach to the issue of whether our laws and authorities are adequate to deal with a disaster of the magnitude of Katrina.  He has indicated his interest in taking a hard look at the Posse Comitatus law and also the Insurrection Act, both of which put certain restrictions on the ability of Active-Duty Forces to be used for law enforcement purposes and in other ways. I commend him for raising these very important issues.  It was evident from the briefing we had with FEMA and Coast Guard officials last week before the Homeland Security Committee that those on the front lines believe the current structures are inadequate to deal with a catastrophe of this magnitude. We talked directly to FEMA's Director of Operations as well as to a Coast Guard admiral who has been in charge of the search-and-rescue operation. Each of them, in response to questions from both of us, indicated this catastrophe has overwhelmed the organizational structures and requires a new way of thinking. Both of them indicated interest in our taking a look, a close examination, at the two acts which the distinguished chairman has mentioned. I commend him for following up on this issue.  I think it is important that we look at that, as well as a host of other issues related to our preparedness and our response.
