Speaker, I take this time to proceed out of order for the purposes of asking something about the scheduling with the gentleman from Illinois [Mr. Hastert], and the gentleman from New York [Mr. Solomon].  Mr. Speaker, because the chairman of the Committee on Rules is on the floor and Mr. Hastert, another one of the leaders on your side of the aisle, I am very concerned that the Senate apparently has not yet passed the omnibus appropriation bill, or the CR, whatever we are calling the vehicle we are using to fund the balance of Government. The concern obviously is, as the chairman knows, the fiscal year ends in essentially 9 hours 45 minutes.  Can the gentlemen sort of enlighten us as to where the Senate might stand, what are the prospects of making sure we pass something by tonight, so that we do not put the Federal employees and the Federal Government to the test of shutting down and opening up?
