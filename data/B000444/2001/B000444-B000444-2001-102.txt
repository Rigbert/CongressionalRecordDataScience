 I will try not to take the whole 3 minutes.  If there is one thing that got the attention of the American people, of everything that has happened in the last 7 months, it is this issue. Why? The only thing I have ever seen that every Conservative, Liberal, Democrat, Republican, Socialist, Communist, Fascist--anybody who has a water tap in America--agrees upon, it is they fully expect, above all else, when they turn on their water tap, the water they are about to consume or give to their children is healthful, not harmful.  We can argue about 50 parts per billion, 10 parts per billion. This has been a revelation to the vast majority of the American people who do not already have water that is being held to the highest standard. We do not have to say anything back to folks in Delaware other than that our standards are the same as Bangladesh, lower than Europe.  This is not complicated. The science sustains the position that was taken. This was not arrived at. We are not even dictating 10 parts per billion in this amendment. We both wish we were, but we are not even doing that.  I conclude my very brief comments by saying my State of Delaware is not known as some liberal bastion. We are the corporate State of America. The legislature in my State of Delaware passed a law which says water coming out of the taps in Delaware can be no less than 10 parts per billion.  To those who do not like this amendment, get ready to explain it at home.  I compliment the Senator. She is dead on. This is one issue that every single constituent I know, unless they own a mining company, supports.
