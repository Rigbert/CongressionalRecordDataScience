President, I rise today to honor the memory of a courageous Oklahoman who died saving the lives of his men. Staff Sergeant Erickson H. Petty grew up in Fort Gibson, where he graduated from high school in 1993. Eric, as he was known, aspired to military service early, enlisting in the Oklahoma Army National Guard when he was 17. Upon graduation, he joined the active duty Army, where he served for nearly 10 years.  Eric has an extremely successful career in the Army, serving as a recruiter for a time and as a scout in the 1st Armored Division. On May 3, Staff Sergeant Petty and his men were guarding a weapons cache in Salman Al Habb when they came under small arms fire. Petty ordered his soldiers into the protection of their Humvees, taking coverlast to ensure the safety of his men. That decision, which so clearly demonstrated his sacrificial leadership, cost him his life.  Staff Sergeant Petty had two passions: his family and his country. Those who speak of him constantly refer to his devotion to his wife Kimberly, and especially to Colton, his 9-year-old son. In the words of a longtime friend, his relationship with his son was ``his center.'' Still, the call of duty was strong. Staff Sergeant Petty had the option to stay a recruiter, to stay with his family. He chose to serve, and for our sakes gave up safety, family, and finally his life.  America needs more committed servants like Staff Sergeant Petty. His life and death stand as a clear example of what it means to be a patriot, even at great cost. Eric Petty heeded his country's call, and for that we are all grateful. We would do well to remember his sacrifice as we celebrate his commitment to family, friends, and nation. He was Oklahoma's son and America's hero--Staff Sergeant Eric Petty.                      specialist james e. marshall  Mr. President, I also pay homage to Army Specialist James E. Marshall, who last month made the ultimate sacrifice for his country--his life. Although he was only 19 years old, Specialist Marshall was a dedicated defender of America and knew the value of freedom and the sacrifices freedom sometimes demands. For his service and his sacrifice, I am proud to honor him on the Senate floor today.  Specialist Marshall was a member of the First Battalion, 21st Field Artillery Regiment, of the First Cavalry Division based at Fort Hood, TX. A native Oklahoma from my hometown of Tulsa, Marshall was raised by his mother, Pamela. Specialist Marshall and his mother were very close; indeed, he pursued military service both to protect his country and to help provide for her, as she had done for him for so many years. We hold her in our prayers.  During his senior year, when classmates were pursuing scholarships and jobs, James Marshall was planning a different route. He had been considering military service for some time, and he saw it as an opportunity for personal development and a chance to prove himself.  Specialist Marshall died tragically on May 5 when the vehicle he and a fellow soldier were riding in was struck by an improvised explosive device in Baghdad, Iraq. On behalf of the U.S. Senate, I ask that we now pay tribute to James Marshall, who knew the true meaning of service and sacrifice. I am proud of him, and proud of his demonstrated commitment to winning the freedom of those he did not know. We will not forget this Oklahoma hero, this American patriot--Specialist James Marshall.                     corporal scott michael vincent  Mr. President, I rise today to honor the memory of a remarkable man. Corporal Scott Michael Vincent was a classic Oklahoman: a hard worker and a leader who was dedicated to his family, his faith, and his country.  Corporal Vincent hailed from one of Oklahoma's great small communities, Bokoshe, where he graduated from Bokoshe High in 2000. He had longtime aspirations to join the Marine Corps. When choosing a quote for his high school yearbook, he selected ``semper fidelis,'' the Marine Corps slogan he exemplified through his life--and his death. He achieved his goal of serving with the Corps when he joined last year, completing a tour in Afghanistan before volunteering for an extra tour in Iraq.  On Friday, April 30, Corporal Vincent was serving as a scout near Fallujah, in Iraq's Al Anbar province. While his unit was halted, a suicide bomber approached his vehicle from the rear and detonated his explosive device. Corporal Vincent and one other marine were killed, and six of their comrades were wounded.  Scott Vincent's remarkable life was confirmed by the way people in his hometown reacted to his death. Over 400 people in a town of 405 came to funeral services on May 6. Our small towns are like families, and they are the fertile ground from which outstanding, selfless leaders like Corporal Vincent emerge to take on the mantle of service to their nation.  In this time of trouble, we remember Corporal Vincent. We remember his family, and we grieve with them for their fallen son. In his life and his death, he set a high standard for all of us to follow. We will never forget him--Corporal Scott Michael Vincent.              chief warrant officer two lawrence s. colton  Mr. President, I rise today to honor the memory of a courageous Oklahoman who gave his life in defense of his Nation and his fellow soldiers. Chief Warrant Officer Two Lawrence Shane Colton hailed from Guthrie, OK. Shane was serving as an attack helicopter pilot in Iraq with the 1st Armored Cavalry division's Company C, 1st Battalion, 227th Aviation Regiment.  Shane joined the military as a clerk in 1992, eventually working his way up to Staff Sergeant and then through Warrant Officer Candidate School. He was highly decorated and regarded as a skilled and capable pilot by his fellow soldiers. On Easter Sunday, April 11, CW2 Colton and CW3 Chuck Fortenberry answered a call for help: a Coalition convoy had been ambushed after being halted by an improvised explosive device. The soldiers were pinned down under heavy fire and significantly outnumbered, and in desperation they called for relief. Shane and Chuck headed right for the scene of the battle and opened fire on the insurgent positions with 30-millimeter chain guns, killing many of the terrorists and destroying a building they were using. The convoy was able to escape, but the Apache was shot down by a small surface-to-air missile, and their rescuers were lost with it.  Shane was a man beloved by his friends and fellow soldiers because of his selflessness and optimism. To quote one of his comrades,       Shane would help you whenever you needed it too. If you had      a problem with your car all you had to do was call him up and      he would be there. He was also a whiz on computers and      electronics. If it was broke he could fix it. The best thing      about Shane was his attitude. No matter how crappy things      were he always had a smile on his face and would say      something to make you feel better.  Chief Warrant Officer 2 Colton was 32 years old when he lost his life. He left a young family to defend his country, knowing full well the risk he was taking. Ultimately, his commitment to his fellow Americans in Baghdad and at home would require his life. I know his friends and family realize that he died a true hero, worthy of the respect and gratitude of every American. They will miss him dearly, and our thoughts and prayers are with them today, particularly with his wife Inge and their children Jennifer and Lance, and with his parents Loren and Kathy Colton. And though we are all grieved by the loss of this man, we shall never cease to be proud of him--Oklahoma's son and America's hero--Chief Warrant Officer 2 Lawrence ``Shane'' Colton.
