Chairman, I rise in support of sound energy for American citizens.  First, I would like to thank the Members and staff of the four committees, the Committee on Energy and the Committee on Science, the Committee on Resources, and the Committee on Ways and Means, who have all worked so hard to bring this bill to the floor.  There are a few points that I would like to address that I believe are crucial for the future stability of energy in America.  First, I commend the inclusion of the hydrogen provision in H.R. 6, which is consistent with the President's call for alternative fuel sources in the future. We must actively pursue increased efficiency of fuel, reduced energy consumption, and additional research into alternative fuels such as hydrogen. The future of our economy and prosperity will ultimately depend on our ability to discover new ways to provide energy for our cars, homes, and businesses.  Another important aspect of energy policy is the reform of nuclear and worker safety regulation at the Department of Energy. The Department of Energy is the only Federal agency that self-regulates; and after 10 years of studies, it is time that we implement external regulation of nonmilitary labs, for the welfare of the workers and to the benefit of taxpayers.  While not included in this legislation, I am hopeful that we can pass other legislation to enact this reform and bring much-needed external regulation of worker safety and health to the Department of Energy.  I am also hopeful that as we confer with the other body we will broadly include innovations in the field of biosynthetic fuel. Again, I commend the efforts of the various committees which have brought this bill about and look forward to moving more options in the arena of energy policy for the benefit of the American public.
