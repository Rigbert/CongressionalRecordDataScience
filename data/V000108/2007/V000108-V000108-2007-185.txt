Chairman, I rise in opposition to the amendment offered by Mr. Westmoreland.  First of all, he did indicate that he was concerned about reinvestigations. I would simply indicate to my colleagues that the world changes every day, and there are times when we need to reassess the circumstances so that we can spend the taxpayers' dollars as wisely as possible.  The fact is that the Nation's investment in our water resources infrastructure has declined over the last three decades, from $6 billion per year to less than $4 billion in constant dollars.  If the tragedy in New Orleans has taught us anything, I hope it is that we have neglected our infrastructure. If the suffering of the residents in the gulf doesn't illustrate the point, simple fiscal prudence should. The cost of recovery in New Orleans will far exceed what it would have cost to provide additional flood and storm protection.  There are large cities that face high and increasing risk of catastrophic flooding. Sacramento is just one example.  We have high-hazard dams with safety issues. There are countless communities that do not have flood protection commensurate with the risk to those communities.  Much of our infrastructure is reaching its design life. Over 50 percent of the locks and dams owned by the Corps of Engineers are in this category. Aging infrastructure brings increasing costs, yet the funding for accounts at the Army Corps for this particular function have been flat over the last 30 years.  Circumstances have changed from the time much of our infrastructure has been designed, development patterns have changed, transportation networks and requirements have evolved. Yet we are not investing enough today to maintain what we already own or complete projects that are in progress today, much less plan for the future needs for the safety of our citizens and economic viability of our transportation system.  Due to insufficient funding, schedules are slipping and costs are growing, as we piecemeal these projects, if we do not act in a timely fashion.  There is a significant and growing backlog of civil works projects. Current estimates are as high as $60 billion. Funding for studies and investigations must be adequately funded so that we can proceed with these very important projects. And given the backlog in construction projects, the funding for investigations account is less than the current year.  The bill focuses funding on completing ongoing projects and maintaining existing infrastructure. However, it is very important, obviously, to plan for the future.  I would ask that my colleagues oppose the amendment.                              {time}  1215
