Chairman, I yield myself such time as I may consume.  Mr. Chairman, I want to say to the gentlewoman that in traveling the country and seeing that at least 70 percent of these civil rights cases are in the State of Mississippi, and in following a bit about how the cases are being adjudicated, I think the gentlewoman brings a very important set of issues to the floor today, and that is the difficulty with processing these cases, some of the bureaucratic, not just inertia, but, for example, when a case is settled, a claim is settled, then, for some reason, even after injury has been found, then that family's case is turned over to the FBI. Why? What is going on out there?  Mr. Chairman, I yield such time as she may consume to the gentlewoman from California (Ms. Waters) on such a critical question that the Department should be moving on expeditiously, and there should be justice in this system and justice should be swift and sure.
