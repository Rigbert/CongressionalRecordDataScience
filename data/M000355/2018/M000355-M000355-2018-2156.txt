 President, first, this morning began with reports of the tragedy at Marshall County High School in Benton, KY. State officials have reported at least one confirmed death and several injuries. My staff in Western Kentucky is at the high school and is in close contact with local officials. They are monitoring the situation and will be providing me with updates throughout the day.  I know I speak for communities across my home State in sending prayers of comfort and healing to students, faculty, and everyone affected by this violence. Our hearts are with the entire community in Marshall County, and our gratitude is with the first responders who rushed into harm's way.                          ____________________
