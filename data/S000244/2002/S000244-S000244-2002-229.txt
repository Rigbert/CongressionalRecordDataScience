Speaker, I move to suspend the rules and agree to the resolution (H. Res. 459) expressing the sense of the House of Representatives that Newdow v. U.S. Congress was erroneously decided, and for other purposes.  The Clerk read as follows:                               H. Res 459       Whereas on June 26, 2002, the Ninth Circuit Court of      Appeals held that the Pledge of Allegiance is an      unconstitutional endorsement of religion, stating that it      ``impermissibly takes a position with respect to the purely      religious question of the existence and identity of God,''      and places children in the ``untenable position of choosing      between participating in an exercise with religious content      or protesting.''       Whereas the Pledge of Allegiance is not a prayer or a      religious practice, the recitation of the pledge is not a      religious exercise.       Whereas the Pledge of Allegiance is the verbal expression      of support for the United States of America, and its effect      is to instill support for the United States of America.       Whereas the United States Congress recognizes the right of      those who do not share the beliefs expressed in the Pledge to      refrain from its recitation.       Whereas this ruling is contrary to the vast weight of      Supreme Court authority recognizing that the mere mention of      God in a public setting is not contrary to any reasonable      reading of the First Amendment. The Pledge of Allegiance is a      recognition of the fact that many people believe in God and      the value that our culture has traditionally placed on the      role of religion in our founding and our culture. The Supreme      Court has recognized that governmental entities may,      consistent with the First Amendment, recognize the religious      heritage of America.       Whereas the notion that a belief in God permeated the      Founding of our Nation was well recognized by Justice      Brennan, who wrote in School District of Abington Township v.      Schempp, 374 U.S. 203, 304 (1963) (Brennan, J., concurring),      that ``[t]he reference to divinity in the revised pledge of      allegiance . . . may merely recognize the historical fact      that our nation was believed to have been founded `under      God.' Thus reciting the pledge may be no more of a religious      exercise than the reading aloud of Lincoln's Gettysburg      Address, which contains an allusion to the same historical      fact.''       Whereas this ruling treats any religious reference as      inherently evil and is an attempt to remove such references      from the public arena.       Now, therefore, be it resolved by the House of      Representatives, That it is the sense of the House of      Representatives that--       (1) the Pledge of Allegiance, including the phrase ``One      Nation, under God,'' reflects the historical fact that a      belief in God permeated the Founding and development of our      Nation; and       (2) The Ninth Circuit's ruling is inconsistent with the      U.S. Supreme Court's First Amendment jurisprudence that the      Pledge of Allegiance and similar expressions are not      unconstitutional expressions of religious belief; and       (3) The phrase ``One Nation, under God,'' should remain in      the Pledge of Allegiance and       (4) the Ninth Circuit Court of appeals should agree to      rehear this ruling en banc in order to reverse this      constitutionally infirm and historically incorrect ruling.
