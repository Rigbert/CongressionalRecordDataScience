 President, I wish to recognize Dr. Frank Fiermonte, a physician from Orleans, VT, who cared for the people of Vermont's North Country with distinction for many years. As Vermont's Northland Journal prepares to publish the final installment of a series on Dr. Fiermonte, I want to join in recognizing his service to Vermont.  Dr. Fiermonte was a true ``country doctor'' who was willing to travel long distances to see his patients at all hours and in all seasons. I have heard Frank tell many an anecdote about how, after a home visit to a rural area, family and friends of the patient had to help him get his car unstuck during mud season or dug out from a snow bank in the winter.  Like many country doctors, he served a vast area, encompassing not just his hometown of Derby, but also a wide swath of Orleans and Essex Counties and even across the border into Quebec. Yet he intimately knew all of the families he served, which sometimes spanned several generations. The stories from North Country residents in the Northland Journal make it clear that Dr. Fiermonte made a tremendous impact on the community. This quote from a former Derby resident stands out in particular: ``Dr. Fiermonte was a godsend to the Derby area. He was always available day or night.''  What always strikes me most about Frank is how personal the practice of medicine was for him. In today's modern world, health care can sometimes be a very impersonal experience. In fact, there is much discussion in Vermont and Washington about returning to a more patient-centered system. We would do well to learn from people like Dr. Frank Fiermonte and his contemporaries, who are the embodiment of that ideal. Motivated by the desire to serve his community and deliver the best care possible, for Dr. Fiermonte, it was all about the patient.  Dr. Frank Fiermonte has earned my deepest respect, and I thank him for his years of service to the North Country.                          ____________________
