My wife and I got to know Mattie. My wife invited him to speak at the spouses dinner, the First Lady's luncheon. She told me I had to come down and meet this young man. I remember coming in there and talking with him. I also talked with him again by phone. I sort of hung back because I was not a Senate spouse. I sort of hung back in the corner and listened when he spoke. What an inspirational little boy.  I know the tug I felt when I turned on the news this morning and heard what we all knew was going to happen had happened. He is no longer with us.  Somebody in the news said he probably had more life in that short span than most people have. The Senator from Maryland said similar things. In this case, it is true. He really had.  I thank her for her statement. I know Marcelle and I had our hearts enriched by having met him.                          ____________________
