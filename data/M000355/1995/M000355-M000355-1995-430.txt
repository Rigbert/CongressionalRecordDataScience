J. Res. 23. A joint resolution proposing an amendment to the Constitution of the United States to repeal the 22d amendment relating to Presidential term limitations; to the Committee on the Judiciary.              joint resolution to repeal the 22d amendment Mr. McCONNELL. Mr. President, it is not without a sense of irony that I am introducing legislation today contrary to the spirit of one of the more notable provisions in the renowned Republican Contract With America. This resolution I put forth would repeal the Presidential term limit--the 22d amendment to the Constitution which Republicans hastily, and regrettably, passed nearly 50 years ago.  This is, in my view, the only term limits bill which should pass Congress.  As we all know, the Contract with America, signed by Republican candidates for the House of Representatives last year, included a call for congressional term limits. Term limits are wildly popular in some areas of the country. But term limits also are misguided, undemocratic and a particularly bad idea for some sparsely populated States where the clamor for them is greatest.  Fortunately, the contract promised a House vote on term limits, not passage. That vote is a promise the House should keep. And for the Nation's sake, it is my hope that the vote result will be a resounding ``no.''  The popular sentiment for term limits is the ultimate and, perhaps, inevitable manifestation of public disdain for government. It is what Congress gets for being irresponsible on the fundamentals--principally money matters. People justifiably do not feel they are getting a return on their investment in government. As their elected tax money managers, so to speak, we are in the crosshairs. And they are coming after us with term limits--a very blunt instrument of electoral revenge.  Term limits are the legislative translation of voters leaning out their windows screaming: We're mad as hell and not going to take it anymore.  Fifty years ago, there was such a sentiment, confined primarily to the Republican caucus, contained in the 1940 and 1944 Republican Party platforms, and directed at the architect of the New Deal--President Franklin Delano Roosevelt. In 1947, a Republican congressional majority, fresh from a virtual political exile, passed the 22d amendment to the Constitution to limit Presidents to two terms in office. They were determined that history not repeat itself--there would be no more four-term Roosevelts. They would see to it.  Mr. President, not a single Republican in the House or Senate voted against that term limit amendment in 1947. It was a brash, ill-conceived, hastily executed and strictly partisan response to the unprecedented tenure of President Roosevelt. As constitutional scholars have observed, this was the first constitutional modification that constricted voter suffrage. And Republicans should take heed, for it is we who have been hoisted by their petard. It is poetic justice, in a sense, that Presidents Eisenhower and Reagan are the only ones, thus far, who have been constrained by the 22d amendment.  The Presidential term limit does not, as some have contended, argue for congressional term limits. The 22d amendment was a mistake, Mr. President, and that is why I am introducing today a Senate Joint Resolution to repeal it. It would be fitting, and in the national interest, for the Republican majority of 1995 to rectify a mistake made by the Republican majority of 1947. Democrats hesitant to change that which has been the status quo for half a century may want to review President Harry S. Truman's words in favor of repeal:       What have you done? You have taken a man and put him in the      hardest job in the world, and sent him out to fight our      battles in a life and death struggle. And you have sent him      out to fight with one hand tied behind his back, because      everyone knows he cannot run for reelection.       He is still the President of the whole country, and all of      us are dependent upon him to do his job. If he is not a good      president, and you do not want to keep him, you do not have      to reelect him.  Mr. President, it is that simple. The vote gives voters the power to limit terms. Term limits, Presidential and congressional, are unnecessary and unwise.                          ____________________
