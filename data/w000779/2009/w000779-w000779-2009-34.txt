President, today I pay tribute to the 100th anniversary of an Oregon icon the Tillamook County Creamery Association, makers of Tillamook Cheese.  Since 1909, this world-famous, farmer-owned cooperative has been dedicated to producing the highest quality cheeses and other products from local dairies that have thrived in the lush coastal valleys around the community of Tillamook, OR. Tillamook Cheese is not just a commercial enterprise. It is the proud symbol of a way of life that has been passed on for generations.  The members of the Tillamook County Creamery Association have been mainstays of the local and state dairy industries and committed stewards of the environment. They employ more than 600 people at two factories in Oregon and have annual sales of nearly $400 million.  With all due respect to my colleagues from the great State of Wisconsin, Tillamook is cheese. Over the years, the Tillamook County Creamery Association has won hundreds of awards, including six at the 2009 Oregon Dairy Industries products contest and six at the 2008 National Milk Producers Association. It has also been recognized by the Portland Business Journal for the third year in a row as one of Oregon's ``Most Admired Companies.''  For decades, the Tillamook Cheese Factory has been a must-see stop for millions of tourists who travel highway 101. In recent years, the creamery association has expanded to other parts of the State, but its traditions are deeply rooted in the pastures and dairies that make Tillamook County and Tillamook Cheese what it is.                          ____________________
