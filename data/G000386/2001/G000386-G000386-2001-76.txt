 I am concerned that proposed Department of Defense, DoD, funding for the National Guard's FY-2002 Counterdrug Program, State Plans, is not sufficient to ensure the continuance of this valuable service to law enforcement and local communities, and request that the funding be increased $40.7 million, from the President's $154.3 million request, to a total of $195 million.  The National Guard's Adjutant Generals, from the various States, have indicated to the National Guard Bureau, that without a minimum of $195 million budgeted for this program, large personnel layoffs may occur. My staff has heard reports that one State may have to downsize by as much as one-third their personnel. Over ninety percent of the National Guard's counterdrug program costs are personnel-based, and as such, it is extremely sensitive to variations in funding, taking years to recover from any reduction in trained and experienced personnel. These reductions affect supported agencies, including the Customs Service, DEA, U.S. Border Patrol, FBI, HIDTAs, scores of State and local law enforcement agencies, and community based organizations.  I am also concerned about the apparent lack of emphasis, and even distancing of itself, by the Department of Defense, on the counterdrug mission, especially in a year of discussions of increased DoD funding for other military mission areas. I sense this repeatedly in insufficient funding for the National Guard and other critical counterdrug mission areas, and believe this would be a poor policy decision and a poor indication of the nation's priorities.  I urge my colleagues and the Department of Defense to give serious consideration to the National Guard program and its contribution to our national drug control strategy.                          ____________________
