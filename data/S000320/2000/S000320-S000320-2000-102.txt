 President, I rise today to recognize the work of the Cullman County Commission in Cullman County, Alabama, for its positive work in the community. I specifically want to pay tribute to Mr. George Spear, the Commission Chairman, as an individual who exemplifies the positive impact a public official can have on a community. Through his direct efforts, Mr. Spear has established the Cullman 2000 Committee, a year-long celebration bringing together both young and old in the area to honor the county's unique heritage and shared future.  Founded in 1873 by Col. John G. Cullmann, the county's roots are firmly entrenched in Alabama history. Cullman County is well known for its industry, modern health care, and agriculture production, which ranks at the top of the state. The many events planned throughout the year are designed to celebrate the county's history and successes and to give residents a sense of pride in their community and the common bond they share as members of the county. It will give all residents of Cullman County a sense of their place in county history.  I commend the Cullman County Commission and particularly Mr. Spear for his hard work and sense of civic pride. Without the efforts of the Commission, the Cullman 2000 Committee would not have been possible. As Cullman County looks toward the future, it is reassuring to know that the leaders of the county are keeping in mind the importance of the county's colorful past.                          ____________________
