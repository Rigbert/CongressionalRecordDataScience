Mr. Chairman, I would like to mention one thing. I do have an amendment for a future day--I am speaking to the gentleman--on NEPA. We don't change the NEPA policy at all, other than the fact that only those affected can have comments on how it affects their land, not a bunch of people from New York or Maine or Dallas or Florida. So that is really a red herring that was drug across this bill. This is to help the tribes.  Mr. Chairman, I yield such time as he may consume to the gentleman from Utah (Mr. Bishop), my good chairman of the full committee.
