Speaker, I yield myself 1 minute.  Mr. Speaker, the gentleman from Michigan (Mr. Conyers) I think was in error when he was saying that all of these people would have avoided billions and billions of dollars of liability. The fact is that this bill does not limit liability for proven economic damages, such as lost wages, lost future wages, rehab expenses, medical expenses and the like by one penny for anybody. The economic damages that are suffered are unlimited under this legislation. What it does limit is noneconomic damages that cannot be quantified.  What the gentleman from Michigan says is that we all should pay more in doctors' fees and the taxpayers should pay more in Medicare expenses simply because we do not want to limit noneconomic damages for maybe one plaintiff or a couple of plaintiffs.
