 President, it was great to see our now-former colleague, Senator Sessions, confirmed as the Nation's 84th Attorney General yesterday. We all had to watch as he was subjected to a terrible campaign of unfair and deeply personal attacks. He endured it all with grace, though, and with the same considerable dignity, respect, and courtesy we have longknown Senator Sessions for. We are going to miss him in the Senate, but we couldn't be more proud of him as he begins this new position.                          ____________________
