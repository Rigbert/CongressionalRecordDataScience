I planned on yielding to you. I would be happy to yield to you. I always do, and I failed to. I apologize.  Mr. McCAIN. Well, I guess my questions were, one, did the Senator, who claimed that no Republican has done anything to curb the health care insurance industry, was the Senator in the Senate when Senator Kennedy and I fought for weeks and months for the Patients' Bill of Rights? Was the Senator here then? Was he engaged in that debate? Senator Kennedy and I fought for the Patients' Bill of Rights, and the majority on that side of the aisle opposed it. The fact is, there have been efforts on my part to curb the abuses of the health insurance industry by sponsorship of the Patients' Bill of Rights.  Second, during the campaign, yes, I said that we could reduce and eliminate waste, fraud, and abuse in spending, and I said it because of Senator Coburn's Patients' Choice Act which would save $1 trillion in the States in Medicaid savings, $400 billion over the next 10 years in Medicare savings. I wish the Senator from Illinois would examine the Patients' Choice Act, as proposed by the Senator from Oklahoma. Maybe he would learn something. The Coburn bill wants to preserve the best quality health care in America and not eliminate $12 billion in the Medicare Advantage Program, which 330,000 of my citizens who are enrollees like and want to keep, not eliminate $150 billion to providers, including hospitals, hospice, and nursing homes, $23 billion in unspecified decreases to be determined by an independent Medicare advisory board, as well as billions of additional cuts to the Medicare Program.  There is no relation between what I tried to do in my campaign and what is being done in this legislation, I tell my friend from Illinois. I would be glad to hear the Senator's response. I would be glad to extend him that courtesy.
