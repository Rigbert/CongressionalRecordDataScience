President, I have been honored to know and work with many of the leaders in our military. One of the absolute finest I have known is General Joseph F. Dunford, Jr., the outgoing Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff. I have known General Dunford for years, certainly in his current capacity, but before that as Commandant of the Marine Corps. As the father of a marine, I looked at Joe Dunford as the best the Corps could have and what we all want from the men and women serving and leading the Marine Corps.  General Dunford has had a long and distinguished career of service as a marine. He was deployed during Operation Iraqi Freedom, earned the nickname ``Fighting Joe'' while serving under James Mattis, and led the U.S. and NATO forces in Afghanistan. He is admired by the men and women who served under him and is known for his respect and care for civilians caught up in conflict.  Marcelle and I were honored to travel with him to Vermont in 2017, where he gave the commencement address at St. Michael's College, 40 years after his own graduation at that same institution. He told the graduates about to step out into their futures, ``have the moral courage to do what's right, even when it's tough. Commit to serving something bigger than yourself.'' Like General Dunford, I am a graduate of St. Michaels, and Marcelle has an honorary degree from St. Michaels. Also like General Dunford, I did my graduate work at Georgetown.  I mention his background because he is not a man that would ever brag about all the things he has done. Rather, he speaks to the values that he believes America should follow. I listened to him, standing in his uniform, speaking to these young men and women who were graduating. You could hear a pin drop in the hall, except for the times when they would interrupt his speech with standing ovations.  He has led by service his entire career. He thought always of the men and women under his command. He thought of their families. He thought of our future and the world we would leave to our grandchildren. His legacy will be measured by his presence on the battlefield, but perhaps more so by the capable leadership he has brought that will be felt for generations to come. That is truly the mark of an exceptional and visionary leader.  General Dunford and his wife Ellyn are looking forward to their retirement, but I do hope that academic and public institutions will call on him for his expertise and his knowledge, but especially his conscience.  I ask unanimous consent that an article from the Washington Post, entitled ``Joseph Dunford's steady hand in the turmoil of Trump's Washington,'' by David Ignatius be printed in the Record, as it so eloquently captures the general's legacy and service to our Nation.  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in the Record, as follows:               [From the Washington Post, Sept. 12, 2019]   Joseph Dunford's Steady Hand in the Turmoil of Trump's Washington                          (By David Ignatius)       Gen. Joseph F. Dunford Jr., the chairman of the Joint      Chiefs of Staff who will retire this month, is that rare      senior official in Donald Trump's Washington whose career and      reputation don't seem to have been tarnished by his dealings      with the president.       The explanation is simple: The low-key, Boston-Irish Marine      maintained the distance and discipline of a professional      military officer. He didn't try to be Trump's friend or      confidant, and he stayed away from palace intrigue. The White      House treated him with respect, and his fellow commanders      came to regard him with something approaching awe: ``We'd all      like to be Joe Dunford,'' says one four-star general.       In the ceaseless turmoil of the Trump administration,      Dunford has been a steady hand who helped insulate national      security policy from disruption and political pressure. His      Pentagon colleagues say he will be keenly missed--several      described him as the best chairman in recent decades--and      they are hoping Gen. Mark Milley, his successor, can sustain      the independence and cool judgment that defined Dunford's      tenure.       Dunford doesn't like talking about his relationship with      the White House. The closest he has come was probably a      Pentagon news briefing last month: ``I've worked very hard to      remain apolitical and not make political judgments. . . . I      work very hard to provide military advice . . . and make sure      that our     men and women in uniform have the wherewithal to do their      job.''       ``Joe Dunford is a man for all seasons,'' says Jim Mattis,      the former defense secretary and a fellow Marine. ``Joe has a      quiet mind, not easily distracted; he quantifies things, but      he brings in the nonquantifiable. Still waters run deep in      him. You simply can't shake his faith in his fundamental      values.''       Mattis cites two combat anecdotes to explain Dunford's      unflappable style. In March 2003, on the eve of the invasion      of Iraq, Mattis told Dunford that because of a last-minute      change of plans, his regiment had to move out in five hours,      rather than at dawn the next morning. ``He just took it in      stride,'' says Mattis.       A few days later, Dunford's unit had fought its way to the      Tigris River, with the loss of some Marines, and was ready to      seize a strategic bridge. Mattis told him he had to fall back      until conditions were safer for the assault. Dunford obeyed      that painful retreat order without hesitation, Mattis says.       Dunford was born for the job. The son of a Marine who      fought at Chosin Reservoir during the Korean War, he grew up      in Quincy, Mass., a working-class suburb of Boston.      Colleagues say he retained those grounded values throughout a      rapidly rising career.       Gen. Frank McKenzie, head of the Central Command and      another fellow Marine, remembers that Dunford faced a      delicate problem as a young lieutenant colonel on the staff      of the Marine commandant. He had to manage a popular but      misplaced protocol officer. He promptly removed the officer,      to the consternation of some politically powerful friends.       Dunford's dream was probably to become Marine commandant      himself, and after he was appointed to that position in 2014,      friends say he assumed it was his last military post. When      President Barack Obama nominated him chairman in 2015, ``he      took the job with a Catholic sense of guilt'' to do his duty,      says one friend.       On Dunford's desk as chairman, he placed the admonition of      a venerated predecessor, Gen. Omar Bradley, who cautioned his      staff that they didn't have the ``luxury'' of focusing on      just one theater but needed to think globally. Dunford has      prodded the different services and combatant commands to do      just that--move toward integrated global strategy, rather      than separate fiefdoms.       Dunford built a powerful joint staff to coordinate policy,      directed by strong officers such as McKenzie and Adm. Michael      Gilday, the new chief of naval operations. The joint staff's      importance grew as the interagency process of the National      Security Council decayed. Some grouse that the joint staff is      now too powerful, but it helped fill a dangerous vacuum.       In dealing with Trump, Dunford's friends say his model was      Gen. George C. Marshall, the celebrated wartime chief of      staff to President Franklin D. Roosevelt. Marshall didn't try      to be FDR's pal, or laugh at his jokes, or join his social      gatherings. Marshall simply did his job.       One four-star general recalls that Trump would sometimes      ask Dunford whether he liked a particular policy option.      ``I'm not in love with any of them,'' Dunford would answer.      ``My job is to give you choices.''       It's Dunford's legacy that in a time of national tumult and      division, the military seems to have remained steady as a      rock.
