Maybe the gentleman does not know, in which case he can say no.  My question is: Does the gentleman know whether a markup is scheduled for next week in the Ways and Means Committee on the repeal of the Affordable Care Act?  I yield to my friend.  Mr. McCARTHY. I thank the gentleman for yielding.  That is an action of the committees, and they will list as soon as they are prepared to do their markups.
