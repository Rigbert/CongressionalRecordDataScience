 President, let me read some headlines.  ``Senate Democrats block Zika agreement ahead of recess.''  ``Senate Dems block House Zika funding.''  That last article goes on to say: ``Senate Democrats . . . blocked a critical funding measure needed to combat the spreading Zika virus, a move that will now make it impossible for Congress to send legislation to President Obama before July 4.''  Our Democratic friends are working hard to spin this, but families don't want excuses, they want action. Yesterday, Senate Democrats listened to the demands of a partisan special interest group and turned their backs on women's health and fighting Zika. First, they demanded congressional action on Zika. Then, in the midst of mosquito season, Democrats chose partisan politics over $1.1 billion in critical funds to protect pregnant women and babies from Zika--after the Democrats voted for the same $1.1 billion funding level just last month.  Yesterday, Senate Democrats listened to the demands of a partisan special interest group and turned their backs on supporting our veterans. First, they demanded more funding for veterans. Then, just before the Fourth of July, Democrats chose partisan politics over significantly increasing resources for veterans' health care.  In the coming days, Democrats will hear from constituents back home who want to know what they are doing to keep them safe from the threat of Zika and what they are doing to support our veterans. Democrats will have to explain why they chose not to do their job and instead blocked funding for the Zika crisis and for our Nation's heroes.  I have moved to reconsider the legislation, and we will give everybody on the other side a chance to think about that during the Fourth of July. We will get back to that when we get back.                          ____________________
