. 4241 which designates the facility of the U.S. Postal Service located at 1818 Milton Avenue in Janesville, Wisconsin, as the Les Aspin Post Office Building.  I had the distinguished honor of serving with Mr. Aspin. As a fellow Wisconsinite, I admired his dedication to public service that was evident throughout his tenure; not only as a Member of the House of Representatives, but as Secretary of Defense and Chairman of the President's Intelligence Advisory Board, to name just a few.  Secretary Aspin did not begin his life's devotion to the public in the political arena. He served this country in the U.S. Army from 1966 to 1968. He then entered politics and went on to served in this body from 1971 to 1993. He served as the Chairman of the House Armed Services Committee from 1985 to 1993. He was then appointed by President Clinton as his first Secretary of Defense.  Secretary Aspin was known to share his knowledge and passion for America in many circles. He continued his outreach by serving as a distinguished professor for Marquette University in Milwaukee, WI, and in Washington, DC. The naming of the Marquette University Washington program, the Les Aspin Center for Government, recognized his service to this program.  Secretary Aspin brought his love for his work and his sense of humor into her personal life as well. As an avid dog lover, my fellow Wisconsinite named his dog ``Junket,'' and Junket was equally comfortable and welcome in the office and at home.  I believe that H.R. 4241 is a fitting tribute to a man who gave tirelessly to the people he represented in Wisconsin during his tenure as Congressman and the country during his tenure as Secretary of Defense. I am honored to speak in support of H.R. 4241 and believe that the recognition it would lend to Secretary Aspin, is well deserved.
