Speaker, throughout towns and cities across our nation there are individuals who are willing to step forward to dedicate their talents and energies to making life better for their friends and neighbors. The citizens of California are fortunate to have such an individual in Jerry A. King.  Jerry King's involvement with the California Regional Water Quality Control Board, Santa Ana Region, and community, began in 1983 when he was first appointed by Governor George Deukmejian. As a Regional Board member Jerry represented the community's concerns, set priorities for projects and plans of action, allocated funds, and made decisions essential to the future of water quality in southern California. His endless energy is displayed by his long list of business and community involvements including: President and owner of J.A. King & Associates, Chairman of the Citizens Advisory Committee for the Orange County Transportation Authority, board member of the Industrial League of Orange County, President of the Newport Beach Conference and Visitors Bureau and countless other local charitable and civic associations and organizations.  Jerry King has made, and continues to make, a lasting and positive impact in the southern California community. His involvement and leadership have established a path for those individuals following in his footsteps. I would like to take this opportunity to thank Jerry for his dedication, influence and involvement in our community. He has served as an outstanding representative of community leadership. It is a great pleasure for me to congratulate Jerry King for the outstanding job he has done as a member of the California Regional Water Quality Control Board.                          ____________________
