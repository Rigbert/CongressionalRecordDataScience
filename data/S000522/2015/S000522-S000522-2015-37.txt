Okay. It is disappointing then that the gentleman is not moved to compassion over the terrible inhumanity displayed on those videos by the Planned Parenthood personnel.  Madam Speaker, human dismemberment is a painful and absolutely frightening way for anyone to die, but in Planned Parenthood clinics across the country, such violence against children is commonplace.  Subsidized by half-a-billion dollars annually, Planned Parenthood kills a baby every 2 minutes, snuffing out the lives of over 57 million infants since 1973, a staggering loss of life, a staggering loss of children.  Madam Speaker, now, because of undercover videos by The Center for Medical Progress, we know Planned Parenthood is also trafficking in baby parts, turning babies into human guinea pigs while making the abortion industry even richer than before.  Although much of the media continues to ignore this scandal, Planned Parenthood's meticulously crafted facade of care and compassion has been shredded. Caught on tape, Planned Parenthood's top leadership, not interns or lower-level employees, show callous disregard for children's lives while gleefully calculating the financial gain.  This begs the question: Do Americans really know what horrors are done to children in Planned Parenthood clinics? Have congressional colleagues and has President Obama watched the videos yet?  In one clip, Dr. Deborah Nucatola, senior director of Planned Parenthood Federation of America's Medical Services and a late-term abortionist herself says on camera:       We have been very good at getting heart, lung, liver      because we know that, I am not going to crush that part. I am      going to basically crush below, I am going to crush above,      and I am going to see if I can get it all intact. . . . I      would say a lot of people want liver; and for that reason,      most providers will do this case under ultrasound guidance,      so they will know where they are putting their forceps.  In other words, crush the baby to death, but do it in a way that preserves organs and body parts for sale.  Planned Parenthood's medical directors council president, Dr. Mary Gatter, appears on the video nonchalantly talking about utilizing ``less crunchy'' abortion methods, again, to preserve body parts.  Regarding the price tag for baby body parts, she says, ``Let me just figure out what others are getting and, if this is in the ballpark, then, it is fine. If it is still low, we can bump it up,'' that is, the price. ``I want a Lamborghini,'' she says.  Planned Parenthood's national director for the Consortium of Abortion Providers, Deborah VanDerhei, says, ``We are just trying to figure out as an industry''--abortion is an industry--``how we are going to manage remuneration because the headlines would be a disaster''--concern for making money and avoiding bad press, no concern whatsoever for the child victim.  Holly O'Donnell, a tissue procurement technician for StemExpress, a biotech company that partners with Planned Parenthood, says some women undergoing abortions did not give consent for these baby body parts to be trafficked.  She says on the video, ``Pregnancy tests are potential pregnancies, therefore, potential specimens.'' They think of the pregnancy test as a way of getting more specimens, so it is just taking advantage of the opportunity.  O'Donnell also says how her supervisor told her to cut through the face of a baby in order to get brain tissue. ``She gave me the scissors and told me that I had to cut down the middle of the face. I can't even describe what that feels like,'' she says on tape.  H.R. 3134, made in order under this rule, authored by an extraordinarily caring and compassionate Member of Congress, Diane Black of Tennessee, places a yearlong moratorium on funding for Planned Parenthood and redirects withheld monies to other facilities that provide women's health.  Madam Speaker, the videos have also brought into sharp focus the fact that some babies actually survive abortions.  Dr. Savita Ginde, vice president and medical director of Planned Parenthood Rocky Mountains, confesses:       Sometimes we get--if someone delivers before we get to see      them for a procedure then they, the baby, are intact.  That means born alive. That means born alive.  ``The fetus just fell out,'' she says. It just fell out. It, the baby, fell out. What happens to that baby? Tragically, we know what happens. They are killed, and some of their organs are stolen.  The second bill made in order by the rule--the Born-Alive Abortion Survivors Protection Act, authored by pro-life champion Trent Franks--simply says any child who survives an abortion must be given the same care as any other premature baby born at the same gestational age. The new bill builds on the landmark Born-Alive Infants Protection Act of 2002, authored by Steve Chabot, by ending important enforcement prohibitions.  I would remind my colleagues that it was just 2 years ago that the infamous Philadelphia abortionist Kermit Gosnell was convicted of killing children, as well as women in his clinics, but children who were born alive after an attempted abortion.  The grand jury report describes his practice--and I read the entire report; you ought to read it--Gosnell had a simple solution for unwanted babies he delivered. He killed them. He didn't call it that. He called it ``ensuring fetal demise.'' He called it ``snipping.''  Support these two bills, I say to my colleagues.  Mr. Speaker, human dismemberment is a painful and absolutely frightening way for anyone to die but in Planned Parenthood clinics across the country, such violence against children is commonplace and usual.  Subsidized by half a billion taxpayer dollars annually, Planned Parenthood kills a baby every two minutes, snuffing out the lives of over seven million infants since 1973--a staggering loss of children.  Now, because of undercover videos by the Center for Medical Progress, we know Planned Parenthood is also trafficking in baby body parts--turning babies into human guinea pigs while making the abortion industry even richer than before.  Although much of the media continues to ignore this scandal, Planned Parenthood's meticulously crafted facade of care and compassion has been shredded. Caught on tape, Planned Parenthood's top leadership--not interns or lower level employees--show callous disregard for children's lives while gleefully calculating the financial gain.  Which begs the question: do Americans really know what horrors are done to children in Planned Parenthood clinics? Have congressional colleagues--has President Obama--watched the videos yet?  In one clip, Dr. Deborah Nucatola, Senior Director of Planned Parenthood Federation of America's Medical Services and a late term abortionist herself says on camera: ``We have been very good at getting heart, lung, liver, because we know that, I am not going to crush that part.

Concern for making money and avoiding bad press--no concern whatsoever for the child victim.  Holly O'Donnell, a tissue procurement technician for StemExpress, a biotech company that partners with Planned Parenthood says some women undergoing abortions did not give consent: ``. . .'' there were times when they would just take (the body parts) what they wanted. And these mothers didn't know. On the video, Ms. O'Donnell says: ``Pregnancy tests are potential pregnancies, therefore potential specimens. So it's just taking advantage of the opportunities.''

H.R. 3134 authored by an extraordinarily caring and compassionate Member of Congress Diane Black of Tennessee places a yearlong moratorium on funding to Planned Parenthood and redirects withheld monies to other facilities that provide women's health.  At the instruction of Speaker Boehner, several committees of congress have launched probes into this baby body parts trafficking scandal.  I suspect that if the President watches at least one of the videos, he'd at least demand real answers concerning Planned Parenthood's inhumane behavior. Or at least I hope he would.  Mr. Speaker, the videos have again brought into sharp focus the fact that some babies actually survive abortion.  Dr. Savita Ginde, Vice President and Medical Director of Planned Parenthood Rocky Mountains confesses that ``Sometimes, we get--if someone delivers before we get to see them for a procedure then they (the baby) are in intact . . .'' A fetal tissue broker describes watching a ``fetus . . . just fell out.''  It just fell out. It, the baby, fell out, she says. And then what happened to that baby?  Tragically, we know what happens to these victimized babies--they are killed and some have their organs stolen.  So the second bill made in order by the rule--The Born Alive Abortion Survivors Protection Act (H.R. 3504)--authored by pro-life champion Trent Franks, simply says any child who survives an abortion must be given the same care as any other premature baby born at the same gestational age. The new bill builds on the landmark Born Alive Infant Protection Act of 2002 authored by Steve Chabot by adding important enforcement provisions.  I would remind my colleagues that it was just two years ago the infamous Philadelphia abortionist Kermit Gosnell was convicted of murder for killing children who were born alive after an attempted abortion. The Grand Jury report described his practices, ``Gosnell had a simple solution for the unwanted babies he delivered: he killed them. He didn't call it that. He called it ``ensuring fetal demise.'' The way he ensured fetal demise was by sticking scissors into the back of the baby's neck and cutting the spinal cord. He called that ``snipping.''  Gosnell's grisly after-birth abortion practices were only exposed when he was investigated for illegal drug charges and, in the words of the Grand Jury ``the search team discovered fetal remains haphazardly stored throughout the clinic--in bags, milk jugs, orange juice cartons, and even in cat-food containers. Some fetal remains were in a refrigerator, others were frozen.''  Last week Gianna Jessen an abortion survivor, told the House Judiciary Committee:   ``My biological mother was seven and a half months pregnant when she went to Planned Parenthood, who advised her to have a late-term saline abortion.   ``This method of abortion burns the baby inside and out, blinding and suffocating the child, who is then born dead, usually within 24 hours.   ``Instead of dying, after 18 hours of being burned in my mother's womb, I was deliveredalive in an abortion clinic in Los Angeles on April the 6th, 1977. My medical records state: ``Born alive during saline abortion'' at 6 am.   ``Thankfully, the abortionist was not at work yet. Had he been there, he would have ended my life with strangulation, suffocation, or leaving me there to die. Instead, a nurse called an ambulance, and I was rushed to a hospital. Doctors did not expect me to live.   ``I did. I was later diagnosed with Cerebral Palsy, which was caused by a lack of oxygen to my brain while surviving the abortion. I was never supposed to hold my head up or walk. I do. And Cerebral Palsy is a great gift to me.  Gianna asked the committee,   ``If abortion is about women's rights, then what were mine? You continuously use the argument, `If the baby is disabled, we need to terminate the pregnancy,' as if you can determine the quality of someone's life. Is my life less valuable due to my Cerebral Palsy?   ``You have failed, in your arrogance and greed, to see one thing: it is often from the weakest among us that we learn wisdom--something sorely lacking in our nation today. And it is both our folly and our shame that blinds us to the beauty of adversity.''  Gianna Jesson's reminds us that we have a duty to protect the weakest and most vulnerable.                              {time}  1415  Mr. McGOVERN. Madam Speaker, let me just state three facts here: We know that these videos that have been mentioned have been selectively edited; we know for a fact that 90 percent of what Planned Parenthood does is preventive care, including screenings for cervical cancer, nothing to do with abortion; and we know for a fact, because it is the law, that no taxpayer dollars can be used to pay for abortion.  Having said that, I yield 1 minute to the gentlewoman from Oregon (Ms. Bonamici).
