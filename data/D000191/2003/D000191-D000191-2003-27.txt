 The CHAIRMAN pro tempore. Is there objection to the request of the gentleman from Oregon?  There was no objection.  Mr. DeFAZIO. Madam Chairman, the point here is that this says that a private entity will build this museum and then gift it to the Federal Government for operation. This is ultimately going to be an official museum of the United States Coast Guard, a Federal museum. This amendment does not interfere in the litigation for a taking. If this local development corporation indeed has the right under Connecticut law and the United States Constitution to take the land and throw these people off their property, they will have that right as determined by the courts. All this amendment says is that this Coast Guard museum, which is going to be a Coast Guard facility in the future after it is built and gifted to the Federal Government and the Coast Guard, will not be built on land that was condemned for that purpose, throwing families out of their homes. It is very simple. That is the issue before this Congress.
