Mack) submitted the following resolution; which was referred to the Committee on the Judiciary:                            S. Con. Res. 127       Whereas November 1998 marks the 50th anniversary of the      creation of the National Microbiological Institute (referred      to in this resolution as the ``Institute'') under authority      of section 202 of the Public Health Service Act;       Whereas the Institute was formed through the combination of      the Rocky Mountain Laboratory, the Biologics Control      Laboratory, the Division of Infectious Diseases and the      Division of Tropical Diseases of the National Institutes of      Health;       Whereas in 1955 Congress renamed the Institute as the      National Instituteof Allergy and Infectious Diseases      (referred to in this resolution as ``NIAID'') under the      authority of the Omnibus Medical Research Act, recognizing      the need for a coordinated scientific research program on      infectious, allergic and immunologic diseases;       Whereas the research portfolio of NIAID encompasses      infectious diseases such as acquired immunodeficiency      syndrome (AIDS), tuberculosis, sexually transmitted diseases,      malaria and influenza, immunologic diseases including asthma,      allergies and primary immune deficiency diseases,      transplantation immunology, and development of new diagnostic      therapies and vaccines forinfectious diseases;       Whereas research supported by NIAID continues to yield      promising advances including the development of vaccines      against the human immunodeficiency virus (HIV), and in the      identification of effective treatment regimens for childhood      asthma;       Whereas the continued threat of emerging and re-emerging      infectious diseases, like tuberculosis, poses a risk to the      health worldwide, NIAID-supported research provides the      necessary tools to develop diagnostic tests, new and improved      treatments, vaccines and other means to combat the microbial      threats of today and those of the future;       Whereas NIAID-supported research is making significant      progress in understanding the immune system and its disorders      including the mechanisms of immune tolerance, which refers to      the ability of the immune system to distinguish between cells      and tissues that are ``self'' and those that are foreign or      ``non-self,'' such as a pathogen, tumor, ortransplanted      organ;       Whereas such advances are vital to the field of organ      transplantation and may prove useful in treating autoimmune      diseases, such as rheumatoid arthritis and multiple      sclerosis;       Whereas Congress intends that NIAID continue its innovative      leadership in delineating pathogenesis, improving diagnosis      and treatment, and developing vaccines to prevent infectious      and immunologic diseases, thereby contributing to the overall      health of the American public and the people of the world:      Now, therefore, be it       Resolved by the Senate (the House of Representatives      concurring), that Congress--       (1) recognizes the historic significance of the 50th      anniversary of theestablishment of the National      Microbiological Institute and the creation ofthe Institute      that became the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious      Diseases;       (2) recognizes the research scientists, administrative      staff, professional societies, and patient groups for their      active participation in support of the research programs and      goals of the NIAID; and       (3) reaffirms its support of the National Institute of      Allergy and Infectious Diseases and its commitment to advance      knowledge and improve health.
