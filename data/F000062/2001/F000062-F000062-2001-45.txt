 President, I rise today to introduce the Security and Fair Enforcement in Arms Trafficking Act of 2001, cosponsored by Senators Leahy and Akaka.  Small arms and light weapons, such as assault rifles, machine guns, grenades, and portable launchers of antiaircraft missile systems, are the weapons of choice for terrorists and their friends, and I fully believe that U.S. leadership is needed to stem the global torrent of illicit arms. All too often these arms fall into the hands of terrorists, drug cartels, and violent rebellions. Curbing the proliferation of these weapons must be a vital component of our efforts to combat international terrorism.  The rise of the Taliban in Afghanistan, in fact, is due in no small part to the ready availability of these weapons in that war torn country, and Afghanistan clearly demonstrates how a country can become a threat to regional and global security if it is flooded with small arms and light weapons. The Taliban and the al Qaeda network were able to gather more than 10 million small arms and light weapons from a variety of sources over the past decade, including AK-47s, hand grenades, and Stinger missiles. Today the United States and its allies are faced with these very weapons as we move forward with Operation Enduring Freedom.  The global networks of terrorism are clearly linked to the networks of the illicit arms trade and to the states that harbor terrorists, and terrorists around the globe also utilize the intertwined global networks of the illegal arms trade and the drug trade to generate financial resources for their destructive and threatening activities.  As I have previously discussed on the floor, the global proliferation of small arms and light weapons is a staggering problem.  An estimated 500 million illicit small arms and light weapons are in circulation around the globe.  In the past decade, an estimated 4 million people have been killed in civil war and bloody fighting. Nine out of ten of these deaths are attributed to small arms and light weapons.  The sheer volume of available weaponry has been a major factor in the devastation witnessed in recent conflicts in Angola, Cambodia, Liberia, Mozambique, Rwanda, Sierra Leone, Somalia, Sri Lanka, and Kosovo, among others, as well as the violence endemic to narco-trafficking.  The increased access by terrorists, guerrilla groups, criminals, and others to small arms and light weapons poses a real threat to U.S. forces overseas. For the United States, as we now engage in the war on terrorism, this issue is a very real force protection issue.  The conflicts fueled by small arms and light weapons undermine regional stability and endanger the spread of democracy and free markets around the world.  Clearly this is a huge problem, with profound implications for U.S. security interests.  I strongly believe that the U.S. Government must take the lead in the international community in addressing this issue. It is in the United States national interest to promote responsibility and restraint in the transfer of small arms and light weapons; to combat irresponsible practices in such transfers, to ensure that nations engaged in substandard practices are held accountable; to encourage other members of the international community to meet, as minimum standards U.S. law and practices; take strong action to negotiate and support making the trafficking of small arms traceable; bolster rules governing arms brokers; and eliminate the secrecy that permits millions of these weapons to circulate illicitly around the globe, fueling crime and war.  As a matter of fact, as a major supplier country in the legal arms trade, the United States has a special obligation to promote responsible practices in the transfer of these weapons.  That is what the Security and Fair Enforcement in Arms Trafficking Act of 2001 aims to do. It: Affirms U.S. policy to maintain the highest standards for the management and transfer of small arms and light weapons exports, and that it is U.S. policy to refrain from exports that could be used in internal repression, human rights abuses and international aggression; enforces the ban in international commercial transfers of military-style assault weapons and, improves end-use monitoring of U.S. arms transfers; urges the administration to enter into negotiations with the European Union and NATO member states, as well as other members of the international community to bring our allies into compliance with U.S. law and standards for the export and transfer of military-style assault weapons as well as on such critical issues as marking and tracing of small arms and light weapons, rules governing the conduct of arms brokers, and the enforcement of arms embargoes; calls on the administration to establish a U.S.-EU Coordinating Group on Small Arms, and to work to and implement and advance the Program of Action of the United Nations Conference on the Illicit Trade in Small Arms and Light Weapons in All its Aspects; improves the transparency of U.S. transfers in small arms and light weapons, and requires the establishment of a registry of all U.S. firearm exports; and, encourages all states that have not done so to ratify the OAS convention on small arms and light weapons.  And let me be clear: This legislation does not interfere with legitimate and responsible transfers of small arms or the lawful ownership and use of guns in the United States.  The United States needs to push hard to improve the international standards and the application of legally binding agreements to stem the illicit trade in these weapons. Fighting the proliferation of small arms is critical to our efforts to combat terrorism, narco-trafficking, international organized crime, regional and local war.  I believe that combating the proliferation of small arms and light weapons is a critical element of the fight against terrorism, and I look forward to working with my colleagues in the Senate and with the administration to pass the Security and Fair Enforcement in Arms Trafficking Act of 2001.                                 ______                                       By
