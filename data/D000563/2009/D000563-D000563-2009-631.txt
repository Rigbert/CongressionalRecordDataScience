President, I would like to ask the Senator about her amendment. The first thing I would like to ask is, her amendment does not specify how many czars--I think that is the term she used on the floor--how many czars she thinks there are in the administration or what their titles are. Could the Senator from Maine tell me how many czars we are going to try to impact with her amendment?
