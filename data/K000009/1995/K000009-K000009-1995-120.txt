Speaker, this week America celebrates the 30th anniversary of Medicare. Thirty years ago, Medicare brought to our senior population, for the first time, health security they never enjoyed before. They knew that whatever their circumstances, medical care would be available if they suffered from sickness or accident.  All that is threatened now. The majority party's budget does wage war on Medicare. It cuts $270 billion from Medicare to finance tax breaks for the privileged few. Seniors will lose their choice of physician unless they can afford to pay more. Everybody in this place can, because they earn $130,000 a year. Their budget will provide seniors cut-rate, substandard medical care unless they can afford to pay more. Their proposed cuts will deprive seniors of the security Medicare now provides, unless they can afford to pay more.  To curb costs, why not rein in rising insurance company premiums costs, along with hospital costs and prescription drug costs? Why pick on our grandparents first? Let us not let America backpedal into the 21st century.                          ____________________
