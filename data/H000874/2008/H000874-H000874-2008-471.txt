Wilkes of Clinton, Maryland, for his outstanding service to the United States Congress, the Members who serve here, and the entire Capitol Hill community over the last two decades.  I also want to thank and acknowledge his family--his beautiful wife of 30 years, Paulette, and his sons, Trevor and his wife Delania, and Frank W. Wilkes III.  After 20 years of service with the Capitol Police, Officer Wilkes retired recently and will move into a new phase in his life.  For most of his last years of service, Officer Wilkes served as the officer on duty at the Senate Day Care Center, a position replete with responsibility and challenge. However, what his resume does not capture is the fact that the children there adore their friend, ``Officer Frank.''  In turn, Frank has been a wonderful presence at the day care center, watching and ensuring that the children go about their day safely and securely. It's my understanding that he plans to come back and read to them on a monthly basis as part of his ``retirement'' plans.  Let me say, too, that I have heard from more than one resident in the neighborhood that Officer Wilkes will be sorely missed; that he was quite popular with the surrounding residents who trusted his judgment, respected his extraordinary common sense, and enjoyed his presence.  During his 20 years with the Capitol Police, Officer Wilkes served a key role in protecting Members of Congress, the President, Vice President, and visiting dignitaries.  In fact, Frank was awarded a Certificate of Commendation for apprehending and subduing a suspect who was attempting to physically assault then-Vice President Dan Quayle.  Prior to joining the Capitol Police force, Officer Wilkes served for 9 years in the United States Air Force. Among other things, he was an administrative executive support manager, and served as liaison between the Office of the Secretary of the Air Force, the White House, the State Department, and the CIA to ensure the proper exchange of critical, time-urgent information.  Madam Speaker, those of us who enjoy the protection of the Capitol Police force--Members of Congress, government officials, and the general public who visit the Capitol complex--take their presence and their professionalism for granted far too often.  The truth is, we owe our Capitol Police officers--people like Frank Wilkes--a real debt of gratitude for doing such an important, oftentimes complicated job with great dedication and commitment.  Thus, today, I again want to thank Frank for his two decades of service to the Capitol Police and our Nation, and to wish him all the best in his future endeavors.                          ____________________
