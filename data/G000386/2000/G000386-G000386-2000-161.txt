 President, I am glad to join my colleagues in support of restoring funds to cuts made in the Senate Labor, Health and Human Services appropriations bill to the Social Services Block Grant program. This block grant program serves millions of older Americans, children and people with disabilities across the nation. The funding helps states provide services that no one else will provide. The money keeps people independent. It keeps them out of nursing homes. It keeps them employed. These are not frivolous services. They are critical to the well-being of thousands of people.  In my state of Iowa, more than 100,000 Iowans receive services under this block grant Polk County, including the city of Des Moines, gets this funding to transport developmentally disabled residents to doctor visits, physical therapy, employment, and day treatment. The county provides 56,000 of these trips each year. Under a funding cut, these rides could stop. Polk County's developmentally disabled residents would be on their own for transportation.  Polk County also funds residential treatment for developmentally disabled and mentally ill residents. The treatment costs $75 a day. That helps people avoid nursing home stays. It makes sense, because no one wants to go to a nursing home, and the expense is large. Under a funding cut, the county could eliminate residential treatment for 34 residents.  Clay County is already having trouble providing placements for clients with mental health problems and developmental disabilities. The county has a waiting list for placements. Providers' fees have been frozen for over three years.  I hope to spare any Iowans from more worry about this funding. It's a relief to hear assurances of complete funding of social services.
