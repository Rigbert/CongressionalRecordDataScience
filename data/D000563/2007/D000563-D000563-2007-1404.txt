President, I rise today to honor Charles H. Ramsey, who retired as chief of the Metropolitan Police Department at the end of December.  A Chicago, IL, native, Chief Ramsey began his career in law enforcement with the Chicago Police Department in 1968. Over the course of nearly three decades, Ramsey proved himself a dedicated and capable member of the force. He was promoted to Deputy Superintendent of the Bureau of Staff Services in 1994. The position brought with it many new responsibilities and put him in charge of the Department's education and training programs, an area in which Charles Ramsey excelled.  During his tenure with the CPD, Chief Ramsey played an instrumental role in the creation and implementation of the Chicago Alternative Policing Strategy, the city's innovative model of community policing. CAPS was designed to help police officers better understand the communities they were patrolling, rendering them more effective in preventing crime.  Chief Ramsey comanaged the Chicago Alternative Policing Strategy program, which promoted the cooperation of police, community, and city services. The training program to support the CAPS operation model provided guidelines for working with city agencies, and encouraging residents to become involved in their neighborhoods and communities through local meetings with law enforcement officials.  Chief Ramsey brought many of the strategies he piloted in Chicago to Washington when he was appointed chief of the Metropolitan Police Department in April of 1998. Chief Ramsey has said that when he came to the MPDC he found ``outstanding people who were frustrated by antiquated technology, vehicles and equipment and perhaps most of all, an overall sense of organizational pride and purpose that needed to be restored.'' Chief Ramsey made it his goal, over the next 8\1/2\ years not only to update the Department's resources, but to restore the Department's sense of pride and to build public confidence in the police.  Under his leadership, the Metropolitan Police Department saw a shift in strategic vision, with a new emphasis on community policing and crime prevention. Chief Ramsey created a system of Regional Operations Commands, designed to reduce unnecessary bureaucracy and enhance accountability. In eight and a half years, the Department has achieved much success. The crime rate in the District of Columbia is close to 40 percent lower than when Chief Ramsey joined the force. Meanwhile, the department received acclaim for its handling of a number of major events, including the 1999 NATO 50th Anniversary summit and the 2000 protests against the International Monetary Fund and World Bank Group.  Throughout his career, Chief Ramsey has received numerous accolades and been presented with many honors. He received the Gary P. Hayes Award from the Police Executive Research Forum, the 2001 Robert Lamb Humanitarian Award from the National Organization of Black Law Enforcement Executives and the 2001 Civil Rights Award from the International Association of Chiefs of Police. But Chief Ramsey is sure to be remembered for an unlikely partnership that developed shortly after he arrived in Washington.  It began, when Chief Ramsey visited the United States Holocaust Museum at the invitation of the Anti-Defamation League. Following his visit, he considered the ways in which his Department could learn from the history of the Holocaust, in particular the vital role law enforcement must play in protecting civil liberties. Chief Ramsey enlisted the help of the Museum and the ADL in drafting a curricula and training program for his officers. In 1999, ``Law Enforcement and Society: Lessons from the Holocaust'' was introduced. Since its inception ``Law Enforcement and Society'' has been used by more than a dozen other departments and the Federal Bureau of Investigation. In 2001, the Anti-Defamation League recognized Chief Ramsey's efforts, presenting him with the Sigmund Livingston Award and Chief Ramsey was honored by the Holocaust Museum in 2005.  I congratulate Chief Charles Ramsey on his many accomplishments throughout his long and distinguished career. I thank him for his leadership in the Metropolitan Police Department and his commitment to public service. I wish him and his family the very best in the years to come.                          ____________________
