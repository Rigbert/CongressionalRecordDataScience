 President, I rise today to honor the men and women of the Commonwealth of Kentucky's Military Order of the Purple Heart, MOPH. Membership in the MOPH is reserved for combat-wounded veterans who have been awarded the Purple Heart for their service in the U.S. Armed Forces. The members of the Kentucky MOPH have made extraordinary contributions and sacrifices in defense of the United States. Their brave and valiant actions during combat have been vital to preserving the freedom and way of life that Americans continue to enjoy today. I applaud the members of the Kentucky MOPH not only for their service to the United States but also for their steadfast commitment to their fellow combat-wounded veterans and to all of our Nation's veterans and their families.  On June 1, 2013, the Kentucky MOPH will gather in Paducah, KY, for its annual convention. In anticipation of this gathering, I would like to draw attention to two noteworthy milestones the Kentucky MOPH celebrates this year. January 2, 2013, marked the 70th anniversary of the Louisville, KY, Bluegrass Chapter 146 of the MOPH, and the Department of Kentucky MOPH will celebrate its 25th anniversary on October 22, 2013. At this time, I ask my colleagues in the Senate to join me in extending gratitude and commendations to members of the Commonwealth of Kentucky's Military Order of the Purple Heart for their dedication and service to America's military and America's veterans. America has the greatest military in the world, and the MOPH serves as a vital support system to veterans that make this a reality.                          ____________________
