When the stock market cratered in the Great Depression, Franklin Roosevelt stepped up and said: We need an agency that will oversee and regulate Wall Street so that people who would care to invest in American companies can have confidence they are investing in a company and a process that follows a rule of law. There will be transparency and disclosure by these companies on a regular basis, by formula, as to what they are earning, what they are losing, and what their assets may be.  That has continued for almost 80 years. The Securities and Exchange Commission has created in the process a credible market in the United States of America for the sale of equities andsecurities. Now comes this bill from the House of Representatives, this so-called jobs bill, which wants to change that. They are suggesting when certain companies get started--startup companies--they be excused from requirements under the law from the Securities and Exchange Commission. The argument is that there is too much paperwork, too many regulations, and smaller startup companies can't get started because there are too many legal requirements.  Well, we first took a look at what they consider to be smaller companies getting started, and they define them as companies with $1 billion a year in annual revenue--$1 billion. Unfortunately, those who make over $1 billion in revenue in a year comprise only about 10 percent of American businesses. That means by definition they are characterizing 90 percent of American businesses and startups as small businesses that need a special break when it comes to regulation.  So over the years we got into a debate--whether it is the regulation of banks or the regulation of these startup companies or those that are going public, selling securities--over the years we got into a debate about whether the government has gone too far. Are there too many rules? I am open to that suggestion. I think we should be open to it. If there is a way to protect the public and investors and still create businesses in this country that generate jobs, I want to hear about them and I want to support them. But too often we go too far. When we go too far and are not careful, some terrible things occur.  The letter I have now entered into the Record from Mary Schapiro of the Securities and Exchange Commission addresses this bill. She said:       While I recognize that H.R. 3606 is the product of      bipartisan effort designed to facilitate capital formation      and include certain promising approaches, I believe that      there are provisions that should be added or modified to      improve investor protections that are worthy of the Senate's      consideration.  The administration has said they are open to the idea of changing some of these laws. What Mary Schapiro, the Chairman of the Securities and Exchange Commission, has suggested is that we put provisions in the bill in the Senate which will protect investors.  Yesterday I spoke about the testimony before the committee. I commend to my colleagues the statement of Professor John Coffee, Adolf A. Berle, professor of law from Colombia University Law School, at a hearing before the Senate Banking Committee on December 1, 2011.  Mr. President, I want my colleagues, many of whom have just seen a few press accounts of this bill, to consider carefully the statement made by Professor Coffee. He has analyzed this bill and raised some important questions about whether it goes too far.  I will be joining some of my colleagues in offering a substitute which improves the law for startup companies but also makes certain that we protect investors and makes certain as well that at the end of the day we don't end up with egg on our faces. How many times has Congress been called on, when the private sector runs amok, goes too far, and starts failing in every direction, to bail them out? We saw it most graphically with the bailout of the major banks not that many years ago. We have seen it in the past with the bailout of the savings and loan industry. We have seen it happen time and time again.  Who ends up holding the bag when government regulation is not adequate to make sure people don't go overboard? The American taxpayers. They end up holding the bag, not to mention innocent victims along the way.  I understand we have to change the law, but I am hoping we can change it in a constructive way. Opening the sale of stocks and securities to everyone who can pull up a chair and open a laptop is not in the best interests of investors across America. It is certainly not in the best interests of many Americans who would find themselves losing their life's savings and any investment funds they might have in the process. Making certain the people who sell these stocks are, in fact, registered and credible; making certain the statements they make can be backed with hard evidence as opposed to a promise; and making sure, as well, that we have, in the process of business undertaking, the safeguards in place so there will not be excessive--as I said yesterday--irrational exuberance that leads to the failure of any marketplace or securities--that, to me, is the best thing we can achieve.  I think these two items to which I have referred--both from Mary Schapiro, Chairman of the Securities and Exchange Commission, as well as Professor Coffee--establish the case for being careful. Let's not jump on this freight train and watch it as it plows into a barricade. Let's make certain that what we do is thoughtful, that it does engender economic growth but not at the expense of the integrity of America's financial markets or at the expense of innocent investors.
