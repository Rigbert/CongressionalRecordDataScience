R. 7, the charitable choice bill. I further ask unanimous consent that all after the enacting clause be stricken; that the Snowe amendment and the Grassley-Baucus amendment, which are at the desk, be agreed to en bloc; that the substitute amendment, which is the text of S. 476, the Senate-passed version of the charitable choice bill as amended by the Snowe and Grassley-Baucus amendments, be agreed to; that the bill, as amended, be read the third time and passed; that the motion to reconsider be laid upon the table; further, that the Senate insist upon its amendments and request a conference with the House; and lastly, that the Chair be authorized to appoint conferees with a ratio of 3 to 2, and that any statements relating to the bill be printed in the Record.
