President, I have a great appreciation for the fine work Senator Mikulski and Senator Bond have put into crafting this difficult bill. The VA, HUD and Independent Agencies Appropriations bill in particular deals with many tough issues and competing demands. One of the smaller agencies which I would like to bring attention to today is the Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA).  Just a few weeks ago FEMA invited Lamoille County in Vermont to become a part of Project Impact, FEMA's pre-disaster mitigation program. This is a program that is partnering with communities, and the private sector, to make communities more resistant to natural disaster.  The importance of this kind of pre-disaster planning was driven home this past weekend as Lamoille, along with Addison, Chittenden, Franklin, Orange, Rutland, Washington, and Windsor Counties in Vermont were again devastated by severe storms and flooding. On June 30th, the President declared these areas in Vermont a major disaster. I toured the area with FEMA officials last week and, thanks to the hard work and spirit of the people of Vermont, the local public safety forces and FEMA, those communities are beginning to recover. Project Impact could help counties like Lamoille take steps to reduce the costs and public health risks of these kinds of disasters in the future.  FEMA Director, James Lee Witt is a friend to just about every member of the Senate. He and his staff, both here and in the regional offices, have been there for our states through all manner of natural disasters. To maintain FEMA's capability to respond so quickly to the needs of our states, I believe Congress should support the levels of funding for FEMA recommended in the President's budget. Again, I congratulate Senator Bond and Senator Mikulski for their fine work and know they share my support for FEMA and the work it does.                     environmental self-evaluations
