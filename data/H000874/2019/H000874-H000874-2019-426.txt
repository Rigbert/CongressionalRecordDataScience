Speaker, I ask unanimous consent to vacate proceedings by which the joint resolution (H.J. Res. 28) making further continuing appropriations for fiscal year 2019, and for other purposes, was passed, and the motion to reconsider laid upon the table, to the end that the Chair put the question on passage of H.J. Res. 28 de novo; and, further, that if a recorded vote or the yeas and nays are ordered--in other words, requested--on the question of passage of H.J. Res. 28, further proceedings may be postponed through the legislative day of January 23, 2019, as though under clause 8 of rule XX.  Again, Mr. Speaker, that will have the effect of allowing a revote on the resolution so that my Republican colleagues can reflect their view on whether that measure ought to pass or whether it ought to fail.
