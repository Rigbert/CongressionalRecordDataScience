 Chairman, I move to strike the requisite number of words.  The point here is that as commodity prices decline, and that is true for dairy, it is true for many other commodities, family farmers are looking for alternative sources of revenue. One of the sources of alternative revenue that they are looking at is agritourism. What we are looking at here is a $2 million program that would help family farmers all across this country.                              {time}  1715  The key issue here, which is an interesting concept, is that, as the gentlewoman from Ohio (Ms. Kaptur) just said, people from cities all over the country go to rural areas in order to enjoy the peace and beauty that exists in rural areas.  One of the reasons that the rural landscape is beautiful is because our family farmers keep that land open. It seems to me what we have to try to do is make sure that family farmers get a fair shake, get a fair return in terms of the agritourism money that is spent in their States; that it is not just the ski areas, that it is not just the fancy hotels, but that some of that money goes out into the rural countryside and helps the family farmers who need it the most.  Let me just give a few examples of what farmers in Vermont and throughout this country are doing, and why we need additional help for family farmers to get involved in what is a growing national concept.  Family farmers throughout this country are converting their guestrooms into small bed and breakfast operations. That means that on the weekend and maybe a few days a week they have a room available for a tourist to stay in.  But in order to do that, in many instances, they might need a loan to convert the guest room into a bed and breakfast. They might need some help in learning how they can market what they are developing. It is not so easy for farmers suddenly to get on the Internet and to know how to bring guests into their home.  Farmers are now encouraging tour buses to stop by and learn what family agriculture is about. But in order to be successful, they might need a loan or a small grant to build a restroom. If you are going to have a busload of people coming by, you might need a restroom there, improved parking facilities.  Farmers might want to build snowmobile trails through their fields and woods so people can come and use the snowmobiles. It might cost a little money in order to maintain those trails and in order to advertise what they have available.  In some instances, people who own apple orchards might want to do some value-added work. I know of an instance where somebody, instead of just doing apple picking in the fall, what they are doing is baking apple pies, selling them to tourists. They might need a few bucks to build or buy a new oven, a commercial-sized oven, and to deal with the health regulations in order to do it.  The list goes on and on and on. And the gentleman from Iowa made a good point about we give out these microloans all over the world, and they are good loans, they are successful, but a few thousand, a few hundred dollars to a family farmer could literally make the difference, if that money is converted into $5,000 in additional revenue stream. It is the difference between whether that farm stays up or goes under.  I happen to think that we are going to see is that agritourism is going to be spreading all over. It is good for the urban folks who want to get out and have the kids see what farming is about.
