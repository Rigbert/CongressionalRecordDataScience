 President, I want to first commend the distinguished chairman of the Budget Committee for his leadership in putting this budget together. But in addition to saying those few words, I want to say to the American people that a lot of times an individual wonders whether one person can make a difference. As far as this budget debate is concerned, the person of Senator Domenici and his leadership as chairman, and the responsibility that goes with that, demonstrates clearly what we all know in America. If an individual puts their mind to it, that one person can make a difference.  So I thank the distinguished chairman.
