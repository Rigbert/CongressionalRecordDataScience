President, I rise today in support of H. Con. Res. 378, which passed the Senate by unanimous consent on July 12, 2002. This resolution commends the District of Columbia National Guard, the National Guard Bureau, and the entire Department of Defense for the assistance provided to the United States Capitol Police and the entire congressional community in response to the terrorist and anthrax attacks of September and October 2001.  I would like to thank all of those who worked tirelessly for almost five months in response to the heightened state of emergency in the Capitol complex following the terrorist and anthrax attacks of September and October 2001.  We owe so much to the over 140 members of the District of Columbia Army National Guard, specifically the 260th Military Police Command, the 260th Regional Training Institute, the 74th Troop Command, the Headquarters District Area Regional Command, and the 33rd Civil Support Team, who answered the call to duty to assist the Capitol Police in protecting the Capitol complex. We here in the Capitol saw firsthand the cooperation between the National Guard and the Capitol Police. This time presented a challenging assignment for all involved, and the combined efforts of these two agencies served as a model for managing such a difficult situation.  Because of these men and women, we were protected around the clock and the activities in the Capitol were secure. Members of Congress, congressional employees, and visitors were confident of their safety here, and we were able to continue to serve the American people.  The dedication of the District of Columbia National Guard came at a price. These men and women worked an extreme number of hours under difficult conditions. The time they spent in order to serve their country was time away from their loved ones, and we are grateful for the personal sacrifices they made for our nation.  During the course of the Civil War, Abraham Lincoln came to Washington as the new president. The States began to divide into the Confederacy and the Union. When he arrived, this Capitol dome which you see outside was under construction. Many people went to the President and said: Mr. President, we can't afford to wage a war and build this Capitol dome. He said: ``Yes, we can, because that Capitol dome represents the unity of this country and what we will be after this war.'' During the Civil War, he continued the construction of that great dome we see today. And Lincoln was right.  The National Guard protected not only the people within the Capitol complex, but the complex itself and the unity, liberty, and freedom it represents. I am honored to support this resolution commending the work of the District of Columbia National Guard, the National Guard Bureau, and the entire Department of Defense, and I extend my personal gratitude for their service.                          ____________________
