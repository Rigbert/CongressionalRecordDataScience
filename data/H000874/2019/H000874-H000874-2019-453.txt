SCALISE. Oh, it lasted very shortly because the gentleman from New York realized he was on the wrong side of the issue, just like right now your side is on the wrong side of this issue opposing border security.  Let's be very clear what the fight is about, and it shouldn't be a fight. It is a fight because the President has said: Here is a proposal that my Department of Homeland Security has brought that said these are the tools they need to keep the country safe with a crisis at the border.  It can't be denied. I know some on your side want to deny it. I don't think the gentleman from Maryland denies it. But, clearly, when the Senate minority leader and the Speaker of the House go on national TV and say it is a fabricated crisis at the border, the American people see what is happening at the border. We can debate how best to solve it.  The President, through the Department of Homeland Security, has put down a proposal of what it is going to take. This is not a new idea.  Obviously, the President ran on this as a front-and-center issue. He not only ran on it, but he was elected by the American people as President to carry out border security and build a wall. It was part of the national debate.  I know some people on your side don't even want to recognize that that election occurred and the result, but it happened.
