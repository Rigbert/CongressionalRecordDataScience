 But I have heard different rhetoric from the other side. And Michigan is here, if I can find Michigan. We ought to put things in alphabetical order, but it does not matter. It does not matter. You are going to have tens of thousands of people or hundreds of thousands of people paying additional tax if we do not take action.  Now, that is just one provision.  We reduce the capital gains from 20 percent down to 15 percent, and we have been told that is already figured into the stock market. Do we want to let the middle-income taxpayers pay a higher capital gains tax? I do not think so, because there are so many middle-income people now who are investing through their IRAs, through their 401(k)s, that we do not want them to be hit by this.  We have the tax deductibility of college tuition. We have the small savers credit. We have the small business expensing provisions that are going to sunset at the end of the year.  All of these provisions have been bipartisan. Millions of American taxpayers rely on these provisions. Do my friends want to take away the deductibility of college tuition for middle-income Americans that is capped at $60,000? These people who are sending their kids to college ought to have, beyond December 31 of this year, the ability of taking advantage of that deduction.  We have the small savers credit. Do my friends want to take away the expensing of equipment for small business? I don't think so. But they would lead you to believe that we want to cut taxes for the rich. The plan addresses expiring business and individual provisions that we call extenders. These provisions include the research and development tax credit, State sales tax deductibility, and the deductibility of teachers' out-of-pocket expenses. Do the people who say we are going to give tax cuts to the wealthy consider our teachers, who pay out-of-pocket expenses for the classroom, that theyought to not have the tax deductibility for that? That is going to end December 31.
