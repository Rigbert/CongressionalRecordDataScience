 President, there will be a point of order made. If a point of order is made, I am obviously going to waive it. I make clear my motion to strike would essentially allow us to replace the revenues taken from the Finance Committee's jurisdiction with general funds that are still available in the off-budget surplus. All Finance Committee members, Republicans and Democrats alike, including my respected chairman of the Senate Budget Committee, a senior member of the Senate Finance Committee, should beware, a vote against my motion is a vote for weakening the Finance Committee's jurisdiction. If your membership on the Finance Committee means anything, you need to vote in favor of my motion to strike.
