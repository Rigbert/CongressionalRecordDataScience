President, let's be realistic.  First, I yield to nobody in this body in my support of good strict law enforcement. I would like to see this bill wrapped up and voted up or voted down. There are different suggestions I made to the distinguished Senator from Utah that might do that. But what I would suggest is that we be serious on this. Unfortunately, on something that should be a nonpartisan issue--juvenile crime--there are some things that have delayed us unnecessarily.  Wednesday, Senate Republicans voted against a Democratic package, and then today voted for the exact same thing when it was introduced on the other side.  For example, the Leahy amendment, which proposed stiffer penalties for the transfers to or possession of handguns and assault weapons, or high-capacity ammunition clips to juveniles, was voted down by the Republicans yesterday, and voted up by the Republicans today.  Moreover, the Leahy amendment also proposed the ban of juvenile possession of handguns, assault weapons and high-capacity ammunition clips, which was again voted down by the Republicans yesterday, and voted up by the Republicans today.
