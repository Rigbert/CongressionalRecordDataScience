Chairman, this amendment calls on the Department of Energy to review and update the data use for a 9-year-old Federal study on oil recycling. It is a good amendment. It promotes recycling of used lubricating oil to save energy, minimize disposal into landfills, and improves public information concerning sustainable reuse options.  It is a good amendment. I would like to see it adopted.
