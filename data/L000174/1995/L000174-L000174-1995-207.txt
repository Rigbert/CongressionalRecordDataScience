President, last Thursday, the Senate passed the fiscal year 1996 foreign operations bill. The vote was 91 to 9. That is the largest number of Senators to vote for a foreign aid appropriations bill that I can recall. I want to congratulate Senator McConnell for his efforts in getting the bill done, and for the overwhelming bipartisan vote. I think it shows that despite assertions to the contrary, the Senate and the American people do support foreign aid.  I also want to thank a number of other people who contributed greatly to putting this bill together, and getting it passed.  In the Congress, the majority clerk of the Foreign Operations Subcommittee, Jim Bond, was indispensable. Jim has been around here a long time, and has gained the unqualified respect of both sides of the aisle. Senator Hatfield could not have a more competent and dedicated adviser to the subcommittee. Jim was very ably assisted by Juanita Rilling, who has also gained an expertise in the foreign assistance programs.  On Senator McConnell's personal staff, Robin Cleveland was instrumental in preparing the fiscal year 1996 bill, and in finding common ground with my staff in developing a product that Senator McConnell and I could support and defend. Robin did a superb job in her first year as the subcommittee chairman's principal adviser on a wide range of foreign aid issues. Robin also had the very able and tireless assistance of Billy Piper.  On my side, Tim Rieser, who was a member of the subcommittee staff during my 6 years as chairman, gave me fine assistance throughout. Dick D'Amato, a member of the committee staff, expertly handled several important and difficult issues, including the compromise that was reached on the language concerning Korea and several amendments on the former Yugoslavia. I want to thank him and Senator Byrd for his contribution.  Janice O'Connell and Diana Olbaum of the Foreign Relations Committee staff helped resolve several difficult issues. Pam Norick on Senator Murray's staff and Robin Lieberman on Senator Feingold's staff were very helpful in preparing for the contentious debate on international family planning.  There are many people in the administration who deserve mention. While I cannot name them all, I do want to recognize Wendy Sherman, the Assistant Secretary for Legislative Affairs at the State Department. Wendy has been a tireless advocate for the Secretary, and for the American people. Her deputy, Will Davis, was an indispensable link between me and my staff, and the State Department. Will's good natured manner and willingness to search for the answer to any question we had was greatly appreciated.  At the Agency for International Development, Jill Buckley, Assistant Administrator for Legislative and Public Affairs, with the assistance of Bob Boyer and Marianne O'Sullivan, and so many other people, made it possible for us to manage with a very difficult budget situation. I also want to single out Bob Lester, whose extraordinary knowledge of the Foreign Assistance Act prevented us from making any egregious drafting errors. Without Bob, I hate to think what kind of laws we would pass.  At the Treasury Department, Robert Baker and Victor Rojas did their best to convince a skeptical Congress of the importance of maintaining U.S. leadership in the international financial institutions.  At the Defense Security Assistance Agency, Michael Friend and Vanessa Murray were always ready to help.  Mr. President, I am sure that I have left out people I should not have. For that I apologize. let me simply conclude by saying that I have greatly appreciated the help of all these dedicated people in getting the foreign operations bill through the Senate. I often wish that critics of the Federal Government would come to Washington and see what people like those I have mentioned do every day. They would see that they are exceptionally intelligent, committed people who work extremely long hours at a fraction of the pay many of them could earn in the private sector. They deserve our respect, and our thanks.                          ____________________
