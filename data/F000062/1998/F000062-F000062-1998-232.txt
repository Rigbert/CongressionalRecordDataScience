 President, in 1988, Congress passed the Duty Free Sales Enterprises Act which, among other things, gave Customs the authority to audit duty free stores to ensure compliance with laws and regulations governing import activities. The Act also permitted off-airport sites, as long as they were in within 25 miles of the airport. What happens is: tourists visit the off-airport site, buy duty-free goods and those goods are shipped to meet them when they arrive home.  When the bill was passed, audits were conducted in person by Customs inspectors. The 25-mile limit was imposed so as not to unduly burden inspectors who would otherwise have to travel great distances between stores. However, audits are no longer conducted in person; rather they are done by computer. Inspectors no longer have to travel between stores.  This legislation adds new section to the law establishing the 25-mile limit to allow exceptions if Customs is reasonably assured the goods being sold are duty free items for people leaving through international airports. All of the other regulations controlling audits and inspections are still in effect; this simply allows stores outside of the 25-mile limit.  I urge my colleagues to support this bill.  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be printed in the Record.  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the Record, as follows:                                S. 1861       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of      the United States of America in Congress assembled,     SECTION 1. DUTY-FREE SALES ENTERPRISES.       Section 555(b)(2) of the Tariff Act of 1930 (19 U.S.C.      1555(b)(2)) is amended--       (1) by striking ``or'' at the end of subparagraph (A),       (2) by striking the period at the end of subparagraph (B)      and inserting ``; or'', and       (3) by adding at the end the following new subparagraph:       ``(C) the customs territory, if reasonable assurance can be      provided that the purchaser of the duty-free merchandise will      depart from an international airport located within the      customs territory.''.                                 ______                                       By Mr. DeWINE:  S. 1862. A bill to provide assistance for poison prevention and to stabilize the funding of regional poison control centers; to the Committee on Labor and Human Resources.        the poison control center enhancement and awareness act  Mr. DeWINE. Mr. President, I rise today to introduce the Poison Control Center Enhancement and Awareness Act of 1998.  Mr. President, America's poison control centers do important work--and they need our help. The number of centers has been declining over the last several years. Their funding has been unstable--and this has resulted in the closing of many of them.  Poison control centers manage poisonings over the telephone, direct those that cannot be managed at home to a local hospital for treatment, provide professional and public education and training, and collect data on poisoning exposures.  Each year, more than 2 million poisonings are reported to poison control centers throughout the United States. More than 90% of these poisonings happen in the home--and over fifty percent of poisoning victims are children younger than 6 years of age.  By providing expert telephone advice to distraught parents, poisoning victims, and health care professionals, poison control centers decrease the severity of illness and prevent deaths. Let me illustrate the value of poison control centers by telling you about two similar poisoning cases that had very different outcomes.  In the first case, a 3 year old child swallowed several tablets of aspirin. His mother called the poison control center and was told to give the child syrup of Ipecac (pronounced ip-ah-kak) to make the child vomit before taking him to the emergency room. The boy was examined in the emergency room and sent home.  In the second case, another toddler swallowed several aspirin while visiting her grandmother's house. Her family was unaware that aspirin can be very dangerous for children, and did not think to call the poison control center. Nine hours later, the child started to have a seizure. When she arrived at the hospital, she was severely ill and nearly died. She spent almost two weeks in the pediatric intensive care unit.  Mr. President, I can tell you that even after eight children, it's often hard to know exactly what to do in these emergencies. In this kind of situation, poison control centers can save lives.  They are life-saving--and they are truly cost-effective public health services. For every dollar spent on poison control center services, $7 in medical costs are saved. The average cost from a poisoning exposure call is $31.28, while the average cost if other parts of the health care system are used is $932.  In spite of their obvious value, poison control centers are seriously under-funded, and the funding situation threatens to get worse. These centers have so far been financed through unstable arrangements involving a variety of public and private sources.  In Ohio, poison control centers are funded primarily by hospitals, with some funds coming from the State. Ohio's poison control centers are working together to coordinate services and consolidate resources, while they continue to look for stable funding sources.  Currently, the Federal Government provides 5% of poison control center funding, but reaps most of the cost-savings benefits from poison control center services. It is only fair that the Federal Government pay for its share of the cost burden for poison control center services. This legislation provides Federal dollars to stabilize poison control center funding and improve poison control center services. I havetried to write this legislation so that existing private and state dollars can be leveraged, rather than displaced, by Federal funds.  Over the last two decades, the instability and lack of funding has resulted in a steady decline in the number of poison control centers in the United States. In 1978, there were over 600 poison control centers; now, there are 75. This trend has jeopardized the capacity of poison control centers to provide equitable services to all Americans. As a result, more people may die, more people may be injured and the costs for treating poisonings may increase.  For example, in 1991, Louisiana closed its poison center and referred all calls to Alabama. After its closing, Louisiana found that ``the cost attributable to unnecessary emergency department visits was more than three times the amount allocated to operate the poison control center each year.'' Louisiana also found that medically treated poisonings, those treated in emergency rooms or by physicians, increased 42%. It reopened its poison control center.  My office has consulted with a number of experts on how we can best improve poison control operations on a national scale, and my legislation contains a number of their suggestions.  Here's what the bill does.  It establishes a national toll-free number to ensure that all Americans have access to poison control center services. This number is then automatically routed to the center designated to cover the caller's region. This system will improve access to poison control center services for everyone. It will also simplify efforts to educate parents and the public about what to do in the event of a poisoning exposure and how to do it quickly.  It begins a nationwide media campaign to educate the public and health care providers about poison prevention, and advertise the new, nationwide toll-free number. I've seen the great work done by some non-profit groups, and how effective their public health campaigns have been. That's what I'd like to see here.  It establishes a grant program to stabilize the funding mechanism and prevent certified regional poison control centers from closing. This program will support activities to prevent and treat poisonings; develop standard education programs; develop standard patient management protocols for commonly encountered toxic exposures; improve and expand the poison control data collection system; and improve national toxin exposure surveillance.  Mr. President, I have always been a supporter of the prevention and treatment services provided by poison control centers. As a member of the Congressional Prevention Coalition, I hope to increase awareness of this very important issue. Federal support for poison control centers will help ensure that all Americans continue to have access to quality poison control center services.  It will reduce the inappropriate use of emergency medical services and other costly health care services.  And, most importantly, it will save lives.  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that this statement and the text of the bill be printed in the Record.  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the Record, as follows:                                S. 1862       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of      the United States of America in Congress assembled,     SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.       This Act may be cited as the ``Poison Control Center      Enhancement and Awareness Act''.     SEC. 2. FINDINGS.       Congress makes the following findings:       (1) Each year more than 2,000,000 poisonings are reported      to poison control centers throughout the United States. More      than 90 percent of these poisonings happen in the home. 53      percent of poisoning victims are children younger than 6      years of age.       (2) Poison centers are life-saving and cost-effective      public health services. For every dollar spent on poison      control centers, $7 in medical costs are saved. The average      cost of a poisoning exposure call is $31.28, while the      average cost if other parts of the medical system are      involved is $932. Over the last 2 decades, the instability      and lack of funding has resulted in a steady decline in the      number of poison control centers in the United States.      Currently, there are 75 such centers.       (3) Stabilizing the funding structure and increasing      accessibility to poison control centers will increase the      number of United States residents who have access to a      certified poison control center, and reduce the inappropriate      use of emergency medical services and other more costly      health care services.
