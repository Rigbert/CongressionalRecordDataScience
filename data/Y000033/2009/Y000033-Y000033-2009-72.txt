Madam Speaker, pursuant to the Republican Leadership standards on earmarks, I am submitting the following information regarding earmarks I received as part of the FY 2010 Department of Defense Appropriations Act.  Bill Number: H.R. 3326--Research, Development Test & Evaluation, Air Force.  Legal name and address of entity receiving earmark: Fairbanks North Star Borough, 809 Pioneer Road, Fairbanks, AK 99701.  Description of how the money will be spent and why the use of federal taxpayer funding is justified: Funding will be used to undertake necessary follow-up engineering studies of a synthetic liquid fuels facility at/or near Eielson Air Force Base. These studies will address the environmental, technical and economic feasibility of a facility benefits, technical and economic feasibility of a synthetic liquid fuels facility and the environmental benefits and economic and technical feasibility of the transportation and sequestration of carbon dioxide to enhance crude oil recovery in northern Alaska.  This project will supply the U.S. Air Force and other military branches a secure supply of synthetic fuels to operate fighters, bombers and other aircraft and military equipment. It will help the Air Force to achieve its stated goal of certifying its fleet of aircraft on a synthetic fuel blend and purchasing 50 percent of its fuels in the form of a synthetic fuel blend by 2016.  Description of matching funds: Funding will go to supplement funds from P.L. 110-329.  Appropriated Amount: $3,000,000.  Project Name: Synthetic Liquid Fuels.  Detailed Finance Plan: Of the $3 million, all will go to the Fairbanks North Star Borough to be expended to study the technical, economic and environmental feasibility of the transportation and sequestration of carbon dioxide to enhance crude oil recovery in northern Alaska produced by a synthetic fuel facility located in the vicinity of Fairbanks Alaska.  Bill Number: H.R. 3326--Research, Development Test & Evaluation, Defense Wide.  Legal name and address of entity receiving earmark: Kachemak Research Development, Inc., 59584 East End Road, Homer, AK 99603.  Description of how the money will be spent and why the use of federal taxpayer funding is justified: Kachemak Research Development, Inc. is a woman owned, HUBZone, 8(a) entity. AutoScan, an under vehicle inspection system developed by KRD, is a stationary system that captures the entire undercarriage image of vehicles, ranging in size from passenger vehicles to semi-trucks. Because of the unique capabilities of AutoScan, vehicles do not need to maintain a constant speed as they travel across the system. Funding will be used for product enhancement and beta testing of AutoScan generation 2 and 3 architecture. As part of the inspection protocol at every military base, CONUS and OCONUS, the undercarriage of every delivery vehicle must be inspected. Standard inspection protocols have been comprised of a mirror-mounted stick or search pits. AutoScan makes it possible for inspection personnel to maintain a safe stand-off distance. Additionally, it stores images for later comparison and analysis if needed. And it provides one, complete, clear image of any vehicle's under-side in real-time and capabilities that no similar system is able to provide.  Description of matching funds: KRD profit is reinvested back into the company to provide facilities that are needed to perform the work. KRD investment exceeds $750,000 to-date.  Appropriated Amount: $3,000,000.  Project Name: Under-Vehicle Inspection System.  Detailed Finance Plan: Of the $3M, roughly 25% will go to administrative support within OSD and the contracting agency. The remaining 75% of the funding, $2.25M, will cover labor: $1,290,000; materials (including equipment and fabrication) $238,000; benefits $262,000; OH $214,000; technical consulting $112,000; $31,000 travel; $95,000 installation and beta testing of generation 2 and 3 AutoScan before fielding.                          ____________________
