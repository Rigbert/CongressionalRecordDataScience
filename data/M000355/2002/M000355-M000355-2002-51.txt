 President, I am about to send to the desk an amendment. I understand from discussions with the other side, we will be allowed to vote on or in relation to this amendment sometime Tuesday morning, with the time prior to that equally divided. I say to my friend from Nevada, what was he thinking of, a couple of hours equally divided on Tuesday morning before the vote or in relation thereto?
