President, I rise today to honor the accomplishments of Sara DeCosta of Warwick, RI. As a member of the U.S. Women's Olympic Ice Hockey Team, Sara and her teammates made history this year by winning the first-ever gold medal awarded in women's ice hockey at the 1998 Olympic Winter Games in Nagano, Japan.  Sara's efforts were a great part of the drive to bring home the gold. Her world class talent and solid determination helped team USA rise above the best in Women's Ice Hockey. Sara and her teammates proved that years of discipline, hard work, and tough sacrifices can pay off. Their magnificent display of sportsmanship and pride lifted our hearts and hopes. Truly, Sara and the U.S. Women's Olympic Ice Hockey team exemplify the best America has to offer and their success serves as a gleaming reminder of what can be achieved through bold determination and persistence.  Mr. President, Sara's victory is not just about hard work and discipline. It proves that if you believe in your own abilities you can succeed, no matter what outdated gender stereotypes would dictate. Sara has served as an example to the state of Rhode Island and the country. Her dedication and enthusiasm will inspire others to look beyond the traditional path and to reach for the stars to bring home their own personal gold medals. I congratulate Sara, the other eight players who are alumnae or students in Rhode Island's schools and the rest of the Women's Hockey Team. We can be proud of this group of young women for their commitment to follow their dreams. Sara DeCosta and her teammates are an inspiration to us all.                          ____________________
