President, I rise today to introduce the EPA Regulatory Relief Act of 2011. I am pleased to be joined in this effort by my colleagues Senators Wyden, Alexander, Landrieu, Pryor, and Toomey. Our legislation is straight forward: it would allow the EPA the time it needs, by its own estimate, to adequately consider and propose a reasonable, workable rule that affects boilers.  Our bill includes four key provisions. First, it provides the EPA with the 15 months it requested to properly analyze the best methods for implementing the application of the Clean Air Act to certain boilers. Second, it will give businesses adequate time to comply with any requirements the EPA adopts by extending the compliance deadline from 3 years to 5 years. Third, our bill will direct the EPA, when developing the new rules, to ensure that renewable and carbon-neutral materials remain classified as fuel and not solid waste. Fourth, our legislation will help ensure that the rules are achievable by real-world standards consistent with the President's directive to improve Federal regulations.  At a time when manufacturers are struggling to retain jobs, it is essential that this rule not jeopardize thousands of jobs in manufacturing, particularly in the forest products industry, by imposing billions of dollars of new costs. Our legislation provides common sense solutions to the challenges the EPA is facing in attempting to draft and implement these complicated rules, which if written without proper data, analysis, and consideration, would cost the industry billions of dollars and potentially thousands of jobs.  To be sure, the EPA performs some vital functions in helping to ensure that the air we breathe is clean and the water we drink is safe. We need, however, to make sure that as the EPA issues new regulations, it does not create so many roadblocks to economic growth that it discourages private investment, which is the key to maintaining and creating jobs.  The EPA's proposed ``boiler MACT'' rules, which would affect tens of thousands of boilers, have been an issue of great concern to many of my constituents in Maine. The forest products industry, in particular, is the economic backbone of many rural areas in our country, including in Maine. Mill managers and workers in Maine have expressed their concern to me about the impact of imposing excessively costly regulations on their mills at this time of economic hardship.  Since these rules were first proposed in April 2010, I have been very troubled that the cost of implementation wouldbe far greater than EPA originally estimated. According to industry estimates, this rule could cost Maine businesses alone hundreds of millions of dollars and put many jobs at risk, when less expensive approaches could be used to address emissions from boilers. This is simply unacceptable in this economic climate.  Furthermore, these rules might force some of our mills in Maine to stop using biomass, a source of renewable energy, and instead dump the biomass in landfills and switch to fossil fuels. This makes no sense. As the President has stated, biomass is an important renewable energy source that our nation should promote in working to reduce our dependence on foreign oil. Converting to fossil fuels alone would also cost mills hundreds of millions of dollars.  My colleagues and I have been concerned about this issue since the EPA proposed these new boiler MACT rules in April 2010. Last year, 40 of my Senate colleagues, including 17 Democrats, wrote to the EPA expressing our deep concern that the boiler MACT regulations would impose onerous burdens on U.S. manufacturers. We asked the EPA to set emissions standards based on what real-world, best-performing units actually can achieve. This letter reflected the widespread bipartisan concern about the proposed boiler MACT rules.  It is important to remember that, under The Clean Air Act, a Maximum Achievability Control Technology rule, or ``MACT'' rule, is designed to reduce emissions to an achievable degree while also considering the economic impact on businesses. The MACT rule must also set its standard according to the best performing practices existing facilities. However, in the case of the boiler MACT rule, the EPA cherry-picked data without considering the real world operating practices of the facilities that will be affected by this rule.  In March 2011, I also asked Administrator Jackson at a hearing to explain why the EPA is not considering alternative standards for emissions since the MACT limits may be far more stringent than necessary to protect public health. Additionally, I have pressed officials at the Office of Management and Budget, such as Administrator of the Office of Regulatory Affairs, Cass Sunstein, about the very negative impacts EPA's Boiler MACT rules would have on the forest products industry.  In 2010, the EPA did request more time from the court to analyze and prepare the boiler MACT rules after it received thousands of comments that raised technical and cost concerns the agency had not originally considered. In response, the EPA appealed for an additional 15 months to implement the rule, noting that the public interest would be best served if it could obtain additional input from the public on these complex rules. Unfortunately, this plea was rejected by the D.C. District Court, and the agency was forced to re-propose the rule in a mere 30 days.  The stakes are too high for the EPA to be forced to rush a complex, multi-step process that could cost thousands of American jobs. Our bill will provide a balance that will help the EPA protect the environment and public health while ensuring that businesses in Maine and throughout the country are not faced with needlessly onerous burdens.  The EPA has claimed that the cost of the final rule has been lowered by 50 percent since the proposed rule last year; however, this is little comfort to manufacturers because the initial rule, according to industry estimates, was approximately $4 billion in capital costs to the forest industry and over $14 billion for all industrial sectors nationwide. The industry experts that I've talked with are very concerned that the standards are being set so high that they are going to have to make a massive new investment at a time when they can least afford it.  The EPA is making progress in reducing the costs and coming up with a more practical approach to the boiler MACT rules, and I believe we can achieve the health benefits that we desire without putting thousands of people out of work. This bill will help ensure that result.  I look forward to working with my colleagues on both sides of the aisle to ensure that the EPA has sufficient time to propose a well thought-out rule that minimizes the negative effect on the economy, while helping to protect public health and the environment.  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that a letter of support be printed in the Record.  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in the Record, as follows:                                                    July 20, 2011.     Hon. Susan Collins,     U.S. Senate, Washington, DC.     Hon. Ron Wyden,     U.S. Senate, Washington, DC.       Dear Senators: We are writing to express our united and      strong support for legislation you are introducing today and      for H.R. 2250, the ``EPA Regulatory Relief Act of 2011,''      bipartisan legislation to address the serious concerns that      remain with EPA's Boiler MACT rules. As they exist today, the      final Boiler MACT rules will have serious economic impacts on      a vast array of facilities across the industrial, commercial      and institutional sectors. These rules place at risk tens of      thousands of high-paying manufacturing jobs that our nation      cannot afford to lose.       As finalized, the Boiler MACT rules are unaffordable, just      as the proposed rules were. The rules are not achievable for      real-world boilers across the range of fuels and operating      conditions. EPA also has created a presumption that materials      commonly used as fuels are wastes subject to the extremely      costly and stigmatizing incinerator standards. This would not      only impose billions of dollars in unreasonable costs, but it      also would cause millions of tons of valuable materials to be      diverted to landfills and replaced with fossil fuel--a bad      result for the environment.       As EPA has acknowledged, the rules were finalized with      serious flaws because EPA was forced to meet a strict court-     ordered deadline. The final Boiler MACT rule alone would cost      over $14 billion in capital for the manufacturing sector,      plus billions more in annual operating costs. Complying with      the incinerator standards could cost several billion dollars      more in capital.       Legislation is needed to resolve serious uncertainties and      vulnerabilities, including to: ensure the rules are stayed      for an adequate and certain period, as EPA's current      administrative stay is being challenged in court; allow EPA      adequate time to re-propose the rules and get them right,      including time for stakeholders to conduct more emissions      testing and to avoid mistakes that occur when rulemakings of      this scope and importance are rushed and become vulnerable to      legal challenge; provide direction and support for EPA to use      the discretion it already has under the Clean Air Act and      Executive Order 13563 to add flexibility and make the rules      achievable; clarify that using non-hazardous materials as      fuels does not result in boilers being treated as      incinerators; and give facilities more time to comply with      the complex and capital-intensive requirements of the      rules.       If enacted, the ``EPA Regulatory Relief Act'' will provide      the much-needed certainty and time for EPA to get the rules      right and for businesses that will be investing billions of      dollars to rationally plan for the capital expenses. This      legislation will preserve jobs and the competitiveness of the      U.S. manufacturing sector while protecting the environment.       Thank you for your leadership on this issue of great      importance to our industries and our workers.
