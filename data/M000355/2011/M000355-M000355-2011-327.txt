 Hogan. On March 12 of this year, the former colonel had his promotion ceremony to the rank of brigadier general. This promotion to general is a very special accomplishment, as very few career officers in our Armed Forces ever reach the general rank.  This promotion is well deserved for all that Brigadier General Hogan has done for his country. Serving as the assistant adjutant general for the Kentucky Army National Guard, he is responsible to the adjutant general for balancing the requirements of readiness, modernization, force structure, and sustainment of the National Guard for mobilization and domestic missions.  Brigadier General Hogan's significant duty assignments include tours with the 101st Airborne Division (Air Assault), Fort Campbell, KY; the 6th Infantry Division Light, Fort Richardson, AK; the Army Operations Center, the Pentagon; and with the Multi-National Corps Iraq based in Baghdad, Iraq. When not serving on Federal active duty, he has served in the Kentucky Army National Guard as an active-duty guardsman with the State's Counter-Drug Unit, and $11 billion worth of illegal marijuana has been eradicated during his service.  Brigadier General Hogan's awards, medals and decorations include the Meritorious Service Medal, with three Bronze Oak Leaf Clusters; the Army Commendation Medal, with one Bronze Oak Leaf Cluster; the Army Reserve Components Achievement Medal, with one Silver Oak Leaf Cluster; the National Defense Service Medal; with one Bronze Service Star; the Iraq Campaign Medal; the Global War on Terrorism Service Medal; the Armed Forces Reserve Medal, with ``M'' Device and Silver Hourglass; the Army Service Ribbon, the Overseas Service Ribbon; the Master Parachutist Badge; the Pathfinder Badge; the Air Assault Badge; the Kentucky Merit Ribbon; the Kentucky Service Ribbon, with three Oak Leaf Clusters; and the Kentucky Counter Drug Ribbon.  Despite all this accomplishment, at his promotion ceremony, Brigadier General Hogan said, ``All I ever wanted to do in life is be a professional soldier.'' Well, we in Kentucky are certainly glad he got his wish. I want to congratulate him on his promotion, and I know my colleagues in the U.S. Senate will join me in honoring his service and his sacrifice for our country.  An article extolling the virtues of Brigadier General Stephen R. Hogan appeared recently in the Marion Star. I ask unanimous consent that the article be printed in the Record.  There being no objection, the article was ordered to be printed in the Record, as follows:                 [From the Marion Star, April 18, 2011]Conner High Grad Named Brig. General--Stephen Hogan served at Pentagon,                                in Baghdad                         (By Stephanie Salmons)       Frankfort.--Conner High School graduate Stephen Hogan, of      Frankfort, has been promoted to the rank of brigadier      general.       A 1981 Conner graduate, Hogan is the son of Paul and      Marilyn Hogan of Burlington. He is a 1985 graduate of      Morehead State University and a 2008 graduate of the U.S.      Army War College.       Hogan received his commission from the Morehead ROTC in      1985 and since 1993 has worked with the Kentucky Army      National Guard as an active-duty Guardsman with the state's      Counter-Drug Unit, where Paul Hogan says his son works for a      marijuana eradication program.       His assignments have included tours with the 101st Airborne      Division (Air Assault), Fort Campbell, KY.; 6th Infantry      Division Light, Fort Richardson, Alaska; The Army Operations      Center, Pentagon; and Multi-National Corps Iraq, Baghdad,      Iraq.       Hogan has also received numerous awards during his time in      the military.       The Hogans said they're proud of their son.       ``It's something you don't comprehend--when someone goes      that far,'' Paul Hogan said.       Stephen Hogan has always had an interest in the military      and has finally obtained his goal, Paul Hogan said.       ``We're very pleased and proud of him. He's worked very      hard,'' Marilyn Hogan said.                          ____________________
