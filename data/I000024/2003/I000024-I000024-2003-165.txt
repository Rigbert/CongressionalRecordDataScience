President, it is important that Congress make available all possible options for refiners to ensure compliance with the renewable fuels standard and decrease chances for gasoline price and supply volatility. One such option for meeting the renewable fuels standard that has shown promise is ethyl tertiary butyl ether ETBE.  ETBE is a High-octane, low-vapor pressure, gasoline-blending component produced from a combination of ethanol and butane. Because both of these raw materials are produced in abundance domestically, ETBE will help expand US gasoline supplies, moderating possible gasoline price volatility.  ETBE is fully fungible with gasoline. This allows ETBE to be blended into gasoline at any point in the gasoline logistical chain and transported in gasoline pipelines to regions of the country where it is more costly to transport and blend ethanol into gasoline. Moreover, ETBE does not have a negative impact on gasoline vapor pressure, making it easier and more cost-effective to blend ETBE into gasoline--especially during the summertime ozone control season when gasoline vapor pressure is restricted.  ETBE reduces more gasoline evaporative and tailpipe emissions, lowers air toxics and carbon monoxide, and provides 20-percent more carbon dioxide emission reduction than other gasoline-blending components.  ETBE is 75 percent less water soluble than MTBE. This means use of ETBE substantially reduces the risks to ground water resources should gasoline leak from an underground storage tank. ETBE also has other physical properties which make it migrate slower and shorter distances--and easier to remediate--should a gasoline spill or leak occur.  I support the development of ETBE because of the benefits it provides for cleaner air, enhanced gasoline supply, and the ability to transport the fuel in the current infrastructure. Congress, in enacting a RFS, should not do anything to preclude its use. The marketplace should be allowed to determine how it will meet the requirements of the RFS.                       Vote on Amendment No. 850
