President, today I, along with my colleagues Congressmen Chaffetz from Utah and Conyers from Michigan, am introducing the Geolocation Privacy and Surveillance Act, a bill that protects Americans from seeing their phones and other devices turned into location trackers without so much as a warrant or a warning. While law enforcement agencies can and have obtained, and should obtain, probable cause search warrants from a neutral judge authorizing them to track the location of Americans, in many other cases, government agencies obtain sensitive location information without a warrant. My colleagues, Mr. Chaffetz and Conyers, and I intend to fix that.  This is a situation where government agencies' use of new technology has gotten ahead of the laws in ways that would surprise many Americans. Federal, State, and local agencies routinely track Americans' locations through a variety of methods, most of the time without people knowing they are being tracked. Some tracking demands go directly from the government to phone companies. In the first 6 months of 2016, law enforcement agencies submitted at least 86,000 demands to telephone companies for subscriber location data. Some of these demands were for the records of hundreds or even thousands of customers at a time.  Law enforcement agencies also regularly track cell phones with the use of a surveillance technology known as a cell site simulator or Stingray. A recent bipartisan report by the Committee on Oversight and Government Reform in the House of Representatives found that the Departments of Justice and Homeland Security have spent more than $95 million to buy over 430 Stingrays. Although Federal agencies now obtain warrants before using this technology, many State and local agencies do not.  There is currently no uniform legal standard that regulates how Federal, State, and local law enforcement agencies are able to spy on the location of Americans. Instead, there exists a confusing patchwork of State laws, policies adopted by law enforcement agencies, and legal precedents set by Federal and State courts. As a result, Americans in one part of the country may enjoy less privacy, based on the policies adopted by their local police department, privacy laws passed by their State legislatures, or the willingness of their phone provider to push back in court, than Americans who happen to live in a privacy-superior jurisdiction. This patchwork quilt of rules and regulations has led to confusion among law enforcement, prosecutors, and service providers, who waste valuable time and resources litigating and appealing what should be clear-cut rules--clear-cut rules that start from the premise that privacy is an inviolable right, not a convenience granted by local law enforcement.  Under President Obama, there was a policy in place that required Federal law enforcement officers to get a probable cause warrant before tracking an American's location. Under the current administration, we do not yet know if this policy will remain, which makes this bill even more critical.  This bill has three main components.  First, it requires the government to show probable cause and get a warrant before acquiring the geolocational information of a U.S. person, while setting out clear exceptions such as emergency or national security situations or cases of theft or fraud. This probable cause requirement would apply to all law enforcement acquisitions of the geolocational information of individual Americans without their knowledge. This requirement will include indirect location information acquisition from commercial service providers and direct acquisitions using Stingrays and similar devices, including tracking devices covertly installed by the government. This bill would regulate both real-time tracking of a person's movements, as well as the acquisition of records of past movements.  Second, the bill creates criminal penalties for secretly using an electronic device to track a person's movements that parallel those for wiretapping. Currently, if a woman's ex-husband taps her phone, he is breaking the law. This legislation would treat hacking her cell phone to track her movements as a similar offense.  Finally, it prohibits commercial service providers from sharing customers' geolocation information with outside entities without customer consent.  Passage of this bill would provide much needed privacy protections to Americans and ensure that location data is adequately protected from warrantless surveillance by law enforcement agencies.  I thank my colleagues Chaffetz and Conyers for their efforts on this bill, and I hope the Judiciary Committee will consider our proposal quickly.                                 ______                                       By
