 President, I rise today to recognize the Asia Foundation, a private, nonprofit organization based in San Francisco, CA, which is celebrating its 50th anniversary in 2004.  The Asia Foundation is a national asset that has contributed in significant ways to the mutual interests of the people of Asia and the United States for a halfcentury.  Through its programs, the foundation has been instrumental at key moments in these five eventful decades. Early in its life, the foundation contributed to democracy, freedom, peace and constructive relations in post-World War II Asia. Since then, the foundation has invested in Asia's future leaders, built the capacity of democratic institutions, provided support to civil society groups, promoted the rights of women and created opportunities for economic growth and development.  Today, the foundation is contributing to new initiatives in the region, building new governance and opportunity in Afghanistan, for instance, through support to the Constitutional Loya Jirga, helping new democratic institutions in Indonesia and programs with moderate Muslim leaders, and continuing to support human rights and prospects for reform in Cambodia, Nepal, and throughout Asia.  Through its 17 field offices in Asia, the Asia Foundation has made its positive mark. The foundation identifies and supports reform-minded people at every level of society, from presidents and parliamentarians, to grassroots nongovernmental leaders. The foundation has supported educational institutions and libraries, legislatures and judiciaries, civil society and the media, all with the aim of improving the lives and helping to meet the aspirations of the people of Asia.  In every corner of Asia, the foundation's impact is felt through the fellowships it has provided to thousands of Asia's leaders since its founding, the new government and nongovernmental institutions it has supported and the new ideas it has fostered to meet the challenges facing Asia today. In so doing, the Asia Foundation represents America at its best: a private organization working in partnership with government, advancing mutual interests of the U.S. and Asia in supporting vibrant democracies, open economies, and peaceful relations.  As the United States addresses new challenges and opportunities in U.S.-Asian relations, we celebrate the Asia Foundation's history of achievement, and look forward to its continued contributions to the region in the future.                          ____________________
