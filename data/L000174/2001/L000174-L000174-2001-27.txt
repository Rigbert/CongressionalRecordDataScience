President, the Senator from Oklahoma, my friend, has talked to me about this on several occasions. We are trying to get through these calendars as quickly as we can. As I say, I have only been here as chairman for 5 months. Actually, there were a number of nominees prior to my becoming chairman who never got a hearing at the beginning of this year.  We will have had far more courts of appeals judges than I think have ever been, or I can remember going through in a President's first year in office. We are going way beyond what the Senate usually does. It is certainly a much faster pace than the Senate has had in the last 4, 5, 6 years.  If we can slow down a little bit the things that are happening around here--anthrax, September 11, all the things we wish we did not have--if the chairman of the committee could deal with just a few less death threats--not from my friend from Oklahoma. The anthrax letter did not have an Oklahoma return address, nor would I expect it to.
