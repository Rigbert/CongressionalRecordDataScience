 President, I ask my friend from Montana, Senator Baucus, to be alert because I want to raise a similar request to set aside. But before I do that, I want to explain why I am doing this. I worked for 6 years to pass the Congressional Accountability Act, which was signed into law by President Clinton in 1995. I worked so hard because I strongly believed there should only be one set of laws in this country.  Prior to 1995, there were two sets of laws--one for Capitol Hill and one for the rest of the country because Congress exempted itself. That is why, following on that practice of 1995, I offered an amendment during the Finance Committee markup to require that Members of Congress and congressional staff get their employer-based health insurance through the same exchanges as our constituents. That is something for which I also heard complaints from the grassroots of Iowa during my town meetings. I did offer that amendment, and it was adopted without objection.  But then after careful consideration and examination of the bill Senator Reid put together--and this was done by the Congressional Research Service--it was revealed that my amendment was changed under this closed-door merger process. Something cute happened. Under the bill we now have before us, this requirement would not apply to staff for committees of the Congress or leadership offices, it would apply to Members and their personal staff but not leadership. That is a real cute thing, to give exemptions for some people on Capitol Hill but not for others.  I ask unanimous consent to have printed in the Record an analysis from the Congressional Research Service.
