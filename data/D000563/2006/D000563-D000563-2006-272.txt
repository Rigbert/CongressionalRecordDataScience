I apologize for interrupting the Senator from New York.  I ask unanimous consent that the following speakers be recognized on the Democratic side in sequence, alternating with Republicans: Senator Clinton for 10 minutes; Senator Harkin for 15 minutes; Senator Boxer, 6 minutes; Senator Carper, 5 minutes; Senator Dorgan, 10 minutes; Senator Murray, 5 minutes; Senator Mikulski, 5 minutes; and Senator Lautenberg, 10 minutes.  The sequence may be different, depending on who is in the Chamber, but those are the times allotted for which I ask unanimous consent.
