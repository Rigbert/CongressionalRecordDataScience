President, I did not know Senator Reed's friend, but after listening to what he said, I feel as though I did know him. The distinguished senior Senator from Rhode Island is fortunate to have had such a friend, but I think his friend was fortunate to know Senator Reed. I know the distinguished Presiding Officer, the Senator from Georgia, did not mind the reference to the U.S. Marine Corps. I saw the smile on his face when that reference was made.                          ____________________
