 President, I will be brief. But I want to take a couple minutes to commend the Senator from Oregon for having the courage and the foresight and tenacity to push these amendments because they make a lot of sense.  All of us travel by the airlines. We want our airlines to do well. We want them to respond to all the people in the market. But we want it to be done upfront and, I think, upright. I am not sure that is going on today. That is why I believe this legislation is necessary. I think it is a step in the right direction.  We all go back to the deregulation of the airlines. I want to deregulate everything. But I want competition to be out there in the marketplace, including the airlines, to where people will have a choice. I am not sure we have a choice today in the airline industry because we have such concentration. We all fly. We want some basic rights.  I believe the passengers, who are the customers who support the airlines--without customers there will be no airlines--ought to have a say. I believe that is the thrust of the amendments offered by the Senator from Oregon. That is why I support them.  Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.
