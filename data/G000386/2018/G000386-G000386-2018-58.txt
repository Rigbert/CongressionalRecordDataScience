 President, as a lot of my colleagues, I rise to speak for a short period of time about our deceased colleague, Senator John McCain.  I begin my remarks by paying my respect for our colleague and friend, Senator John McCain. A great American has died.  Senator McCain represented the people of Arizona and the United States of America with great honor, always holding his ground and sticking to his principles. ``Sticking to his principles'' have been the words used by more colleagues since his death than any other description of him. Senator McCain was tough and tenacious, both as a 32-year Member of the U.S. Senate and also as a member of the U.S. Navy. His grit and determination as a prisoner of war in Vietnam are legendary and ought to be an inspiration. For the rest of his life, he understood from his own experience what it takes to keep a country safe, and he stood up for the security of the United States, and, in turn, that was standing up for the security of the world.  He prioritized those in uniform and the veterans who safeguard our Nation. I had tremendous respect for Senator McCain's leadership of the Armed Services Committee and for the many ways he led on the No. 1 responsibility of the Federal Government: our national defense.  Senator McCain and I served in the Senate together since 1986. Even after he became ill last year, Senator McCain's charisma was as strong as ever. At Christmastime, he greeted me with an oft-repeated joke he had since he was a candidate for President and traveling around Iowa. He learned a lot about Iowa, and this greeting was something like: Well, Chuck, I had my glass of ethanol for breakfast. He would often say to me something he learned in Iowa about advertising by the John Deere corporation: Nothing runs like a Deere. Of course, being from Iowa, I liked to hear that sort of greeting, and it was often that he said those things to me.  As I stand here today with his Senate desk close at hand and draped in hishonor, my wife Barbara and I share our condolences with Cindy McCain and Senator McCain's entire family. Senator McCain sacrificed so much of himself for his country, and we are grateful for his lifetime of service.                          ____________________
