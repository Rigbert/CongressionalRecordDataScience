This bill is of utmost importance to future generations in America. Quite simply, it implements equal protection under the Fourteenth Amendment of the Constitution for every born and pre-born person. It protects Americans' right to life by defining the term ``human person'' as an individual at all stages of life, including, but not limited to, the moment of conception.  The Constitution's Fourteenth Amendment grants that no ``state deprive any person of life, liberty, or property, without due process of law; nor deny to any person within its jurisdiction the equal protection of the laws.'' Furthermore, it grants ``Congress shall have power to enforce, by appropriate legislation, the provisions of this article.'' It is time that we, the Congress, start enforcing this provision, start defending the Constitution, and start defending American lives.  Even the Justices in the 1973 Roe v. Wade decision conceded this point by making the admission: ``If this suggestion of personhood is established, the appellant's case [Roe], of course, collapses, for the fetus' right to life is then guaranteed specifically by the [Fourteenth] Amendment.'' Our Constitution is designed to protect the rights of all Americans, and give them the right to live and succeed. Right now, significant portions of Americans, who have no voice, are being killed, despite the explicit protections in the Fourteenth Amendment. Since 1973, more than 44 million babies have been sentenced to death without trial. We cannot tolerate this atrocity.  Additionally, a 1999 Wirthlin poll found that 62 percent of Americans support legal abortion only in cases of rape, incest, or if the mother's life is in danger. How can we stand by and let so many children die even when public opinion is on our side? It is our role as legislators to uphold and enforce the Constitution, and it is our role as humans to defend those who cannot defend themselves. I urge my colleagues to follow their conscience, support this bill, and do what is right for America and for humanity.                                 ______                                       By
