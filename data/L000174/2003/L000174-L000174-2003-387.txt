President, regaining my right to the floor, I probably could have completed my speech during thistime, but I was trying to save everybody some time. I was trying to accommodate the distinguished senior Senator from Utah, who is the chairman. I think everybody has agreed now to the request I have made.  I would renew my request that the distinguished Senator from California be recognized, the ball then goes back to the distinguished Senator from Utah.
