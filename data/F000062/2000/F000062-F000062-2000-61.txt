 President, I am as upset by the gasoline price spikes as anyone else. I believe they are still very high in California, though prices have come down in my State from the highs they reached in March.  Having said that, I feel obliged to oppose this amendment despite understanding the sentiment behind it. The problem with the amendment is that there is no way to guarantee that a reduction in the federal gasoline tax will be passed on to consumers.  At least that's what the chief executive officers of the three major California refiners told me. Collectively, they produce 70 percent of California's gasoline. Earlier in the year, I called them. None could guarantee that a decrease in the gasoline tax would cause the same drop at the pump. They cited the fundamental problem with supply, and also pointed out that they have no control over other entities in the supply chain.  Price is a function of supply and demand, not taxes and right now, world oil markets are extremely tight, so prices are high. The way to relieve the pressure on the market is to boost supply and reduce demand.  With regard to supply, 14 nations sell oil to the U.S. under a cartel known as the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries, OPEC. Like any monopoly, OPEC controls the price of oil by limiting supply. Decreased production in non-OPEC countries like Venezuela, Mexico, and Norway has also contributed to the squeeze.  Since OPEC is not bound by U.S. law, there are only a few things the U.S. can do to encourage the cartel to increase supply. The preferred alternative is diplomacy.  It takes several weeks for production increases to be felt at the pump in lower prices, and California has unique problems affecting its supply. No other State requires the kind of reformulated gasoline that California does. So the gasoline has to be refined in California, and California refiners have had problems--including two fires--operating their plants at full capacity. They are at full capacity now.  As I said a moment ago, this amendment does not solve the problem of high gasoline prices. Under California law, if the federal gasoline tax drops by 9 cents per gallon or more, then the State tax automatically rises to off-set the federal decrease. The law is designed to protect the Highway Trust Fund. I have spoken with members of the California Legislature about this. They do not seem inclined to change the law.  What are our options?  The fact is, we have limited control over supply. Too much of the world's oil is produced elsewhere. The one thing we can control is demand.  The best way to reduce demand is to require that sports utility vehicles, SUVs, and light duty trucks get the same fuel efficiency that passenger vehicles do. If SUVs and light duty trucks had the same fuel efficiency standards as passenger cars, the U.S. would use one million fewer barrels of oil each day.  This is roughly equal to the U.S. shortfall before OPEC increased production.  The Department of Transportation is responsible for setting fuel efficiency requirements under the Corporate Average Fuel Economy, CAFE, program. About two-thirds of all petroleum used goes to transportation, so boosting fuel efficiency is an important way to wean ourselves off OPEC oil and reduce the price motorists pay for gasoline. Consider, too, the significant environmental and health benefits of higher fuel efficiency.  But CAFE standards have not increased since the mid-1980s. And the situation is made worse by a loophole in the CAFE regulations. SUVs and light duty trucks--which are as much passenger vehicles as station wagons and sedans--are only required to average 20.7 miles per gallon per fleet versus 27.5 miles per gallon for automobiles.  Since half of all new vehicles sold in this country are fuel-thirsty SUVs and light duty trucks, this stranglehold on energy efficiency has produced an American fleet with the worst fuel efficiency since 1980. We are going backwards!  According to the non-partisan American Council for an Energy Efficient Economy, the U.S. saves 3 million barrels of oil a day because of CAFE standards. Close the SUV loophole, as I said a moment ago, and save another million barrels each day.  Overall, SUV and light duty truck owners spend an extra $25 billion a year at the pump because of the ``SUV loophole.'' Making SUVs and light duty trucks get better gas mileage would save their owners some $640 at the pump each year when the price of gasoline averages $2 per gallon.  The bottom line is that eliminating some or all of the federal gasoline tax will not lower prices at the pump. The best way to do that is to reduce our demand. The best way to reduce demand is to increase the gas mileage requirements for SUVs and light duty trucks.
