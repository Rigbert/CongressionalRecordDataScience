Your perspective is one abortion procedure. You are prepared to not accept, but to tolerate other destructions of the fetus in abortion, but not this one, which troubles you greatly.  I don't deal with that aspect. I deal with postviability, that is, late-term abortions, of all types. And there is the distinction.  If the Senator is saying to me: ``You do not cover fetuses that are not viable,'' guilty as charged. This amendment does not address the fetus that is not viable.
