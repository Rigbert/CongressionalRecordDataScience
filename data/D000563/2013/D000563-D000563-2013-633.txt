At 5:30 p.m. we are voting on a measure which will affect literally millions of Americans. I will provide some illustration about this bill.  A close friend of mine is the mayor of Normal, IL. His name is Chris Koos, and he is a local businessman. His business sells bicycles, running shoes, running paraphernalia, and equipment. Chris has a good business and has done well.  He told me that in the last 10 or 20 years things have changed. He said, It is not unusual for someone to come into my store, ask to see a pair of running shoes, try them on, look at the different colors, and then leave without buying anything. Sometimes they will come back several weeks later with shoes and they will say: Chris, we bought these over the Internet, and they are not what we thought they would be; what can we do about it?  This is called ``showrooming'' and is happening more and more. Why would somebody try on the shoes, not purchase them, and then go to the Internet? In many instances, it is because many Internet retailers do not collect sales tax. In my State, this means 9 or 10 percent less cost to purchase an item over the Internet.  This is the reality for most companies. Some companies, Internet retailers, collect a sales tax. I recently purchased a book on Amazon, and theycharged the sales tax, which is appropriate in Illinois. Most companies do not collect the sales tax.  I wish to tell another side of this story. When we are dealing with the collection of this sales tax, we are dealing with existing law. Forty-six States in America have sales tax. The States that do not are Montana, Oregon, New Hampshire, and Delaware. Every other State has either a sales tax or what they call a use tax, and the State law requires all of us living in those States to pay a sales tax on Internet purchases even if the seller didn't charge it.  In my State, people are supposed to pay it when they file their annual State income tax return. There is a line: How much do you owe for Illinois sales tax that should have been paid on remote purchases or online purchases? It is really an honor system is what it comes down to. Though there is a legal obligation, there is no direct enforcement. It turns out that only 1 out of 20 people in Illinois even know this exists. So only 5 percent of the population know.  As I mentioned several times, a few years ago my bookkeeper said--when she was doing our taxes--Senator, do you want to pay the sales tax you owe? I said: I think I do. I did, and we have ever since. But most people aren't aware of it.  So here we have businesses all around America, on Main Streets and in shopping malls, collecting sales tax on the things they sell and competing with Internet retailers who do not collect the sales tax. Secondly, we have individuals with an obligation to pay the sales tax, but most of them do not. So the bill we will consider at 5:30 this afternoon is going to try to resolve this problem.  Over 20 years ago the U.S. Supreme Court said: Congress, you have to fix this. We are not going to fix it by court decision. The States can't fix it because it affects retailers from all around the United States. In the Quill decision before the Supreme Court, they said: Congress, you have to fix it.  It was about that time my colleague, Senator Enzi of Wyoming, teamed up with Senator Byron Dorgan of North Dakota to fix it. Many years have passed and here we are today on the floor of the Senate trying to finally resolve this issue. We have reached a good place. I think we have a reasonable approach to it, and this is what it says: States have to decide to opt in to our system. In other words, no mandate from the Federal Government.  If States opt in to what we propose in this legislation, here is what it means. It means States will be willing to provide the Internet retailers with the software program so that when they sell into the State of Illinois and the purchaser gives the home address, the program will automatically calculate how much sales tax should be collected on the sale. This is free to the retailers, and it allows them to collect the sales tax and then remit the sales tax to the State of Illinois or the other States in which they are selling.  We have worked with businesses--Internet businesses, obviously--and have the support of amazon.com, the largest Internet retailer. For years they have been fighting this battle State by State. As I said, they are now in Illinois collecting sales tax on things they sell over the Internet. But they have decided, and many others as well, it is time to put an end to these statewide court battles, statewide legislative battles, and finally have a national program to collect the sales tax.  What it means is a lot of money for the States and localities. My State is struggling with terrible budget problems. We are in the red with deficits, our pension system is in trouble, and money that should be collected for sales tax is not being collected. So what we are doing with this bill is allowing States to have Internet retailers selling in those States to collect the sales tax.  Several of my colleagues will come to the floor to oppose this, and they have one thing in common. Most of them--I think virtually all of them--live in States that don't have a sales tax. So what about those States? If we say Internet retailers can collect a sales tax, what does that mean in the State of Montana, for example? It means nothing changes for the people living in Montana. If there is no State sales tax they have to pay in their stores, this bill is not going to impose any new sales tax on the people of Montana.  So, then, why are the Senators from Montana opposing it? They are arguing their Internet retailers should not have to collect a sales tax for sales made in States that do have a sales tax. My answer to that is, if you wanted to do business in Illinois--if you wanted to move your shoe store to Illinois--you would have to follow Illinois law; you would have to play by Illinois rules--you would have to pay your property tax and collect the sales tax. That is accepted. If you want to do business in our State or any other State, those are the rules. We think the same thing should apply when it comes to Internet sales.  If a Montana Internet retailer, a State with no sales tax--Montana has no sales tax--wants to sell in Illinois, we are saying they need to collect money from the Illinois purchaser--not from the Montana purchaser but from the Illinois purchaser--for the sales tax and remit that back to the State of Illinois. If they do not want to do that or sell in Illinois or any State with a sales tax, that is their right. But if they do, for the privilege of selling in our State, we are saying they will pay this sales tax.  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to have printed in the Record a column from last week, April 21, from the Wall Street Journal, entitled ``Tax Internet Sales, Stimulate Growth.''  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in the Record, as follows:             [From the Wall Street Journal, Apr. 17, 2013]                  Tax Internet Sales, Stimulate Growth                         (By Arthur B. Laffer)       States can cut their income-tax rates if Web vendors      collect the sales taxes that are legally due.       Reinvigorating the economy should be priority No. 1 for      federal and state leaders. After enjoying an average growth      rate above 3.5% per year between 1960 and 1999, Americans      have had to make do with less than one-half that pace since      2000.       The consequences are already dramatic and will become even      more so over time. Overall we are 20% poorer today than we      would be had the pre-2000 growth rate persisted. All other      things being equal, less national income also means federal      and state fiscal problems are more intractable.       At the state level, there are reforms that can alleviate      the problems associated with declining sales-tax bases and,      at the same time, allow the states to move closer to a pro-     growth tax system. One such reform would be to have Internet      sellers collect the sales taxes that are owed by in-state      consumers when they purchase goods over the Web.       So-called e-fairness legislation addresses the inequitable      treatment of retailers based on whether they are located in-     state (either a traditional brick-and-mortar store or an      Internet retailer with a physical presence in the state) or      out of state (again as a brick-and-mortar establishment or on      the Internet).       In-state retailers collect sales taxes at the time of      purchase. When residents purchase from retailers out of state      (including over the Internet) they are supposed to report      these purchases and pay the sales taxes owed--which are      typically referred to as a ``use tax.'' As you can imagine,      few people do.       The result is to narrow a state's sales-tax base. It also      leads to several inefficiencies that, on net, diminish      potential job and economic growth.       Exempting Internet purchases from the sales tax naturally      encourages consumers to buy goods over the Web; worse, the      exemption incentivizes consumers to use in-state retailers as      a showroom before they do so. This increases in-state      retailers' overall costs and reduces their overall      productivity.       The exemption of Internet and out-of-state retailers from      collecting state sales taxes reduced state revenues by $23.3      billion in 2012 alone, according to an estimate by the      National Conference of State Legislatures. The absence of      these revenues has not served to put a lid on state-     government spending. Instead, it has led to higher marginal      rates in the 43 states that levy income taxes.       Therefore--as with any pro-growth tax reform--the sales tax      base in the states should be broadened by treating Internet      retailers similarly to in-state retailers, and the marginal      income-tax rate should be reduced such that the total static      revenue collected by the state government is held constant.       One difficulty in imposing an Internet sales tax is the      existence of dozens, if not hundreds, of sales-tax      jurisdictions in many states, often with the tax rates and      tax classification of the same goods varying by jurisdiction.      It is overly burdensome to task companies with remitting      sales taxes to more than 9,500 such tax jurisdictions.      Instead, each state should set up a single sales-tax system,      making compliance as easy as possible for today's modern      sellers.       Addressing e-fairness from a pro-growth perspective creates      several benefits for the     economy. A gross inequity is addressed--all retailers would      be treated equally under state law. It also provides states      with the opportunity to make their tax systems more efficient      and better aligned toward economic growth, as well as improve      the productivity of local retailers.       The principle of levying the lowest possible tax rate on      the broadest possible tax base is the way to improve the      incentives to work, save and produce--which are necessary to      reinvigorate the American economy and cope with the nation's      fiscal problems. Properly addressing the problem of e-     fairness on the state level is a small, but important, step      toward achieving this goal.
