I did this because I have been trying to obtain information concerning EPA's decision to become involved with the City of Portland's combined sewer overflow program since last August. Despite numerous requests, EPA has to this point failed to answer my questions and failed to provide me with the documents I have requested, with the exception of a limited number of documents that EPA would have to provide to any requester under FOIA.  There are legitimate questions about EPA's decision to intervene 10 years after the City signed an enforceable order with the State of Oregon and after the city and its ratepayers have spent more than $500 million to reduce sewer overflows. But to date, I have been unable to get answers to my questions from EPA despite repeated requests.  Last August, I wrote to the Acting EPA Administrator Marianne Horinko requesting answers to a number of questions concerning EPA's decision to become involved with the City of Portland's combined sewer overflow program. I also requested copies of documents about the Portland sewer situation. I never received answers to my specific questions, and I have received only a small number of the documents I requested.  I also submitted written questions following a hearing of the Senate Environment and Public Works Committee on September 15 to then EPA Assistant Administrator for Water, Tracy Mehan. I never received a response from Mr. Mehan, who has subsequently left the agency, or anyone else from EPA.  In October, I received a letter from Acting EPA Administrator Marianne Horinko promising to ``work[] with your staff to identify which of the documents that are not enforcement sensitive or confidential would be most helpful to you.'' Since then, I have received only a slim file of documents that doesn't begin to answer my questions.  Finally, I ask EPA Administrator Leavitt to look into this personally more than a month ago.  Until I receive answers to my questions and the documents I need to exercise my oversight responsibilities over EPA as a member of the Senate Environment and Public Works Committee, I will continue to object to any unanimous consent request for the Senate to take up the nomination of Stephen Johnson to be Deputy Administrator of the Environmental Protection Agency.                          ____________________
