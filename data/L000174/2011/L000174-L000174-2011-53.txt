President, I am proud to have joined once again with Senator Grassley to offer the bipartisan Fighting Fraud to Protect Taxpayers Act as an amendment to the National Defense Authorization Act. Combating fraud is a vital issue on which we have a long track record of working together, with great success. In these trying economic times, cracking down on fraud, which has harmed so many hardworking Americans, is more important than ever.  Fraud in military contracting and procurement is a persistent problem which costs taxpayers millions and hurts our military men and women. This amendment will help the critically important effort to crack down on fraud in the military and elsewhere, and so including this amendment with the Department of Defense authorization bill makes good sense. I urge Senators from both parties to support this amendment.  One of the first major bills the last Congress passed was the Leahy-Grassley Fraud Enforcement and Recovery Act. That bill gave fraud investigators and prosecutors additional tools and resources to better hold those who commit fraud accountable and has led to significant successes. Our work is not done though. Our amendment reflects the ongoing need to invest in enforcement to better protect hardworking taxpayers from fraud.  In the last fiscal year alone, the Department of Justice recovered well over $6 billion through fines, penalties, and recoveries from fraud cases--far more than it costs to investigate and prosecute these matters.
