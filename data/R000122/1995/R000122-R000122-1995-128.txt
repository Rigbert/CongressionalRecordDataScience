Speaker, when I was a young cadet at West Point, I read the remarks of an officer describing an operation in Vietnam. He said ``we had to destroy the village to save it.'' Looking back, that mind set left many destroyed villages but not a lot of salvation.  I fear this Republican leadership has the same mind set. They seem eager to destroy the Government to save it. This policy is clearly destructive and will not in any way serve the interests of the American people.  There is no need for this continued shutdown of the Government. It has resulted from the inability of the Congress to do its job in passing appropriations bills in a timely fashion. It continues because the Republican leadership persists in holding hostage the operation of the Government to its extreme budget plans.  However, it is incumbent that all parties, including the President, come to the table and make the good faith effort required to resolve the current shutdown. This situation is both unnecessary and unwise. Getting the Government back to work will not prejudice the Republicans from considering and, over my objections, passing their current reconciliation legislation. But, getting the Government back to work will aid seniors seeking to apply for Social Security, veterans needing assistance from the Veterans Administration, Americans needing to travel overseas on urgent business or family emergencies; in sum, all the people we were elected to serve.  It is time to end this gridlock.                          ____________________
