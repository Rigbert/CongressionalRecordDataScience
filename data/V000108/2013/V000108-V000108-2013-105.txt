 The gentleman mentioned, given their portion of the country, that it is hurricane season. It is tornado season in the Midwest. It is flood season in the Midwest. It is earthquake season every day in the State of California, and we have wildfires out west. The Guard does terrific work.  I am very proud of the fact that, although Indiana has continued to decline relative to other States, and is now only the 16th largest State by population in this great Republic, the Indiana National Guard is the fourth largest Guard unit in the United States of America. And it's not just numerical; it is the quality of the men and women who serve, just as in the States of Mississippi, Florida, and throughout our country.  But I would, again, reference back to the observations I've made on all of the furlough amendments that have been made tonight. Everyone who does civilian work, whether it be at the Department of Defense or any other agency of this government, does important work; and we ought not to make that distinction.  The gentlemen who have spoken in favor of this did vote for the Budget Control Act that did create sequestration, that did create this problem.  I would suggest that what we ought to do is comprehensively begin to solve this problem and not move chairs around on this particular deck.  I yield back the balance of my time.  The Acting CHAIR. The question is on the amendment offered by the gentleman from Mississippi (Mr. Palazzo).  The amendment was agreed to.           Amendment No. 58 Offered by Mr. Rogers of Alabama  The Acting CHAIR. It is now in order to consider amendment No. 58 printed in House Report 113-170.
