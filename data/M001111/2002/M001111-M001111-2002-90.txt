 I also want to commend the Chairman of the Senate Agriculture Committee, Senator Harkin, for writing a strong trade title in this Farm Bill. It is clear to me that Senator Harkin understands how critical USDA trade programs are to our farmers and ranchers, and to hungry nations around the world.  I am concerned, however, about the level of funding for the Market Access Program in the early years of this Farm Bill. I was prepared to offer an amendment to the Farm Bill to add $145 million to the Market Access Program, so that we would fund MAP at $200 million sooner than in the underlying bill. Unfortunately, some controversy arose over the offset for my amendment.  I would ask Senator Feinstein if she believes we need to fund the Market Access Program at $200 million as soon as possible in the final Farm Bill.
