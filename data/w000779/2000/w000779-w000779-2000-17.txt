 The Senator from California has made the key point. At the end of the day, I want it understood when the people of Oregon cast a ballot like the one I have in my hand on a matter that has historically been left to the people of my State and to every State, I will do everything I can on the floor of the Senate to protect that vote.  I yield the floor, and I suggest the absence of a quorum.
