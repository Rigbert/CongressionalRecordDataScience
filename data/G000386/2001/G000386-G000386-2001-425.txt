 President, as Chairman of the Senate Caucus on International Narcotics Control, I want to draw attention to our interdiction efforts throughout the Caribbean and Eastern Pacific, commonly referred to as the ``transit zone.''  Although Plan Colombia is our primary counterdrug operation in Colombia and the emphasis in the Andean region, commonly called the ``source zone'', continued interdiction efforts in the transit zone are an important part of our overall ``defense-in- depth'' plan. I have noted for some time, however, that our defense in depth seems more like a defense in doubt. I want to be confident that the United States has a well-thought out, overarching national drug control strategy, involving all components of both supply and demand reduction, including eradication and fumigation, alternate development, trade incentives, interdiction, prevention, treatment, and education. I am very pleased the President is ready to appoint the new Director of the Office of National Drug Control Policy, ONDCP, to assist with reviewing our plans, programs, and strategy. But I am concerned that we lack coherent thinking on our interdiction efforts. I am concerned about rumblings from the Department of Defense, DOD, that it is going to duck and weave on supporting such a plan.  I desire our interdiction efforts to be integrated and balanced, both interagency and internationally, as well as between the source zone, transit zone, and arrival zones. We need balance, within the transit zone, between the Caribbean and the Eastern Pacific, as well as balance with in the eastern, central, and western portions of the Caribbean itself. We need to have adequate intelligence community and DOD support for both the source zone and the transit zone. We need to be balanced between our air and maritime interdiction efforts. We need to be equally dynamic and risk adverse as the smuggling organizations are, when route and conveyance shifts are detected. Our counterdrug forces on patrol should also be aware of the terrorism threats that are increasing focused against our country. It is not clear to me that we currently have these things I have outlined.  The Senate Drug Caucus is planning an upcoming hearing on the Transit zone on May 15, 2001 to discuss the broader questions of ``What is our transit zone strategy?'' and ``Do we have a balanced approach in the transit zone?'' I hope for a discussion on the current threat, agency capabilities, current shortcomings, the relationship with the source zone and Plan Colombia, the projected future threat, any needed improvements, interagency and international relationships, and DOD and intelligence community support to our transit zone operations. I am especially concerned about reports of aging aircraft and vessels in the both the Customs Service and Coast Guard fleet inventories. I am also particular interested in the countries of Haiti, Jamaica, Cuba, Venezuela, Mexico, and the Bahamas, as well as the Commonwealth of Puerto Rico. Success in the transit zone is so critical for both the United States as well as the many countries throughout the Caribbean, who are so dependent on trade andtourism, and who struggle to avoid the dark influences of the narcotics threat.  I want to be sure we are doing our transit zone missions effectively and competently. I appreciate the difficult task of foreign investigations and interdiction, and appreciate the daily efforts of the Customs Service, Coast Guard, Drug Enforcement Administration, Department of Defense, Department of State, and our international allies. The mission is an important one and deserves our serious attention and sustained effort.                          ____________________
