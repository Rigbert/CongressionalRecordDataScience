Speaker, I rise today to comment on H.R. 2670, the Commerce, Justice, State, and the Judiciary Appropriations Act of 1999 conference report. This bill contains funding for the Department of Commerce's (DOC) Science and Technology programs.  In May of this year, the Committee on Science passed H.R. 1552, the Marine Research and Related Environmental Research and Development Programs Authorization Act of 1999, and H.R. 1553, the National Weather Service and Related Agencies Authorization Act of 1999. H.R. 1553 subsequently passed the House on May 19th and awaits Senate action.  In H.R. 2670, NOAA is funded at $2.3 billion. Within this amount, the National Weather Service (NWS) is funded at $604 million, which is a $43 million increase over the FY 1999 enacted level. This level is $13 million below the authorization in H.R. 1553 of $617.9 million, however, I believe it will provide adequate resources for the NWS. It is NOAA's highest duty to protect our citizens' life and property from severe weather and this amount is sufficient for NWS to finish its modernization and deploy critical weather observation systems. I also am pleased that the appropriators kept the Award Weather Interactive Processing Systems (AWIPS) cost-cap of 1996. This cap will protect taxpayers from unnecessary cost overruns.  This bill funds the Office of Oceanic and Atmospheric Research at NOAA at a level of $300.2 million which is $18 million over the President's request. This amount is also $16 million over the total authorizations in H.R. 1552 and H.R. 1553.  The National Sea Grant College Program is funded at $59.2 million. This is $7.7 million above the President's request. I am pleased that this total includes money for zebra mussel research. Sea Grant's cost-sharing approach with states provides a good bang for the research buck and is a good way to stretch scarce research dollars.  However, Mr. Speaker, I am disappointed that the conferees decided to include funding for a new Fisheries Research Vessel. The Commerce Inspector General and the Government Accounting Office have pointed out time and time again the need for outsourcing NOAA fleet operations. While NOAA is making some progress in the oceanographic and hydrographic outsourcing areas, there is little to no progress in the fisheries research area. In H.R. 1552, the Marine Research and Related Environmental Research and Development Programs Authorization Act of 1999, the Committee on Science directed NOAA to transfer resources to NSF to avoid having the taxpayer foot the bill for a new NOAA vessel. I urge NOAA to follow the recommendations of the Commerce I.G. and GAO and contract for vessel time instead of building new ships.  H.R. 2670 also funds the National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) at $639 million for FY 2000. This amount is $99 million below the President's request and $8 million below the FY 1999 enacted amount.  First, I want to remind my colleagues that last year we appropriated $197.5 million for the Advanced Technology Program (ATP) program. We were recently informed by the Commerce Department that the ATP program would carryover $69 million of this total. Once carryover from previous years is considered, ATP spent less than $190 million in FY 1999. This bill includes $142 million in new appropriations for ATP. With the 1999 carryover, ATP will have $211 million for FY 2000. I see no reason to increase the money available for ATP when the program could not efficiently and effectively use its FY 1999 appropriation.  The Manufacturing Extension Partnership (MEP) at NIST is funded at a level of $104.8 million or $5 million over the President's request.  Finally, Mr. Speaker, the construction account at NIST is funded at $108.4 million for FY 2000. After deducting a modest amount to maintain NIST facilities in Colorado and Maryland, I am optimistic that enough funds will remain to start construction of the Advanced Measurements Laboratory (AML). AML is necessary due to the precise measurements required for establishing standards associated with today's increasingly complex technologies. It is my hope that the additional funding that has resulted from this conference will enable NIST to begin construction of AML in FY 2000.
