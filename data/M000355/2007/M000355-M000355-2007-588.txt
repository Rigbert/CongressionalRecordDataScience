 President, I rise today to honor a great Kentuckian, Mr. Danny Orazine, for his 13-year service as county judge-executive to the people of McCracken County.  Mr. Orazine is the epitome of a man dedicated to serving his county residents, all the while ensuring a strong relationship with the city government as well. He is a modest, ethical, and fairminded man who has given much to McCracken County, and I am proud of the work he has done.  On Monday, December 25, 2006, The Paducah Sun newspaper published an article highlighting Mr. Orazine's many years of service. I ask unanimous consent that the full article be printed in the Record and that the entire Senate join me in thanking this beloved Kentuckian.  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in the Record, as follows:               [From the Paducah Sun, December 25, 2006]              Reflections: Orazine Returns to Simple Life                            (By Brian Peach)       Danny Orazine isn't a politician. At least he doesn't think      of himself as one. This coming from the man who has spent the      past 21 years in McCracken County public office--time that      was every bit as challenging as he would have liked.       ``Honestly, I don't really like politics,'' the outgoing      judge-executive said in a recent interview. ``I'm a simple      person.''       He's not flashy. Not begging for the spotlight. He'll wear      a suit when he needs to, but he'd rather lose the tie      whenever possible.       Look no further than his truck for proof of his modesty.       He still drives a 1983 Ford pickup that he bought new. It      has about 250,000 miles on it.       ``I've got the same house, same wife, same truck,'' he said      with a laugh, adding that a new paint job on the truck has      kept it looking good. He'll have to give back his county-     issued car, but that's OK. He'll just turn to his trusty      pickup a little more often.       He considers himself a strong Democrat, but he's not crazy      about partisan politics.       ``I normally worked closely with Democratic governors,'' he      said, adding that he still considers his relationship strong      with Gov. Ernie Fletcher and his Republican cabinet. The two      joked recently at ground-breaking and ribbon-cutting      ceremonies, and he said it's because partisan politics don't      come into play.       ``I'm a simple person,'' he said.       At one point, he thought of walking away.       ``In the middle of my first tenure, I was about ready to      resign,'' he said.       But he stayed on, and was re-elected twice, serving 13      years as judge-executive after eight as a county      commissioner.       It was sewers that got him into office. They were the big      issue back then. After that, he just hung around.       ``We just didn't get sewers in the smaller districts,''      Orazine said, referring in part to the Hendron area 18 years      ago.       The sewer agency was finally formed in July 1999 with the      merger of separate city and county sewer agencies. He said      the goal was to merge the water districts into one as well,      but today, ``I would never ask the water districts in the      county to give up theirs for the Paducah Water Works board.''       Paducah Mayor Bill Paxton recently asked Orazine to serve      on the city water board, and he accepted.       He'll leave behind a big corner office and lots of      responsibilities, but take his love for the community with      him. He's been offered a couple of full-time jobs since his      defeat, but he said he wants to get away from ``the politics      stage.''                             Running Clean       On his window sill are pictures--family and friends--as      well as a $20 bill, laminated and labeled: First Campaign      Contribution to Danny Orazine from Don Utley, Aug. 21, 1991.       He was elected judge-executive two years later. On his wall      are many pictures, including a large one of Paducah native      and former U.S. Vice President Alben Barkley, and one of his      campaign posters that Orazine said was from 1948.       He has never been offered a bribe, he said. ``I used to kid      about never being offered a bribe. Guess they didn't think      that I had enough clout to get it down. . . . Hopefully they      just thought I wouldn't have accepted it.''       He said advice from Julian Carroll stuck with him over the      years: If you'll only take your paycheck, you'll never have      any problems.       ``I have adhered to that,'' Orazine said, pointing out that      among his first responsibilities at the end of this year will      be turning in his eight-year-old county-issued Ford Taurus.                             Time of Change       He's leaving office, and it's in large part due to county      residents feeling it was time for a change. They picked Van      Newberry to replace Orazine in the May primary. He said his      was a good, tough run.       Zoning issues and building code enforcement were just a      couple of the ``monumental ordinances'' that he said the      fiscal court passed, and that weren't entirely popular with      the voters. About six years ago, the fiscal court required      that all new homes undergo a five-point inspection. The      problem was that some people decided to build homes on their      own, and may not have realized that the inspection also      checks for earthquake protection, given the proximity to the      New Madrid Fault.       ``People might cut a plan out of a magazine and come in      with it,'' he said. But most of those plans account for      possible seismic activity. ``We were stuck with not having a      building code or having seismic in it.''       The county opted to keep the more stringent codes, and the      five-point inspections--which Orazine said have led to a few      building delays during the busy construction season. ``It      took a while to catch up,'' he said. ``Now (in the winter),      the building has slowed and they're caught up.''       As for the city and county working together on such      projects as a comprehensive plan, Orazine never viewed that      as a step toward a metro government. Even so, he admitted      that at times, ``It's hard to tell where the city ends and      the county begins.''       Many city residents have moved into the county over the      past several years, and the city is occasionally annexing      county land into the city, often at a developer's request.       ``Anything, good or bad, affects both the city and county      now,'' he said. ``We have to prioritize what we're going to      prioritize, and talk over those things we place as      priorities.''       The downtown riverfront, though located in the city, will      benefit the entire area, and it's something the judge says      must naturally include the county, and that includes      financial support.       County government, he notes, ``is very lean by nature.''      That's mainly in regard to the budget. Comparatively      speaking, Paducah's is about $28 million, while the county's      is about $20 million.       ``If we didn't have the grants and money that the state      gives us, it'd be about half the city's,'' Orazine said of      the budget. ``That's why we're hesitant about hiring people      over here. . . . That's just the nature of the county.''       He looked to the city's fire department in saying that the      county couldn't afford to pay its firefighters. Grants help      keep the five volunteer fire districts operational.       ``There's a lot of pride that goes into them,'' he said.      ``Probably the biggest factor in the metro-government      discussion, moneywise, is I think you're going to have to      keep your volunteer firefighters.       ``If anybody ever proposed (a paid county fire department),      oh my, property taxes would go so high. I wouldn't want to be      anywhere near public office when that happens.''       That all comes back to the idea of a metro government. He      said county residents' pride in fire departments and parks      being operated by volunteers adds to the pride when they do      look nice, albeit, he said, not as nice as Noble Park.       ``The county was just not ready for it,'' he said of metro      government suggestions. But because he worked so closely with      the city during his tenure, particularly with Paxton, ``I got      associated with that, but I never went there and had no plans      to. That sure didn't keep me from working with the mayor.''       Paxton said Orazine ``is one of the most ethical, fair-     minded people I have ever known,'' and it made him easy to      work with. ``I enjoyed every minute of it,'' Paxton said. ``I      think the city and county benefited from not only the      closeness of my relationship with Danny, but also (his      relationship) with former Mayor Albert Jones, who was      extremely close with the judge.''                             Helping Youth       Another area Orazine looks back on with a smile is      everything he has done to help youths.       ``I got a special place for juveniles,'' he said of his      desire to help them. ``I didn't get into trouble (as a      teenager), but it was a wonder I graduated--It took me five      years to get through high school.''       Now, thanks to his push, the county puts about $1 million      each year toward helping children and teens, in large part      through the McCracken Regional Juvenile Detention Center.       Orazine is also a member of the state Office of Juvenile      Justice Advisory Board, which he has served on since it was      founded in 1998. He also serves on the Juvenile Detention      Council Board locally. As his tenure as judge-executive ends,      he plans to resign from those boards. That means fewer trips      to Frankfort for the state board meetings.       He lasted a term and a half before hiring a county      administrator--a position incoming Judge-Executive Van      Newberry wants to abolish. Orazine said he was becoming      overwhelmed with the large and small projects.       ``In the midst of all that, an employee of the courthouse      came in'' complaining about the texture of the toilet paper--     ``that it was too rough,'' he said, still sounding      exasperated at having to handle minor tasks when he had more      important things to deal with.                          ____________________
