 President, I come before this body to state that I would object to any unanimous consent or other requests to address H.R. 2751, S. 1522, entitled the GAO Human Capital Reform Act of 2003, as amended. The bill would, among other things, allow new authority to the General Accounting Office, GAO, to modify its personnel and workforce practices to allow greater flexibility in determining pay increases, pay retention rules, and other compensation matters. I am objecting to this bill because, at this time, I am evaluating a number of matters involving the operation and management of the General Accounting Office and one or more of its offices.                          ____________________
