Chairman, I move to express my strong opposition to the amendment. Some would suggest outrage; I will simply say opposition.  The fact is, across-the-board cuts to administrative accounts when we have significant problems as far as the administration of some of these programs in the Department of Energy is a profound mistake.  What I really want to emphasize at this point to all of our colleagues in the House is that members of this subcommittee and the full Appropriations Committee--which approved this bill, the people of this committee approved this bill--have made value judgments account by account.  The fact is, for renewable energy--and we will have amendments on this issue--there is a $428,345,000 reduction in this bill. In the Office of Science, there is a $72,203,000 reduction. For environmental clean-up for defense sites, for example, there is an $88,872,000 cut. These were all discrete decisions made and value judgments.  So I would emphasize to my colleagues that there are significant cuts and savings in this bill. I strongly oppose the gentleman's amendment, and I yield back the balance of my time.                             Point of Order
