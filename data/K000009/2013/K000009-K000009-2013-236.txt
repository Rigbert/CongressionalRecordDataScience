Speaker, during this month of October, the American people honor the life of Polish General Casimir (Kazimierz) Pulaski whose love of liberty, bravery and military prowess in founding the American cavalry played a pivotal role in winning our American Revolution. Let his timeless story inspire generations to come. May the eagles that soar over both our lands--as symbols of liberty--strengthen our partnership in freedom's cause. Onward.       Commemorating the Life of Polish General Kazimierz Pulaski       Thank you to all who have gathered here today to remember      and to commemorate the contributions of General Casimir      Pulaski to our nation's victory in the American Revolution      and to passing to us the blessings of liberty. As a young      child, I first learned his name as the street on which our      grandparents lived which was named ``PULASKI''.       Kazimierz Pulaski was born in Warsaw, Poland in 1745, 268      years ago, son of Polish Count Jozef Pulaski and Marianna      Zielinska. Within a little more than two decades, he would      come to be known as a freedom fighter and ``the father of the      American cavalry.'' Through his family in Poland, Pulaski      became involved at a very early age--age 15--in political and      military activity. He accompanied his father and other      members of the Polish nobility to publicly oppose the      Prussian, Russian, and Austrian empires' designs on      dominating their Polish homeland. Pulaski pushed for Polish      independence, free of outside interference. When he was      outlawed in his homeland by the Russian empire after initial      uprisings failed, he decided to travel to Paris, France, in a      self imposed exile. In so doing, he came to befriend Benjamin      Franklin, a father of our country, who also had travelled to      France imbued with the spirit of the French Revolution and      its values of liberty, equality, fraternity. They both were      seeking alternatives to the empire-driven political systems      of the European continent. Franklin was captivated with the      ideas of the Enlightenment as he tried to help lead a      fledgling nation, casting off the oppression of Great      Britain's monarchy. Franklin was impressed by Pulaski and      wrote of him to George Washington: ``Count Pulaski of Poland,      is an officer famous throughout Europe for his bravery and      conduct in defense of the liberties of his country against      the three great invading powers of Russia, Austria and      Prussia . . . he may be highly useful to our service.''       A century before their encounter, new ideas of how people      should live, and govern themselves, were brewing and emerging      on a European continent fraught with empires and suppression      of individual liberty. These ideas were transformational      concepts in human history. They revolved around how people      should live and govern themselves. The new concepts      emphasized democracy not monarchy; equality not subservience      nor serfdom; liberty not repression; freedom of thought and      reason, not dogma nor emotion; freedom of expression not      regimented thought; freedom of press, not propaganda; and      full separation of church and state, not theocratic control      of government. For those of us living in the 21st century,      with our nation an heir of Enlightenment thinking, perhaps we      have become so accustomed to our way of life that we forget      how radical these thoughts were at the time. Let us remember      what a price was paid for their emergence globally.       Pulaski's life reminds us of that early struggle of our      founders to build a new America, casting off the remnants of      old empires. Pulaski volunteered his services in the      Revolutionary War of the United States. America's founders      were about building a brand new nation girded by      Enlightenment ideals. That struggle did not happen overnight.      In fact we should recall that almost 4 decades after Pulaski      first volunteered, the new America was still fighting for its      future. The ballad ``Battle of New Orleans'' recounts      America's fight to finally drive the British from its      territory. You might recall the words from the last great      land Battle in the War of 1812 . . .``in 1814, we took a      little trip, along with Colonel Jackson down the mighty      Mississip. We took a little bacon and we took a little beans,      and we caught the bloody British in a town called New      Orleans.'' Of course, this year of 2013, our region of the      United States is commemorating the 200th anniversary of the      Battle of Lake Erie, when Commodore Oliver Hazard Perry      defeated the British in Lake Erie, the only time the British      Navy has ever lost a battle on the high seas. The British      monarchy finally was driven out of the westernmost reaches of      the new America.       So, imagine, Casimir Pulaski fighting bravely 33 years      earlier before the War of 1812, at the dawn of the American      Revolution. To my knowledge, there are no ballads written yet      about his achievements, though they are legendary and worthy      of expression.       Pulaski travelled in 1777 to Philadelphia--America's first      capital--a decade before our Constitution was drafted and      signed. He wrote to Washington: ``I came here, where freedom      is being defended, to serve it, and to live or die for it.''      Washington knew that the colonies had no trained cavalry, so      he met with Pulaski and introduced him to Marquis de      Lafayette and John Hancock. Pulaski showed off some of his      riding abilities, and tried to convince Washington of the      superiority of the cavalry over the infantry. And in Sept.      1777 Washington persuaded the Continental Congress to give      Pulaski temporary command of the Cavalry. On that very same      day, Pulaski pushed back the Birdshot at the Battle of      Brandywine in which he came to the aid of Washington's forces      and demonstrated his brilliant military tactics. He saved      Washington's Army from defeat, and some have recorded he took      a bullet aimed at George Washington himself. Congress      acknowledged Pulaski's leadership and commissioned him as a      Brigadier General. He was placed in command of four light      cavalry regiments. But, Pulaski as a foreigner had difficulty      with the Continental Congress allowing him to fight. So he      asked Washington to allow him to start his own legion. He      even offered to pay for them. Congress finally agreed. With      68 horses and 200 foot soldiers, the Pulaski Legion would      become the colonists' first fully trained cavalry. He spent      the winter of 1777 to 1778 at Valley Forge with most of the      army. He was then ordered to defend Little Egg Harbor in New      Jersey and then Minisink on the Delaware; Washington then      ordered him to proceed South to Charleston, South Carolina.      During the Battle of Savannah, on October 9, 1779, Pulaski      was wounded by cannon as he charged into battle on horseback.      He fell to the ground, mortally wounded. He died from      complications from that wound. But Pulaski was so respected      for his courage, even by his enemies, that he was spared the      musket and permitted to be carried from the battlefield. He      died on Oct 15, 1779 at age 34. There is a Pulaski Monument      erected in his honor, on Monterrey Square in Savannah,      Georgia.       In 1791, twelve years after his death, his homeland in      Poland adopted a new constitution modeled on that of the U.S.      Constitution, which just had been adopted in 1789. The Polish      Constitution too was a revolutionary document as Poland      became the first nation in Europe to outlaw serfdom. Indeed,      her constitution was so threatening to Europe's empires,      Poland was wiped off the map of Europe for 126 years emerging      as a nation after World War I and the Peace Treaty of      Versailles due significantly to the friendship between U.S.      President Woodrow Wilson and Polish pianist Ignacy      Paderewski.       Many national recognitions of Pulaski's contributions to      America's victory in our Revolution have been accomplished.      On October 29, 1779, the U.S. Congress passed a resolution      that a monument be dedicated to him. The first memorial was      built in 1854 and a bust of Pulaski was added to busts of      other heroes in the U.S. Capitol in 1867. In 1910, President      William Taft of Ohio unveiled a Congress-sponsored General      Casimir Pulaski statue. In 1929, Congress passed a General      Pulaski Memorial Day. There is a federal observance of      General Pulaski Memorial Day commemorating Pulaski's death      from wounds suffered at the Siege of Savannah on October 9,      1779. After a previous attempt failed, on Nov. 6, 2009,      President Barack Obama signed a joint resolution of the U.S.      Senate and House conferring on Pulaski an honorary American      citizenship, 230 years after his death, making him the 7th      person so honored.       Today, we, here in the heart of Cleveland, again bear      witness and respectfully remember General Casimir Pulaski. We      express our gratitude in America's third century for his      bravery and vision. And we collectively join together, as      eagles fly above both our nations, to say: Long live his      memory, long live America, long live Poland and long live      liberty.                          ____________________
