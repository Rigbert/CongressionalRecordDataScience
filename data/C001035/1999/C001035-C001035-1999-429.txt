President.                             Exhibit No. 1                           Securities and Exchange Commission,                                     Washington, DC, May 24, 1999.     Hon. Susan M. Collins,     Chairman, Permanent Subcommittee on Investigations, Committee          on Governmental Affairs, U.S. Senate, Washington, DC.       Dear Chairman Collins: I commend both you and your      Subcommittee for addressing the important issue of fraud in      the market for microcap securities. As I said in my March 23,      1999 testimony before your Subcommittee, fighting fraud in      this market has been one of the Commission's more significant      challenges this decade. The hearings you held help to focus      the issues and educate investors, and the principles in the      bill you plan to introduce will help leverage the      Commission's resources to combat microcap fraud.       As you know, Chairman Levitt testified on microcap fraud      before your Subcommittee in September 1997. He noted then      that with our resources remaining relatively constant, we      must ``rely increasingly on innovative and efficient ways of      minimizing fraud and of maximizing the deterrence achievable      with the Commission's limited resources.'' In my own view,      the concepts underlying ``The Microcap Fraud Prevention Act      of 1999'' would be of great assistance to us in this regard.      Most importantly, the bill would give us valuable new tools      to close off participation in the microcap market by those      who would prey on innocent investors.       In recent years, the Commission has made significant      inroads in the fight against microcap fraud. I appreciate      your efforts to address this serious problem through hearings      and legislation that support our enforcement efforts. I      believe your bill would significantly advance the cause and      help make our markets safer for investors. My staff and I      look forward to continuing to work with you and your      Subcommittee on this legislation.           Very truly yours,                                            Richard H. Walker,                                                         Director,     Division of Enforcement.                                  ____                                        North American Securities,                             Administrators Association, Inc.,                                     Washington, DC, May 17, 1999.     Hon. Susan M. Collins,     U.S. Senate,     Washington, DC.       Dear Chairman Collins: On behalf of the membership of North      American Securities Administrators Association, Inc.      (``NASAA'') \1\, I commend you for recognizing and      confronting the problem of fraud in the microcap securities      market. At your invitation NASAA testified before you and the      members of the Permanent Subcommittee on Investigations, and      took part in your fact-finding mission. We appreciate your      efforts to protect the investing public from frauds and for      introducing legislation to enhance enforcement efforts in      this area.       As you know, several years ago, state securities      administrators recognized the problem of fraud in the      microcap market. Since then the states have led enforcement      efforts and filed numerous actions against microcap firms.      There are systematic problems in this area, but they can be      addressed effectively if state and federal regulators and      policymakers work together on meaningful solutions.       NASAA wholeheartedly supports the intent of The Microcap      Fraud Prevention Act of 1999. It would be an important step      in combating abuses in the microcap market and maintaining      continued public confidence in our markets.       I pledge the support of NASAA's membership to continue to      work with you to secure passage of this important      legislation.           Sincerely,                                            Peter C. Hildreth,                                New Hampshire Securities Director,                                                  NASAA President.                             Exhibit No. 2  S. 1189, Microcap Fraud Prevention Act of 1999--Section-by-Section                                 Summary     sec. 1. short title: ``microcap fraud prevention act of 1999''       Explanation: The purpose of the bill is to protect      investors against fraud in the micro-cap securities market,      and for other purposes.       sec. 2. amendments to the securities exchange act of 1934       This section amends the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 to      grant the SEC authority to take actions against registered      persons who have violated the law. It allows SEC enforcement      actions to be predicated on state enforcement actions and      take steps to prevent the entry into the securities industry      of individuals who have committed fraud in other sectors of      the financial services industry.       Explanation: Currently, state securities laws do not allow      state regulators to obtain civil relief having nation-wide      effect. Rather, state regulators only have jurisdiction to      prohibit defendants from doing business in their state.      Wrongdoers are thus free to perpetrate fraud in any other      state where they have not been separately barred. This      section amends Exchange Act section 15(b)(4)(G) to allow the      SEC to bring a follow-up administrative proceeding to suspend      or bar regulated persons who either (1) have been barred by a      state securities administrator from operating within that      state or (2) is subject to a final order for fraudulent,      manipulative, or deceitful conduct.       The SEC would not have the authority to follow-up on ex      parte temporary restraining orders. Such orders are imposed      immediately by state regulators and do not provide alleged      violators with a chance to present a defense until after the      order has already been entered. The SEC would have the      ability to act on these state actions if, after adjudication,      the defendant were ultimately found to have committed a      violation or reached a settlement agreement.       Currently, the Securities Exchange Act does not permit the      SEC to take administrative actions to bar or suspend from the      securities industry individuals who have committed serious      violations--i.e. fraud--in other financial industries, such      as the insurance or banking sectors. This section amends      Exchange Act 15(b)(4)(G) to authorize the SEC (1) to take      administrative action seeking bars or suspensions against a      broker-dealer or associated person based on orders issued by      federal regulators of other financial services industries and      (2) to allow the SEC to take follow-up actions when a foreign      financial regulatory authority has previously found      violations in other financial sectors. To ensure parity and      close off any remaining loopholes, corresponding changes have      also been made to Exchange Act sections 15B(c), 15C(c), and      17A(c) to extend this provision to those who seek to      associate with municipal securities dealers, government      securities dealers, and transfer agents.       sec. 3. amendments to the investment advisers act of 1940       This section amends Investment Advisers Act section 203 to      allow the SEC to bring a follow-up administrative proceeding      to suspend or bar investment advisors who are subject to      certain federal, state, or foreign orders. This sections also      amends section 203(f) of the act to permit the SEC to bar a      person associated with an investment adviser on the basis of      a felony conviction.       Explanation: This section makes the same changes to the      Investment Adviser Act that Section 2 of the bill makes to      the Exchange Act. Both allow SEC enforcement actions to be      predicated on certain federal, state, or foreign enforcement      actions against individuals found to have committed      fraudulent or similar acts in the financial services sector.        sec. 4. amendments to the investment company act of 1940       This section amends Investment Company Act section 9(b)(4)      to allow the SEC to bring a follow-up administrative      proceeding to suspend or bar individuals covered by the      Investment Company Act who are subject to certain federal,      state, or foreign orders.       Explanation: This section makes the same changes to the      Investment Company Act that Section 2 of the bill makes to      the Exchange Act. Both allow SEC enforcement actions to be      predicated on certain federal, state, or foreign enforcement      actions against individuals found to have committed      fraudulent or similar acts in the financial services sector.                     sec. 5. conforming amendments       This section amends various provisions of the Securities      Exchange Act of 1934 to authorize the SEC to take      administrative actions against individuals--based on the      findings of certain federal, state, or foreign enforcement      actions--who seek to associate with municipal securities      dealers, government securities brokers and dealers, and      clearing agencies. The section also amends the Securities      Exchange Act of 1934, so that actions by state securities      commissions and other regulators can trigger a statutory      disqualification. This section will focus statutory      disqualifications on serious violations of state law,      particularly fraud and similar offenses.       Explanation: This section seeks to prevent individuals who      have committed fraud in other financial services sectors from      entering the securities industry. The section also expands      the definition of violations that trigger automatic statutory      bars from the securities industry.                 Sec. 6. broadening of penny stock bar       This section amends Exchange Act section 15(b)(6) to expand      the penny stock bar to cover a broader category of offerings.       Expanation: This section would extend the penny stock bar      to all offerings other than those involving securities traded      on the NYSE, AMEX, NASDAQ, NMS, or investment company      securities. While there is no formal definition of ``micro-     cap'' security, this statutory amendment would cover what are      generally referred to as ``micro-cap'' securities.sec. 7. court authority to prohibit offerings of non-covered securities       This section amends Exchange Act section 21(d)(5) to      provide federal court judges the authority to impose the      remedy outlined in Section 9 of the bill.       Explanation: This section would allow the SEC to obtain all      necessary relief more efficiently and expeditiously by      requesting, in appropriate cases, a district court to issue a      penny stock bar order. This authority would be provided as an      alternative to the SEC's current ability to seek such orders      only through administrative proceedings.             sec. 8. broadening of officer and director bar       This section amends Exchange Act section 21(d)(2) in order      to broaden the scope of the officer and director bar.       Explanation: Current law allows persons barred from serving      as an officer or director of companies that report to the SEC      to serve as officers or directors of other companies. This      section removes the limitation to SEC reporting companies,      and instead covers all publicly traded companies--those      registered pursuant to Exchange Act section 12, those      required to file reports pursuant to Exchange Act section      15(d), and those whose securities are ``quoted in any      quotation medium.''                sec. 9. violations of court ordered bars       This section adds section 21(i) to the Exchange Act to give      the SEC a more direct remedy against recidivist violators of      prior bar orders.       Explanation: This section makes it a stand-alone violation      of the securities laws for a person to engage in conduct that      violated a prior order barring him from acting as an officer,      director or promoter. It allows the SEC to take direct      enforcement action (seeking per-day money penalties, among      other remedies) against a recidivist without the need for      criminal authorities to bring a contempt proceeding.                                 ______                                       By
