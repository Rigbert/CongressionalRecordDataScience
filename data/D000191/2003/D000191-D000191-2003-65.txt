Speaker, I would like to just restate briefly from what I have heard from the three gentlemen who have gone before me, because I think it is very important for the American people. I mean, it would be one issue if there was misjudgment that was costing the American people tens of billions of dollars. The President is asking us to borrow $87 billion and put into debt future generations of Americans to pay it back. We do not have the money. It is going to be borrowed. Thirty years, people will work for the next 30 years to pay it back. But really not wealthy people, because they do not pay taxes anymore, but working people.  So there is a question, if someone in my administration made a mistake that was causing the American people 30, 50, 100, 200 billion dollars, maybe there would be a consequence. Then we go to the issue of lies. There was an extraordinary article in the press today which said the President said our troops have the best equipment possible; they have everything they need.                              {time}  2200  And we find out the young men and women over there have Vietnam-era flak jackets that will not stop bullets from AK-47s. $400 billion budget at the Pentagon, $80 billion from Congress last spring, and they are just now placing the orders.  Individual families have been buying these kids state-of-the-art flak jackets, available for $500 in the private sector in the United States, and mailing them to the kids who are serving the United States of America.  So you get to the next level which is beyond someone simply made a mistake to extraordinary incompetence, extraordinary incompetence that is costing the American people tens of billions, hundreds of billions of dollars over the next 30 years. It is costing young American men and women their lives today as we speak. And yet no one has lost their job. No one who planned this, no one who made this case, no one has been involved. In fact, they are being promoted.  As you said, Condoleezza Rice has been promoted now to be Pro-Consul over Afghanistan and Iraq because she has been doing such a great job. What has she been doing a great job on?
