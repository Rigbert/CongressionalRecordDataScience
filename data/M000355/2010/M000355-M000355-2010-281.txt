 President, let me say again before turning to Senator Shelby how much we appreciate his leadership on this and how much we appreciate all of our Republican colleagues, plus Senator Nelson, giving him the ability to improve the bill that came out of committee. Much has indeed changed since Monday. I thank Senator Shelby for his leadership. I also commend Senator Dodd for the spirit in which those discussions were commenced.  I see the Senator from Alabama on the floor.  I yield the floor.
