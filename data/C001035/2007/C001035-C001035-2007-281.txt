President, I thank my colleague from Utah.  I rise in opposition to the amendment offered by the Senator from Louisiana that would restrict the ability of a campaign to hire the spouse or child of a candidate. I just don't see why we would want to get into the issue of whom a candidate can put on his or her payroll. As long as it is a fully disclosed expense, which it would be through campaign finance reports and campaign disclosures, then the voters can judge whether it is appropriate. In some cases, it may be appropriate; in some cases, it may not. Why should we bar the ability of a family member to work for a candidate? I don't see the point of that.  This isn't a case where taxpayer dollars are being used and you might want to make sure that you are following some antinepotism rules. This is a campaign.  As it happens, I have never had a relative on my campaign payroll. I should perhaps make that clear. But many times when people are starting out, running for public office the first time, it is family members who are willing towork on the campaign at very minimal pay in order to help their relative win the race.  I don't see this creating a problem. I think it is a mistake for us to legislate in this area. I urge opposition to Senator Vitter's amendment.  I thank the Chair.
