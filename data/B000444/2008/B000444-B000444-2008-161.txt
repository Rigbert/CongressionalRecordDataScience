 President, I wish today to commend someone whom I have admired for my entire time in this body, a man who has committed his life to helping society's most vulnerable. Joe Dell'Olio, who is retiring after 35 years at Child, Incorporated, is a dedicated public servant in the true sense of the word.  Joe started at Child, Inc., of Wilmington after spending his early career fighting to reduce Delaware's crime rate. In 1972, after just 2 years as the executive director of the Delaware Agency to Reduce Crime, we saw the crime rate cut by 7 percent. As the head of the agency responsible for leading that fight, perhaps no one was due more credit than Joe.  Joe then joined Child, Inc. in 1973, the same year I was sworn in to the Senate. As executive vice president, he was responsible for the development and administration of a wide range of advocacy and service programs for victims of domestic violence and their families. Joe and I grew together as we fought to empower and protect victims of domestic violence in our community.  While I labored in the Senate to write and pass the Violence Against Women Act, Joe Dell'Olio was on the front lines in our battle. He was the one on the street or in the counseling room. He was the one securing legal help when victims could not afford it. And he was the one who made sure someone was there when a victim had nowhere to go.  I consider the Violence Against Women Act my proudest legislative accomplishment. But the Joe Dell'Olios of the world are the ones who deserve the credit for our progress. Joe has received several awards, including some from the U.S. Departments of Justice and Health and Human Services.  Throughout my career, I have been privileged to work with some of the finest public servants our Nation has ever known, those who committed their lives to the greater good. None have been more unwaveringly focused on a worthy cause than has Joe Dell'Olio, even as he raised a loving family of his own. Joe's tireless sense of duty and his unrelenting service never cease to amaze me.  I wish him the best in all his future endeavors.                          ____________________
