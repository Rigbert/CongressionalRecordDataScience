Chairman, I yield such time as she may consume to the gentlewoman from Washington State (Mrs. McMorris Rodgers), the author of this legislation.  Mrs. McMORRIS RODGERS. Mr. Chairman, I appreciate all of the work that has gone into this legislation, and I rise in support and urge support of the Hydropower Policy Modernization Act of 2017.  Hydropower serves as the Nation's largest source of clean, renewable, reliable, and affordable energy. In my home State of Washington, it is roughly 70 percent of our electricity that comes from hydropower. It is one of the reasons that we enjoy some of the lowest electricity rates in the country.  Only 3 percent of the dams produce electricity, and there is room for tremendous potential to increase production of this renewable energy resource. In fact, we could double hydropower production and create an estimated 700,000 new jobs without building a single new dam, simply by updating the technology in our existing infrastructure and streamlining the relicensing process. But we must reduce the regulatory burden to allow this process to move forward.  This legislation seeks to streamline the relicensing process in an inclusive and environmentally friendly way. On average, it only takes 18 months to authorize or relicense a new natural gas facility--18 months--but it can take up to 10 years or longer to license a new hydropower project or relicense an existing facility--10 years.  Right now, it can be extremely costly and an uncertain process to relicense an existing dam or license a new dam. Investors are pursuing other base load sources of energy because of the current regulatory process. I want to encourage these investments so that we can support and expand renewable, carbon-free hydropower.  As I understand it, hydropower is well-supported by my colleagues, but many think we are tipping the scales in favor of this source.  First, I would like to define industry. We are hearing a lot about industry on the other side.  In eastern Washington, many of these dams are owned by small PUDs who pass on all of the costs to the ratepayers. These costs are delivered to the people of eastern Washington and throughout the United States. These are not major corporations.  I have also heard that we are lowering environmental standards during the licensing process for Tribes and States. At the request of the Western Governors' Association, we added language to clarify that nothing in this bill--nothing in this bill--will touch the Federal Water Pollution Control Act, the Fish and Wildlife Coordination Act, the Endangered Species Act, the Rivers and Harbors Appropriation Act, or the National Historic Preservation Act.  I have also heard that we did not allow Tribes and States to testify on this bill. I struggle with these comments. This bill has gone through regular order. We have held multiple hearings. We had a member from the Standing Rock Sioux Tribe on one of the panels. It passed out of committee with a voice vote because concerns were raised from the Tribes, and we committed to sitting down and working with the Tribes to attempt to reach some language. I am proud of our efforts in that regard, and I am greatly disappointed that, at the end of the day, the Tribes did not come to an agreement on the legislation.                              {time}  1400  Although we weren't able to reach that resolution, we do protect the integrity of this legislation.  Licenses are complex, but there is no excuse for a process to take 10 years. It is time to update the approval process and make hydropower production easier and less costly without sacrificing environmental review. That is exactly what the Hydropower Policy Modernization Act of 2017 will do.  Specifically, my legislation designates FERC as the lead agency for the purpose of coordinating all applications of Federal authorizations, and establishes coordinated procedures for the licensing of hydropower projects.  By designating FERC as the lead when coordinating with agencies, States, and Tribes, there will be added transparency and collaboration. This added certainty in the relicensing process will diminish the burden on resource agencies, help avoid unnecessary delays, and ultimately lower costs to my constituents.  My legislation also incentivizes capital-intensive projects like updating turbines or improving fish ladders. Right now, these upgrades are only included in the lifespan of a dam's license during the relicensing window.  Included in the legislation is an early action provision requiring FERC to include all protection, mitigation, and enhancement measures during the relicensing process. In addition, the legislation allows the timely and efficient completion of licensing procedures by minimizing the duplication of studies and establishing a program to compile a comprehensive collection of studies and data on a regional or basin-wide scale. At the same time, industry has the option to help pay for studies and staff resources to speed up the process.  As a co-chair of the Northwest Energy Caucus, I recognize and I am excited about the tremendous potential hydropower brings not just to my district in eastern Washington, but to the country. By utilizing currently untapped resources and unleashing American ingenuity, hydropower production will lower energy costs and help create jobs.  This bill is not about changing outcomes or environmental law. This bill is about speeding up the process and saving time and money.  Mr. Chair, I urge all of my colleagues to support clean American energy and to support the Hydropower Policy Modernization Act of 2017.
