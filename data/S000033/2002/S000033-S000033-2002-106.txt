 Speaker, today, I recognize the outstanding work done by participants in my Student Congressional Town Meeting held this spring at the University of Vermont. These participants were part of a group of high school students from around Vermont who testified about the concerns they have as teenagers, and about what they would like to see government do regarding these concerns.  I respectfully request that the following testimonials be included in the Congressional Record.        On Behalf of Sam Parker, Becca Van Horn, and Eli Brannon                          Regarding FREE TRADE                            (April 8, 2002)       ELI BRANNON: Free trade is a method for countries to trade      internationally without having to worry about tariffs or      barriers. The first step towards free trade was taken in 1948      with the creation of GAT, the General Agreement Tariffs rate.      GAT was formed as a way to provide rules for countries to      dismantle trade barriers and organize a system of commercial      business. Unfortunately, it did not live up to expectations.       GATT was transformed into the World Trade Organization, or      WTO, on January 1, 1995. Before the World Trade Organization      was created, North America had already created its own system      of trade, the North American Free Trade Agreement, or NAFTA.      NAFTA has grown to include Canada, the U.S. and Mexico. Free      trade is supposed to help support the countries involved. It      does create more jobs, lowers taxes on trade, and makes some      Second World Nations like South Korea and Taiwan want to      attend trade liberalization. However, the advantages are      overshadowed by the numerous disadvantages, including worker      exploitation, job loss effects on the agricultural community,      and the obvious attempt for corporate profit.       SAM PARKER: NAFTA was originally established to help solve      North America's problems, increase of trade surplus, standard      of living, and better jobs, among other things. Before NAFTA,      the U.S. agricultural trade surplus with Mexico and Canada      was $203 million. Since NAFTA was established in 1994, this      surplus fell $1.498 million.       What NAFTA does not openly stop our economy's advancement,      it has set it far behind. NAFTA promised an increase in jobs      for Americans. Not only has this not happened, but more than      350 U.S. workers have lost their jobs. Many of these jobs      were given to Mexican workers being paid one-third of what      Americans are paid.       Another promise of NAFTA was to boost the agricultural      economy. The farming community has been given nothing but      false hopes with the promise of more jobs. Farming income has      declined and consumer prices have gone up.       Although NAFTA and free trade look appealing on the      outside, the effects are devastating to most working-class      persons.       BECCA VAN HORN: I pledge allegiance to the flag of the      multinational corporations, and to the profit for which they      stand, one interlocking directorate under no government,      indivisible, with monopoly and cheap labor for all.       This pledge epitomizes the only noticeable progress of the      World Trade Organization. Free trade, and therefore NAFTA and      the World Trade Organization, which attempts to globalize      economies without globalizing human rights, only leads to big      corporations exploiting the Third World. While supporting the      capitalists, the big corporations who benefit most from free      trade, the World Trade Organization advances by exploiting      the Third World proletarians, opposing human rights and      demands for adequate working conditions.       The World Trade Organization thrives on maintaining the      status quo by taking American jobs and giving them to eleven-     year-old Indonesian children working in a Nike factory for 83      cents per day. Free trade helps the First World, but leaves      the poorest with barely .4 percent of all global trade. That      is barbaric. You do not keep the standard of living for      America by exploiting one group of people. The Third World      has taken an incredible hit.       The World Trade Organization supports groups like the      International Monetary Fund, whose only purpose is to loan      money to countries in dire situations, and then demand the      money back at an incredibly high interest rate. By supporting      organizations like the IMF, and only looking at how the rich      can flourish, the World Trade Organization is dooming the      Third World to never advance economically.       This is not an impossible situation. If free trade focuses      on advancing all social classes, it will be beneficial to the      First and Third worlds. There would be more American jobs,      farmers could prosper, and, although big corporations would      lose money, they could begin to cleanse their moral values.       If the Third World is able to focus on trading with each      other and the First World on an equal basis, their children      could go to school and their economy progress. If an      organization like the U.N. helped put that eleven-year-old      Indonesian child into a plausible trade, their population      would not be doomed to factory work at subsistence wages and      no benefits.       Of course, it would be difficult. But free trade attempts      to globalize only one aspect of our world, increasing the      disparity in every other way. Free trade, and therefore NAFTA      and the WTO, globalizes economies, not for the betterment of      the world, but for corporations and consumerism, creating a     never-ending spiral of the rich remaining rich and the poor      remaining poor.                        On Behalf of Ruth Blake                    Regarding STRAIGHT TALK VERMONT                            (April 8, 2002)       RUTH BLAKE: Straight Talk Vermont is one of the programs      run out of the Community Justice Center, and some of the      things they are involved in is Arts are Wonderful, a group of      high school students getting together and working on art      projects and learning different types of art. They have a      Team Reaching In, which is like a song-poetry kind of group.      They have Art from the Inside Out, which is a group of UVM      art majors who are teaching majors, teaching middle schoolers      and young students art. And the Teen Expressions, which is      what I'm part of. It is a group of high schoolers from around      the area, and they get together, and plan different events,      and fun things to do, as something else to do besides      drinking and drugs and that kind of stuff.       Straight Talk Vermont is the overall thing. They help      people at high risk, and it--they just help build and become      better. What I'm involved in is the Teen Expressions Dance      Company, and they're putting on a dance performance. It is a      group of young amateur performers. We are just getting      together and choreographing and dancing, performing.                               ____________________
