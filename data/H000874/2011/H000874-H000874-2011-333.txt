Speaker, I rise today to honor and congratulate a remarkable group of talented young students from Maryland's Fifth Congressional District.  On May 9th, a team from Dr. James Craik Elementary School in Charles County won first place in Maryland's statewide Mathematics, Engineering, Science Achievement (MESA) competition held at the Johns Hopkins University Applied Physics Laboratory in Laurel. To participate in the competition, the students first had to prevail in the regional semi-finals against 21 other Charles County elementary schools.  Led by coaches Nick Gardiner and Susan Steinmet, the team took on a series of challenges that tested their ingenuity, creativity, and determination. Although they faced stiff competition, the team impressed the judges and emerged victorious by incorporating green design elements like solar panels and making the most efficient designs. It is the second time Craik has won the competition in just 3 years.  The team's win represents not only a victory for Craik, but for our State and Nation. With the proper education and support, these students have proven that the next generation of American leaders are poised to push the boundaries of science and technology and achieve great things. I urge my colleagues to join me in applauding this great accomplishment.                          ____________________
