Speaker, the majority leader talked about a lot of issues, one of which was NICS. What he didn't say was they put a poison pill in the Fix NICS bill, which is why so many of us voted against it on concealed carry. There is a disagreement in this House on that. We disagree, for the most part, on that provision. We don't think that makes America safer. There are differences of opinion on that.  My suggestion to the majority leader is, the Rutherford bill is on the floor. By unanimous consent, let's put the Fix NICS bill in the Rutherford bill without the poison pill in it.  Mr. Speaker, I yield to the gentleman to see if he will be agreeable to doing that.  Mr. McCARTHY. Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentleman for yielding.  That would be the same outcome that is already sitting in the Senate. The Senate has the Fix NICS bill now. We will add more to it.  I hope you are just as frustrated with the Senate as I am.  Why can they not pass something?
