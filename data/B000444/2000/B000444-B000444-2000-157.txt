 In the meantime, the fellow with whom I have worked most on this legislation, and who has played the most major part on the Republican side of the aisle on the violence against women legislation has been Senator Hatch.  He and I have been working to try to work out a compromise. We think we have done that on the violence against women II legislation, reauthorization of the original legislation. Because of his cooperation and his leadership, actually, I am prepared to not offer my amendment. But I do want the Record to show why. It is because of Senator Hatch's commitment and leadership for us to move through the Judiciary Committee with this and find another opportunity to come to the floor with it.  With the permission of the managers, I will yield--without the Senator from Minnesota losing his right to the floor--to my friend from Utah to comment on the Violence Against Women Act.
