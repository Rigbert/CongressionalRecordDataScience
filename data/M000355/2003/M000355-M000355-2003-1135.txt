 We have worked closely in our approach to this section where we have addressed the funding needs for democracy programs, including in predominantly Muslim countries.  The bill we are considering today will increase funding in Section 524(b) of the Foreign Operations portion from $15,000,000 to $20,000,000 and correspondingly adds ``civic education'' as a program and activity under this section that the subcommittee wishes to fund.  Does the Ranking Member agree with me that this increase of $5,000,000 is intended to ensure that democracy programs, including civic education programs, receive additional funding?
