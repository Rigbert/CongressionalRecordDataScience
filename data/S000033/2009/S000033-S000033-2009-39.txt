 It is called the Northeast Kingdom, in the northeast part of the State. For 30 years we have had a number of community health centers in that region. Do you know what? Amidst all of the poverty, all of the unemployment, all of the economic problems, we do not have a problem in terms of primary health care in the poorest area of the State of Vermont precisely because of these community health centers, which you indicate address dental care, which we often forget about, mental health counseling, we forget about, low-cost prescription drugs.  I look forward to working with the chairman of the HELP Committee and others to make sure we fund the kind of revolution we need in disease prevention, in primary health care, which at the end of the day improves people's health, keeps them out of the emergency room, keeps them out of the hospital, saves us money.  Study after study: Saves us money.
