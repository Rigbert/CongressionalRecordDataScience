They have not gone bankrupt. They are still operating.  The Federal Government has not had, that I am aware of, any major TIFIA loans or anything go into default.

No one in the world operates transit agencies that make money.  It is a public service to mitigate congestion and provide for our major urban areas to move people more efficiently with a partnership between the Federal Government and local authorities.  I reserve the balance of my time.
