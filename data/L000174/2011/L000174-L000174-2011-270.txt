President, we have a group of British parliamentarians meeting with us. I see the distinguished Republican leader on the floor. Senator Cochran and I are leading a delegation to meet with them, and I am about to ask to put the Senate in recess subject to the call of the Chair, which will only be a matter of minutes, I assure my colleagues, so we can bring them on the floor.  I ask unanimous consent that the Senate stand in recess, subject to the call of the Chair.  There being no objection, the Senate, at 12:03 p.m., recessed subject to the call of the Chair and reassembled at 12:13 p.m., when called to order by the Presiding Officer.  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Manchin). The Senator from Vermont.
