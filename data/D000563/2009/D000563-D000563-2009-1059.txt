Lamont  I would like to add, Madam President, before I ask for this consent, that one of the numbers I have just read relates to the nomination of Thomas Lamont, to serve as Assistant Secretary of the Army for Manpower and Reserve Affairs.  Mr. Lamont is a friend of mine. He lives in my hometown, and I have known him for many years. He and his wife Bridget are close friends.  Tom is a dedicated public servant. He has spent 25 years in the Judge Advocate General's division of the Illinois Army National Guard, where he was a State staff judge advocate general before retiring with the rank of colonel in the year 2007.  He was also elected to the board of trustees at the University of Illinois. He served in the highest capacities with the Office of the State Attorney Appellate Prosecutor, Civil Litigation in the Office of the Illinois Attorney General, and the Illinois Board of Higher Education.  He has practiced law in Springfield, my hometown, where he has built a sterling reputation for integrity and ability.  Most recently, Tom has served as special counsel to the University of Illinois.  With this confirmation, his broad array of service and experience will serve our Nation. The Army and America need leaders such as Tom Lamont.  With our Army's soldiers deployed around the world, with their families counting on good leadership in the Pentagon to make certain they are well trained, serve us well, and come home safely, we have an excellent person to serve as Assistant Secretary of the Army for Manpower and Reserve Affairs in Tom Lamont of Springfield, IL.  I was happy to recommend his name to the President.                   Nomination of Margaret A. Hamburg  Madam President, one of the nominees to be considered and voted out this evening is to serve in the administration with a special responsibility for the Food and Drug Administration. Margaret A. Hamburg is certainly well qualified to serve in that capacity. There are many responsibilities to be dealt with in the agency, including the safety of drugs, pharmaceuticals, medical devices, and food in America. It is an issue that is near and dear to me. I have spoken to the nominee about it personally, and I wish to commend her.  Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the nominations be confirmed en bloc, and the motions to reconsider be laid upon the table en bloc; that no further motions be in order; that any statements relating to the nominations be printed in the Record; that the President be immediately notified of the Senate's action, and the Senate then resume legislative session.
