 President, at the request of President Clinton, I am introducing today legislation to combat international terrorism. The very grave threat to the United States posed by violent terrorist acts is documented by the events of this week, as well as of the past 2 years.  Two days ago, Ahmed Ramzi Yousef, the alleged mastermind of New York's World Trade Center bombing 2 years ago, was arrested and extradited from Pakistan. Explosives and United and Delta Airlines timetables were recovered from his hotel room in Pakistan.  Even as legal proceedings now begin against him, 11 other men are on trial in Federal court in New York City for conspiracy to commit several heinous acts of terrorism in and around Manhattan--including the World Trade Center bombing.  These incidents demonstrate that the United States and its citizens continue to be the focus of extremists who are willing and able to use violence to advance their cause. The damage this terrorism causes extends beyond the tragic loss of life and damage of the World Trade Center bombing.  Indeed, the revelation that terror networks are operating in our midst undeniably has its intended effect on [[Page S2503]] our national psyche--it undermines the sense of security of all Americans both at home and abroad.  Equally important, the continued operation of numerous terrorist organizations around the globe undermines the stability of key U.S. allies and important foreign policy objectives.  In the Middle East, terrorism perpetrated by groups supported by Iran and Syria pose a grave threat to the already fragile Middle East peace process.  The recent bombing in central Tel Aviv, which killed 19 Israelis--many of them soldiers on leave--was only the latest in a series of attacks carried out by Palestinian extremists since the signing of the Israeli-PLO Declaration of Principles in September 1993.  In South America, terrorists in Colombia and Peru--often in league with narcotics traffickers--attack the very institutions of State, weakening the ability of those governments to confront the drug trade--a trade that continues to plague our own society.  A short time ago, international terrorism seemed to be in decline. But in 1993, the last year for which data are available, the State Department's Office of Counterterrorism reports that there were 427 terrorist incidents, an increase from 364 incidents in 1992.  The main reason for the increase was an acceleration of the campaign conducted by the Kurdistan workers party--known as the PKK--against Turkish interests in Western Europe.  But the raw numbers--and the dry statistics of which group perpetrated what attack--do not even begin to portray the harm caused by the heinous acts of terrorist violence.  Wherever it occurs, the lost lives, broken hearts, and destroyed dreams of the thousands touched by terrorism is tangible, while the fear that grips the citizenry--the fear of the indiscriminate attack that can occur at any time--cannot be quantified. But its effect is all too real.  In the 1980's, Congress and the Reagan administration worked together to empower law enforcement with many tools to counter the men of terror. Last year, President Clinton urged a refocus on terrorism--and sought recommendations from the executive branch agencies on new tools that might be needed in the fight against terrorism.  Now, this bill includes a number of provisions to help in that fight. The bill expands the circumstances in which we can prosecute crimes committed overseas which affect our interests. It also prohibits persons in the United States from conspiring to commit terrorism overseas--and from raising funds for foreign terrorist organizations.  In addition, the bill implements the convention on the marking of plastic explosives for the purposes of detection. That convention was an international response to earlier terrorist bombings of aircraft, requiring manufacturers of plastic explosives to make them easier to detect.  The bill also expands the coverage of the existing statute involving transactions in nuclear materials, to cover materials from the dismantling of nuclear weapons in the former Soviet Union.  It also allows prosecutors to use the Federal RICO and money laundering statutes to attack terrorism, and fills gaps in current law by authorizing wiretaps for investigations of all terrorism offenses. Other more technical changes will also enhance the law enforcement response to terrorism.  Finally, the bill includes a new Federal terrorism offense, with stiff penalties--including a new death penalty for terrorist murders. This is an important, an appropriate, new Federal offense.  The expansion of Federal jurisdiction has been a contested issue in recent years. I have long opposed broad assertions of Federal jurisdiction over offenses which are more appropriately prosecuted in State courts. But, in my view, international terrorism requires a Federal response.  As expressed in its letter transmitting the legislation to the Congress, the administration stated that it intends that section 101 confer Federal jurisdiction only over acts of violence that are, indeed, international terrorism offenses.  I strongly support that intent, but I believe the language of section 101 could be improved to better reflect that intent. The administration has agreed to work with the Congress to make modifications to the legislative language to further that goal.  I must also point out that the bill includes one provision which I strongly oppose in its current form. That is the provision which allows secret evidence to be used in a deportation proceeding against an immigrant--even a legal permanent resident--who is alleged to be a terrorist.  Under current law, any person who is not a citizen--including legal immigrants--is deportable if the person is engaged in terrorist activities, even without a criminal conviction.  This bill would create a new and, in my view, troubling court procedure which would allow the Government to deport an immigrant based on secret evidence, on evidence unknown to the immigrant or his counsel.  The right to see and confront the evidence against oneself is a fundamental premise of the due process clause of the Constitution.  The Supreme Court has held that the due process clause applies to aliens in the United States, and that it applies to deportation proceedings.  Deportation can be a dramatic step. This procedure could be used, for instance, against a legal permanent resident who has lived in the United States with all of his family for 40 or more years.  Deportation could mean separation from family, and could mean removal to a country in which the person has never before lived, since a person is not always deported to the person's country of citizenship.  The use of secret information is unprecedented. Even in other cases where sensitive information is involved, the Government is required to give a defendant a summary of the evidence to be used against him.  The use of secret evidence raises fundamental questions about the accuracy of any determinations made using that procedure. Our system of justice is an adversarial one. It assumes that by allowing defendants to see and challenge the evidence against them, the reliability and truthfulness of that information can be evaluated.  That is what cross-examination is all about--to test the reliability and biases of the witness. That is why the defense is allowed to put on witnesses to rebut evidence presented by the prosecution. If a person does not know what evidence is being used against him, it is simply impossible to subject that evidence to the scrutiny our system requires.  I agree with the administration that we must have the ability to deport aliens involved in terrorist activities. I also agree that we must be able to safeguard classified information. But I am not convinced that nothing short of secret evidence can protect our security. Why, for example, can we not consider applying the Classified Information Procedures Act--a tried and tested process--to deportation proceedings, before we sanction in this country Kafkaesque procedures requiring people to defend against unknown and unseen evidence.  I have introduced this bill at the President's request. I support most of its provisions, as I am sure most Senators will. But as I have said, I will work to modify certain portions of the bill even as we move expeditiously to see it enacted into law.  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill and additional material be printed in the Record.  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in the Record, as follows:                                 S. 390       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of      the United States in Congress assembled,     SECTION 1.

FINDINGS AND PURPOSES.       (a) The Congress finds and declares--       (1) International terrorism remains a serious and deadly      problem which threatens the interests of the United States      both overseas and within its territory. States or      organizations that practice terrorism or actively support it      should not be allowed to do so without serious consequence;       (2) International terrorism directed against United States      interests must be confronted by the appropriate use of the      full array of tools available to the President, including      diplomatic, military, economic and prosecutive actions;       (3) The Nation's security interests are seriously impacted      by terrorist attacks carried out overseas against United      States Government facilities, officials and other American      citizens present in foreign countries;       (4) United States foreign policy interests are profoundly      affected by terrorist acts overseas especially those directed      against friendly foreign governments and their people and      those intended to undermine the peaceful resolution of      disputes in the Middle East and other troubled regions;       (5) Since the Iranian Revolution of 1979, the defeat of the      Soviet Union in Afghanistan, the peace initiative in the      Middle East, and the fall of communism throughout Eastern      Europe and the former Soviet Union, international terrorism      has become a more complex problem, with new alliances      emerging among terrorist organizations;       (6) Violent crime is a pervasive international problem and      is exacerbated by the free international movement of drugs,      firearms, explosives and individuals dedicated to performing      acts of international terrorism who travel using false or      fraudulent documentation;       (7) While international terrorists move freely from country      to country, ordinary citizens and foreign visitors often fear      to travel to or through certain parts of the world due to      concern about terrorist violence;       (8) In addition to the destruction of property and      devastation to human life, the occurrence of an international      terrorist event results in a decline of tourism and affects      the marketplace, thereby having an adverse impact on      interstate and foreign commerce and economies of friendly      nations;       (9) International terrorists, violating the sovereignty of      foreign countries, attack dissidents and former colleagues      living in foreign countries, including the United States;       (10) International terrorists, both inside and outside the      United States, carefully plan attacks and carry them out in      foreign countries against innocent victims;       (11) There are increasing intelligence indications of      networking between different international terrorist      organizations leading to their increased cooperation and      sharing of information and resources in areas of common      interest;       (12) In response, increased international coordination of      legal and enforcement issues is required, pursuant, for      example, to the numerous multilateral conventions in force      providing universal prosecutive jurisdiction over persons      involved in a variety of terrorist acts, including hostage      taking, murder of an internationally protected person, and      aircraft piracy and sabotage;       (13) Until recently, United States asylum processing      procedures have been complicated and often duplicative,      providing a powerful incentive for individuals, including      terrorists, without a genuine claim, to apply for asylum and      remain in the United States;       (14) The United States Constitution grants Congress the      power to establish a uniform rule of naturalization and to      make all laws necessary and proper thereto;       (15) Part of that power authorizes the Congress to      establish laws directly applicable to alien conduct within      the United States that harms the foreign relations, domestic      tranquility or national security of the United States;       (16) While the vast majority of aliens justify the trust      placed in them by United States immigration policies, a      dangerous few utilized access to the United States to carry      out their terrorist activity to the detriment of this      nation's national security and foreign policy interests.      Accordingly, international terrorist organizations have been      able to create significant infrastructures and cells in the      United States among aliens who are in this country either      temporarily or as permanent resident aliens;       (17) International terrorist organizations, acting through      affiliated groups and/or individuals, have been raising      significant funds within the United States, often through      misrepresentation of their purposes or subtle forms of      extortion, or using the United States as a conduit for      transferring funds among countries;       (18) The provision of funds to organizations that engage in      terrorism serves to facilitate their terrorist activities      regardless of whether the funds, in whole or in part, are      intended or claimed to be used for non-violent purposes;       (19) Certain foreign governments and international      terrorist organizations have directed their members or      sympathizers residing in the United States to take measures      in support of terrorist acts, either within or outside the      United States;       (20) Present federal law does not adequately reach all      terrorist activity likely to be engaged in by aliens within      the United States;       (21) Law enforcement officials have been hindered in using      current immigration law to deport alien terrorists because      the law fails to provide procedures to protect classified      intelligence sources and information. Moreover, a few high      ranking members of terrorist organizations have been      naturalized as United States citizens because denial of such      naturalizations would have necessitated public disclosure of      highly classified sources and methods. Furthermore,      deportation hearings frequently extend over several years,      thus hampering the expeditious removal of aliens engaging in      terrorist activity;       (22) Present immigration law is inadequate to protect the      United States from terrorist attacks by certain aliens. New      procedures are needed to permit expeditious removal of alien      terrorists from the United States, thereby reducing the      threat that such aliens pose to the national security and      other vital interests of the United States;       (23) International terrorist organizations that have      infrastructure support within the United States are believed      to have been responsible for--       (A) conspiring in 1982 to bomb the Turkish Honorary      Consulate in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania;       (B) bombing the Marine barracks in Lebanon in 1983;       (C) holding Americans hostage in Lebanon from 1984-1991;       (D) hijacking in 1984 Kuwait Airlines Flight 221 during      which two American employees of the Agency for International      Development were murdered;       (E) hijacking in 1985 TWA Flight 847 during which a United      States Navy diver was murdered;       (F) murdering in 1985 an American tourist aboard the      Achille Lauro cruise liner;       (G) hijacking in 1985 Egypt Air Flight 648 during which one      American and one Israeli were killed;       (H) murdering in 1985 four members of the United States      Marine Corps in El Salvador;       (I) attacking in December 1985 the Rome and Vienna airports      resulting in the death of a young American girl;       (J) hijacking in 1986 Pan Am Flight 73 in Karachi,      Pakistan, in which 44 Americans were held hostage and two      were killed;       (K) conspiring in 1986 in New York City to bomb an Air      India aircraft;       (L) bombing in April 1988 the USO club in Naples, Italy,      killing one American servicewoman and injuring four American      servicemen;       (M) attacking in 1988 the Greek cruise ship ``City of      Poros'';       (N) bombing in 1988 Pan Am Flight 103 resulting in 270      deaths;       (O) bombing in 1989 UTA Flight 772 resulting in 171 deaths,      including seven Americans;       [[Page S2505]] (P) murdering in 1989 a United States Marine      Corps officer assigned to the United Nations Truce      Supervisory Organization in Lebanon;       (Q) downing in January 1991 a United States military      helicopter in El Salvador causing the death of a United      States military crewman as a result of the crash and      subsequently murdering its two surviving United States      military crewmen;       (R) bombing in February 1992 the United States Ambassador's      residence in Lima, Peru;       (S) bombing in February 1993 a cafe in Cairo, Egypt, which      wounded two United States citizens;       (T) bombing in February 1993 the World Trade Center in New      York City, resulting in six deaths;       (U) conspiring in the New York City area in 1993 to destroy      several government buildings and tunnels;       (V) wounding in October 1994 two United States citizens on      a crowded street in Jerusalem, Israel;       (W) kidnapping and subsequently murdering in October 1994 a      dual citizen of the United States and Israel; and       (X) numerous bombings and murders in Northern Ireland over      the past decade;       (24) Nuclear materials, including byproduct materials, can      be used to create radioactive dispersal devices which are      capable of causing serious bodily injury as well as      substantial damage to property and the environment;       (25) The potential use of nuclear materials, including      byproduct materials, enhances the threat posed by terrorist      activities and thereby has a greater effect on the security      interests of the United States;       (26) Due to the widespread hazards presented by the threat      of nuclear contamination, as well as nuclear bombs, the      United States has strong interest in assuring that persons      who are engaged in the illegal acquisition and use of nuclear      materials, including byproduct materials, are prosecuted for      their offenses;       (27) The threat that nuclear materials will be obtained and      used by terrorist and other criminal organizations has      increased substantially due to international developments in      the years since the enactment in 1982 of the legislation      which implemented the Convention on the Physicial Protection      of Nuclear Material, codified at 18 U.S.C. 831;       (28) The successful effort to obtain agreements from other      countries to dismantle and destroy nuclear weapons has      resulted in increased packaging and transportation of nuclear      materials, thereby creating more opportunities for their      unlawful diversion or theft;       (29) The illicit trafficking in the relatively more common,      commercially available and usable nuclear and byproduct      materials poses a potential to cause significant loss of life      and/or environmental damage;       (30) Reported trafficking incidents in the early 1990's      suggest that the individuals involved in trafficking these      materials from Eurasia and Eastern Europe frequently      conducted their black market sales within the Federal      Republic of Germany, the Baltic States, and to a lesser      extent in the Middle European countries;       (31) The international community has become increasingly      concerned over the illegal possession of nuclear and nuclear      byproducts materials;       (32) The potentially disastrous ramifications of increased      access by terrorists to nuclear and nuclear byproduct      materials pose such a significant future threat that the      United States must use all lawful methods available to combat      the illegal use of such materials;       (33) The United States has an interest in encouraging      United States corporations to do business in the countries      which comprised the former Soviet Union, as well as in other      developing democracies; protection of such corporations from      threats created by the unlawful use of nuclear materials is      important to encourage such business ventures, and to further      the foreign relations and commerce of the United States;       (34) The nature of nuclear contamination is such that it      may affect the health, environment, and property of United      States nationals even if the acts which constitute the      illegal activity occur outside the territory of the United      States, and are primarily directed toward non-nationals of      the United States;       (35) Plastic explosives were used by terrorists in the      bombings of Pan Am flight 103 in December 1988 and UTA flight      772 in September 1989;       (36) Plastic explosives currently can be used with little      likelihood of detection for acts of unlawful interference      with civil aviation, maritime navigation, and other modes of      transportation;       (37) The marking of plastic explosives for the purpose of      detection would contribute significantly to the prevention      and punishment of such unlawful acts; and       (38) In order to deter and detect the unlawful use of      plastic explosives, the Convention on the Marking of Plastic      Explosives for the Purpose of Detection, done at Montreal on      1 March 1991, requires each contracting State to adopt      appropriate measures to ensure that plastic explosives are      duly marked and controlled.       The Congress further finds:       (39) Such international terrorist offenses place innocent      lives in jeopardy, endanger national security, affect      domestic tranquility, and gravely impact on interstate and      foreign commerce;       (40) Such international terrorist offenses involve      international associations, communication, and mobility which      can often be addressed effectively only at the federal law      enforcement level;       (41) There previously has been no federal criminal statute      which provides a comprehensive basis for addressing acts of      international terrorism carried out within the United States;       (42) There previously has been no federal provision that      specifically prohibits fund raising within the United States      on behalf of international terrorist organizations;       (43) There previously has been no adequate procedure under      the immigration law that permits the expeditious removal of      resident and non-resident alien terrorists;       (44) There previously has been no federal criminal statute      which provides adequate protection to United States interests      from non-weapons grade, yet hazardous radioactive material,      and from the illegal diversion of nuclear materials which are      held for other than peaceful purposes;       (45) There previously has been no federal law that requires      the marking of plastic explosives to improve their      detectability; and       (46) Congress has the power under the interstate and      foreign commerce clause, and other provisions of the      Constitution, to enact the following measures against      international terrorism in order to help ensure the integrity      and safety of the Nation.       (b) The purposes of this Act are to provide:       (1) federal law enforcement the necessary tools and fullest      possible basis allowed under the Constitution of the United      States to address, pursuant to the rule of law, acts of      international terrorism occurring within the United States,      or directed against the United States or its nationals      anywhere in the world;       (2) the Federal Government the fullest possible basis,      consistent with the Constitution of the United States, to      prevent persons and organizations within the jurisdiction of      the United States from providing funds, directly or      indirectly, to organizations, including subordinate or      affiliated persons, designated by the President as engaging      in terrorism, unless authorized under this Act;       (3) procedures which, consistent with principles of      fundamental fairness, will allow the government to deport      resident and non-resident alien terrorists promptly without      compromising intelligence sources and methods;       (4) provide federal law enforcement the necessary tools and      fullest possible basis allowed under the Constitution of the      United States to combat the threat of nuclear contamination      and proliferation which may result from illegal possession      and use of radioactive materials; and       (5) fully implement the Convention on the Marking or      Plastic Explosives for the Purpose of Detection, done at      Montreal on 1 March 1991.             TITLE I--SUBSTANTIVE CRIMINAL LAW ENHANCEMENTS     SEC. 101. ACTS OF TERRORISM TRANSCENDING NATIONAL BOUNDARIES.

TITLE II--IMMIGRATION LAW IMPROVEMENTS     SEC. 201. ALIEN TERRORIST REMOVAL PROCEDURES.       (a) Findings and Purpose.--       (1) The Congress hereby finds that--       (A) international terrorism is a serious and deadly problem      which threatens the interests of this nation overseas and      within our territory;       (B) until recently, United States asylum processing      procedures have been complicated and often duplicative,      providing a powerful incentive for individuals, including      terrorists, without a genuine claim, to apply for asylum and      remain in the United States;       (C) while most aliens justify the trust placed in them by      our immigration policies, a dangerous few utilized access to      the United States to create significant infrastructures and      cells in the United States in order to carry out their      terrorist activity to the detriment of the nation's national      security and foreign policy interests;       (D) the bombing of the World Trade Center exemplifies the      danger posed to the United States and its citizens by alien      terrorists;       (E) similarly, some foreign terrorist organizations utilize      associated aliens within the United States to raise funds to      facilitate their overseas terrorist acts against U.S.      nationals as well as against foreign governments and their      citizens; and       (F) current immigration laws and procedures are not      effective in addressing the alien terrorist problem, as they      require the government to place sensitive intelligence      sources and methods at risk and allow the alien to remain      within the United States for the prolonged period necessary      to pursue a deportation action. Moreover, under the current      statutory framework a few high ranking members of terrorist      organizations have been naturalized as United States citizens      because denial of such naturalizations would have      necessitated public disclosure of highly classified sources      and methods.       (2) The purpose of this section is to provide procedures      which, consistent with principles of fundamental fairness,      will allow the government to deport alien terrorists promptly      without compromising intelligence sources and methods.       (b) Alien Removal Procedures.--The Immigration and      Nationality Act is amended--       (1) by adding at the end of the table of contents the      following:             ``TITLE V--ALIEN TERRORIST REMOVAL PROCEDURES.     ``Sec. 501. Applicability     ``Sec. 502. Special removal hearing     ``Sec. 503. Designation of judges     ``Sec. 504. Miscellaneous provisions''; and       (2) by adding at the end the following new title:             ``TITLE V--ALIEN TERRORIST REMOVAL PROCEDURES                            ``Applicability       ``Sec. 501. (a) The provisions of this title may be      followed in the discretion of the Department of Justice      whenever the Department of Justice has classified information      that an alien described in paragraph 4(B) of section 241(a),      as amended, is subject to deportation because of such      section. For purposes of this title, the terms `classified      information' and `national security' shall have the meaning      prescribed in section 1 of the Classified Information      Procedures Act, 18 U.S.C. App. III 1.       ``(b) Whenever an official of the Department of Justice      files, under section 502, an application with the court      established under section 503 for authorization to seek      removal pursuant to the provisions of this title, the alien's      rights regarding removal and expulsion shall be governed      solely by the provisions of this title. Except as they are      specifically referenced, no other provisions of the      Immigration and Nationality Act shall be applicable. An alien      subject to removal under these provisions shall have no right      of discovery of information derived from electronic      surveillance authorized under the Foreign Intelligence      Surveillance Act (50 U.S.C. 1801 et. seq.) or otherwise for      national security purposes. Nor shall such alien have the      right to seek suppression of evidence. Further, the      government is authorized to use, in the removal proceedings,      the fruits of electronic surveillance and/or unconsented      physical searches authorized under the Foreign Intelligence      Surveillance Act without regard to subsections 106(c), (e),      (f), (g), and (h) of that Act. The provisions and      requirements of section 3504 of title 18, United States Code,      shall not apply to procedures under this title.       ``(c) This title is enacted in response to findings of      Congress that aliens described in paragraph 4(B) of section      241(a), as amended, represent a unique threat to the security      of the United States. It is the intention of Congress that      such aliens be promptly removed from the United States      following--       ``(1) a judicial determination of probable cause to believe      that such person is such an alien; and       ``(2) a judicial determination pursuant to the provisions      of this title that an alien is removable on the grounds that      he or she is an alien described in paragraph 4(B) of section      241(a), as amended.     The Congress furthers intends that, other than as provided by      this title, such aliens shall not be given a deportation      hearing and are ineligible for any discretionary relief from      deportation or for relief under section 243(h).                       ``Special Removal Hearing       ``Sec. 502. (a) Whenever removal of an alien is sought      pursuant to the provisions of this title, a written      application upon oath or affirmation shall be submitted in      camera and ex parte to the court established under section      503 for an order authorizing such a procedure. Each      application shall require the approval of the Attorney      General or the Deputy Attorney General based upon his finding      that it satisfies the criteria and requirements of such      application as set forth in this title. Each application      shall include--       ``(1) the identity of the Department of Justice attorney      making the application;       ``(2) the approval of the Attorney General or the Deputy      Attorney General for the making of the application;       ``(3) the identity of the alien for whom authorization for      the special removal procedure is sought; and       [[Page S2508]] ``(4) a statement of the facts and      circumstances relied on by the Department of Justice to      establish that--       ``(A) the alien is an alien as described in paragraph 4(B)      of section 241(a), as amended, and is physically present in      the United States; and       ``(B) with respect to such alien, adherence to the      provisions of title II regarding the deportation of aliens      would pose a risk to the national security of the United      States.       ``(b)(1) The application shall be filed under seal with the      court established under section 503. The Attorney General may      take into custody any alien with respect to whom such an      application has been filed and, notwithstanding any other      provision of law, may retain such an alien in custody in      accordance with the procedures authorized by this title.       ``(2) An alien lawfully admitted for permanent residence      (hereafter referred to as resident alien) shall be entitled      to a release hearing before the judge assigned to the special      removal case pursuant to section 503(a). The resident alien      shall be granted release pending the special removal hearing,      upon such terms and conditions prescribed by the court      (including the posting of any monetary amount), if the alien      demonstrates to the court that the alien, if released, is not      likely to flee and that the alien's release will not endanger      national security or the safety of any person or the      community. The judge may consider classified information      submitted in camera and ex parte in making his determination.       ``(C) In accordance with the rules of the court established      under section 503, the judge shall consider the application      and may consider other information, including classified      information, presented under oath or affirmation at an in      camera and ex parte hearing on the application. A verbatim      record shall be maintained of such a hearing. The application      and any other evidence shall be considered by a single judge      of that court who shall enter an ex parte order as requested      if he finds, on the basis of the facts submitted in the      application and any other information provided by the      Department of Justice at the in camera and ex parte hearing,      there is probable cause to believe that--       ``(1) the alien who is the subject of the application has      been correctly identified and is an alien as described in      paragraph 4(B) of section 241(a), as amended; and       ``(2) adherence to the provisions of title II regarding the      deportation of the identified alien would pose a risk to the      national security of the United States.       ``(d) (1) In any case in which the application for the      order is denied, the judge shall prepare a written statement      of his reasons for the denial and the Department of Justice      may seek a review of the denial by the United States Court of      Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit by notice of      appeal which must be filed within 20 days. In such a case the      entire record of the proceeding shall be transmitted to the      Court of Appeals      under seal and the Court of Appeals shall hear the matter ex      parte.       ``(2) If the Department of Justice does not seek review,      the alien shall be released from custody, unless such alien      may be arrested and taken into custody pursuant to title II      as an alien subject to deportation, in which case such alien      shall be treated in accordance with the provisions of this      Act concerning the deportation of aliens.       ``(3) If the application for the order is denied because      the judge has not found probable cause to believe that the      alien who is the subject of the application has been      correctly identified or is an alien as described in paragraph      4(B) of section 241(a), as amended, and the Department of      Justice seeks review, the alien shall be released from      custody unless such alien may be arrested and taken into      custody pursuant to title II as an alien subject to      deportation, in which case such alien shall be treated in      accordance with the provisions of this Act concerning the      deportation of aliens simultaneously with the application of      this title.       ``(4) If the application for the order is denied because,      although the judge found probable cause to believe that the      alien who is the subject of the application has been      correctly identified and is an alien as described in      paragraph 4(B) of section 241(a), as amended, the judge has      found that there is not probable cause to believe that      adherence to the provisions of title II regarding the      deportation of the identified alien would pose a risk to the      national security of the United States, the judge shall      release the alien from custody subject to the least      restrictive condition or combination of conditions of release      described in section 3142(b) and (c)(1)(B)(i) through (xiv)      of title 18, United States Code, that will reasonably assure      the appearance of the alien at any future proceeding pursuant      to this title and will not endanger the safety of any other      person or the community; but if the judge finds no such      condition or combination of conditions the alien shall remain      in custody until the completion of any appeal authorized by      this title. The provisions of sections 3145 through 3148 of      title 18, United States Code, pertaining to review and appeal      of a release or detention order, penalties for failure to      appear, penalties for an offense committed while on release,      and sanctions for violation of a release condition shall      apply to an alien to whom the previous sentence applies and--       ``(A) for purposes of section 3145 of such title an appeal      shall be taken to the United States Court of Appeals for the      District of Columbia Circuit; and       ``(B) for purposes of section 3146 of such title the alien      shall be considered released in connection with a charge of      an offense punishable by life imprisonment.       ``(e)(1) In any case in which the application for the order      authorizing the special procedures of this title is approved,      the judge who granted the order shall consider each item of      classified information the Department of Justice proposes to      introduce in camera and ex parte at the special removal      hearing and shall order the introduction of such information      pursuant to subsection (j) if he determines the information      to be relevant. The Department of Justice shall prepare a      written summary of such classified information which does not      pose a risk to national security and the judge shall approve      the summary if he finds the summary is sufficient to inform      the alien of the general nature of the evidence that he is an      alien as described in paragraph 4(B) of section 241(a), as      amended, and to permit the alien to prepare a defense. The      Department of Justice shall cause to be delivered to the      alien a copy of the summary.       ``(2) If the written summary is not approved by the court,      the Department shall be afforded reasonable opportunity to      correct the deficiencies identified by the court and submit a      revised summary. Thereafter, if the written summary is not      approved by the court, the special removal hearing shall be      terminated unless the court issues a finding that--       ``(A) the continued presence of the alien in the United      States, or       ``(B) the provision of the required summary     would likely cause serious and irreparable harm to the      national security or death or serious bodily injury to any      person. If such finding is issued, the special removal      hearing shall continue, the Department of Justice shall cause      to be delivered to the alien a statement that no summary is      possible, and the classified information submitted in camera      and ex parte may be used pursuant to subsection (j).       ``(3) The Department of Justice may take an interlocutory      appeal to the United States Court of Appeals for the District      of Columbia Circuit of--       ``(A) any determination by the judge pursuant to paragraph      (1)--       ``(I) concerning whether an item of evidence may be      introduced in camera and ex parte; or       ``(II) concerning the contents of any summary of evidence      to be introduced in camera and ex parte prepared pursuant to      paragraph (1); or       ``(B) the refusal of the court to make the finding      permitted by paragraph (2);     In any interlocutory appeal taken pursuant to this paragraph,      the entire record, including any proposed order of the judge      or summary of evidence, shall be transmitted to the Court of      Appeals under seal and the matter shall be heard ex parte.      The Court of Appeals shall consider the appeal as      expeditiously as possible.       ``(f) In any case in which the application for the order is      approved, the special removal hearing authorized by this      section shall be conducted for the purpose of determining if      the alien to whom the order pertains should be removed from      the United States on the grounds that he is an alien as      described in paragraph 4(b) of section 241(a), as amended. In      accordance with subsection (e), the alien shall be given      reasonable notice of the nature of the charges against him      and a general account of the basis for the charges. The alien      shall be given notice, reasonable under all the      circumstances, of the time and place at which the hearing      will be held. The hearing shall be held as expeditiously as      possible.       ``(g) The special removal hearing shall be held before the      same judge who granted the order pursuant to subsection (e)      unless that judge is deemed unavailable due to illness or      disability by the chief judge of the court established      pursuant to section 503, or has died, in which case the chief      judge shall assign another judge to conduct the special      removal hearing. A decision by the chief judge pursuant to      the preceding sentence shall not be subject to review by      either the alien or the Department of Justice.       ``(h) The special removal hearing shall be open to the      public. The alien shall have a right to be present at such      hearing and to be represented by counsel. Any alien      financially unable to obtain counsel shall be entitled to      have counsel assigned to represent him. Such counsel shall be      appointed by the judge pursuant to the plan for furnishing      representation for any person financially unable to obtain      adequate representation for the district in which the hearing      is conducted, as provided for in section 3006A of title 18,      United States Code. All provisions of that section shall      apply and, for purposes of determining the maximum amount of      compensation, the matter shall be treated as if a felony was      charged. The alien may be called as a witness by the      Department of Justice. The alien shall have a right to      introduce evidence on his own behalf. Except as provided in      subsection (j), the alien shall have a reasonable opportunity      to examine the evidence against him and to cross-examine any      witness. A verbatim record of the proceedings and of all      testimony and evidence offered or produced at such a hearing      shall be kept. The decision of the judge shall be based only      on the evidence introduced at the hearing, including evidence      introduced under subsection (j).       ``(i) At any time prior to the conclusion of the special      removal hearing, either the alien or the Department of      Justice may request      [[Page S2509]] the judge to issue a subpoena for the presence      of a named witness (which subpoena may also command the      person to whom it is directed to produce books, papers,      documents, or other objects designated therein) upon a      satisfactory showing that the presence of the witness is      necessary for the determination of any material matter. Such      a request may be made ex parte except that the judge shall      inform the Department of Justice of any request for a      subpoena by the alien for a witness or material if compliance      with such a subpoena would reveal evidence or the source of      evidence which has been introduced, or which the Department      of Justice has received permission to introduce, in camera      and ex parte pursuant to subsection (j), and the Department      of Justice shall be given a reasonable opportunity to oppose      the issuance of such a subpoena. If an application for a      subpoena by the alien also makes a showing that the alien is      financially unable to pay for the attendance of a witness so      requested, the court may order the costs incurred by the      process and the fees of the witness so subpoenaed to be paid      for from funds appropriated for the enforcement of title II.      A subpoena under this subsection may be served anywhere in      the United States. A witness subpoenaed under this subsection      shall receive the same fees and expenses as a      witness subpoenaed in connection with a civil proceeding in      a court of the United States. Nothing in this subsection      is intended to allow an alien to have access to classified      information.       ``(j) When classified information has been summarized      pursuant to subsection (e)(1) or where a finding has been      made under subsection (e)(2) that no summary is possible,      classified information shall be introduced (either in writing      or through testimony) in camera and ex parte and neither the      alien nor the public shall be informed of such evidence or      its sources other than through reference to the summary      provided pursuant to subsection (e)(1). Notwithstanding the      previous sentence, the Department of Justice may, in its      discretion and, in the case of classified information, after      coordination with the originating agency, elect to introduce      such evidence in open session.       ``(k) Evidence introduced at the special removal hearing,      either in open session or in camera and ex parte, may, in the      discretion of the Department of Justice, include all or part      of the information presented under subsections (a) through      (c) used to obtain the order for the hearing under this      section.       ``(l) Following the receipt of evidence, the attorneys for      the Department of Justice and for the alien shall be given      fair opportunity to present argument as to whether the      evidence is sufficient to justify the removal of the alien.      The attorney for the Department of Justice shall open the      argument. The attorney for the alien shall be permitted to      reply. The attorney for the Department of Justice shall then      be permitted to reply in rebuttal. The judge may allow any      part of the argument that refers to evidence received in      camera and ex parte to be heard in camera and ex parte.       ``(m) The Department of Justice has the burden of showing      by clear and convincing evidence that the alien is subject to      removal because he is an alien as described in paragraph 4(B)      of subsection 241(a) of this Act (8 U.S.C. 1251(a)(4)(B)), as      amended. If the judge finds that the Department of Justice      has met this burden, the judge shall order the alien removed      and, if the alien is a resident alien who was released      pending the special removal hearing, order the Attorney      General to take the alien into custody.       ``(n)(1) At the time of rendering a decision as to whether      the alien shall be removed, the judge shall prepare a written      order containing a statement of facts found and conclusions      of law. Any portion of the order that would reveal the      substance or source of information received in camera and ex      parte pursuant to subsection (j) shall not be made available      to the alien or the public.       ``(2) The decision of the judge may be appealed by either      the alien or the Department of Justice to the United States      Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit by      notice of appeal which must be filed within 20 days, during      which time such order shall not be executed. In any case      appealed pursuant to this subsection, the entire record shall      be transmitted to the Court of Appeals and information      received pursuant to subsection (j), and any portion of the      judge's order that would reveal the substance or source of      such information shall be transmitted under seal. The Court      of Appeals shall consider the case as expeditiously as      possible.       ``(3) In an appeal to the Court of Appeals pursuant to      either subsection (d) or (e) of this section, the Court of      Appeals shall review questions of law de novo, but a prior      finding on any question of fact shall not be set aside unless      such finding was clearly erroneous.       ``(o) If the judge decides pursuant to subsection (n) that      the alien should not be removed, the alien shall be released      from custody unless such alien may be arrested and taken into      custody pursuant to title II of this Act as an alien subject      to deportation, in which case, for purposes of detention,      such alien may be treated in accordance with the provisions      of this Act concerning the deportation of aliens.       ``(p) Following a decision by the Court of Appeals pursuant      to either subsection (d) or (n), either the alien or the      Department of Justice may petition the Supreme Court for a      writ of certiorari. In any such case, any information      transmitted to the Court of Appeals under seal shall, if such      information is also submitted to the Supreme Court, be      transmitted under seal. Any order of removal shall not be      stayed pending disposition of a writ of certiorari except as      provided by the Court of Appeals or a Justice of the Supreme      Court.       ``(q) The Department of Justice retains the right to      dismiss a removal action at any stage of the proceeding.       ``(r) Nothing in this section shall prevent the United      States from seeking protective orders and/or asserting      privileges ordinarily available to the United States to      protect against the disclosure of classified      information, including the invocation of the military and      state secrets privileges.                        ``Designation of Judges       ``Sec. 503.

The Chief Justice      shall publicly designate one of the judges so appointed as      the chief judge. The chief judge shall promulgate rules to      facilitate the functioning of the court and shall be      responsible for assigning the consideration of cases to the      various judges.       ``(b) Proceedings under section 502 shall be conducted as      expeditiously as possible. The Chief Justice, in consultation      with the Attorney General, the Director of Central      Intelligence and other appropriate federal officials, shall,      consistent with the objectives of this title, provide for the      maintenance of appropriate security measures for applications      for ex parte orders to conduct the special removal hearings      authorized by section 502, the orders themselves, and      evidence received in camera and ex parte, and for such other      actions as are necessary to protect information concerning      matters before the court from harming the national security      of the United States.       ``(c) Each judge designated under this section shall serve      for a term of five years and shall be eligible for      redesignation, except that the four associate judges first      designated under subsection (a) shall be designated for terms      of from one to four years so that the term of one judge shall      expire each year.                       ``Miscellaneous Provisions       ``Sec. 504. (a)(1) Following a determination pursuant to      this title that an alien shall be removed, and after the      conclusion of any judicial review thereof, the Attorney      General may retain the alien in custody or, if the alien was      released pursuant to subsection 502(o), may return the alien      to custody, and shall cause the alien to be transported to      any country which the alien shall designate provided such      designation does not, in the judgment of the Attorney      General, in consultation with the Secretary of State, impair      the obligation of the United States under any treaty      (including a treaty pertaining to extradition) or otherwise      adversely affect the foreign policy of the United States.       ``(2) If the alien refuses to choose a country to which he      wishes to be transported, or if the Attorney General, in      consultation with the Secretary of State, determines that      removal of the alien to the country so selected would impair      a treaty obligation or adversely affect United States foreign      policy, the Attorney General shall cause the alien to be      transported to any country willing to receive such alien.       ``(3) Before an alien is transported out of the United      States pursuant to paragraph (1) or (2) or pursuant to an      order of exclusion because such alien is excludable under      paragraph 212(a)(3)(B) of this Act (8 U.S.C. 1182(a)(3)(B),      as amended, he shall be photographed and fingerprinted, and      shall be advised of the provisions of subsection 276(b) of      this Act (8 U.S.C. 1326(b)).       ``(4) If no country is willing to receive such an alien,      the Attorney General may, notwithstanding any other provision      of law, retain the alien in custody.

Any alien in      custody pursuant to this subsection shall be released from      custody solely at the discretion of the Attorney General and      subject to such conditions as the Attorney General shall deem      appropriate. The determinations and actions of the Attorney      General pursuant to this subsection shall not be subject to      judicial review, including application for a writ of habeas      corpus, except for a claim by the alien that continued      detention violates his rights under the Constitution.      Jurisdiction over any such challenge shall lie exclusively in      the United States Court of Appeals for the District of      Columbia Circuit.       ``(b)(1) Notwithstanding the provisions of subsection (a),      the Attorney General may hold in abeyance the removal of an      alien who has been ordered removed pursuant to this title to      allow the trial of such alien on any federal or State      criminal charge and the service of any sentence of      confinement resulting from such a trial.       ``(2) Pending the commencement of any service of a sentence      of confinement by an alien described in      paragraph (1), such an alien shall remain in the custody of      the Attorney General, unless the Attorney General      determines that temporary release of the      [[Page S2510]] alien to the custody of State authorities for      confinement in a State facility is appropriate and would not      endanger national security or public safety.       ``(3) Following the completion of a sentence of confinement      by an alien described in paragraph (1) or following the      completion of State criminal proceedings which do not result      in a sentence of confinement of an alien released to the      custody of State authorities pursuant to paragraph (2), such      an alien shall be returned to the custody of the Attorney      General who shall proceed to carry out the provisions of      subsection (a) concerning removal of the alien.       ``(c) For purposes of section 751 and 752 of title 18,      United States Code, an alien in the custody of the Attorney      General pursuant to this title shall be subject to the      penalties provided by those sections in relation to a person      committed to the custody of the Attorney General by virtue of      an arrest on a charge of felony.       ``(d)(1) An alien in the custody of the Attorney General      pursuant to this title shall be given reasonable opportunity      to communicate with and receive visits from members of his      family, and to contact, retain, and communicate with an      attorney.       ``(2) An alien in the custody of the Attorney General      pursuant to this title shall have the right to contact an      appropriate diplomatic or consular official of the alien's      country of citizenship or nationality or of any country      providing representation services therefore.

(c) Additional Amendments to INA.--(1) Subsection 106(b) of      the Immigration and Nationality Act (8 U.S.C. 1105a(b)) is      amended by adding at the end thereof the following sentence:      ``Jurisdiction to review an order entered pursuant to the      provisions of section 235(c) of this Act concerning an alien      excludable under paragraph 3(B) of subsection 212(a) (8      U.S.C. 1182(a)), as amended, shall rest exclusively in the      United States Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia      Circuit.''.       (2) Section 276(b) of the Immigration and Nationality Act      (8 U.S.C. 1326(b)) is amended by deleting the word ``or'' at      the end of subparagraph (b)(1), by replacing the period at      the end of subparagraph (b)(2) with a semicolon followed by      the word ``or'', and by adding at the end of paragraph (b)      the following subparagraph: ``(3) who has been excluded from      the United States pursuant to subsection 235(c) of this Act      (8 U.S.C. 1225(c)) because such alien was excludable under      paragraph 3(B) of subsection 212(a) thereof (8 U.S.C.      1182(a)(3)(B)), as amended, or who has been removed from the      United States pursuant to the provisions of title V of the      Immigration and Nationality Act, and who thereafter, without      the permission of the Attorney General, enters the United      States or attempts to do so shall be fined under title 18,      United States Code, and imprisoned for a period of ten years      which sentence shall not run concurrently with any other      sentence.''       (3) Section 106(a) of the Immigration and Nationality Act      (8 U.S.C. 1105a(a)) is amended by striking from the end of      subparagraph 9 the semicolon and the word ``and'' and      inserting a period in lieu thereof, and by striking      subparagraph 10.       (d) Effective Date.--The provisions of this Act shall be      effective upon enactment, and shall apply to all aliens      without regard to the date of entry or attempted entry into      the United States.

(a) Section 212(a)3)(B) of the Immigration and Nationality      Act (8 U.S.C. 1182(a)(3)(B)) is amended to read as follows:       ``(B) Terrorism Activities       ``(i) In general       Any alien who       ``(I) has engaged in a terrorism activity, or       ``(II) a consular officer or the Attorney General knows, or      has reason to believe, is likely to engage after entry in any      terrorism activity (as defined in clause (iii)),     is excludable.

The court      shall grant such a motion of the United States if it finds      that the redacted item, stipulation or summary will provide      the defendant with substantially the same ability to make his      defense as would disclosure of the specific classified      information.       ``(B) Taking of trial testimony.--During the examination of      a witness in any civil proceeding brought by the United      States under this section, the United States may object to      any question or line of inquiry that may require the witness      to disclose classified information not previously found to be      admissible. Following such an objection, the court shall take      suitable action to determine whether the response is      admissible and, in doing so, shall take precautions to guard      against the compromise of any classified information. Such      action may include permitting the United States to provide      the court, ex parte, with a proffer of the witness's response      to the question or line of inquiry, and requiring the      defendant to provide the court with a proffer of the nature      of the information he seeks to elicit.       ``(C) Appeal.--If the court enters an order denying relief      to the United States under this subsection, the United States      may take an immediate interlocutory appeal in accordance with      paragraph (3) of this subsection.       ``(3) Interlocutory appeal       ``(A) An interlocutory appeal by the United States shall      lie to a court of appeals from a decision or order of a      district court authorizing the disclosure of classified      information, imposing sanctions for nondisclosure of      classified information, or refusing a protective order sought      by the United States to prevent the disclosure of classified      information.       ``(B) An appeal taken pursuant to this section either      before or during trial shall be expedited by the court of      appeals.

TITLE IV--CONVENTION ON THE MARKING OF PLASTIC EXPLOSIVES     SEC. 401. SHORT TITLE.       This title may be cited as the ``Marking of Plastic      Explosives for Detection Act.''.       (a) Findings.--The Congress finds that--       (1) plastic explosives were used by terrorists in the      bombings of Pan Am flight 103 in December 1988 and UTA flight      772 in September 1989;       (2) plastic explosives can be used with little likelihood      of detection for acts of unlawful interference with civil      aviation, maritime navigation and other modes of      transportation;       (3) the criminal use of plastic explosives places innocent      lives in jeopardy, endangers national security, affects      domestic tranquility, and gravely affects interstate and      foreign commerce;       (4) the marking of plastic explosives for the purpose of      detection would contribute significantly to the prevention      and punishment of such unlawful acts; and       (5) for the purpose of deterring and detecting such      unlawful acts, the Convention on the Marking of Plastic      Explosives for the Purpose of Detection, Done at Montreal on      1 March 1991, requires each contracting State to adopt      appropriate measures to ensure that plastic explosives are      duly marked and controlled.       (b) Purpose.--The purpose of this Act is to fully implement      the Convention on the Marking of Plastic Explosives for the      Purpose of Detection, Done at Montreal on 1 March 1991.     SEC. 403. DEFINITIONS.

SEC. 404. REQUIREMENT OF DETECTION AGENTS FOR PLASTIC                    EXPLOSIVES.       Section 842 of title 18, United States Code, is amended by      adding after subsection (k) the following new subsections:       ``(l) It shall be unlawful for any person to manufacture      any plastic explosive which does not contain a detection      agent.       ``(m)(1) It shall be unlawful for any person to import or      bring into the United States, or export from the United      States, any plastic explosive which does not contain a      detection agent.       ``(2) This subsection does not apply to the importation or      bringing into the United States, or the exportation from the      United States, of any plastic explosive which was imported,      brought into, or manufactured in the United States prior to      the effective date of the Marketing of Plastic Explosives for      Detection Act by or on behalf of any agency of the United      States performing military or police functions (including any      military reserve component) or by or on behalf of the      National Guard of any State, not later than 15 years after      the date of entry into force of the Convention on the Marking      of Plastic Explosives, with respect to the United States.       ``(n)(1) It shall be unlawful for any person to ship,      transport, transfer, receive, or possess any plastic      explosive which does not contain a detection agent.       ``(2) This subsection does not apply to--       ``(A) the shipment, transportation, transfer, receipt, or      possession of any plastic explosive, which was imported,      brought into, or manufactured in the United States prior to      the effective date of this Act by any person during a period      not exceeding three years after the effective date of this      Act; or       ``(B) the shipment, transportation, transfer, receipt, or      possession of any plastic explosive, which was imported,      brought into, or manufactured in the United States prior to      the effective date of this Act by or on behalf of any agency      of the United States performing a military or police function      (including any military reserve component) or by or on behalf      of the National Guard of any State, not later than 15 years      after the date of entry into force of the Convention on the      Marking of Plastic Explosives, with respect to the United      States.       ``(o) It shall be unlawful for any person, other than an      agency of the United States (including any military reserve      component) or the National Guard of any State, possessing any      plastic explosive on the effective date of this Act, to fail      to report to the Secretary within 120 days from the effective      date of this Act the quantity of such explosives possessed,      the manufacturer or importer, any marks of identification on      such explosives, and such other information as the Secretary      may by regulations prescribe.''.

SEC. 406. EXCEPTIONS.       Section 845 of title 18, United States Code, is amended--       (1) in subsection (a), by inserting ``(l), (m), (n), or (o)      of section 842 and subsections'' after ``subsections'';       (2) by adding at the end of subsection (a)(1) ``and which      pertains to safety''; and       (3) by adding at the end the following new subsection:       ``(c) It is an affirmative defense against any proceeding      involving sections 842 (l) through (o) if the proponent      proves by a preponderance of the evidence that the plastic      explosive--       ``(1) consisted of a small amount of plastic explosive      intended for and utilized solely in lawful--       ``(A) research, development, or testing of new or modified      explosive materials;       ``(B) training in explosives detection or development or      testing of explosives detection equipment; or       ``(C) forensic science purposes; or       ``(2) was plastic explosive which, within three years after      the date of entry into force of the Convention on the Marking      of Plastic Explosives, with respect to the United States,      will be or is incorporated in a military device within the      territory of the United States and remains an integral part      of such military device, or is intended to be, or is      incorporated in, and remains an integral part of a military      device that is intended to become, or has become, the      property of any agency of the United States performing      military or police functions (including any military reserve      component) or the National Guard of any State, wherever such      device is located. For purposes of this subsection, the term      `military device' includes, but is not restricted to, shells,      bombs, projectiles, mines, missiles, rockets, shaped charges,      grenades, perforators, and similar devices lawfully      manufactured exclusively for military or police purposes.''.

TITLE V--NUCLEAR MATERIALS     SEC. 501. EXPANSION OF NUCLEAR MATERIALS PROHIBITIONS.       (a)(1) Findings.--The Congress finds and declares--       (A) Nuclear materials, including byproduct materials, can      be used to create radioactive dispersal devices which are      capable of causing serious bodily injury as well as      substantial damage to property and the environment;       (B) The potential use of nuclear materials, including      byproduct materials, enhances the threat posed by terrorist      activities and thereby has a greater effect on the security      interests of the United States;       (C) Due to the widespread hazards presented by the threat      of nuclear contamination, as well as nuclear bombs, the      United States has a strong interest in assuring that persons      who are engaged in the illegal acquisition and use of nuclear      materials, including byproduct materials, are prosecuted for      their offenses;       (D) The threat that nuclear materials will be obtained and      used by terrorist and other criminal organizations has      increased substantially since the enactment in 1982 of the      legislation which implemented the Convention on the Physical      Protection of Nuclear Material, codified at 18 U.S.C. 831;       (E) The successful efforts to obtain agreements from other      countries to dismantle nuclear weapons have resulted in      increased packaging and transportation of nuclear materials,      thereby decreasing the security of such materials by      increasing the opportunity for unlawful diversion and theft;       (F) The illicit trafficking in the relatively more common,      commercially available and useable nuclear and byproduct      materials poses a potential to cause significant loss of life      and/or environmental damage;       (G) Reported trafficking incidents in the early 1990's      suggest that the individuals involved in trafficking these      materials from Eurasia and Eastern Europe frequently      conducted their black market sales of      these materials within the Federal Republic of Germany, the      Baltic States, and to a lesser extent in the Middle      European countries;       (H) The international community has become increasingly      concerned over the illegal possession of nuclear and nuclear      byproduct materials;       (I) The potentially disastrous ramifications of increased      access to nuclear and nuclear byproduct materials pose such a      significant future threat that the United States must use all      lawful methods available to combat the illegal use of such      materials;       (J) The United States has an interest in encouraging United      States corporations to do business in the countries which      comprised the former Soviet Union, as well as in other      developing democracies; protection of such U.S. corporations      from threats created by the unlawful use of nuclear materials      is important to the success of the effort to encourage such      business ventures, and to further the foreign relations and      commerce of the United States;       (K) The nature of nuclear contamination is such that it may      affect the health, environment, and property of U.S.      nationals even if the acts which constitute the illegal      activity occur outside the territory of the United States,      and are primarily directed toward non-U.S. nationals; and       (L) There is presently no federal criminal statute which      provides adequate protection to United States interests from      non-weapons grade, yet hazardous radioactive material, and      from the illegal diversion of nuclear materials which are      held for other than peaceful purposes.       (2) Purpose.--The purpose of the Act is to provide federal      law enforcement the necessary tools and fullest possible      basis allowed under the Constitution of the United States to      combat the threat of nuclear contamination and proliferation      which may result from illegal possession and use of      radioactive materials.       (b) Expansion of Scope and Jurisdictional Bases.--Section      831 of title 18, United States Code, is amended by--       (1) in subsection (a), striking ``nuclear material'' each      time it appears and inserting each time ``nuclear material or      nuclear byproduct material'';       (2) in subsection (a)(1)(A), inserting ``or the      environment'' after ``property'';       (3) amending subsection (a)(1)(B) to read as follows:       ``(B)(i) circumstances exist which are likely to cause the      death of or serious bodily injury to any person or      substantial damage to property or the environment; or (ii)      such circumstances are represented to the defendant to      exist;'';       (4) in subsection (a)(6), inserting ``or the environment''      after ``property'';       (5) amending subsection (c)(2) to read as follows:       ``(2) an offender or a victim is a national of the United      States or a United States corporation or other legal      entity;'';       (6) in subsection (c)(3), striking ``at the time of the      offense the nuclear material is in use, storage, or      transport, for peaceful purposes, and'';       (7) striking ``or'' at the end of subsection (c)(3);       (8) in subsection (c)(4), striking ``nuclear material for      peaceful purposes'' and inserting ``nuclear material or      nuclear byproduct material'';       (9) striking the period at the end of subsection (c)(4) and      inserting ``; or'';       (10) adding at the end of subsection (c) a new paragraph as      follows:       ``(5) the governmental entity under subsection (a)(5) is      the United States or the threat under subsection (a)(6) is      directed at the United States.'';       (11) in subsection (f)(1)(A), striking ``with an isotopic      concentration not in excess of 80 percent plutonium 238'';       (12) inserting at the beginning of subsection (f)(1)(C)      ``enriched uranium, defined as'';       (13) redesignating subsections (f)(2)-(4) as (f)(3)-(5);       (14) inserting after subsection (f)(1) the following new      paragraph:       ``(2) the term `nuclear byproduct material' means any      material containing any radioactive isotope created through      an irradiation process in the operation of a nuclear reactor      or accelerator;'';       (15) striking ``and'' at the end of subsection (f)(4), as      redesignated;       (16) striking the period at the end of subsection (f)(5),      as redesignated, and inserting a semicolon; and       (17) adding at the end of subsection (f) the following new      paragraphs:       ``(6) the term `national of the United States' has the      meaning prescribed in section 101(a) (22) of the Immigration      and Nationality Act (8 U.S.C. 1101(a)(22)); and       ``(7) the term `United States corporation or other legal      entity' means any corporation or other entity organized under      the laws of the United States or any State, district,      commonwealth, territory or possession of the United      States.''.

TITLE VII--ANTITERRORISM ASSISTANCE     SEC. 701. FINDINGS.       Congress finds that in order to improve the effectiveness      and cost efficiency of the Antiterrorism Training Assistance      Program, which is administered and coordinated by the      Department of State to increase the antiterrorism      capabilities of friendly countries, more flexibility is      needed in providing trainers and courses overseas and to      provide personnel needed to enhance the administration and      evaluation of the courses.     SEC. 702. ANTITERRORISM ASSISTANCE AMENDMENTS.       Section 573 of chapter 8 (relating to antiterrorism      assistance), of the Foreign Assistance Act of 1961 (22 U.S.C.      2349aa2) is amended by:       (1) striking ``30 days'' in subsection (d)(1)(A) and      inserting in lieu thereof ``180 days'';       (2) striking the ``add'' after subsection (d)(1)(B);       (3) striking subsection (d)(1)(B);       (4) inserting ``and'' after subsection (d)(1)(A);       [[Page S2516]] (5) redesignating subsection (d)(1)(C) as      subsection (d)(1)(B);       (6) amending subsection (d)(2) to read as follows:       ``(2) Personnel of the United States Government authorized      to advise foreign countries on antiterrorism matters shall      carry out their responsibilities within the United States      when determined most effective or outside the United States      for periods not to exceed 180 consecutive calendar days.'';      and       (7) striking subsection (f).                                                                    ____                      Section-by-Section Analysis                               Section 1.       Section 1 states that the short title for the Act is ``The      Omnibus Counterterrorism Act of 1995.''                               Section 2.       Section 2 provides a Table of Contents for the Act.                               Section 3.       Section 3 sets forth the congressional findings and      purposes for the Act.                              Section 101.       The purpose of section 101 is to provide a more certain and      comprehensive basis for the Federal Government to respond to      future acts of international terrorism carried out within the      United States. The section creates an overarching statute      (proposed 18 U.S.C. 2332b) which would allow the government      to incorporate for purposes of a federal prosecution any      applicable federal or state criminal statute violated by the      terrorist act, so long as the government can establish any      one of a variety of jurisdictional bases delineated in      proposed subsection 2332b(c).       Subsection 101(a) creates a new offense, 18 U.S.C. 2332b,      entitled ``Acts of Terrorism Transcending National      Boundaries.'' This statute is aimed at those terrorist acts      that take place within the United States but which are in      some fashion or degree instigated, commanded, or facilitated      from outside the United States. It does not encompass acts of      street crime or domestic terrorism which are in no way      connected to overseas sources.       Subsection 2332b(a) sets forth the particular findings and      purposes for the provision.       Subsection 2332b(b) sets forth the prohibited acts which      relate to the killing, kidnapping, maiming, assault causing      serious bodily injury, or assault with a dangerous weapon of      any individual (U.S. national or alien) within the United      States. It also covers destruction or damage to any      structure, conveyance of other real or personal property      within the United States. These are the types of violent      actions that terrorist most often undertake. The provision      encompasses any such activity which is in violation of the      laws of the United States or any States, provided a federal      jurisdictional nexus is present.       Subsection 2332b(c) sets forth the jurisdictional bases.      Except for subsections (c) (6) and (7), these bases are a      compilation of jurisdictional elements which are presently      utilized in federal statutes and which have been approved by      the courts.       Paragraph (1) covers the situation where the offender      travels in commerce. Cf. 18 U.S.C. 1952.       Paragraph (2) covers the situation where the mails or a      facility utilized in any manner in commerce is used to      further the commission of the offense or to effectuate an      escape therefrom. Cf. 18 U.S.C. 1951.       Paragraph (3) covers the situation where the results of      illegal conduct affect commerce. Cf. 18 U.S.C. 1365(c).       Paragraph (4) covers the situation where the victim is a      federal official. Cf. 18 U.S.C. 115, 1114, 351, 1751. The      language includes both civilians and military personnel.      Moreover, it also covers any ``agent'' of a federal agency.      Cf. 18 U.S.C. 1114 (i.e., assisting agent of customs or      internal revenue) and 1121. It covers all ranches of      government, including members of the military services, as      well as all independent agencies of the United States.       Paragraph (5) covers property used in commerce (cf. 18      U.S.C. 844(i)), owned by the United States (cf. 18 U.S.C.      1361), owned by an institution receiving federal financial      assistance (cf. 18 U.S.C. 844(f)) or insured by the federal      government (cf. 18 U.S.C. 2113).       Paragraph (6) provides a jurisdictional base which has not      been tested. It should, however, fall with the federal      government's commerce power. It is included to avoid the      construction, given to many federal interstate commerce      statutes, that a ``commercial'' aspect is required. Paragraph      (6) would cover both business and personal travel.       Paragraph (7) covers situations where the victim or      perpetrator is not a national of the United States. The      victimization of an alien in a terrorist attack has the      potential of affecting the relations of the United States      with the country of criminal jurisdiction on the involvement      of an alien as the perpetrator or victim. E.q., see 18 U.S.C.      1203 and 1116. In addition, aliens are a special      responsibility of the federal government, as it is involved      in admitting aliens, establishing the conditions for their      presence, adjusting them to resident alien status, deporting      aliens for violating the immigration laws, and eventually      naturalizing aliens as citizens.       Paragraphs (8) and (9) cover the territorial seas of the      United States and other places within the special maritime      and territorial jurisdiction of the United States that are      located within the United States (cf. 18 U.S.C. 7).       Jurisdiction exists over the prohibited activity if at      least one of the jurisdictional elements is applicable to one      perpetrator. When jurisdiction exists for one perpetrator, it      exists over all perpetrators even those who were never within      the United States.       Subsection (d) sets forth stringent penalties. These      penalties are mandatorily consecutive to any other term of      imprisonment which the defendant might receive. Consecutive      sentences for ``identical'' offenses brought in the same      prosecution are constitutionally permissible. See Missouri v.      Hunter, 459 U.S. 359, 367 (1983). However, there is no      statutory mandatory minimum. The court is given the      discretion to decide the penalty for this offense under the      sentencing guidelines.       Subsection (e) limits the prosecutorial discretion of the      Attorney General. Before an indictment is sought under      section 2332b, the Attorney General, or the highest ranking      subordinate of the Attorney General with responsibility for      criminal prosecutions, must certify that in his or her      judgment the violation of section 2332b, or the activity      preparatory to its commission, transcended national      boundaries. This means that the Attorney General must      conclude that some connection exists between the activities      and some person or entity outside the United States.       Moreover, the certification must find that the offense      appears to have been intended to coerce, intimidate, or      retaliate against a government or civilian population. This      is similar to the certification requirement for ``terrorism''      found in 18 U.S.C. 2332(d). The term ``civilian population''      includes any segment thereof and, accordingly, is consistent      with the Congressionally intended scope of section 2332(d).      The certification requirement ensures that the statute will      only be used against terrorists with overseas connections.      Section 2332b is not aimed at purely domestic terrorism or      against normal street crime as current law, both federal and      state, appears to adequately address these areas. The      certification of the Attorney General is not an element of      the offense and, except for verification that the      determination was made by an authorized official, is not      subject to judicial review.       Subsection (f) states that the Attorney General shall      investigate this offense and may request assistance from any      other federal, state, or local agency including the military      services. This latter provision, also found in several other      statutes, see e.g., 18 U.S.C. 351(g) and 1751(i), is intended      to overcome the restrictions of the posse comitatus statute,      18 U.S.C. 1385. It is not intended to give intelligence      agencies, such as the Central Intelligence Agency, any      mission that is prohibited by their charters.       Pursuant to 28 C.F.R. 0.85(a), the Attorney General      automatically delegates investigative responsibility over      this offense to the Director of the Federal Bureau of      Investigation (FBI). Moreover, under 28 C.F.R. 0.85(l) the      FBI has been designated as the lead federal law enforcement      agency responsible for criminal investigation of terrorism      within the United States. While local and state authorities      retain their investigative authority under their respective      laws, it is expected that in the event of major terrorist      crimes such agencies will cooperate, consult, coordinate and      work closely with the FBI, as occurred in the investigation      of the World Trade Center bombing in New York City.       Subsection (g) makes express two points which are normally      inferred by courts under similar statutes, namely, that no      defendant has to have knowledge of any jurisdictional base      and that only the elements of the state offense and not any      of its provisions pertaining to procedures or evidence are      adopted. Federal rules of evidence and procedure control any      case brought under section 2332b.       Subsection (h) makes it clear that there is      extraterritorial jurisdiction to reach defendants who were      involved in crimes but who never entered the United States.       Subsection (i) sets forth definitions, many of which      specifically incorporate definitions from elsewhere in the      federal code, e.g., the definition of ``territorial sea'' in      18 U.S.C. 2280(e).       Subsection 101(b) makes a technical amendment to the      chapter analysis for Chapter 113B of title 18, United States      Code.       Subsection 101(c) amends 18 U.S.C. 3286, which was created      by section 120001 of Pub. Law 103-322. Section 3286 is      designed to extend the period of limitation for a series of      enumerated terrorism offenses from five to eight years. The      wording of the section, however, gives rise to a potential      interpretation that, with respect to violations of the      enumerated offenses that are capital crimes, the same eight-     year period applies rather than the unlimited period that      previously applied and continues to apply to capital offenses      under 18 U.S.C. 3281. Section 3286's introductory language is      as follows:       ``Notwithstanding section 3282, no person shall be      prosecuted, tried, or punished for any offense involving a      violation of'' the enumerated provisions of law (emphasis      supplied).       It seems clear that Congress did not intend to reduce the      limitations period for offenses under the enumerated statutes      that are capital due to the killing of one or more victims.      Rather, the intent was (as the title of the section 120001      provision indicates) to enlarge the applicable limitation      period for non-capital violations of the listed offenses.      Accordingly, the proposed amendment would insert ``non-     capital'' after ``any'' in the above-quoted phrase. Notably,      the drafters      [[Page S2517]] were careful to include the word ``non-     capital'' when effecting a similar period of limitations      extension applicable to arson offenses under 18 U.S.C. 844(i)      in section 320917 of the Pub. L. 103-322.       Subsection 101(c) also corrects certain erroneous statutory      references in section 3286 (i.e., changes ``36'' to ``37'',      ``2331'' to ``2332'' and ``2339'' to ``2332a''). Finally, the      subsection adds to section 3286 the new 18 U.S.C. 2332b.       Subsection 101(d) amends section 3142(e) of title 18,      United States Code, to insure that a defendant arrested for a      violation of the new 18 U.S.C. 2332b is presumed to be      unreleasable pending trial. The factors, most likely to be      present i.e., an alien perpetrator who is likely to flee and      who is working on behalf of or in concert with a foreign      organization, makes such an individual unsuitable for release      pending trial. This presumption, which is subject to      rebuttal, will limit the degree of sensitive evidence that      the Government must disclose to sustain its burden to deny      release.       Subsection 101(e) amends the ``roving'' provision in the      wiretap statute (18 U.S.C. 2518(11)(b)(ii)) so that it can be      applied to violations of new 18 U.S.C. 2332b even in the      absence of a showing of intent to thwart detection. The      development of evidence of such intent could cause a delay      which, in the content of a section 2332b violation, could      have catastrophic consequences. Further, the secrecy and      clandestine movement of terrorists make it extremely      difficult to develop advance knowledge of which precise      telephones they will use.                              section 102.       Section 102 is designed to complement section 101 of this      bill concerning terrorist acts within the United States      transcending national boundaries. Just as a better basis for      addressing crimes carried out within the United States by      international terrorists is needed, it also is appropriate      that there should be an effective federal basis to reach      conspiracies undertaken in part within the United States for      the purpose of carrying out terrorist acts in foreign      countries.       Section 102 covers two areas of activity involving      international terrorists. The first is conspiracy in the      United      States to murder, kidnap, or maim a person outside of the      United States. The second is conspiracy in the United      States to destroy certain critical types of property, such      as public buildings and conveyances, in foreign countries.      The term conveyance would include cars, buses, trucks,      airplanes, trains, and vessels.       Subsection 102(a) amends current 18 U.S.C. 956 in several      ways. It creates a new subsection 956(a) which proscribes a      conspiracy in the United States to murder, maim, or kidnap a      person outside of the United States. The new section fills a      void in the law that exists. Currently, subsection 956(a)      only prohibits a conspiracy in the United States to commit      certain types of property crimes in a foreign country with      which the United States is at peace. It does not cover      conspiracy to commit crimes against the person.       Subsection 102(a) thus expands on the current section 956      so that new subsection 956(a) covers conspiracy to commit one      of the three listed serious crimes against any person in a      foreign country or in any place outside of the jurisdiction      of the United States, such as on the high seas. This type of      offense is committed by terrorists and the new subsection      956(a) is intended to ensure that the government is able to      punish those persons who use the United States as a base in      which to plot such a crime to be carried out outside the      jurisdiction of the United States.       New subsection 956(a) would apply to conspiracies to commit      one of the enumerated offenses where at least one of the      conspirators is inside the United States. The other member or      members of the conspiracy would not have to be in the United      States but at least one overt act in furtherance of the      conspiracy would have to be committed in the United States.      The subsection would apply, for example, to two individuals      who consummated an agreement to kill a person in a foreign      country where only one of the conspirators was in the United      States and the agreement was reached by telephone      conversations or letters, provided at least one of the overt      acts were undertaken by one co-conspirator while in the      United States. In such a case, the agreement would be reached      at least in part in the United States. The overt act may be      that of only one of the conspirators and need not itself be a      crime.       Subsection 102(a) also re-enacts current section 956(a) of      title 18 (dealing with a conspiracy in the United States to      destroy property in a foreign country) as subsection 956(b),      and expands its coverage to other forms of property. The      revision adds the terms ``airport' and ``airfield'' to the      list of ``public utilities'' presently set out in section      956(a), since they are particularly attractive targets for      terrorists. New subsection 956(b) also adds public      conveyances (e.g., buses), public structures, and any      religious, educational or cultural property to the list of      targets. This makes it clear that the statute covers a      conspiracy to destroy any conveyance on which people travel      and any structure where people assemble, such as a store,      factory or office building. It also covers property used for      purposes of tourism, education, religion or entertainment.      Accordingly, the words ``public utility'' do not limit the      statute's application to a conspiracy to destroy only such      public utility property as transportation lines or power      generating facilities.       Consequently, as amended, 18 U.S.C 956 reaches those      individuals who have conspired within the United States to      commit the violent offenses overseas and who solicit money in      the United States to facilitate their commission. Moreover,      monetary contributors who have knowledge of the conspiracy's      purpose are coconspirators subject to prosecution.       Subsection 102(a) also increases the penalties in current      18 U.S.C. 956(a). The new penalties are comparable to those      proposed in section 101 of the bill for the new 18 U.S.C.      2332b. Finally, subsection 102(a) eliminates the requirement      that is currently found in 18 U.S.C. 956(b) of naming in the      indictment the ``specific property'' which is being targeted,      as this requirement may be difficult to establish in the      context of a terrorism conspiracy which does not result in a      completed offense. Additionally, even in a completed      conspiracy, the parties may, after agreeing that a category      of property or person will be targeted, leave the actual      selection of the particular target to their conspirators on      the ground overseas. Hence, while an indictment must always      describe its purposes with specificity, it need not allege      all specific facts, especially those that were formulated at      a subsequent time or which may not be completely known to      some of the participants.       Section 956 is contained in chapter 45 of title 18, United      States Code, relating to interference with the foreign      relations of the United States. It is not intended to apply      to duly authorized actions undertaken on behalf of the United      States Government. Chapter 45 covers those individuals who,      without appropriate governmental authorization, engage in      prohibited conduct that is harmful to the foreign relations      of the United States.                              section 103       This section would correct a failure to execute fully our      treaty obligations and would, in addition, clarify and expand      federal jurisdiction over certain overseas acts of terrorism      affecting United States interests.       Subsection 103(a) would amend 49 U.S.C. 46502(b) (former      section 902(n) of the Federal Aviation Act of 1958, as      amended (49 U.S.C. App. 1472(n)). Section 46502(b) currently      covers those aircraft piracies that occur outside the      ``special aircraft jurisdiction of the United States,'' as      defined in 49 U.S.C. 46501(2). It, therefore, applies to      hijackings of foreign civil aircraft which never enter United      States airspace. As a State Party to the 1970 Hague      Convention for the Suppression of Unlawful Seizure of      Aircraft, the United States has a treaty obligation to      prosecute or extradite such offenders when they are found in      the United States. This measure is based on the universal      jurisdiction theory. See United States v. Yunis, 924 F.2d      1086 (D.C. Cir. 1991). However, the present statute fails to      make clear when federal criminal jurisdiction commences with      respect to such air piracies, absent the actual presence      within the United States of one of the perpetrators.       Paragraph (a)(1) would establish clear federal criminal      jurisdiction over those foreign aircraft hijackings where      United States nationals are victims or perpetrators. While      the Hague Convention does not mandate that State Parties      criminalize those situations involving their nationals as      victims or perpetrators, it does allow State Parties to      assert extraterritorial jurisdiction on the basis of the      passive personality principle. See Paragraph 3 of Article 4.      In addition, other recent international conventions dealing      with terrorism, such as the United Nations Convention Against      the Taking of Hostages and the International Maritime      Organization Convention for the Suppression of Unlawful Acts      Against the Safety of Maritime Navigation, mandate criminal      jurisdiction by a State Party when its national is a      perpetrator and permit the assertion of jurisdiction when its      national is a victim of an offense prohibited by those      conventions. Further, experience has shown that it is often      the country whose nationals were victims of the hijacking      which is willing to commit the necessary resources to locate,      prosecute, and incarcerate the perpetrators for a period of      time commensurate with their criminal acts. For those foreign      civil aircraft hijackings involving no United States      nationals as victims or perpetrators, section 46502 would      continue to carry out the U.S. obligation under the      Convention to prosecute or extradite an alien perpetrator who      was subsequently found in the United States.       Under the clarified statute, subject matter jurisdiction      over the offense would vest whenever a United States national      was on a hijacked flight or was the perpetrator of the      hijacking. Where a United States national is the perpetrator,      all perpetrators, including non-U.S. nationals, would be      subject to indictment for the offense, since these non-     national defendants would be either principals or aiders and      abettors within the meaning of 18 U.S.C. 2.       Paragraph (a)(2) amends 49 U.S.C. 46502(b)(2) to set forth      the three different subject matter jurisdictional bases. It      has the effect of repealing the current provision which      failed to fully execute our treaty obligation. Presently,      paragraph 46502(b)(2) reads: ``This subsection applies only      if the place of takeoff or landing of the aircraft on which      the individual commits the      offense is located outside the territory of the country of      registration of the aircraft.'' Paragraph (b)(2) was      intended to reflect paragraph 3 of Article 3 of the Hague      Convention, which      [[Page S2518]] states that the convention normally applies      ``only if the place of take-off or the place of actual      landing of the aircraft on which the offense is committed is      situated outside the territory of the State of registration      of that aircraft.'' However, the authors of the original      legislation apparently overlooked the obligation imposed by      paragraph 5 of Article 3 of the Convention which applies when      the alleged aircraft hijacker is found in the territory of a      State Party other than the State of registration of the      hijacked aircraft. Paragraph 5 states: ``Notwithstanding      paragraphs 3 and 4 of this Article, Article 6, 7, 8 and 10      shall apply whatever the place of take-off or the place of      actual landing of the aircraft, if the offender or the      alleged offender is found in the territory of a State other      than the State of registration of that aircraft.''       For example, under the Hague Convention, the hijacking of      an Air India flight that never left India is not initially      covered by the Convention. (Article 3, paragraph 3.) However,      the subsequent travel of the offender from India to the      jurisdiction of another State Party triggers treaty      obligations. Paragraph 5 makes the obligation of Article 7,      to either prosecute or extradite an alleged offender found in      a party's territory, applicable to a hijacker of a purely      domestic air flight who flees to another State.       Paragraph (a)(3) creates a new section 46502(b)(3) which      provides a definition of ``national of the United States''      that has been used in other terrorism provisions, see, e.g.,      18 U.S.C. 2331(2) and 3077(2)(A).       Subsection 103(b) amends section 32(b) of title 18, United      States Code. Presently, section 32(b) carries out the treaty      obligation of the United States, as a State Party to the      Montreal Convention for the Suppression of Unlawful Acts      Against the Safety of Civil Aviation, to prosecute or      extradite offenders found in the United States who have      engaged in certain acts of violence directed against foreign      civil aircraft located outside the United States. The      proposed amendment would fully retain current jurisdiction      and would establish additional jurisdiction where a United      States national was the perpetrator or a United States      national was on board such aircraft when the offense was      committed. Because subsection 32(b)(3) of title 18, United      States Code, covers the placement of destructive devices upon      such aircraft and a ``victim'' does not necessarily have to      be on board the aircraft at the time of such placement, the      phrase ``or would have been on board'' has been used. In such      instances, the prosecution would have to establish that a      United States national would have been on board a flight that      such aircraft would have undertaken if the destructive device      had not been placed thereon.       Subsection 103(b) is drafted in the same manner as      paragraph (a)(2), above, so that once subject matter      jurisdiction over the offense vests, all the perpetrators of      the offense are subject to indictment for the offense.       Subsections 103(c), (d), (e) and (f) would amend 18 U.S.C.      1116 (murder), 112 (assault), 878 (threats), and 1201      (kidnapping), respectively. The primary purpose of these      proposed amendments is to extend federal jurisdiction to      reach United States nationals, or those acting in concert      with such a national, who commit one of the specified      offenses against an internationally protected person located      outside of the United States. The invocation of such      jurisdiction under U.S. law is required by the Convention on      the Prevention and Punishment of Crimes Against      Internationally Protected Persons, including diplomatic      agents. It was apparently omitted as an oversight when the      implementing federal legislation was enacted in 1976 (P.L.      94-467).       Additionally, the provisions would also clarify existing      jurisdiction. The language used in the first sentence of      sections 1116(e), 112(e), 878(d), and 1201(e) is ambiguous as      pertains to instances in which the victim is a United States      diplomat. The first sentence in each of these provisions now      reads: ``If the victim of an offense under subsection (a) is      an internationally protected person, the United States may      exercise jurisdiction over the offense if the alleged      offender is present within the United States, irrespective of      the place where the offense was committed or the nationality      of the victim or the alleged offender.''       This sentence could be read to require the presence of the      offender in the United States even when the internationally      protected person injured overseas was a United States      diplomat. This would be anomalous and was likely not      intended. Accordingly, subsections (c)-(f) rewrite the first      sentence to read as follows:       ``If the victim of an offense under subsection (a) is an      internationally protected person outside the United States,      the United States may exercise jurisdiction over the offense      if (1) the victim is a representative, officer, employee, or      agent of the United States, (2) an offender is a national of      the United States, or (3) an offender is afterwards found in      the United States.''       The provision is drafted, in the same manner as the      aircraft piracy and aircraft destruction measures, so that      once subject matter jurisdiction over the offense is vested,      all the perpetrators of the offense would be subject to      indictment for the offense.       Subsections 103(c)-(f) also would incorporate in an      appropriate manner the definition of ``national of the United      States'' in sections 1116, 112, 878, and 1201 of title 18.       Subsection 103(g) contains an amendment similar in nature      to those in the preceding subsections. It expands federal      jurisdiction over extraterritorial offenses involving      violence at international airports under 18 U.S.C. 37. That      provision, enacted as section 60021 of Public law 103-322,      presently reachers such crimes committed outside the United      States only when the offender is later found in the United      States. There is, however, good reasons to provide for      federal jurisdiction over such terrorist crimes when an      offender or a victim is a United States national. In such      circumstances the interests of the United States are equal      to, if not greater than, the circumstance where neither the      victim nor the offender is necessarily a United States      national but the offender is subsequently found in this      country.       Subsection 103(h) adds the standard definition of the term      ``national of the United States'' to 18 U.S.C. 178. This term      is used earlier in the chapter (in 18 U.S.C. 175(a), which      provides for extraterritorial jurisdiction over crimes      involving biological weapons ``committed by or against a      national of the United States'') but no definition is      provided.                              section 201       In recent years, the Department of Justice has obtained      considerable evidence of involvement in terrorism by aliens      in the United States. Both legal aliens, such as lawful      permanent residents and aliens here on student visas, and      illegal aliens are known to have aided and to have received      instructions regarding terrorist acts from various      international terrorist groups. While many of these aliens      would be subject to deportation proceedings under the      Immigration and Nationality Act (INA), these proceedings      present serious difficulties in cases involving classified      information. Specifically, these procedures do not prevent      disclosure of classified information where such disclosure      would pose a risk to national security. Consequently, section      201 sets out a new title in the INA devoted exclusively to      the removal of aliens involved in terrorist activity where      classified information is used to sustain the grounds for      deportation.       The new title would create a special court, patterned after      the special court created under the Foreign Intelligence      Surveillance Act (50 U.S.C. 1801 et seq.). When the      Department of Justice believes that it has identified an      alien in the United States who has engaged in terrorist      activity, and that to afford such an alien a deportation      hearing would reveal classified national security      information, it could seek an ex parte order from the court.      The order would authorize a formal hearing, called a special      removal hearing, before the same court, at which the      Department of Justice would seek to prove by clear and      convincing evidence that the alien had in fact engaged in      terrorist activity. At the hearing, classified evidence could      be presented in camera      and not revealed to the alien or the public, although its      general nature would normally be summarized.       Enactment of section 201 would provide a valuable new tool      with which to combat aliens who use the United States as a      base from which to launch or fund terrorist attacks either on      U.S. citizens or on persons in other countries. It is a      carefully measured response to the menace posed by alien      terrorists and fully comports with and exceeds all      constitutional requirements applicable to aliens.       Subsection 201(a) sets out findings that aliens are      committing terrorist acts in the United States and against      United States citizens and interests and that the existing      provisions of the INA providing for the deportation of      criminal aliens are inadequate to deal with this threat.      These findings are in addition to the general findings      contained in section 3 of the bill. The findings explain that      these inadequacies arise primarily because the INA,      particularly in its requirements pertaining to deportation      hearings, may require disclosure of classified information.       The findings are important in explaining Congressional      intent and purpose. As noted above, section 201 creates an      entirely new type of hearing to determine whether aliens      believed to be terrorists should be removed from the United      States. At such a ``special removal hearing,'' the government      would be permitted to introduce in camera and ex parte      classified evidence that the alien has engaged in terrorist      activity. Such hearings would be held before Article III      judges. The in camera and ex parte portion of the hearing      would relate to classified information which, if provided to      the alien or otherwise made public, would pose a risk to      national security. Such an extraordinary type of hearing      would be invoked only in a very small percentage of      deportation cases, and would be applicable only in those      cases in which an Article III judge has found probable cause      to believe that the aliens in question are involved in      terrorist activity. Although the bill provides the alien many      rights equal to--and in some respects greater than--those      enjoyed by aliens in ordinary deportation proceedings, the      rights specified for aliens subject to a special removal      hearing are deemed exclusive of any rights otherwise afforded      under the INA.       It is within the power of Congress to provide for a special      adjudicatory proceeding and to specify the procedural rights      of aliens involved in terrorist acts. The Supreme Court has      noted that ``control over matters of immigration is a      sovereign prerogative, largely within the control of the      Executive and the Legislature. . . . The role of the      judiciary is limited to determining whether the procedures      meet the essential standard      [[Page S2519]] of fairness under the Due Process Clause and      does not extend to imposing procedures that merely displace      congressional choices of policy.'' Landon v. Plasencia, 459      U.S. 21, 34-35 (1982). Moreover, Congress can specify what      type of process is due different classes of aliens. ``(A)      host of constitutional and statutory provisions rest on the      premise that a legitimate distinction between citizens and      aliens may justify attributes and benefits for one class not      accorded to the other; and the class of aliens itself is a      heterogeneous multitude of persons with a wide-ranging      variety of ties to this country.'' Matthews v. Diaz, 426 U.S.      67, 78-79 (1976). Because the Due Process Clause does not      require ``that all aliens must be placed in a single      homogeneous legal classification,'' id., Congress can provide      separate processes and procedures for determining whether to      remove resident and non-nonresident alien terrorists.       Subsection 201(b) adds a new title V to the INA to provide      a special process for removing alien terrorists when      compliance with normal deportation procedures might adversely      affect national security interests of the United States.      However, the new title V is not the only way of expelling      alien terrorists from the United States. In addition to      proceedings under the new special removal provisions, aliens      falling within 8 U.S.C. 1251(a)(4)(B) alternatively could be      deported following a regular deportation hearing. Moreover,      like all other aliens, alien terrorists remain subject to      possible expulsion for any of the remaining deportation      grounds specified in section 241 of the Act (8 U.S.C. 1251).      For example, alien terrorists who violate the criminal laws      of the United States remain subject to ``ordinary''      deportation proceedings on charges under INA section      241(a)(2). The special removal provisions augment, without in      any narrowing, the prosecutorial options in cases of alien      terrorists.       The new title V consists of four new sections of the INA,      sections 501-504 (8 U.S.C. 1601-1604). Briefly, the title      provides for creation of a special court comprised of Article      III judges, patterned after the special court created under      the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act (50 U.S.C. 1801 et      seq.). When the Department of Justice believes it has      identified an alien terrorist, that is, an alien who falls      within 8 U.S.C. 1251(a)(4)(B), and determines that to      disclose the evidence of that fact to the alien or the public      would compromise national security, the Department may seek      an order from the special court. The order would authorize      the Department to present the classified portion of its      evidence that the alien is a terrorist in camera and ex parte      at a special removal hearing. The classified portion of the      evidence would be received in chambers with only the court      reporter, the counsel for the government, and the witness or      document present. The general nature of such evidence,      without identifying classified or sensitive particulars,      would than normally be revealed to the alien, his counsel,      and the public in summarized form. The summary would have to      be found by the court to be sufficient to permit the alien to      prepare a defense.       Where an adequate summary, as determined by the court,      would pose a risk to national security, and, hence,      unavailable to the alien, the special hearing would be      terminated unless the court found that (1) the continued      presence of the alien in the United States or (2) the      preparation of the adequate summary would likely cause      serious and irreparable harm to the national security or      death or serious bodily injury to any person. If such a      situation exits, the special removal hearing would continue,      the alien would not receive a summary, and the relevant      classified information could be introduced against the alien      pursuant to subsection (j).       If, at the conclusion of the hearing, the judge finds that      the government has established by clear and convincing      evidence that the alien has engaged in terrorist activity,      the judge would order the alien removed from the United      States. The alien could appeal the decision to the United      States Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit,      and ultimately could petition for a writ of certiorari to the      Supreme Court.       Use of information that is not made available to the alien      for reasons of national security is a well-established      concept in the existing provisions of the INA and immigration      regulations. For example, section 235(c) provides for an      expedited exclusion process for aliens excludable under 8      U.S.C. 1182(a)(3) (providing for the exclusion, inter alia,      of alien spies, saboteurs, and terrorists), and states in      relevant part:       ``If the Attorney General is satisfied that the alien is      excludable under [paragraph 212(a)(3)] on the basis of      information of a confidential nature, the disclosure of which      the Attorney General, in his discretion, and after      consultation with the appropriate security agencies of the      Government, concludes would be prejudicial to the public      interest, safety, or security, he may in his discretion order      such alien to be excluded and deported without any inquiry or      further inquiry by [an immigration judge].''       Thus, where it is necessary to protect sensitive      information, existing law authorizes the Attorney General to      conduct exclusion proceedings outside the ordinary      immigration court procedures and to rely on classified      information in ordering the exclusion of alien terrorists.       In the deportation context, 8 C.F.R. 242.17 (1990) provides      that in determining whether to grant discretionary relief to      an otherwise deportable alien, the immigration judge--       ``May consider and base his decision on information not      contained in the record and not made available for inspection      by the [alien], provided the Commissioner has determined that      such information is relevant and      is classified under Executive Order No. 12356 (47 FR 14874,      April 6, 1982) as requiring protection from unauthorized      disclosure in the interest of national security.''       The constitutionality of this provision has been upheld.      Suciu v. INS, 755 F.2d 127 (8th Cir. 1985). The alien in that      case had been in the United States for 16 years and had      become deportable for overstaying his student visa, a      deportation ground ordinarily susceptible to discretionary      relief. Nevertheless, the court held that it was proper to      deny the alien discretionary relief without disclosing to him      the reasons for the denial. Sucia followed the Supreme      Court's holding sustaining the constitutionality of a similar      predecessor regulation in Jay v. Boyd, 351 U.S. 345 (1956).                      Section 501 (Applicability)       Section 501 sets forth the applicability of the new title.      Section 501(a) states that the title may, but need not, be      employed by the Department of Justice whenever it has      information that an alien is subject to deportation because      he is an alien described in 8 U.S.C. 1251(a) (4)(B), that is,      because he has engaged in terrorist activity.       Section 501(b) provides that whenever an official of the      Department of Justice determines to seek the expulsion of an      alien terrorist under the special removal provisions, only      the provisions of the new title need be followed. This      ensures that such an alien will not be deemed to have any      additional rights under the other provisions of the INA.      Except when specifically referenced in the special removal      provisions, the remainder of the INA would be inapplicable.      For example, under the special removal provisions an alien      who has entered the United States (and thus is not      susceptible to exclusion proceedings) need not be given a      deportation hearing under section 242 of the Act, 8 U.S.C.      1252, and will not have available the rights generally      afforded aliens in deportation proceedings (e.g., the      opportunity for an alien out of status to correct his      status).       Section 501(c) states that Congress has enacted the title      upon finding that alien terrorists represent a unique threat      to the security interests of the United States. Consequently,      the subsection states Congress' specific intent that the      Attorney General be authorized to remove such aliens without      resort to a traditional deportation hearing, following an ex      parte judicial determination of probable cause to believe      they have engaged in terrorist activity and a further      judicial determination, following a modified adversarial      hearing, that the Department of Justice has established by      clear and convincing evidence that the aliens in fact have      engaged in terrorist activity.       Section 501(c) is designed to make clear that singling out      alien terrorists for a special type of hearing rather than      according them ordinary deportation hearings is a careful and      deliberate policy choice by a political branch of government.      This policy choice is grounded upon the legislative      determination that alien terrorists seriously threaten the      security interests of the United States and that the existing      process for adjudicating and effecting alien removal is      inadequate to meet this threat. In accordance with settled      Supreme Court precedent, such a choice is well within the      authority of the political branches of government to control      our relationship with and response to aliens.       For example, in Mathews v. Diaz, supra, the Court held that      Congress could constitutionally provide that only some aliens      were entitled to Medicare benefits. The Court held that it      was ``unquestionably reasonable for Congress to make an      alien's eligibility depend on both the character and duration      of his residence,'' and noted that the Court was ``especially      reluctant to question the exercise of congressional      judgment'' in matters of alien regulation. 426 U.S. at 83,      84; see Fiallo v. Bell, 430 U.S. 787, 792 (1977) (describing      the regulation of aliens as a political matter ``largely      immune from judicial control''). The specific findings and      reference to the intent in adopting the new provisions of      title V make clear the policy judgment that alien terrorists      should be treated as a separate class of aliens and that this      choice should not be disturbed by the courts.                 Section 502 (Special Removal Hearing)       Section 502 sets out the procedure for the special removal      hearing. Section 502(a) provides that whenever the Department      of Justice determines to use the special removal process it      must submit a written application to the special court      (established pursuant to section 503) for an order      authorizing such procedure. Each application must indicate      that the Attorney General or Deputy Attorney General has      approved its submission and must include the identity of the      Department attorney making the application, the identity of      the alien against whom removal proceedings are sought, and a      statement of the facts and circumstances relied upon by the      Department of Justice as justifying the belief that the      subject is an alien terrorist and that following normal      deportation procedures would pose a risk to the national      security of the United States.       Section 502(b) provides that applications for special      removal proceedings shall be filed under seal with the      special court established pursuant to section 503. At or      after the time the application is filed, the Attorney General      may take the subject alien into custody. The      [[Page S2520]] Attorney General's authority to retain the      alien in custody is governed by the provisions of new title V      which, as explained below, provide in certain circumstances      for the release of the alien.       Although title V does not require the Attorney General to      take the alien subject to special removal applications into      custody, it is expected that most such aliens will be      apprehended and confined. The Attorney General's decision      whether to take a non-resident alien into custody will not be      subject to judicial review. However, a resident alien is      entitled to a release hearing before the judge assigned by      the special court. The resident alien may be released upon      such terms and conditions prescribed by the court (including      the posting of any monetary amount), if the alien      demonstrates to the court that the alien, if released, is not      likely to flee and that the alien's release will not endanger      national security or the safety of any person or the      community. Subsequent provisions (section 504(a)) authorize      the Attorney General to retain custody of alien terrorists      who have been ordered removed until such aliens can be      physically delivered outside our borders.       Section 502(c) provides that special removal applications      shall be considered by a single Article III judge in      accordance with section 503. In each case, the judge shall      hold an ex parte hearing to receive and consider the written      information provided with the application and such other      evidence, whether documentary or testimonial in form, as the      Department of Justice may proffer. The judge shall grant an      ex parte order authorizing the special removal hearing as      provided under title V if the judge finds that, on the basis      of the information and evidence presented, there is probable      cause to believe that the subject of the application is an      alien who falls within the definition of alien terrorist and      that adherence to the ordinary deportation procedures would      pose a risk to national security.       Section 502(d)(1) provides that in any case in which a      special removal application is denied, the Department of      Justice within 20 days may appeal the denial to the United      States Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit.      In the event of a timely appeal, a confined alien may be      retained in custody. When the Department of Justice appeals      from the denial of a special removal application, the record      of proceedings will be transmitted to the Court of Appeals      under seal and the court will hear the appeal ex parte.      Subsequent provisions (section 502(p)) authorize the      Department of Justice to petition the Supreme Court for a      writ of certiorari from an adverse appellate judgment.       Section 502(d)(2) provides that if the Department of      Justice does not seek appellate review of the denial of a      special removal application, the subject alien must be      released from custody unless, as a deportable alien, the      alien may be arrested and taken into custody pursuant to      title II of the INA. Thus, for example, when the judge finds      that the special procedures of title V are unwarranted but      the alien is subject to deportation as an overstay or for      violation of status, the alien might be retained in custody      but such detention would be pursuant to and governed by the      provisions of title II.       Subsection 502(d)(3) provides that if a special removal      application is denied because the judge finds no probable      cause that the alien has engaged in terrorist activities, the      alien must be released from custody during the pendency of an      appeal by the government. However, section 502(d)(3) is      similar to section 502(d)(2) in that it provides for the      possibility of continued detention in the case of aliens who      otherwise are subject to deportation under title II of the      Act.       Section 502(d)(4) applies to cases in which the judge finds      probable cause that the subject of a special removal      application has been correctly identified as an alien      terrorist, but fails to find probable cause that use of the      special procedures are necessary for reasons of national      security, and the Department of Justice determines to appeal.      A finding that the alien has engaged in terrorist activity--a      ground for deportation that would support confinement under      title II of the Act--justifies retaining the alien in      custody. Nevertheless, section 502(d)(4) provides that the      judge must determine the question of custody based upon an      assessment of the risk of flight and the danger to the      community or individuals should the alien be released. The      judge shall release the alien subject to the least      restrictive condition(s) that will reasonably assure the      alien's appearance at future proceedings, should the      government prevail on its appeal, and will not endanger the      community or individual members thereof. The possible release      conditions are those authorized under the Bail Reform Act of      1984, 18 U.S.C. 3142(b) and (c), and range from release on      personal recognizance to release on execution of a bail bond      or release limited to certain places or periods of time. As      with the referenced provsions of the Bail Reform Act, the      judge may deny release altogether upon determining that no      condition(s) of release would assure the alien's future      appearance and community safety.       Section 502(e)(1) provides that in cases in which the      special removal application is approved, the judge must then      consider each piece of classified evidence that the      Department of Justice proposes to introduce in camera and ex      parte at the special removal hearing. The judge shall      authorize the in camera and ex parte introduction of any item      of classified evidence if such evidence is relevant to the      deportation charge.       Section 502(e)(1) also provides that with respect to any      evidence authorized to be introduced in camera and ex parte,      the judge must consider how the alien subject to the      proceedings is to be advised regarding such evidence. The      Department of Justice must prepare a summary of the      classified informaiton. The court must find the summary to be      sufficient to inform the alien of the general nature of the      evidence that he has engaged in terrorist activity, and to      permit the alien to prepare a defense. A summary, however,      ``shall not pose a risk to the national security.'' In      considering the summary to be provided to the alien of the      government's proffered evidence, it is intended that the      judge balance the alien's interest in having an opportunity      to hear and respond to the case against him against the      government's extraordinarily strong interest in protecting      the national security. The Department of Justice shall      provide the alien a copy of the court approved summary.       In situations where the court does not approve the proposed      summary, the Department of Justice can amend the summary to      meet specific concerns raised by the court. Subsection (e)(2)      provides that if such submission is still found unacceptable,      the special removal proceeding is to be terminated unless the      court finds that the continued presence of the alien in the      United States or the preparation of an adequate summary would      likely cause serious and irreparable harm to the national      security or death or serious bodily injury to any person. If      such a situation exists, the special removal hearing would      continue, the alien would be notified that no summary is      possible, and relevant classified information could be      introduced against the alien pursuant to subsection (j).       Section 502(e)(3) provides that, in certain situations, the      Department of Justice may take an interlocutory appeal to the      United States Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia      Circuit from the judge's rulings regarding the in camera and      ex parte admission and summarization of particular items of      evidence. Interlocutory appeal is authorized if the judge      rules that a piece of classified information may not be      introduced in camera and ex parte because it is not relevant;      or if the Department disagrees with the judge regarding the      wording of a summary (that is, if the Department believes      that the scope of summary required by the court will      compromise national security). Interlocutory appeal is also      authorized when the court refuses to make the finding      permitted by subsection (e)(2). Because the alien is to      remain in custody during such an appeal, the Court of Appeals      must hear the matter as expeditiously as possible. When the      Department appeals, the entire record must be transmitted to      the Court of Appeals under seal and the court shall hear the      matter ex parte.       Section 502(f) provides that in any case in which the      Department's application is approved, the court shall order a      special removal hearing for the purpose of determining      whether the alien in question has engaged in terrorist      activity. Subsection (f) provides that ``[i]n accordance with      subsection (e), the alien shall be given reasonable notice of      the nature of the charges against him and a general account      of the basis for the charges.'' This cross-reference is      intended to make clear that subsection (f) is not to be      construed as requiring that information be given to the alien      about the nature of the charges if such information would      reveal the matters that are to be introduced in camera. The      special removal hearing must be held as expeditiously as      possible.       Section 502(g) provides that the special removal hearing      shall be held before the same judge who approved the      Department of Justice's application unless the judge becomes      unavailable due to illness or disability.       Section 502(h) sets out the rights to be afforded to the      alien at the special removal hearing. The hearing shall be      open to the public, the alien shall have the right to be      represented by counsel (at government expense if he cannot      afford representation), and to introduce evidence in his own      behalf. Except as provided in section 502(j) regarding      presentation of evidence in camera and ex parte, the alien      also shall have a reasonable opportunity to examine the      evidence against him and to cross-examine adverse witnesses.      As in the case of administrative proceedings under the INA      and civil proceedings generally, the alien may be called as a      witness by the Department of Justice. A verbatim record of      the proceedings and of all evidence and testimony shall be      kept.       Section 502(i) provides that either the alien or the      government may request the issuance of a subpoena for      witnesses and documents. A subpoena request may be made ex      parte, except that the judge must inform the Department of      Justice where the subpoena sought by the alien threatens      disclosure of evidence of the source or evidence which the      Department of Justice has introduced or proffered for      introduction in camera and ex parte. In such cases, the      Department of Justice shall be given a reasonable opportunity      to oppose the issuance of a subpoena and, if necessary to      protect the confidentiality of the evidence or its source,      the judge may, in his discretion, hear such opposition in      camera. A subpoena under section 502(i) may be served      anywhere in the United States. Where the alien shows an      inability to pay for the appearance of a necessary witness,      the court may order the costs of the subpoena and witness fee      to be paid by the government from funds appropriated for the      enforcement of      [[Page S2521]] title II of the INA. Section 502(i) states      that it is not intended to allow the alien access to      classified information.       Section 502(j) provides that any evidence which has been      summarized pursuant to section 502(e)(1) may be introduced      into the record, in documentary or testimonial form, in      camera and ex parte. The section also permits the      introduction of relevant classified information if the court      has made the finding permitted by subsection (e)(2). While      the alien and members of the public would be aware that      evidence was being submitted in camera and ex parte, neither      the alien nor the public would be informed of the nature of      the evidence except as set out in section 502(e)(1). For      example, if the Department of Justice sought to present in      camera and ex parte evidence through live testimony, the      courtroom could be cleared of the alien, his counsel, and the      public while the      testimony is presented. Alternatively, the court might hear      the testimony in chambers attended by only the reporter,      the government's counsel, and the witness. In the case of      documentary evidence, sealed documents could be presented      to the court without examination by the alien or his      counsel (or access by the public).       While the Department of Justice does not have to present      evidence in camera and ex parte, even if it previously has      received authorization to do so, it is contemplated that      ordinarily much of the government's evidence (or at least the      crucial portions thereof) will be presented in this fashion      rather than in open court. The right to present evidence in      camera and ex parte will have been determined in the ex parte      proceedings before the court pursuant to subsections (a)      through (c) of section 502.       Section 502(k) provides that evidence introduced in open      session or in camera and ex parte may include all or part of      the information that was presented at the earlier ex parte      proceedings. If the evidence is to be introduced in camera      and ex parte, the attorney for the Department of Justice      could refer the judge to such evidence in the transcript of      the ex parte hearing and ask that it be considered as      evidence at the removal hearing itself. The Department might      present evidence in open court rather than in camera and ex      parte as a result of changed circumstances, for example,      where the source whose life was at risk had died before the      hearing or if the Department believes that a public      presentation of the evidence might have a deterrent effect on      other terrorists. In any event, once the Department of      Justice has received authorization to present evidence in      camera and ex parte, its decision whether to do so is purely      discretionary and is not subject to review at the time of the      special removal hearing. Of course, the disclosure of any      classified information requires appropriate consultation with      the originating agency.       Section 502(l) provides that following the introduction of      evidence, the attorney for the Department of Justice and the      attorney for the alien shall be given fair opportunity to      present argument as to whether the evidence is sufficient to      justify the alien's removal. At the judge's discretion, in      camera and ex parte argument by the Department of Justice      attorney may be heard regarding evidence received in camera      and ex parte.       Section 502(m) provides that the Department of Justice has      the burden of showing that the evidence is sufficient. This      burden is not satisfied unless the Department establishes by      clear and convincing evidence--the standard of proof      applicable in a deportation hearing--that the alien has      engaged in terrorist activity. If the judge finds that the      Department has met that burden, the judge must order the      alien removed. In cases in which the alien has been shown to      have engaged in terrorist activity, the judge has no      authority to decide that removal would be unwarranted. If the      alien was a resident alien granted release, the court is to      order the Attorney General to take the alien into custody.       Section 502(n)(1) provides that the judge must render his      decision as to the alien's removal in the form of a written      order. The order must state the facts found and the      conclusions of law reached, but shall not reveal the      substance of any evidence received in camera or ex parte.       Section 502(n)(2) provides that either the alien or the      Department of Justice may appeal the judge's decision to the      United States Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia      Circuit. Any such appeal must be filed within 20 days, and      during this period the order shall not be executed.      Information received in camera and ex parte at the special      removal hearing shall be transmitted to the Court of Appeals      under seal. The Court of Appeals must hear the appeal as      expeditiously as possible.       Section 502(n)(3) sets out the standard of review for      proceedings in the Court of Appeals. Questions of law are to      be reviewed de novo, but findings of fact may not be      overturned unless clearly erroneous. This is the usual      standard in civil cases.       Section 502(o) provides that in cases in which the judge      decides that the alien should not be removed, the alien must      be released from custody. There is an exception for aliens      who may be arrested and taken into custody pursuant to title      II of the INA as aliens subject to deportation. For such      aliens, the issues of release and/or circumstances of      continued detention would be governed by the pertinent      provisions of the INA.       Section 502(p) provides that following a decision by the      Court of Appeals, either the alien or the government may seek      a writ of certiorari in the Supreme Court. In such cases,      information submitted to the Court of Appeals under seal      shall, if transmitted to the Supreme Court, remain under      seal.       Section 502(q) sets forth the normal right the Government      has to dismiss a removal action at any stage of the      proceeding.       Section 502(r) acknowledges that the United States retains      it common law privileges.                  Section 503 (Designation of Judges)       Section 503 establishes the special court to consider      terrorist removal cases under section 502, patterned on the      special court created under the Foreign Intelligence      Surveillance Act, 50 U.S.C. 1801 et seq. Section 503(a)      provides that the court will consist of five federal district      court judges chosen by the Chief Justice of the United States      from five different judicial circuits. One of these judges      shall be designated as the chief or presiding judge. Should      the Chief Justice determine it appropriate, he could      designate as judges under this section some of those that he      has designated pursuant to section 1803(a) of title 50,      United States Code for the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance      Court. The presiding judge shall promulgate rules for the      functioning of the special court. The presiding judge also      shall be responsible for assigning cases to the various      judges. Section 503(c) provides that judges shall be      appointed to the special court for terms of five years,      except for the initial appointments the terms of which shall      vary from one to five years so that one new judge will be      appointed each year. Judges may be reappointed to the special      court.       Section 503(b) provides that all proceedings under section      502 are to be held as expeditiously as possible. Section      503(b) also provides that the Chief Justice, in consultation      with the Attorney General, the Director of Central      Intelligence and other appropriate officials, shall provide      for the maintenance of appropriate security measures to      protect the ex parte special removal applications, the orders      entered in response to such applications, and the evidence      received in camera and ex parte sufficient to prevent      disclosures which could compromise national security.                 Section 504 (Miscellaneous Provisions)       Section 504 contains the title's miscellaneous provisions.      Section 504(a) provides that following a final determination      that the alien terrorist should be removed (that is, after      the special removal hearing and completion of any appellate      review), the Attorney General may retain the alien in custody      (or if the alien was released, apprehend and place the alien      in custody) until he can be removed from the United States.      The alien is provided the right to choose the country to      which he will be removed, subject to the Attorney General's      authority, in consultation with the Secretary of State, to      designate another country if the alien's choice would impair      a United States treaty obligation (such as an obligation      under an extradition treaty) or would adversely affect the      foreign policy of the United States. If the alien does not      choose a country or if he chooses a country deemed      unacceptable, the Attorney General, in coordination with the      Secretary of State, must make efforts to find a country that      will take the alien. The alien may, at the attorney General's      discretion, be kept in custody until an appropriate country      can be found, and the Attorney General shall provide the      alien with a written report regarding such efforts at least      once every six months. The Attorney General's determinations      and actions regarding execution of the removal order are not      subject to direct or collateral judicial review, except for a      claim that continued detention violates the alien's      constitutional rights. The alien terrorist shall be      photographed      and fingerprinted and advised of the special penalty      provisions for unlawful return before he is removed from      the United States.       Section 504(b) provides that, notwithstanding section      504(a), the Attorney General may defer the actual removal of      the alien terrorist to allow the alien to face trial on any      State or federal criminal charge (whether or not related to      his terrorist activity) and, if convicted, to serve a      sentence of confinement. Section 504(b)(2) provides that      pending the service of a State or federal sentence of      confinement, the alien terrorist is to remain in the Attorney      General's custody unless the Attorney General determines that      the alien can be released to the custody of State authorities      for pretrial confinement in a State facility without      endangering national security or public safety. It is      intended that where the alien terrorist could possibly secure      pretrial release, the Attorney General shall not release the      alien to a State for pretrial confinement. Section 503(b)(3)      provides that if an alien terrorist released to State      authorities is subsequently to be released from state custody      because of an acquittal in the collateral trial, completion      of the alien's sentence of confinement, or otherwise, the      alien shall immediately be returned to the custody of the      Attorney General who shall then proceed to effect the alien's      removal from the United States.       Section 504(c) provides that for purposes of sections 751      and 752 of title 18 (punishing escape from confinement and      aiding such an escape), an alien in the Attorney General's      custody pursuant to this new title--whether awaiting or after      completion of a special removal hearing--shall be treated as      if in custody by virtue of a felony arrest. Accordingly,      escape by or aiding the escape of an      [[Page S2522]] alien terrorist will be punishable by      imprisonment for up to five years.       Section 504(d) provides that an alien in the Attorney      General's custody pursuant to this new title--whether      awaiting or after completion of a special removal hearing--     shall be given reasonable opportunity to receive visits from      relatives and friends and to consult with his attorney.      Determination of what is ``reasonable'' usually will follow      the ordinary rules of the facility in which the alien is      confined.       Section 504(d) also provides that when an alien is confined      pursuant to this new title, he shall have the right to      contact appropriate diplomatic or consular officers of his      country of citizenship or nationality. Moreover, even if the      alien makes no such request, subsection (d) directs the      Attorney General to notify the appropriate embassy of the      alien's detention.       Subsection 201(c) sets out three conforming amendments to      the INA. First, section 106 of the INA, 8 U.S.C. Sec. 1105a,      is amended to provide that appeals from orders entered      pursuant to section 235(c) of the Act (pertaining to summary      exclusion proceedings for alien spies, saboteurs, and      terrorists) shall be to the United States Court of Appeals      for the District of Columbia Circuit. Thus, in cases      involving alien terrorists, the same court of appeals shall      hear both exclusion and deportation appeals and will develop      unique expertise concerning such cases.       Second, section 276 of the INA, 8 U.S.C. Sec. 1326, is      amended to add increased penalties for an alien entering or      attempting to enter the United States without permission      after removal under the new title or exclusion under section      235(c) for terrorist activity. For aliens unlawfully      reentering or attempting to reenter the United States, the      section presently provides for a fine pursuant to title 18      and/or imprisonment for up to two years (five years when the      alien has been convicted of a felony in the United States, or      15 years when convicted of an ``aggravated felony''); the      bill increases to a mandatory ten years the term of      imprisonment for reentering alien terrorists.       Finally, section 106 of the INA, 8 U.S.C. Sec. 1105a, is      amended to strike subsection (a)(10) regarding habeas corpus      review of deportation orders. Originally enacted in 1961 to      make clear that the exclusive provision for review of final      deportation orders through petition to the courts of appeals      was not intended to extinguish traditional writs of habeas      corpus in cases of wrongful detention, the subsection has      been the source of confusion and duplicative litigation in      the courts. Congress never intended that habeas corpus      proceedings be an alternative to the process of petitioning      the courts of appeals for review of deportation orders.      Elimination of subsection (a)(10) will make clear that any      review of the merits of a deportation order or the denial of      relief from deportation is available only through petition      for review in the courts of appeals, while leaving unchanged      the traditional writ of habeas corpus to examine challenges      to detention arising from asserted errors of constitutional      proportions.       Subsection 201(d) provides that the new provisions are      effective upon enactment and ``apply to all aliens without      regard to the date of entry or attempted entry into the      United States.'' Aliens may not avoid the special removal      process on the grounds that either their involvement in      terrorist activity or their entry into the United States      occurred before enactment of the new title. Upon enactment,      the new title will be available to the Attorney General for      removal of any and all alien terrorists when classified      information is involved.                              Section 202       This section makes additional changes to the Immigration      and Naturalization Act (INA) besides those contained in      section 201. It improves the government's ability to deny      visas to alien terrorist leaders and to deport non-resident      alien terrorists under the INA.       Subsection 202(a) amends the excludability provisions of      the INA relating to terrorism activities (section      212(a)(3)(B) of the INA (8 U.S.C. 1182(a)(3)(B)). Most of the      changes are clarifying in nature, but a few are substantive.      The changes are:       (1) ``Terrorist'' is changed to ``terrorism'' in most      instances in order to direct focus on the nature of the      activity itself and not the character of the particular      individual perpetrator.       (2) Definitions of ``terrorist organization'' and      ``terrorism'' are added. The definition of ``terrorist      organization'' includes subgroups. Although a terrorist      organization may perform certain charitable activities, e.g.,      run a hospital, this does not remove its characterization of      being a terrorist organization if it, or any of its      subgroups, engages in terrorism activity. The definition of      ``terrorism'' describes terrorism as the ``premeditated      politically motivated violence perpetrated against noncombat      targets.'' This is consistent with existing law found      elsewhere in the federal code. See, e.g., 22 U.S.C. 2656f(d).       (3) In order to make ``representatives'' of certain      specified terrorist organizations excludable, the term has      been expanded to cover any person who directs, counsels,      commands or induces the organization or its members to engage      in terrorism activity. The terms ``counsels, commands, or      induces'' are used in 18 U.S.C. 2. Presently, only the      officers, officials, representatives and spokesman are deemed      to be excludable. This change expands coverage to encompass      those leaders of the group who may not hold formal titles and      those who are closely associated with the group and exert      leadership over the group but may not technically be a      member. This is not a mere membership provision.       (4) In order to make the ``leaders'' of more terrorist      organizations excludable without having to establish that      they personally have engaged in terrorist activity, the      revision gives the President authority to designate terrorist      organizations based on a finding that they are detrimental to      the interests of the United States. (Presently, only the PLO      is expressly cited in the existing statute.) Implicit with      the right to designate is the authority to remove an      organization that the President has previously designated. By      giving the President this authority, which is similar to      subsection (f) of section 212 (8 U.S.C. 212(f)), the      President can impose stricter travel limitations on the      leaders of terrorist organizations who desire to visit the      United States. For a leader of a      designated terrorist organization to obtain a visa, he would      have to solicit a waiver from the Attorney General under      subsection 212(d)(3) (8 U.S.C. 1182(d)(3)) to obtain      temporary admission. In deciding whether or not to grant      to waiver, the Attorney General could, should he/she      decide to grant a waiver, impose whatever restrictions are      warranted on the alien's presence in the United States.       (5) The words ``it has been'' are inserted in the first      sentence of the definition of ``terrorism activity'' in order      to make clear that it is United States law (federal or state)      which is used to determine whether overseas violent activity      is considered criminal.       (6) The term ``weapons'' is added to clause (V)(b) in the      definition of ``terrorist activity'' in order to cover those      murders carried out by deadly and dangerous devices other      than firearms or explosives (e.g., a knife).       (7) The knowledge requirement in clause (III) of the      definition of ``engage in terrorism activity'' was deleted as      unnecessary, as similar language has been added in the      beginning of the definition.       (8) The term ``documentation or'' has been added to ``false      identification'' in clause (III) of the definition of      ``engage in terrorism activity'' to encompass other forms of      false documentation that might be provided to facilitate      terrorism activity. The term ``false identification'' would      include stolen, counterfeit, forged and falsely made      identification documents.       Subsection 202(b) amends section 241(a)(4)(B) of the INA (8      U.S.C. 1251(a)(4)(B)) to reflect the change in section      212(a)(3)(B) (8 U.S.C. 1182(a)(3)(B)) from ``terrorist'' to      ``terrorism.''       Subsection 202(c) adds a sentence to section 291 of the INA      (8 U.S.C. 1361) to clarify that discovery by the alien in a      deportation proceeding is limited only to those documents in      the INS file relating to the alien's entry. Section 291 was      never intended to authorized discovery beyond this limited      category of documents.       Subsection 202(d) makes an important change to section      242(b)(3) of the INA (8 U.S.C. 1252(b)(3)). First, in the      case of non-resident aliens it precludes the alien's access      to any classified information that is being used to deport      them. Secondly, it denies non-resident aliens any rights      under 18 U.S.C. 3504 (relating to access concerning sources      of evidence) and 50 U.S.C. 1801 et seq. (relating to the      Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act) during their      deportation.                              Section 203       Section 203 amends the confidentiality provisions contained      in the Immigration and Nationality Act (INA) for an alien's      application relating to legalization (section 245A(c)(5) of      the INA (8 U.S.C. 1255(a)(c)(5)) or special agricultural      worker status (section 210(b)(5) and (6) of the INA (8 U.S.C.      1160(b)(5) and (6)). At present, it is very difficult to      obtain crucial information contained in these files, such as      fingerprints, photographs, addresses, etc., when the alien      becomes a subject of a criminal investigation. In both the      World Trade Center bombing and the killing of CIA personnel      on their way to work at CIA Headquarters, the existing      confidentiality provisions hindered law enforcement efforts.       Subsection 203(a) amends the confidential provisions for      legalization files. It permits access to the file if a      federal court finds that the file relates to an alien who has      been killed or severely incapacitated or is the suspect of an      aggravated felony. Subsection 203(b) makes comparable      amendments to the confidentiality requirements relating to      special agricultural worker status.                              Section 301       Section 301 authorizes the government to regulate or      prohibit any person or organization within the United States      and any person subject to the jurisdiction of the United      States anywhere from raising or providing funds for use by      any foreign organization which the President has designated      to be engaged in terrorism activities. Such designation would      be based on a Presidential finding that the organization (1)      engages in terrorism activity as defined in the Immigration      and Nationality Act and (2) its terrorism activities threaten      the national security, foreign policy, or economy of the      United States.       The fund-raising provision provides a licensing mechanism      under which funds may be provided to a designated      organization based on a showing that the money will be used      exclusively for religious, charitable, literary, or      educational purposes. It includes      [[Page S2523]] both administrative and judicial enforcement      procedures, as well as a special classified information      procedures applicable to certain types of civil litigation.      The term ``person'' is defined to include individuals,      partnerships, associations, groups, corporations or other      organizations.       Subsection 301(a) creates a new section 2339B in title 18,      United States Code, entitled ``Fund-raising for terrorist      organizations.''       Subsection 2339B(a) sets forth the congressional findings      and purposes for the fund-raising statute.       Subsection 2339B(b) gives the President the authority to      issue regulations to regulate or prohibit any person within      the United States or any person subject to the jurisdiction      of the United States anywhere from raising or providing funds      for use by, or from engaging in financial transactions with,      any foreign organization which the President, pursuant to      subsection 2339B(c), has designated to be engaged in      terrorism activities.       Subsection 2339B(c)(1) grants the President the authority      to designate any foreign organization, if he finds that (1)      the organization engages in terrorism activity (as defined in      section 212(a)(3)(B) of the Immigration and Nationality Act      (8 U.S.C. 1182(a)(3)(B)) and (2) the organization's terrorism      activities threaten the national security, foreign policy or      economy of the United States. Subsection 2339B(c)(2) grants      the President the authority to designate persons who are      raising funds for or are acting for or on behalf of a foreign      organization designated pursuant to subsection (c)(1).       Such designations must be published in the Federal      Register. The President is authorized to revoke any      designation. A designation under subsection (c)(1) is      conclusive and is not reviewable by a court in a criminal      prosecution.       Subsection 2339B(d) sets forth the prohibited activities.      Paragraph (1) makes it unlawful for any person within the      United States, or any person subject to the jurisdiction of      the United States anywhere in the world, to raise, receive,      or collect funds on behalf of or to furnish, give, transmit,      transfer, or provide funds to or for an organization      designated by the President unless such activity is done is      accordance with a license granted under subsection 2339B(e).      Paragraph (2) makes it unlawful for any person within the      United States or any person subject to the jurisdiction of      the United States anywhere in the world, acting for or or      behalf of a designated organization, (1) to transit,      transfer, or receive any funds raised in violation of      subsection 2339B(d)(1); (2) to transmit, transfer or dispose      of any funds in which any designated organization has an      interest; or (3) to attempt to do any of the foregoing. The      latter provision serves to make it a crime for any person      within the United States, or any person subject to the      jurisdiction of the United States anywhere, to transfer,      transfer or dispose of on behalf of a designated organization      any funds in which such organization has an interest until      after a license has been issued.       Subsection 2339B(e) requires that any person who desires to      solicit funds or transfer funds to any designated      organization must obtain a license from the Secretary of the      Treasury. Any license issued by the Secretary shall be      granted only when the Secretary is      satisfied that the funds are intended exclusively for      religious, charitable, literacy, or educational purposes      and that any recipient in any fund-raising chain has      effective procedures in place to insure that the funds      will be used exclusively for religious, charitable,      literary, or educational purposes and will not be used to      affect a transfer of funds to be used in terrorism      activity. The burden is on the license applicant to      convince the Secretary that such procedures do in fact      exist. A licensee is required to keep books and records      and make such books available for inspection upon the      Secretary's request. A licensee is also required to have      an agreement with any recipient which permits the      Secretary to inspect the recipient's records.       Subsection 2339B(f) requires that a financial institution      which becomes aware that it is in possession of or that it      has control over funds in which a designated organization has      an interest must ``freeze'' such funds and notify the      Secretary of the Treasury. A civil penalty is provided for      failure to freeze such funds or report the required      information to the Secretary. The term ``financial      institution'' has the meaning prescribed in 31 U.S. C.      5312(a)(2) and regulations promulgated thereunder. It is the      same definition as utilized in the money laundering statute,      see 18 U.S.C. 1956(c)(6).       Subsection 2339B(g) divides investigative responsibility      for the section between the Secretary of the Treasury and the      Attorney General. This provision thus permits the combination      of the administrative and financial expertise of Treasury's      Office of Foreign Assets Control (OFAC) and the intelligence      capabilities and criminal investigative techniques of the      Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) to be combined together      in a highly coordinated manner in order to effectively      enforce the requirements of this section while protecting the      equities of the nation's national security intelligence      gathering community. The provision reflects, as does section      407 of the bill, the FBI's role as the lead federal agency      for the investigation and prosecution of terrorist activity      as well as the prime federal intelligence agency for      gathering national security information within the United      States.       Section 2339B(h) gives authority to the Secretary of the      Treasury and the Attorney General to require recordkeeping,      hold hearings, issue subpoenas, administer oaths and receive      evidence.       Subsection 2339B(i) sets forth the penalties for section      2339B. Any person who knowingly violates subsection 2339B(d)      can be fined under title 18, United States Code, or      imprisoned for up to ten years, or both. A person who fails      to keep records or make records available to the Secretary of      the Treasury upon his/her request is subject to a civil      penalty of the greater of $50,000 or twice the amount of      money which would have been documented had the books and      records been properly maintained. A financial institution      which fails to take the actions required pursuant to      subsection (f)(1) is subject to civil penalty of the greater      of $50,000 or twice the amount of money of which the      financial institution was required to retain possession or      control. Any person who violates any license, order,      direction, or regulation issued pursuant to the section is      subject to a civil penalty of the greater of $50,000 per      violation or twice the value of the violation. A person who      intentionally fails to maintain or make available the      required books or records also commits a crime subject to a      fine under title 18, United States Code, or imprisonment for      up to five years, or both. Any organization convicted of an      offense under subsections 2339B(i)(1) or (3) shall forfeit      any charitable designation it might have received under the      Internal Revenue Code.       Subsection 2339B(j)(1) gives the Attorney General the right      to seek an injunction to block any violation of section      2339B. An injunctive proceeding is normally governed by the      Federal Rules of Civil Procedure, but if the respondent is      under indictment, discovery is to be governed by the Federal      Rules of Criminal Procedure.       Subsection 2339B(k) states that there is extra territorial      jurisdiction over activity prohibited by section 2339B which      is conducted outside the United States. This insures that      foreign persons outside the United States are covered by this      statute if they aid, assist, counsel, command, induce or      procure, or conspire with, persons within the United States      or persons subject to the jurisdiction of the United States      anywhere in the world to violate the fund-raising prohibition      (18 U.S.C. 2339B, 2, and 371).       Subsection 2339B(1) sets forth a special process to protect      classified information when the government is the plaintiff      in civil proceedings to enforce section 2339B.       Subsection 2339B(m) sets forth the definitions of      ``classified information,'' ``financial institution,''      ``funds,'' ``national security,'' ``person,'' and ``United      States.'' Funds are defined to include all currency, coin,      and any negotiable or registered security that can be used as      a method of transferring money.       Subsection 301(c) further amends section 212(a)(3)(B)(i) of      the Immigration and Nationality Act (8 U.S.C.      1182(a)(3)(B)(i)) to include leaders of any terrorist      organization designated under the fund-raising statute (18      U.S.C. 2339B) as an aliens deemed to be excludable under the      immigration laws.       Subsection 301(d) makes the special classified information      provisions of 18 U.S.C. 2339B(k) applicable to similar civil      proceedings under the International Emergency Economic Powers      Act (50 U.S.C. 1701 et. seq.).                              Section 401       This section states that title IV may be cited as the      ``Marking of Plastic Explosives for Detection Act.''                              Section 402       This section sets forth the congressional findings      concerning the criminal use of plastic explosives and the      prevention of such use through the marking of plastic      explosives for the purpose of detection. This section also      states that the purpose of the legislation is to implement      the Convention on the Marking of Plastic Explosives for the      Purpose of Detection, Done at Montreal on 1 March 1991 (the      Convention).                              Section 403       This section sets forth three new definitions for 18 U.S.C.      841. It amends 18 U.S.C. 841 by adding a new subsection (o)      which defines the term ``Convention on the Marking of Plastic      Explosives.'' The definition provides the full title of the      Convention, ``Convention on the Marking of Plastic Explosives      for the Purpose of Detection, Done at Montreal on 1 March      1991.'' The definition eliminates the need to repeat the full      title of the Convention each time it is used in the bill.       Section 403 also amends section 841 by adding a new      subsection (p) which defines the term ``detection agent.''      The term has been defined to include four specified chemical      substances and any other substance specified by the Secretary      of the Treasury by regulation. The four specified chemical      substances, ethylene glycol dinitrate (EDGN), 2, 3-dimethyl-     2-3-dinitrobutane (DMNB), paramononitrotoluene (p-MNT), and      ortho-mononitrotoluene (o-MNT), are in Part 2 of the      Technical Annex to the Convention. The required minimum      concentration of the four substances in the finished plastic      explosives was also taken from the Technical Annex. The      definition of ``detection agent'' has been drafted to require      that the particular substance be introduced into a plastic      explosive in such a manner as to achieve homogeneous      distribution in the finished explosive. The purpose of      homogeneous distribution is to assure that the detection      agent can be detected by vapor detection equipment.       [[Page S2524]] New section 841(p)(5) would permit the      Secretary of the Treasury to add other substances to the list      of approved detection agents by regulation, in consultation      with the Secretaries of State and Defense. Permitting the      Secretary to designate detection agents other than the four      listed in the statute would facilitate the use of other      substances without the need for legislation. Only those      substances which have been added to the table in Part 2 of      the Technical Annex, pursuant to Articles VI and VII of the      Convention, may be designated as approved detection agents      under section 841(p)(5). Since the Department of Defense      (DOD) is the largest domestic consumer of plastic      explosives (over 95 percent of domestic production), it is      appropriate that DOD provide guidance to the Treasury      Department in approving additional substances as detection      agents.       Finally, section 403 adds a new subsection (q) to section      841 which defines the term ``plastic explosive.'' The      definition is based on the definition of ``explosives'' in      Article I of the Convention and Part I of the Technical      Annex.                              Section 404       This section adds subsections (l)-(o) to 18 U.S.C. Sec. 842      proscribing certain conduct relating to unmarked plastic      explosives.       Section 842(l) would make it unlawful for any person to      manufacture within the United States any plastic explosive      which does not contain a detection agent.       Section 842(m) would make it unlawful for any person to      import into the United States or export from the United      States any plastic explosive which does not contain a      detection agent. However, importations and exportations of      plastic explosives imported into or manufactured in the      United States prior to the effective date of the Act by      Federal law enforcement agencies or the National Guard of any      State, or by any person acting on behalf of such entities,      would be exempted from this prohibition for a period of 15      years after the Convention is entered into force with respect      to the United States. This provision implements Article IV,      paragraph 3, of the Convention. Section 842(m) is drafted to      specifically include the National Guard of any State and      military reserve units within the 15-year exemption.       The purpose of the 15-year exemption is to give the      military and Federal law enforcement agencies a period of 15      years to use up the considerable stock of unmarked plastic      explosives they now have on hand. This exception would also      permit DOD to export its unmarked plastic explosives to      United States forces in other countries during the 15-year      period.       Section 842(n)(1) would make it unlawful for any person to      ship, transport, transfer, receive, or possess any plastic      explosive which does not contain a detection agent. Section      842(n)(2)(A) would provide an exception to the prohibition of      section 842(n)(1) for any plastic explosive which was      imported, brought into, or manufactured in the United States      prior to the effective date of the Act by any person during a      period not exceeding three years after the effective date of      the Act. This provision implements Article IV, paragraph 2,      of the Convention, and provides an exemption from the      prohibitions of section 842(n)(1) for any person, including      State and local governmental entities and other Federal      agencies, for a period of three years after the effective      date of the Act.       Section 842(n)(2)(B) would provide an exception to the      prohibition of section 842(n)(1) for any plastic explosive      which was imported, brought into, or manfuactured in the      United States prior to the effective date of the Act by any      Federal law enforcement agency or the United States military      or by any Federal law enforcement agency or the United States      military or by any person acting on behalf of such entities      for a period of 15 years after the date of entry into force      of the Convention with respect to the United States. This      provision implements Article IV, paragraph 3, of the      Convention. The provision was drafted to specifically include      the National Guard of any State and military reserve units      within the 15-year exemption.       Section 842(o) would make it unlawful for any person, other      than a Federal agency possessing any plastic explosive on the      effective date of the Act, to fail to report to the Secretary      of the Treasury within 120 days from the effective date of      the Act the quantity of plastic explosive possessed, the      manufacturer or importer of the explosive, any identifying      markings on the explosive, and any other information as      required by regulation. This provision implements Article IV,      paragraph 1, of the Convention, which requires each State      Party to take all necessary measures to exercise control over      the possession and transfer of possession of unmarked      explosives which have been manufactured in or imported into      its territory prior to the entry into force of the Convention      with respect to that State. This provision was drafted to      specifically include the National Guard of any State and      military reserve units as agencies which are exempt from the      reporting requirement.                              Section 405       This section amends 18 U.S.C. 844(a), which provides      penalties for violating certain provisions of 18 U.S.C. 842.      The amended section would add sections 842(l)-(o) to the list      of offenses punishable by a fine under 18 U.S.C. 3571 of not      more than $250,000 in the case of an individual, and $500,000      in the case of an organization, or by imprisonment for not      more than 10 years, or both.                              Section 406       This section amends 18 U.S.C. 845(a)(1), which excepts from      the provisions of 18 U.S.C. Chapter 40 any aspect of the      transportation of explosive materials regulated by the United      States Department of Transportation. The purpose of the      amendment is to make it clear that the exception in section      845(a)(1) applies only to those aspects of such      transportation relating to safety. This amendment would      overcome the effect of the adverse decisions in United States      v. Petrykievicz, 809 F. Supp. 794 (W.D. Wash. 1992), and      United States v. Illingworth, 489 F.2d 264 (10th Cir.) 1973).      In those cases, the court held that the language of section      845(a)(1) resulted in the defendant's exemption from all the      provisions of the chapter, including the requirement of a      license or permit to ship, transport, or receive explosives      in interstate or foreign commerce.       The list of offenses which are not subject to the      exceptions of section 845(a) has also been amended to include      the new plastic explosives offenses in sections 842(l)-(m).       Section 406 also adds a new subsection (c) to 18 U.S.C. 845      to provide certain affirmative defenses to the new plastic      explosives offenses in sections 842(l)-(o). This provision      implements Part 1, paragraph II, of the Technical Annex to      the Convention, which relates to exceptions for limited      quantities of explosives. The affirmative defenses of 18      U.S.C. 845(c) could be asserted by defendants in criminal      prosecutions, persons having an interest in explosive      materials seized and forfeited pursuant to 18 U.S.C. 844(c),      and persons challenging the revocation or denial of their      explosives licenses or permits pursuant to 18 U.S.C. 845(c).       The three affirmative defenses specified in section      845(c)(1) all relate to research, training, and testing, and      require that the proponent provide evidence that there was a      ``small amount'' of plastic explosive intended for and      utilized solely in the specified activities. The      respresentatives to the Conference which resulted in the      Convention agreed that the amount of unmarked explosive      permitted to be used for these purposes should be      ``limited,'' but were unable to agree on a specific quantity.      The Secretary of the Treasury may issue regulations defining      what quantity of plastic explosives is a ``small amount'' or      may leave it up to the proponent of the affirmative defense      to prove that a ``small amount'' of explosives was imported,      manufactured, possessed, etc. The statute is drafted to      require that the proponent establish the affirmative defense      by a preponderance of the evidence.       Section 845(c)(2) would create another affirmative defense      to the plastic explosives offenses, which implements Article      IV of the Convention, and Part I, Paragraph II(d), of the      Technical Annex. This provision would require that proponent      to prove, by a preponderance of the evidence, that the      plastic explosive was, within three years after the date of      entry into force of the Convention with respect to the United      States, incorporated in a military device that is intended to      become or has become the      property of any Federal military or law enforcement agency.      Furthermore, the proponent must prove that the plastic      explosive has remained an integral part of the military      device for the exemption to apply. This requirement would      discourage the removal of unmarked plastic explosives from      bombs, mines, and other military devices manufactured for      the United States military during the three year period.      The provision was drafted to specifically include the      National Guard of any State and military reserve units      within the exemption. The term ``military device'' has      been defined in accordance with the definition of that      term in Article I of the Convention.       Requiring that the exceptions of section 845(c) be      established as an affirmative defense would facilitate the      prosecution of violations of the new plastic explosive      provisions by terrorists and other dangerous criminals in      that the Government would not have to bear the difficult, if      not impossible, burden of proving that the explosives were      not used in one of the research, training, testing, or      military device exceptions specified in the statute. The      proponent of the affirmative defense would be in the best      position to establish the existence of one of the exceptions.       The approach taken in section 845(c) is patterned after the      affirmative defense provision in 18 U.S.C. 176 and 177,      relating to the use of biological weapons.                              Section 407       This section provides the Attorney General investigative      authority over new subsections (m) and (n) of section 842,      relating to the importation, exportation, shipping,      transferring, receipt or possession of unmarked plastic      explosives, when such provisions are violated by terrorist/     revolutionary groups or individuals. This authority is      consistent with the existing March 1, 1973, memorandum of      understanding on the investigation of explosives violations      between the Departments of Justice and the Treasury and the      United States Postal Service. The section also makes it clear      that, consistent with current national policy, the Federal      Bureau of Investigation (FBI) is the lead Federal agency for      investigating all violations of Federal law involving      terrorism when the FBI has been given by statute or      regulation investigative authority over the relevant offense.      See 28 U.S.C. 523 and 28 C.F.R. 0.85(1).                       [[Page S2525]] Section 408       This section provides that the amendments made by title IV      shall take effect one year after the date of enactment. The      one year delay should be adequate for manufacturers to obtain      sources of one of the specified detection agents and to      reformulate the plastic explosives they manufacture to      include a detection agent.                              Section 501       Section 501 expands the scope and jurisdictional bases      under 18 U.S.C. 831 (prohibited transactions involving      nuclear materials). It is an effort to modify current law to      deal with the increased risk stemming from the destruction of      certain nuclear weapons that were once in the arsenal of the      former Soviet Union and the lessening of security controls      over peaceful nuclear materials in the former Soviet Union.      Among other things, the bill expands the definition of      nuclear materials to include those materials which are less      than weapons grade but are dangerous to human life and/or the      environment. It also expands the jurisdictional bases to      reach all situations where a U.S. national or corporation is      the victim or perpetrator of an offense. The bill expressly      covers those situations where a threat to do some form of      prohibited activity is directed at the United States      Government.       Subsection 501(a)(1) sets forth a series of findings.      Subsection 501(a)(2) sets forth the purpose.       Subsection 501(b) makes many technical changes to section      831 of title 18, United States Code. The ones of substance      are:       (1) Paragraph (1) adds ``nuclear byproduct material'' to      the scope of subsection 831(a).       (2) Paragraph (2) ensures coverage of situations under      subsection 831(a)(1)(A) where there is substantial damage to      the environment.       (3) Paragraph (3) rewrites subsection 831(a)(1)(B) in the      following ways:       (A) drops the requirement that the defendant ``know'' that      circumstances exist which are dangerous to life or property.      If such circumstances are created through the intentional      actions of the defendant, criminal sanctions are appropriate      due to the inherently dangerous nature of nuclear material      and the extraordinary risk of harm created.       (B) adds substantial damage to the environment; and       (C) adds language (i.e., ``such circumstances are      represented to the defendant to exist'') to cover the      situation of sales by undercover law enforcement to      prospective buyers of materials purported to be nuclear      materials. This is comparable to the new 18 U.S.C. 21 created      by section 320910 of Pub. L. 103-322 for undercover      operations.       (4) Paragraph (4) expands the threat provision of      subsection 831(a)(6) to cover threats to do substantial      damage to the environment.       (5) Paragraph (5) expands the jurisdiction in subsection      831(c)(2) beyond those situations where the offender is a      United States national. As revised, it includes all      situations, anywhere in the world where a United States      national is the victim of an offense or where the perpetrator      or victim of the offense is a ``United States corporation or      other legal entity.''       (6) Paragraph (6) drops the requirement in subsection      831(c)(3) that the nuclear material be for ``peaceful      purposes'', i.e., non-military, and that it be in use,      storage, or transport. Hence, the provision now reaches any      alien who commits an offense under subsection 831(a) overseas      and is subsequently found in the United States. Of course, if      the target of the offense was a U.S. national or corporation      or the U.S. Government there would be jurisdiction of the      offense under another provision of subsection 831(c), even      when the perpetrator is still overseas. The activities      prohibited by subsection 831(a) are so serious that all      civilized nations have recognized their obligations to      confront this growing problem because of its inherent      dangerousness.       (7) Paragraph (8) deletes the requirement for subsection      831(c)(4) that the nuclear materials being shipped to or from      the United States be for peaceful purposes. Hence, military      nuclear materials are now encompassed under subsection      831(c)(4). It also adds nuclear byproduct material to the      provision.       (8) Paragraph (10) adds a new paragraph (5) to subsection      831(c) to ensure that there is federal jurisdiction when the      governmental entity being threatened under subsection      831(a)(5) is the United States and when the threat under      subsection 831(a)(6) is directed at the United States.       (9) Paragraph (11) deletes an outmoded requirement, so that      all plutonium is now covered.       (10) Paragraph (14) adds ``nuclear byproduct material'' to      the definitions as a new subsection 831(f)(2). Nuclear      byproduct material means any material containing any      radioactive isotope created through an irradiation process in      the operation of a nuclear reactor or accelerator. This will      extend the prohibitions of this statute to materials that are      not capable of creating a nuclear explosion, but which,      nevertheless, could be used to create a radioactive dispersal      device capable of spreading highly dangerous radioactive      material throughout an area.       (11) Paragraph (17) adds to subsection 831(f) the      definitions for the terms ``national of the United States''      and ``United States corporation or other legal entity.''                              section 601       This section deletes subsection (c) of the material support      statute (18 U.S.C. 2339A(c)) enacted as part of the 1994      crime bill (Pub. L. 103-322). It would also correct erroneous      statutory references and typographical errors (i.e., changes      ``36'' to ``37,'' ``2331'' to ``2332,'' ``2339'' to      ``2332a,'' and ``of an escape'' to ``or an escape'').       Subsection 2339A(c) of title 18, United States Code,      imposes an unprecedented and impractical burden on law      enforcement concerning the initiation and continuation of      criminal investigations under 18 U.S.C. 2339A. Specifically,      subsection (c) provides that the government may not initiate      or continue an investigation under this statute unless the      existing facts reasonably indicate that the target knowingly      and intentionally has engaged, is engaged, or will engage in      a violation of federal criminal law. In other words, the      government must have facts that reasonably indicate each      element of the offense before it even initiates (or      continues) an investigation. The normal investigative      practice is that the government obtains evidence which      indicates that a violation may exist if certain other      elements of the offense, particularly the knowledge or intent      elements, are also present. The government then seeks to      obtain evidence which establishes or negates the existence of      the other elements. If such evidence is found to exist, the      investigation continues to obtain the necessary evidence to      prove its case beyond a reasonable doubt on every element.       As drafted, however, subsection (c) reverses the natural      flow of a criminal investigation. It is an impediment to the      effective use of section 2339A. Moreover, the provision would      generate unproductive litigation which would only serve to      delay the prosecution of any offender, drain limited      investigative and prosecutive resources, and hinder efforts      to thwart terrorism. It is the position of the Department of      Justice that the investigative guidelines issued by the      Attorney General adequately protect individual rights while      providing for effective law enforcement.       Section 601 deletes subsection (c) retroactive to September      13, 1994, the date that the 1994 crime bill was signed into      law. Since subsection (c) is procedural in nature, the      retroactive nature of the proposed deletion does not pose a      constitutional problem. It should suffice, however, to      preclude a defendant from availing himself of subsection (c)      in the event that the conduct charged in a subsequent      indictment arose between September 13, 1994, and the      enactment of section 601.       Section 102(c) of this Act also proposes to broaden the      scope of the material support statute by incorporating, as      one of the predicate offenses, the proposed statute relating      to conspiracies within the United States to commit terrorist      acts abroad.                              section 602       This section would add coverage for threats to the weapons      of mass destruction statute (18 U.S.C. 2332a). The offense of      using a weapon of mass destruction (or attempting or      conspiring to use such a weapon) was created by section 60023      of the Violent Crime Control and Law Enforcement Act of 1994      (P.L. 103-322). However, no threat offense was included. A      threat to use such a weapon is a foreseeable tactic to be      employed by a terrorist group. Further, it could necessitate      a serious and costly government response, e.g. efforts to      eliminate the threat, evacuation of a city or facility, etc.      Accordingly, it seems clearly appropriate to make threatening      to use a weapon of mass destruction a federal offense.       This section amends subsection (a) to include threats among      the proscribed offenders. Further, it redesignates subsection      (b) of section 2332a as subsection (c) and provides a new      subsection (b). The new subsection (b) ensures jurisdiction      when a national of the United States outside the United      States is the perpetrator of the threat offense.                              section 603       Section 603 adds to the Racketeer Influenced and Corrupt      Organizations (RICO) statute certain federal violent crimes      relating to murder and destruction of property. These are the      offenses most often committed by terrorists. Many violent      crimes committed within the United States are encompassed as      predicate acts for the RICO statute. However, RICO does not      presently reach most terrorist acts directed against United      States interests overseas. Hence, this section adds to RICO      extraterritorial terrorism violations. When an organization      commits a series of terrorist acts, a RICO theory of      prosecution may be the optimal means of proceeding.       The offenses being added to as predicate acts to RICO are:      18 U.S.C. 32 (relating to the destruction of aircraft), 37      (relating to violence at international airports), 115      (relating to influencing, impeding or retaliating against a      federal official by threatening or injuring a family member)      351 (relating to Congressional or Cabinet officer      assassination), 831 (relating to prohibited transactions      involving nuclear materials as amended by section 501 of this      bill), 844 (f) or (i) (relating to destruction by explosives      or fire of government property or property affecting      interstate or foreign commerce), 956 (relating to conspiracy      to kill, kidnap, maim or injure property certain property in      a foreign country as amended by section 102 of this bill),      1111 (relating to murder), 1114 (relating to murder of United      States law enforcement officials), 1116 (relating to murder      of foreign officials, official guests, or internationally      protected persons), 1203 (relating to hostage taking), 1361      (relating to willful injury of      [[Page S2526]] government property), 1363 (relating to      destruction of property within the special maritime and      territorial jurisdiction), 1751 (relating to Presidential      assassination), 2280 (relating to violence against maritime      navigation as amended by section 606 of this bill), 2281      (relating to violence against maritime fixed platforms), 2332      (relating to terrorist acts abroad against United States      (nationals), 2332a (relating to use of weapons of mass      destruction as amended by section 602 of this bill), 2332b      (relating to acts of terrorism transcending national      boundaries created by section 101 of this bill), and 2339A      (relating to providing material support to terrorists as      amended by sections 102(c) and 601 of this bill), and 49      U.S.C. 46502 (relating to aircraft piracy).                              section 604       18 U.S.C. 1956(a)(2)(A) makes it a felony to transfer funds      from the United States to a place outside the United States      if the transfer is done with the intent to promote the      carrying on of ``specified unlawful activity.'' The term      ``specified unlawful activity'' is defined in section      1956(c)(7)(B) to include an offense against a foreign nation      involving kidnapping, robbery, or extortion as well as      certain offenses involving controlled substances and fraud by      or against a foreign bank. It does not, however, include      murder or the destruction of property by means of explosive      or fire.       In recent investigations of international terrorist      organizations, it has been discovered that certain of these      organizations collect money in the United States and then      transfer the money outside the United States for use in      connection with acts of terrorism which may involve murder or      destruction of property in foreign nations.       In order to prevent terrorist organizations from collecting      money inside the United States which is used to finance      murders and destruction of property, subsection (a) would add      ``murder and destruction of property by explosive or fire''      to the list of specified unlawful activity in section      1956(c)(7)(B)(ii). This amendment would also apply to cases      where the proceeds of any such murder or property destruction      would be laundered in the United States.       Subsection (b) would add to the definitions of ``specified      unlawful activity'' in section 1956(c)(7)(D) of title 18,      United States Code, those violent federal offenses most      likely to be      violated by terrorists overseas. Hence, if during the course      of perpetrating these violent offenses the terrorists      transferred funds in interstate or foreign commerce to      promote the carrying on of any of these offenses, they      would also violate the money laundering statute. The      offenses added are the same as those added to the RICO      statute by section 603 of this bill, except for 18 U.S.C.      1203 (relating to hostage taking) which is already      contained as a money laundering predicate. It should be      noted that if section 603 of this bill is enacted,      subsection 604(b) need not be enacted because any offense      which is included as a RICO predicate is automatically a      predicate also under the money laundering statute.                              section 605       This section would add a number of terrorism-related      offenses to 18 U.S.C. 2516, thereby permitting court-     authorized interception of wire, oral, and electronic      communications when the rigorous requirements of chapter 119      (including section 2516) are met. Presently, section 2516      contains a long list of felony offenses for which electronic      surveillance is authorized. The list has grown periodically      since the initial enactment of the section in 1968. As a      result, coverage of terrorism-related offenses is not      comprehensive. Section 2516 already includes such offenses as      hostage taking under 18 U.S.C. 1203, train wrecking under 18      U.S.C. 1992, and sabotage of nuclear facilities or fuel under      42 U.S.C. 2284.       The instant proposal would add 18 U.S.C. 956, as amended by      section 103 of this bill, and 960 (proscribing conspiracies      to harm people or damage certain property of a foreign nation      with which the United States is not at war and organizing or      participating in from within the United States an expedition      against a friendly nation), 49 U.S.C. 46502 (relating to      aircraft piracy), and 18 U.S.C. 2332 (relating to killing      United States nationals abroad with intent to coerce the      government or a civilian population). It would also add 18      U.S.C. 2332a (relating to offenses involving weapons of mass      destruction), 18 U.S.C. 2332b (relating to acts of terrorism      transcending national boundaries, which offense is created by      section 101 of this bill), 18 U.S.C. 2339A (relating to      providing material support to terrorists), and 18 U.S.C. 37      (relating to violence at airports).       Terrorism offenses frequently require the use of court-     authorized electronic surveillance techniques because of the      clandestine and violent nature of the groups that commit such      crimes. Adding the proposed predicate offenses to 18 U.S.C.      2516 would therefore facilitate the ability of law      enforcement successfully to investigate, and sometimes      prevent, such offenses in the future.                              section 606       In considering legislative proposals which were      incorporated into the 1994 crime bill (Pub. L. 103-322),      Congress altered the Department's proposed formulation of the      jurisdictional provisions of the Maritime Violence      legislation, the Violence Against Maritime Fixed Platforms      legislation, and Violence at International Airports      legislation, because of a concern over possible federal      coverage of violence stemming from labor disputes. The      altered language created uncertainties which were brought to      the attention of Congress. Subsequently, the labor violence      concern was addressed by adoption of the bar to prosecution      contained in 18 U.S.C. 37(c), 2280(c) and 2281(c). With the      adoption of this bar, the sections were to revert to their      original wording, as submitted by the Department of Justice.      While sections 37 and 2281 were properly corrected, the      disturbing altered language was inadvertently left in section      2280.       Consequently, as clauses (ii) and (iii) of subsection      2280(b)(1)(A) of title 18, United States Code, are presently      written, there would be no federal jurisdiction over a      prohibited act within the United States by anyone (alien of      citizen) if there was a state crime, regardless of whether      the state crime is a felony. Moreover, the Maritime      Convention mandated that the United States assert      jurisdiction when a United States national does a prohibited      act anywhere against any covered ship. Limiting jurisdiction      over prohibited acts committed by United States nationals to      those directed against only foreign ships and ships outside      the United States does not fulfill our treaty      responsibilities to guard against all wrongful conduct by our      own nationals.       Moreover, as presently drafted, there is no federal      jurisdiction over alien attacks against foreign vessels      within the United States, except in the unlikely situation      that no state crime is involved. This is a potentially      serious gap. Finally, until the federal criminal jurisdiction      over the expanded portion of the territorial sea of the      United States is clarified, there remains some doubt about      federal criminal jurisdiction over aliens committing      prohibited acts against foreign vessels in the expanded      portion of the territorial sea of the United States (i.e.,      from 3 to 12 nautical miles out). Consequently, striking the      limiting phrases in clauses (ii) and (iii) ensures federal      jurisdiction, unless the bar to prosecution under subsection      2280(c) relating to labor disputes is applicable, in all      situations that are required by the Maritime Convention.                              section 607       This section expands federal jurisdiction over certain bomb      threats or hoaxes. Presently, 18 U.S.C. 844(e), covers      threats to damage by fire or explosive property protected by      18 U.S.C. 844(f) or (i), if the United States mails, the      telephone or some other instrument of commerce is used to      convey the threat or the false information. Section 607      removes any jurisdictional nexus for the means used to convey      the threat or false information. A sufficient jurisdictional      nexus is contained in the targeted property itself, i.e., the      property (1) belongs to the United States Government, (2) is      owned by an organization receiving federal funds, or (3) is      used in or affects interstate or foreign commerce. The threat      provision has also been drafted to cover a threat to commit      an arson in violation of 18 U.S.C. 81 against property      located in the special maritime and territorial jurisdiction      of the United States.                              section 608       This section would amend the explosives chapter of title 18      to provide generally that a conspiracy to commit an offense      under that chapter is punishable by the same maximum term as      that applicable to the substantive offense that was the      object of the conspiracy. In contrast, the general conspiracy      statute, 18 U.S.C. 371, provides for a maximum of five years'      imprisonment. This provision accords with several recent      Congressional enactments, including 21 U.S.C. 846 (applicable      to drug conspiracies) and 18 U.S.C. 1956(h) (applicable to      money laundering conspiracies). See also section 320105 of      Pub. Law 103-322, which raised the penalty for the offense of      conspiracy to travel interstate with intent to commit murder      for hire (18 U.S.C. 1958). This trend in federal law, which      is emulated in the penal codes of many States, recognizes      that, as the Supreme Court has observed, ``collective      criminal agreement--partnership in crime--presents a greater      potential threat to the public than individual delicts.''      Callanan v. United States, 364 U.S. 587, 593 (1961); accord      United States v. Feola, 420 U.S. 671, 693-4 (1975).       Section 608 includes the introductory phrase ``[e]xcept as      provided in this section'' in order to take account of one      area where a different maximum penalty will apply. Section      110518(b) of Pub. Law 103-322 enacted a special twenty-year      maximum prison penalty (18 U.S.C. 844(m)) for conspiracies to      violate 18 U.S.C. 844(h), which prohibits using an explosive      to commit certain crimes and which carries a mandatory five-     year prison term for the completed crime. Like section      844(m), the proposed amendment exempts the penalty of death      for a conspiracy offense.                              section 609       Section 609 would cure an anomaly in 18 U.S.C. 115. The      statute presently punishes violent crimes against the      immediate families of certain former federal officials and      law enforcement officers (including prosecutors) in      retaliation for acts undertaken while the former official was      in office. However, the former official is not protected      against such crimes. Federal investigators, prosecutors, and      judges who are involved in terrorism cases are often the      subject of death threats. The danger posed to the safety of      such officers does not necessarily abate when they leave      government service. Former United States officials should be      protected by federal law against retaliation directed at      [[Page S2527]] the past performance of their official duties.      Section 609 would provide such protection.                              section 610       The changes made by this section are similar to that made      by section 608 for explosives conspiracies.       This section adds ``conspiracy'' to several offenses likely      to be committed by terrorists. Conspiracy is added to the      offense itself to ensure that coconspirators are subject to      the same penalty applicable to those perpetrators who attempt      or complete the offense. Presently, the maximum possible      imprisonment provided under the general conspiracy statute,      18 U.S.C. 371, is only five years. The offenses for which      conspiracy is being added are: 18 U.S.C. 32 (destruction of      aircraft), 37 (violence at airports serving international      civil aviation), 115 (certain violent crimes against former      federal officials, added by section 609, and family members      of current or former federal officials), 175 (prohibitions      with respect to biological weapons), 1203 (hostage taking),      2280 (violence against maritime navigation), and 2281      (violence against maritime fixed platforms), and 49 U.S.C.      46502 (relating to aircraft piracy).                              section 701       This section sets forth the congressional findings for      title VII                              section 702       Amending subsection 573(d) of chapter 8 of the Foreign      Assistance Act of 1961 (22 U.S.C. 2349aa2) would allow more      flexibility and efficiency in the Department of State's      Antiterrorism Training Assistance (ATA) program by permitting      more courses to be taught overseas and allowing for      instructors to teach overseas for up to 180 days. Current law      allows training overseas for only certain specified types of      courses and only for up to 30 days. Deleting subsection (f)      of section 573 would allow for some personnel expenses for      administering the ATA program to be met through the foreign      aid appropriation. Currently, all such costs are paid from      the Department of State's Salaries and Expenses      account.
