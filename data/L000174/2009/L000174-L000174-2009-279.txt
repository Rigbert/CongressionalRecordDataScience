President, I am pleased to introduce today the Upper Connecticut River Partnership Act. This legislation will help bring recognition to New England's largest river ecosystem and one of our Nation's 14 American Heritage Rivers.  The purpose of this legislation is to help the communities along the river protect and enhance their rich cultural history, economic vitality, and the environmental integrity of the river.  From its origin in the mountains of northern New Hampshire, the Connecticut River runs over 400 miles and eventually empties into Long Island Sound. The river forms a natural boundary between my home state of Vermont and New Hampshire, and travels through the States of Massachusetts and Connecticut. The river and surrounding valley have long shaped and influenced development in the New England region. This river is one of America's earliest developed rivers, with European settlements going back over 350 years. The industrial revolution blossomed in the Connecticut River Valley, supported by new technologies such as canals and mills run by hydropower.  I am pleased that the entire Senate delegations from Vermont and New Hampshire have cosponsored this bill. For years our States have worked together, to help communities on both sides of the river develop local partnerships to protect the Connecticut River valley of Vermont and New Hampshire. While great improvements have been made to the river, its overall health remains threatened by water and air pollution, habitat loss, hydroelectric dams, and invasive species.  Historically, the people throughout the Upper Connecticut River Valley have functioned cooperatively and the river serves to unite Vermont and New Hampshire communities economically, culturally, and environmentally.  Citizens on both sides of the river know just how special this region is and have worked side by side for years to protect it. Efforts have been underway for some time to restore the Atlantic salmon fishery, protect threatened and endangered species, and support urban riverfront revitalization.  In 1989, Vermont and New Hampshire came together to create the Connecticut River Joint Commissions--a unique partnership between the states, local businesses, all levels of Government within the 2 States and citizens from all walks of life. This partnership helps coordinate the efforts of towns, watershed managers and other local groups to implement the Connecticut River Corridor Management Plan. This Plan has become the blueprint for how communities along the river can work with one another with Vermont and New Hampshire and with the federal government to protect the river's resources.  The Upper Connecticut River Partnership Act would help carry out the recommendations of the Connecticut River Corridor Management Plan, which was developed under New Hampshire law with the active participation of Vermont citizens and communities.  This act would also provide the Secretary of the Interior with the much needed ability to assist the States of New Hampshire and Vermont with technical and financial aid for the Upper Connecticut River Valley through the Connecticut River Joint Commissions. The act would also assist local communities with cultural heritage outreach and education programs while enriching the recreational activities already active in the Connecticut River Watershed of Vermont and New Hampshire.  Lastly, the bill will require that the Secretary of the Interior establish a Connecticut River Grants and Technical Assistance Program to help local community groups develop new projects as well as build on existing ones to enhance the river basin.  In the future, I hope this bill will help bring renewed recognition and increased efforts to conserve the Connecticut River as one of our Nation's great natural and economic resources.  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be printed in the Record.  There being no objection, the text of the bill was ordered to be printed in the Record, as follwos:                                S. 1117       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of      the United States of America in Congress assembled,     SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.       This Act may be cited as the ``Upper Connecticut River      Partnership Act''.     SEC. 2. FINDINGS AND PURPOSE.       (a) Findings.--Congress finds that--       (1) the upper Connecticut River watershed in the States of      New Hampshire and Vermont is a scenic region of historic      villages located in a working landscape of farms, forests,      and the mountainous headwaters and broad fertile floodplains      of New England's longest river, the Connecticut River;       (2) the River provides outstanding fish and wildlife      habitat, recreation, and hydropower generation for the New      England region;       (3) the upper Connecticut River watershed has been      recognized by Congress as part of the Silvio O. Conte      National Fish and Wildlife Refuge, established by the Silvio      O. Conte National Fish and Wildlife Refuge Act (16 U.S.C.      668dd note; Public Law 102-212);       (4) the demonstrated commitment to stewardship of the River      by the citizens living in the watershed led to the      Presidential designation of the River as 1 of 14 American      Heritage Rivers on July 30, 1998;       (5) the River is home to the bi-State Connecticut River      Scenic Byway, which was declared a National Scenic Byway by      the Department of Transportation in 2005 to foster heritage      tourism in the region;       (6) each of the legislatures of the States of Vermont and      New Hampshire has established a commission for the      Connecticut River watershed, and the 2 commissions, known      collectively as the ``Connecticut River Joint Commissions''--       (A) have worked together since 1989; and       (B) serve as the focal point and catalyst for cooperation      between Federal agencies, States, communities, and citizens;       (7) in 1997, as directed by the legislatures, the      Connecticut River Joint Commissions, with the substantial      involvement of 5 bi-State local river subcommittees appointed      to represent riverfront towns, produced the 6 volume      Connecticut River Corridor Management Plan, to be used as a      blueprint in educating agencies, communities, and the public      in how to be good neighbors to a great river;       (8) in 2009, after 3 years of broad consultation, the      Connecticut River Joint Commissions have substantially      expanded and published updates via the Connecticut River      Recreation Management Plan and the Water Resources Management      Plan to guide public and private activities in the watershed;       (9) through a joint legislative resolution, the      legislatures of the States of Vermont and New Hampshire have      requested that Congress provide for continuation of      cooperative partnerships and that Federal agencies support      the Connecticut River Joint Commissions in carrying out the      recommendations of the Connecticut River Corridor Management      Plan;       (10) this Act effectuates certain recommendations of the      Connecticut River Corridor Management Plan that are most      appropriately directed by the States through the Connecticut      River Joint Commissions, with assistance from the National      Park Service and the United States Fish and Wildlife Service;      and       (11) where implementation of those recommendations involves      partnership with local communities and organizations, support      for the partnership should be provided by the Secretary.       (b) Purpose.--The purpose of this Act is to authorize the      Secretary to provide to the States of New Hampshire and      Vermont (including communities in those States), through the      Connecticut River Joint Commissions, technical and financial      assistance for management of the River.
