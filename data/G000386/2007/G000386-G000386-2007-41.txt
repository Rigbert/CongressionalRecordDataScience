 We didn't get what we wanted, and consequently, you know, let's have a commission study it.  The Commission ended up, in this report, recommending the very measures which we have included in this bill. So they want a study? The study says what we said in 2002 that the conferees didn't think we ought to do. And we have had all the eggheads and farmers in this country study the problem we presented in 2002, and they gave us the results we have here.  The report said also that the 2007 farm bill is the time for these reforms. You might remember the last time we had a vote on payment limits was in a budget bill a couple of years ago. Manyof our colleagues said they agreed with what we were trying to do, but they said the budget was not the right time; it needs to be done on the farm bill. To all of our colleagues who said: Wait for the farm bill, we are waiting. You have your opportunity. It is 2007. We have the farm bill here.  By voting in favor of this amendment, we can allow young people to get into farming and lessen the dependence on Federal subsidies. This will help restore public respectability for the Federal farm program and keep urban support for the farm program so we can continue to have a stable supply of food for our consumers.  I call upon my colleagues to support this commonsense amendment, and I reserve the remainder of time for our side.  I yield the floor.
