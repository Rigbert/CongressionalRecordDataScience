 DODD. I am worried about an obligation that we all have this evening. We are getting pressed. I want to be careful about asking Members to hang around when we all have an obligation--100 of us. I suggest that we enter into an agreement if we can. I am hopeful this can be worked out. There may be a side-by-side. I would be agreeable to setting a time certain tonight--preferably tomorrow, with debate tonight and a vote in the morning--maybe an hour after we come in, or a half hour after we come in. We will have to make sure the leadership is fine with that.
