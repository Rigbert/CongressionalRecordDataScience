That is a tribute to Chairman Jeffords and the ranking member, Senator Kennedy from Massachusetts, and all the members of the committee and the Members of the Senate participating in this debate.  However, there remains at least one issue of concern, one issue that was a subject of extensive debate today. That issue is a provision regarding the 510(k) approval process for class I and class II devices. As I mentioned previously, these class I and class II devices are serious medical devices. This is not a Band-Aid or gauze. These are lasers or biopsy needles or many other complicated, necessary medical devices.  As a result, we cannot, I think, assume that this is a small or inconsequential issue we are debating. It is a very important issue.  Essentially, the legislation that is before the Senate today limits the FDA from looking behind the stated use on the label presented by the manufacturer when they request approval to put a new product on the market. It is important, in certain cases, to make such a searching review beyond the proposed use by the manufacturer. It is particularly important in the case where there is strong suspicion that the label is either misleading or fraudulent or false. Although my amendment was not favorably considered earlier today, it would have given the authority to the FDA to look beyond the label in cases where they could show--and this is a very high standard of proof--that the label was false or misleading.  There is no other provision in this new legislation that would give the FDA such authority. Indeed, one could ask why the proponents of this legislation deliberately chose to remove the FDA's authority and to effectively prevent the FDA from conducting a thorough review of medical devices as they come on the market.  I have outlined, as many of my colleagues have, the detailed reaction of several sections of the FDA law. It is complicated, arcane legislative language.  I have tried to think of a more homely and mundane example which might illustrate the dilemma the FDA would be facing as it contemplates this new legislation. If the FDA were in the position of not approving medical devices but approving, for example, land transportation vehicles, they might be confronted with an existing model, perhaps a Ford Mustang. And say, for example, a new product such as an F-16 fighter plane is presented for review. Both can move over the ground, both of them are fairly fast, and both of them have certain similar aerodynamic capacities. Both of them can carry passengers. So one could make the argument that the F-16 could be substantially equivalent in use as a ground transportation vehicle.  But I think anyone would have to say, upon looking at both of these devices, that there is a strong suggestion the F-16 can be used for something else. If the FDA, or in this example, the hypothetical agency, did not have the authority to ask the simple question: Will it be used to fly and can it fly? The hypothetical agency may not be doing the job.  That is a homely example to illustrate that the FDA is frequently confronted with devices that are presented as being substantially equivalent to existing devices. These new devices may be similarly labeled to that existing device, but they have the potential for other uses. If it is obvious that the device is for uses not listed on the label, the FDA should have the authority to make an inquiry into those other uses.  In fact, my suspicion is that in the development of new medical devices there is a long history of starts and stops. A history of contact with other individuals, many researchers working together, exploring different uses and alternatives, different materials. In that process, it is very likely that other issues are contemplated, evaluated and perhaps designed into the device.  Today we have a system where there is more incentive for approaching the FDA with a petition of a 510(k) approval because that is the fastest way to the marketplace. Even if there were uses that were discussed and contemplated, even if there are obvious uses that might become part of common practice, those may be dismissed in order to get this through the system quickly.  What we have done today by not adopting my amendment is effectively prohibit the FDA from making that searching inquiry into possible uses. The consequences can be severe to the public health.  Despite all of these issues we have discussed, this bill represents significant progress on many fronts. We are very, very close. I hope in the ensuing conference--or before we go to conference--that we could address this particular issue. It is an issue that has been highlighted by Secretary Shalala. It has been highlighted with respect to the potential for a Presidential veto. I hope we don't reach that point.  The hard work that has been done over many months by my colleagues, the hard work of many representatives of the industry, and the hard work of public health advocates I think will lead us, if we can get over this hurdle, to a bill that we will all be proud of.  In conclusion, today we have spent some time discussing the industry. We have spent some time discussing the FDA. There have been criticisms by Members with respect to both the industry and the FDA. Our job at this point is not to demonize or deify anyone. It is to get good laws passed. I believe this legislation can be approved and can succeed.  I note the majority leader is standing by, and I yield back my time.                          ____________________
