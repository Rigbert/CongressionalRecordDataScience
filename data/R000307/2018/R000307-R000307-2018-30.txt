President, I would only add at this point--and I think Members who have paid attention to this debate at all or to this particular issue are probably a little tired of hearing this, but maybe there are some who haven't really grasped the issue. We have to get a farm bill.  We are the Agriculture Committee. Agriculture is in dire need of this farm bill--the farmers, the ranchers, the growers, their lenders, and everybody up the food chain. Our situation being what it is, I certainly hope that improves.  Many people, of course, are interested in opening up any bill to amendments, having regular order, and voting on their amendments. I understand that. I think there are about 146 amendments we have agreed to. We are reaching out to people and urging them to come forward and, on a bipartisan basis, agree on these amendments or modify them and then agree to them. So it isn't as if we have not done that.  At some point, we have to pass this bill. The issue is so paramount and the situation is so dire--on behalf of the folks who produce the food and fiber for this country in a troubled and hungry world to at least go on for another year--that it is paramount over any other issue, despite the fact that some people want to come in under a reform they believe would be very salutary, and I understand that. Again, we have to pass this bill.  With that observation, I hope people can understand and we can get some agreement with regard to some of these issues. None of my remarks are intended to impugn in any way the interest of the distinguished Senator from Florida.  I yield the floor.
