  Mr. DeFAZIO. Mr. Speaker, today the Transportation Safety Administration finally announced that they are going to plug a huge, gaping loophole in aviation security, 15 months after I first brought this issue to their attention.  While Americans nationwide stand patiently in line and the pilots and flight attendants are standing in line, sometimes unnecessarily long lines because of an arbitrary cap on the number of screeners by the Republican majority, unbeknownst to them, hundreds of thousands of people on a daily basis have been filing around security carrying whatever they wanted, just flashing an ID at a guard. That is, all the vendors who work in the airport, the people who have access to the terminal and to the airplanes.  Finally today, today, after being beat over the head for months, the Transportation Security Administration is going to require that those people also go through security so that they will not be able to carry contraband, weapons, drugs or whatever through, to be smuggled aboard airplanes. This will improve security for Americans. It took an awfully long time to get action from the Bush administration to fill this loophole.                          ____________________
