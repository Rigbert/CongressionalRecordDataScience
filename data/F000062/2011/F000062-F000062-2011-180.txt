 President, I rise to call for a new effort to combat an often deadly form of cancer--by re-introducing the Lung Cancer Mortality Reduction Act. I am pleased to be joined by my cosponsors, Senator Isakson and Senator Kerry on this very important bill.  This bill will renew and improve Federal government's efforts to combat lung cancer. It will: set a goal to reduce lung cancer mortality by 50 percent by 2020; establish a Lung Cancer Mortality Reduction Program, with comprehensive interagency coordination, to develop and implement a plan to meet this goal; improve disparity programs to ensure that the burdens of lung cancer on minority populations are addressed; create a computed tomography screening demonstration project based on recent science; and establish a Lung Cancer Advisory Board, which will provide an annual report to Congress on the progress of the Mortality Reduction Program.  We have made great strides against many types of cancer in the last several decades. However, these gains are uneven.  When the National Cancer Act was passed in 1971, lung cancer had a 5-year survival rate of only 12 percent. After decades of research efforts and scientific advances, this survival rate remains only 15 percent.  In contrast, the 5 year survival rates of breast, prostate, and colon cancer have risen to 89, 99 and 65 percent respectively.  Lung cancer is the leading cause of cancer death for both men and women, accounting for 28 percent of all cancer deaths.  Lung cancer causes more deaths annually than: colon cancer, breast cancer, prostate cancer, and pancreatic cancer combined.  A National Cancer Institute study in 2009 indicated that the value of life lost to lung cancer will exceed $433 billion annually by 2020.  A four percent annual decline in mortality would reduce this amount by more than half.  A lung cancer diagnosis can be devastating. The average life expectancy following a lung cancer diagnosis is only 9 months.  This is because far too many patients are not diagnosed with lung cancer until it has progressed to the later stages. Lung cancer can be hard to diagnose, and symptoms may at first appear to be other illnesses, such as bronchitis, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, or asthma.  As a result, only 16 percent of lung cancer patients are diagnosed when their cancer is still localized, and is the most treatable.  When I introduced this legislation in 2009, lung cancer lacked early detection technology, to find the cancer when it was most treatable. Now, however, preliminary results show a screening method with a demonstrated reduction in mortality for lung cancer.  In 2010, the National Cancer Institute released initial results from the National Lung Screening Trial, a large-scale study of screening methods to detect lung cancers at earlier stages.  The National Lung Screening Trial found a 20 percent reduction in lung cancer mortality among participants screened with the computed tomography screening versus a traditional X-ray.  This is the first time that researchers have seen evidence of a significant reduction in lung cancer mortality with a screening test.  This is why this legislation also includes the creation of a computed tomography screening demonstration project, to assess public health needs of screening for lung cancer, and develop the most effective, safe, equitable, and efficient process to maximize the benefit of screening.  Efforts to fight lung cancer lag behind other cancers, in part, due to stigma from smoking. Make no mistake, tobacco use causes the majority of lung cancer cases.  Tobacco cessation is a critical component of reducing lung cancer mortality. Less smoking means less lung cancer. Period.  But tobacco use does not fully explain lung cancer. Approximately 20 percent of lung cancer patients never smoked.  Two-thirds of individuals diagnosed with lung cancer who have never smoked are women.  60 percent of lung cancer patients are former smokers who quit, often decades ago.  These patients may have been exposed to second hand smoke, or they may have been exposed to radon, asbestos, chromium, or other chemicals. There could be other causes and associations that have not yet been discovered, genetic predispositions or other environmental exposures.  The President's National Cancer Advisory Board Report of 2010 identified radon as the second leading cause of lung cancer after smoking and listed 15 other environmental contaminants strongly associated with lung cancer.  I believe that we have the expertise and technology to make serious progress against this deadly cancer, and to reach the goal of halving lung cancer mortality by 2020.  We need this legislation to ensure that our government's resources are focused on this mission in the most efficient way possible.  Agency efforts must be coordinated, and all sectors of the federal government that may have some ideas to lend should be participating. That is what the Lung Cancer Mortality Reduction Program will accomplish.  In this bill the Secretary of Health and Human Services is tasked to workin consultation with Secretaries and Directors from the Department of Defense, Veterans Affairs, the National Institutes of Health, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, and Food and Drug Administration, the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid, and the National Center on Minority Health and Health Disparities.  This means that each agency with an expertise on lungs, imaging, and cancer will be included in this long overdue process.  We can do better for Americans diagnosed with lung cancer. I ask my colleagues to support this legislation.  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be printed in the Record.  There being no objection, the text of the bill was ordered to be printed in the Record, as follows:                                 S. 752       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of      the United States of America in Congress assembled,     SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.       This Act may be cited as the ``Lung Cancer Mortality      Reduction Act of 2011''.     SEC. 2. FINDINGS.       Congress makes the following findings:       (1) Lung cancer is the leading cause of cancer death for      both men and women, accounting for 28 percent of all cancer      deaths.       (2) The National Cancer Institute estimates that in 2010,      there were 222,520 new diagnosis of lung cancer and 157,300      deaths attributed to the disease.       (3) According to projections published in the Journal of      Clinical Oncology in 2009, between 2010 and 2030, the      incidence of lung cancer will increase by 46 percent for      women and by 58 percent for men. The increase in the      incidence of lung cancer among minority communities during      that time period will range from 74 percent to 191 percent.       (4) Lung cancer causes more deaths annually than the next 4      leading causes of cancer deaths, colon cancer, breast cancer,      prostate cancer, and pancreatic cancer, combined.       (5) The 5-year survival rate for lung cancer is only 15      percent, while the 5-year survival rate for breast cancer is      89 percent, for prostate cancer 99 percent, and for colon      cancer 65 percent. Yet in research dollars per death, lung      cancer is the least funded of the major cancers.       (6) In 2001, the Lung Cancer Progress Review Group of the      National Cancer Institute stated that funding for lung cancer      research was ``far below the levels characterized for other      common malignancies and far out of proportion to its massive      health impact'' and it gave the ``highest priority'' to the      creation of an integrated multidisciplinary, multi-     institutional research program. No comprehensive plan has      been developed.       (7) While smoking is the leading risk factor for lung      cancer, the President's National Cancer Advisory Board Report      of 2010 identified radon as the second leading cause of lung      cancer and listed 15 other environmental contaminants      strongly association with lung cancer, and there is      accumulating evidence that hormonal and genetic factors may      influence the onset.       (8) Lung cancer is the most stigmatized of all the cancers      and the only cancer blamed on patients, whether they smoked      or not.       (9) Nearly 20 percent of lung cancer patients have never      smoked. Sixty percent of individuals diagnosed with lung      cancer are former smokers who quit, often decades ago.       (10) Lung cancer in men and women who never smoked is the      sixth leading cause of cancer death. Of individuals diagnosed      with lung cancer who have never smoked, \2/3\ of are women.       (11) Lung cancer is the leading cause of cancer death in      the overall population and in every major ethnic grouping,      including white, African American, Hispanic, Asian and      Pacific Islander, American Indian, and Alaskan Native, with      an even disproportionately higher impact on African American      males that has not been addressed.       (12) Military personnel, veterans, and munitions workers      exposed to carcinogens such as Agent Orange, crystalline      forms of silica, arsenic, uranium, beryllium, and battlefield      fuel emissions have increased risk for lung cancer.       (13) Only 16 percent of lung cancer is being diagnosed at      an early stage and there were no targets for the early      detection or treatment of lung cancer included in the      Department of Health and Human Services's ``Healthy People      2010'' or ``Healthy People 2020''.       (14) An actuarial analysis carried out by Milliman Inc. and      published in Population Health Management Journal in 2009      indicated that early detection of lung cancer could save more      than 70,000 lives a year in the United States.       (15) A National Cancer Institute study in 2009 indicated      that while the value of life lost to lung cancer will exceed      $433,000,000,000 a year by 2020, a 4 percent annual decline      in lung cancer mortality would reduce that amount by more      than half.       (16) In 2010, the National Cancer Institute released      initial results from the National Lung Screening Trial, a      large-scale randomized national trial that compared the      effect of low-dose helical computed tomography (``CT'') and a      standard chest x-ray on lung cancer mortality. The study      found 20 percent fewer lung cancer deaths among study      participants screened with the CT scan.     SEC. 3. SENSE OF THE SENATE CONCERNING INVESTMENT IN LUNG                    CANCER RESEARCH.       It is the sense of the Senate that--       (1) lung cancer mortality reduction should be made a      national public health priority; and       (2) a comprehensive mortality reduction program coordinated      by the Secretary of Health and Human Services is justified      and necessary to adequately address all aspects of lung      cancer and reduce lung cancer mortality among current      smokers, former smokers, and non-smokers.     SEC. 4. LUNG CANCER MORTALITY REDUCTION PROGRAM.       Part P of title III of the Public Health Service Act (42      U.S.C. 280g et seq.) is amended by adding at the end the      following:     ``SEC. 399V-6.
