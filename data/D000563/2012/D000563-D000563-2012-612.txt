President, at this point I wish to make a unanimous consent request relative to this bill that would open the Supreme Court proceedings to be televised.  I ask unanimous consent the Senate proceed to the consideration of Calendar No. 319, S. 1945, a bill to permit the televising of Supreme Court proceedings; that the bill be read a third time and passed; and the motion to reconsider be laid upon the table with no intervening action or debate.
