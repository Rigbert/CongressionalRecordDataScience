President, in its statement, the Maine Medical Association states that ``such a ban would deny a patient and her physician the right to make medically appropriate decisions about the best course for that patient's care. . . . The intervention of legislative bodies into medical decisionmaking is inappropriate, ill advised and dangerous.''  The MMA statement goes on to say:       . . . when serious fetal anomalies are discovered or a      pregnant woman develops a life or health-threatening medical      condition that makes continuation of the pregnancy dangerous,      abortion--  Unfortunately, I add--       may be medically necessary. In these cases, intact dilation      and evacuation procedures may provide substantial medical      benefits or, in fact, may be the only option. This procedure      may be safer than the alternatives . . . [may] reduce blood      loss, and reduce the potential for other complications.  That is what the experts are telling us. That is what the doctors are telling us.  Our amendment goes far beyond, in many ways, what the Senator from Pennsylvania is attempting to accomplish. His legislation would only prohibit one specific medical procedure. It will not prevent a single late-term abortion. Let me emphasize that point. The partial-birth legislation before us would not prevent a single late-term abortion. A physician could simply useanother, perhaps more dangerous, method to end the pregnancy.  By contrast, the Durbin-Snowe proposal would prohibit the abortion of any viable fetus by any method unless the abortion is necessary to preserve the life of the mother or to prevent grievous injury to her physical health.  We have taken great care to tightly limit the health exception in our bill to grievous injury to the mother's physical health. It would not allow late-term abortions to be performed simply because a woman is depressed or feeling stressed or has some minor physical health problem because of pregnancy.  Moreover, we have included a very important second safeguard. The initial opinion of the treating physician that the continuation of pregnancy would threaten the mother's life or risk grievous injury to her physical health must be confirmed by a second opinion from an independent physician.  This second opinion must come from an independent physician who will not be involved in the abortion procedure and who has not been involved in the treatment of the mother. This second physician must also certify--in writing--that, in his or her medical judgment, the continuation of the pregnancy would threaten the mother's life or risk grievous injury to her physical health.  What we are talking about are the severe, medically diagnosable threats to a woman's physical health that are sometimes brought on or aggravated by pregnancy.  Let me give you a few examples: Primary pulmonary hypertension, which can cause sudden death or intractable congestive heart failure; severe pregnancy-aggravated hypertension with accompanying kidney or liver failure; complications from aggravated diabetes such as amputation or blindness; or an inability to treat aggressive cancers such as leukemia, breast cancer, or non-Hodgkins lymphoma.  These are all obstetric conditions that are cited in the medical literature as possible indications for pregnancy terminations. In these extremely rare cases--where the mother has been certified by two physicians to be at risk of losing her life or suffering grievous physical harm--I believe that we should leave the very difficult decisions about what should be done to the best judgment of the women, families, and physicians involved.  The Durbin-Snowe-Collins amendment is a fair and compassionate compromise on this extremely difficult issue. It would ensure that all late-term abortions--including partial-birth abortions--are strictly limited to those rare and tragic cases where the life or the physical health of the mother is in serious jeopardy. This amendment presents an unusual opportunity for both ``pro-choice'' and ``pro-life'' advocates to work together on a reasonable approach, and I urge our colleagues to join us in supporting it.                               Exhibit 1       The Maine Medical Association takes no position on the      moral or ethical issue of abortion. Our membership includes      individuals who are ``pro-choice'' and ``pro-life.''       Still, abortion currently is a legal medical procedure in      the United States. Accordingly, the Maine Medical Association      opposes any legislation proposed to ban any legal medical      procedure whether that be abortion, ``intact dilation and      extraction'' (partial birth abortion), or another medical      procedure. Such a ban would deny a patient and her physician      the right to make medical-appropriate decisions about the      best course for that patient's care. The determination of the      medical need for and effectiveness of a particular medical      procedure must be left to the patient and her physician      acting in conformity with standards of good medical care.       In addition, imposing civil or criminal sanctions on      physicians who perform abortions would have a chilling effect      on physicians' willingness to perform legal abortions. Doing      so would limit patients' access to safe abortions. The Maine      Medical Association opposes such efforts to ``criminialize''      the practice of medicine.       An abortion performed in the second or third trimester or      after viability is extremely difficult for everyone involved.      The Maine Medical Association does not support elective      abortions in the last stage of pregnancy. However, when      serious fetal anomalies are discovered or the pregnant woman      develops a life or health-threatening medical condition that      makes continuation of the pregnancy dangerous, abortion may      be medically necessary. In these cases, intact dilation and      evacuation procedures may provide substantial medical      benefits or, in fact, may be the only option. This procedure      may be safer than the alternatives, maintain uterine      integrity, reduce blood loss, and reduce the potential for      other complications. Also, this procedure permits the      performance of a careful autopsy and, therefore, a more      accurate diagnosis of a fetal anomaly. This would permit      women who wish to have additional children to receive      appropriate genetic counseling and better prenatal care and      testing in future pregnancies. The intact dilation and      extraction procedure may be the most medically appropriate      procedure for a woman in a particular case.       The intervention of legislative bodies into medical      decision-making is inappropriate, ill-advised, and dangerous.      The Maine Medical Association urges the Maine Legislature and      the People of Maine to allow the patient and her doctor to      determine the most appropriate method of care based upon      accepted standards of care in the medical profession and upon      the patient's individual circumstances.
