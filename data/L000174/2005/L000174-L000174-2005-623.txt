It is as though those currently in power believe they are above our constitutional checks and balances and they can reinterpret any treaty, law, rule, custom, or practice. If they don't like it or they find it inconvenient, they set it aside. It was tragic that the committee that judges the judges did not follow its own rules but broke them to achieve a predetermined result.  It was through these means that divisive and controversial judicial nominees were repeatedly brought before the Senate in the last Congress. It was through these abuses that the majority acted as handmaidens to the administration to create confrontation after confrontation over controversial nominees. They dragged the judiciary, which should be above politics, into the political thicket and did so for partisan gain.  I applaud the Senator from Pennsylvania who has worked to bring us back in the Senate Judiciary Committee to following our rules in the comity that makes it work. I regret that filibusters have been necessary in the past 2 years. I wish Republicans would not have followed their years of secret holds and pocket filibusters of more than 60 of President Clinton's nominees, judicial nominees, and more than 200 of his executive nominees. I wish they would not have flipped the script once a Republican became President and dismembered the rules and traditions of the Judiciary Committee.  I have urged consultation and cooperation over the last 4 years. I had the privilege of chairing the Senate Judiciary Committee for 17 months with President Bush in the White House, and we confirmed 100 of President Bush's judicial nominees, including a number of controversial nominees, including some I was opposed to. I voted against them, but I made sure they got hearings.  The President and his enablers in the Senate cannot seem to take ``yes'' for an answer. The Senate has confirmed 208 of his judicial nominees and we are withholding consent on 5.  He rejects our advice, but he demands our consent. That is wrong, and that goes against the Constitution. The Constitution speaks of advice and consent, not order and rubberstamp.  What the White House ignores is that President Bush completed his first term with the third highest total of confirmed judges in our history--in our history--and more Federal judges on the courts than at any time in our history. The truth is, Senate Democrats have cooperated extensively in confirming more than 95 percent of this President's judicial nominees--208 of them.  George Washington, the most popular and powerful President in our history, was not successful in all of his judicial nominations. The Senate rejected President Washington's nomination of John Rutledge to be Chief Justice of the Supreme Court. For example. And certainly I would hope that the current President would not assume he stands higher in our history books than George Washington.  The truth is, in President Bush's first term, the 204 judges confirmed were more than were confirmed in either of President Clinton's two terms, more than during the term of this President's father, and more than Ronald Reagan's first term when he had a Republican majority in the Senate. By last December, we had reduced judicial vacancies from the 110 vacancies I inherited in the summer of 2001 to its lowest level, lowest rate, and lowest number in decades, since President Ronald Reagan was in office.  Unfortunately, this President has chosen confrontation over cooperation. In fact, it is mid-May, and he has only sent one new nomination to the Senate all year. Im connection with that nomination, Democrats on the Judiciary Committee have written to the Chairman urging a prompt hearing. With the support of the nominee's home-state Senators, one a Democrat and one a Republican, the nomination of Brian Sandoval will be added to the long list of judicial confirmations.  But that leave 30 judicial vacancies without nominations. Back on April 11, the Democratic leader and I wrote to the President urging him to work with Senators of both parties to identify nominees for these 30 vacancies. To date, he has not responded. Instead he, his Vice President, his Chief of Staff and his spokesperson continue to prod the Senate toward triggering the nuclear option. I ask unanimous consent to have that letter printed in the Record.  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in the Record, as follows:                                                  U.S. Senate,                                   Washington, DC, April 11, 2005.     Hon. George W. Bush,     President,     Washington, DC.       Dear Mr. President: There are currently 28 vacancies on the      Federal courts of appeals and district courts for which you      have not forwarded nominees to the Senate. We write to offer      to help you obtain consultation and advice from the Senate on      these vacancies so that you may select nominees who will      generate strong, bipartisan support.       This evening the Senate is scheduled to consider your      nomination of Paul Crotty to become a federal judge in New      York. We expect Mr. Crotty to be confirmed with the support      of his home-state Senators and an overwhelming vote. We have      each been urging you for some time to work with the Senate to      fill federal judicial vacancies with qualified, consensus      nominees. It is now imperative that we do so.       When you met with Russian President Putin earlier this      year, you noted that     checks and balances and an independent judiciary are among      the fundamental requirements of democracy. We agree. We      therefore urge you to make clear to Senate Republican leaders      that you do not favor the so-called ``nuclear option'' which      would remove an important check on executive power. Instead,      let us work together to identify consensus judicial      candidates. Let us preserve our independent judiciary, which      is the envy of the world.           Respectfully,     Harry Reid,       Democratic Leader.     Patrick Leahy,       Ranking Member.                                  ____
