 Bunning):  S. 1323. A bill to amend the Federal Power Act to ensure that certain Federal power customers are provided protection by the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission, and for other purposes; to the Committee on Environment and Public Works.                    THE TVA CUSTOMER PROTECTION ACT  Mr. McCONNELL. Mr. President, I have come to the Senate floor today to introduce a bill known as the TVA Customer Protection Act. This legislation will implement a number of consumer protections that will make TVA accountable to ratepayers and better prepare TVA to compete in a restructured electricity market. I am pleased to have Senator Bunning as an original cosponsor on this bill.  The legislation I am introducing, which is virtually identical to the legislation I introduced in the 105th Congress, provides Valley ratepayers protections against unchecked and unjustified increases in their power rates. Included in this bill are checks against future increases in TVA's massive debt. This bill will put an end to TVA's ability to compete unfairly with its regional distributors and will prohibit TVA from sticking ratepayers with the bill for its international forays that have no relevance to its responsibility to provide low-cost power to the Valley. Finally, this bill also codifies an agreement between TVA and several industry associations to limit TVA's authority as a government entity to compete with small businesses in non-electric services.  Mr. President, TVA is a federal corporation that was first established in 1933, to tame the Tennessee River, our nation's fifth largest river, and to bring economic development to this once poverty stricken region. Today, TVA provides power to nearly all of Tennessee and to parts of six other states covering over 80,000 square miles and serving eight million consumers. The bulk of TVA's power sales are made through municipal and cooperative distributors, which in turn are responsible for delivering that power to every home, office and farm in the Valley. TVA has exclusive power contracts with its distributors and the three-member TVA board sets the retail rates offered by distributors.  Mr. President, while TVA has achieved significant success, it has not come without a price. Today, TVA customers are paying a premium for TVA's excesses and mismanagement. For example, TVA has accumulated an enormous debt of nearly $26 billion, despite its monopoly status and the Board's unilateral rate making authority. As a result, in 1998, TVA customers paid an astronomical 30 cents of every $1 to interest expenses. When you match TVA's interest charge of 30 cents to the 11 cents paid by the Federal Government, it makes Uncle Sam look like a conservative financial planner. When compared to the average regulated public utility, which pays a mere 7 percent in finance cost, it is obvious that this isn't a good deal for TVA ratepayers.  In a 1994 study, the General Accounting Office determined that TVA's financial condition ``threatens its long-term viability and places the federal government at risk.'' Only through years of unaccountability and fiscal irresponsibility could a power company have ever reached this level of debt, despite the fact that TVA is a monopoly provider of electricity.  As a result of TVA's fiscal mismanagement and bloated budgets, TVA rates are higher than those of FERC-regulated utilities in Kentucky. Since 1988, wholesale power rates of regulated utilities in Kentucky have steadily fallen, while TVA has maintained the same level, albeit higher than Kentucky utilities. Then, in 1997, TVA was forced to raise rates by 7 percent in an effort to get its fiscal house back in order. It is apparent that due to TVA's past financial mismanagement, thousands of Kentucky residents are paying more for power than Kentucky residents who are outside the TVA fence.  Mr. President, another way to quantify the impact of TVA's fiscal irresponsibility is to compare the electric rates paid by Kentuckians. Mr. President I have a chart here that displays the rate premiums paid by the 211,427 TVA customers living in Kentucky. I have used the rates filed by Kentucky Utilities and TVA's publicly disclosed rates between 1999 and 2003. Based on these rates, Kentuckians will pay an average of $50 million more annually for the privilege of being served by TVA. Over the next five years this amounts to a $250 million ``TVA membership fee.'' It is painfully clear the Kentuckians who are served by TVA are getting a raw deal from this New Deal program.  Mr. President, I have come to the conclusion that TVA needs to be made more accountable for its actions. Not more accountable to Congress or the President, but the people TVA is charged to serve--Valley customers.  Mr. President, it is my desire to provide TVA customers with a clear picture of TVA's financial situation including its rates, charges and costs. The Federal Energy Regulatory Commission (FERC) is authorized under the Federal Power Act with regulating electric utilities. FERC currently provides regulatory oversight to over 200 utilities for wholesale and transmission power rates to ensure that their electric rates and charges are ``just and reasonable and not unduly discriminatory or preferential.'' At present, TVA is entirely exempt from these necessary regulations allowing it to operate as a self-regulating monopoly, with no such mandate for openness, fairness or oversight.  Mr. President, I am not alone in this belief. The distributors serving Memphis, Tennessee, Knoxville, Tennessee, and Paducah, Kentucky, share my views that TVA should fully comply with the FERC authority. Recently, before the House Commerce Committee, Mr. Herman Morris, Jr., President and CEO of the Memphis Light, Gas and Water Division testified on behalf of MLGWD and the Knoxville Utilities Board that FERC would ``provide a neutral forum for resolving disputes regarding TVA transmission, wholesale sales pricing, terms and conditions.'' Mr. Morris went on to say that FERC jurisdiction is ``necessary to provide Tennessee Valley distributors the same level of protection that the rest of the country enjoys.''  Requiring TVA to comply with FERC regulations will serve two purposes. First, it will allow customers to accurately evaluate TVA's wholesale and transmission pricing to ensure the rates charged are ``just and reasonable'' and will provide customers with a forum for challenging future rate increases just as every other regulated utility does.  Second, this information will provide FERC with a better understanding of the costs TVA has accumulated. Understanding the full scope of these costs will be critical in an open transmission and wholesale market. It will also have a significant impact in determining how competitive TVA will be in the future.  Another measure which I have added this year builds on the full disclosure provisions by requiring FERC to conduct an investigation to determine TVA's total stranded cost liability. I have heard from a number of distributors who are very concerned about the potential stranded cost liability they might be assessed. They adamantly oppose paying for any costs or services they haven't paid for. For example, residents of Paducah, Kentucky don't want to pay for the costs TVA incurred in providing service to Nashville. Unfortunately, nobody has any idea of the total stranded cost liability TVA has incurred or can be recovered. This investigation will uncover those costs that were prudently incurred and are eligible for recovery as stranded costs.  In order to ensure that TVA keeps its promise of lowering its debt, I have proposed that TVA be required to meet four need-based criteria before it is able to add costly generating capacity. For my colleagues who are not familiar with TVA, it is important to note that TVA's tremendous level of debt is a result of TVA's aggressive and unchecked plan to add new generating capacity in the Valley. In 1966, TVA announced a plan to build 17 nuclear facilities throughout the Valley. Today less than half of these facilities are in commercial service.  As a result, TVA is $26 billion in debt and has invested $14 billion in non-performing nuclear assets which have driven rates up in the Valley. To prevent history from repeating itself, I believe it is necessary to apply safeguards against overbuilding. TVA must demonstrate a legitimate need before committing such significant resources again.  This legislation will also prohibit TVA from using Valley ratepayers to subsidize power sales outside the Valley in the future. All new generation will be required to meet the needs of Valley ratepayers.  Mr. President, let me take a moment to go through the other important customer reforms included in the bill. Section Four of the bill prohibits TVA from continuing to subsidize their foreign endeavors at ratepayer's expense. Quarter million dollar conferences in China and other points on the globe are not consistent with either TVA's deficit reduction goals or its mission to be a low-cost power provider to the Valley.  Another provision that I have included is a measure proposed by the TVA distributors. Section Five in the bill protects distributors from unfair competition by ending TVA's ability to directly serve large industrial customers. In the past, TVA has been able to directly serve some of the valley's largest industrial customers. Through this loophole, TVA is able to use its considerable market power to unfairly compete with distributors.  Section Seven of this bill will increase TVA's level of accountability by applying all federal antitrust laws and penalties. I have included this provision in response to heavy-handed tactics used by TVA to punish the City of Bristol, Virginia, for signing a contract with another energy provider.  TVA applied heavy-handed tactics by predicting unreliable electricity services as a disincentive to leaving, and TVA attempted to syphon-off Bristol's industrial customers by offering direct-serve power contracts at 2 percent below any rate offered by Bristol. I find these predatory practices to be entirely unacceptable, especially applied to one of its own customers. It is my belief that since TVA's activities were performed in a commercial endeavor, they should be held to the same standards as any other corporation under the antitrust laws.  I understand that TVA is willing to subject themselves to federal antitrust laws, so long as they aren't subject to any penalties. Mr. President, I have some advice for TVA.  If you can't pay the fine, don't do the crime.  Finally, this legislation limits TVA's ability to branch out into other businesses beyond power generation and transmission. TVA has attempted to diversify into equipment leasing as well as engineering and other contracting services in direct competition with other Valley businesses. I don't believe that TVA should be permitted to use its considerable advantages, like its tax-exempt status, to compete against Valley businesses. TVA has signed a Memorandum of Agreement with Valley businesses not to compete against them.  My legislation codifies that agreement. Mr. President, I hope these reforms will offer TVA customers--both distributors and individuals alike--the means to make TVA more accountable and put an end, once and for all, to TVA's unaccountability and unchecked fiscal irresponsibility. I want to put an end to TVA membership premium and let all Kentuckians benefit from some of the lowest power rates in the nation.  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that additional material be printed in the Record.  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in the Record, as follows:                                S. 1323       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of      the United States of America in Congress assembled,     SECTION 1.

There are authorized to be appropriated to the Federal      Energy Regulatory Commission such sums as are necessary to      carry out this Act and the amendments made by this Act.                                  ____          TVA Board Spent More Than $85,000 To Travel in 1998       Knoxville, Tenn.--Credit card receipts show Tennessee      Valley Authority board members spent more than $85,000 in      1998 on travel expenses, a newspaper reported on Sunday.       Among the charges are lodging at the Ritz-Carlton hotel      near Washington, a casino resort in Nevada and a golf club in      Mississippi. TVA Chairman Craven Crowell alone took 92 trips,      including 12 to foreign countries, The Knoxville News-     Sentinel reported.       Crowell's charges totaled $49,541. Crowell, who is      currently in England with other Tennessee business leaders,      declined to discuss the issue with the newspaper last week.       Among Crowell's duties while traveling are promoting TVA      bonds, meeting with utility officials and attending      conferences, according to TVA officials.       ``These are not pleasure trips,'' said TVA spokesman Steve      Bender. ``The chairman is working on these trips.''       The U.S. General Accounting Office, the investigative arm      of Congress, is probing how TVA Inspector General George      Prosser spent TVA expense money, after a written request from      Crowell. In question are more than $10,000 in travel and      entertainment charges.       Prosser maintains the expenses are legitimate and he is the      victim of retaliation by TVA officials because he      investigated TVA executive Joe Dickey for fraud.       Prosser's expenses include a $500 hotel bill from a      Mississippi casino, $4,500 at attractions with golf courses      and more than $200 in liquor.       Crowell currently is the only member of the three-member      TVA board. Johnny Hayes left in January to work in Vice      President Al Gore's presidential campaign, and Bill Kennoy's      nine-year term ended May 18.       In 1998, Kennoy spent $17,935 on 69 trips, and he didn't      return phone calls from the newspaper seeking comment. Hayes      spent $17,268 on 155 trips.       ``I never charged golf, a meal or anything else where I      wasn't on TVA business,'' Hayes said.       ``I was out with customers constantly,'' he said. ``I      fished with them. I golfed with them. I went to every major      convention they had.''       U.S. Rep. Harold Ford, Jr., D-Memphis, said the travel      expenses seemed high at first glance.       ``The real measure is how much they accomplish on the      trips,'' Ford said.                                  ____                                         Paducah Power System,                                        Paducah, KY, July 1, 1999.     Senator Mitch McConnell,     Russell Building, Washington, DC.       Dear Senator McConnell: Having reviewed the ``TVA Customer      Protection Act of 1999,'' the Board and management of Paducah      Power System are supportive of the bill.       Specifically, the protection from TVA competing with the      distributors for retail customers as long as at least half of      the distributors wholesale power requirements are purchased      from TVA is very important.       The provision for identifying and establishing the      methodology and value of stranded cost is extremely      important. This information will assist future planning for      distributors.       Additionally, the protection of Valley ratepayers from      subsidizing off system sales provides distributors within the      Valley to continue to provide energy at the lowest practical      cost.       Thank you for your efforts and continuing interest in the      people of Western Kentucky and all the Tennessee Valley.       Feel free to call if I can be of any assistance.           Respectfully,                                                       Don Fuller,                                                  General Manager.                                 ______                                       By
