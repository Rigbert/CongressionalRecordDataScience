As you know, we did pass a budget through the House in a timely fashion. The Senate passed its budget. It is now in conference.  Because of the April break, Easter-Passover break, we have not reached the April 15th. As a matter of fact, I talked to Mr. Conrad just an hour ago, I talked to Mr. Spratt just an hour ago, and we are very hopeful that we will come to an agreement.  I would observe, of course, last year the disagreement was between the Republican leadership in the Senate and the Republican leadership in the House. I understand what the gentleman is saying. Some of the votes in the Senate were overwhelming and bipartisan in terms of some of these issues. So this is an issue that we've got to overcome. We hope we can overcome it and move the budget.  But I want to tell the gentleman, he is absolutely correct. I am very focused. Mr. Obey is very focused. We are going to pass appropriation bills in a timely fashion. We hope to finish by the 30th of June. Very frankly, the more quickly we can move appropriation bills, perhaps the more flexibility we will have in June's schedule. But as you know, June now is scheduled for every Monday and every Friday meeting to effect that business, which is critical.  As the gentleman knows, we met last year for the full year. We left here in December and nine of the 11 appropriation bills were unpassed. We don't want to be in that position. The gentleman knows, and I know, that part of that problem was the Senate's inability to move its business as quickly as we would like, as quickly as we did. The Labor-Health bill, of course, never passed this floor last year, but we are hopeful that that will happen.  I will go over the schedule of the appropriations process with the gentleman at some point in time. We are hopeful that mid-May to the end of June we will pass our appropriation bills. I will tell the gentleman it will be my intention to discuss with both Chairman Spratt and Chairman Obey that if the budget process cannot be resolved, not in this House, but in the other House, that it would be my hope that the House would mark its bills to the House-passed number, as you know we have done in the past; and that would certainly be my intention.  Again, I have not discussed that with Mr. Obey at this point in time, that's premature, nor have I discussed it with others, but we are hopeful to move ahead on the appropriation bills.  As you know, passage of the budget has a much greater impact in the Senate than it does in the House with respect to the rules process under which appropriation bills are considered in the Senate.
