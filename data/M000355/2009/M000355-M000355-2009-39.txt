 President, reserving the right to object, there is nothing more outrageous to the American people than the thought that they will have to visit both the IRS and the undertaker on the same day.  Surveys indicate that Americans, even after informed that estate tax may not apply to them, object to it in principle.  I am going to ask that the chairman of the Finance Committee modify his request in the following way:  That there be an amendment considered that reflects a permanent, portable, and unified $5 million exemption that is indexed for inflation, and a 35-percent top rate; and further, that the amendment be agreed to, the bill then be read the third time and passed, with the motion to reconsider laid upon the table.  Before the Chair rules, I want to acknowledge my good friend Senator Kyl, the Republican whip, who has been our leader on this side of the issue. He has crafted a proposal, along with the leader on this on the other side, Senator Lincoln of Arkansas, that is consistent with the consent agreement and with the modification I am now asking the chairman of the Finance Committee to make. This approach would provide certainty and clarity to all taxpayers, especially small businesses and farmers; whereas the UC propounded by the chairman would only create additional confusion, with three different rates coming into effect in the course of a 12-month period.  Summing it up, I ask that my friend from Montana modify the agreement in the way I described.
