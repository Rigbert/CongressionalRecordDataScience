President, I picked up the newspaper, at least went online to look at the newspapers from Illinois this morning, and two stories jumped right off the page. One was in the Bloomington Pantagraph. What a great story it is and makes me so proud to be from the Midwest and to represent people who are, by their very nature, pretty darned extraordinary. It is a story that comes out of Lexington, IL, about an event that happened yesterday, and I will quote just a bit of it.       More than 60 area farmers, truckers and their families      gathered north of Lexington on Sunday morning to pay back a      friend who had helped them out at one time or another during      his 71-year lifetime. Some 16 combines harvested more than      300 acres of corn as friends of Dave Thomas brought in      Thomas' last harvest. Thomas died of a heart attack on July      22 and his wife Sharon and four sons, decided to end the      family's farm operations.
