Speaker, January 20, 2004 saw the unexpected passing of a beloved member of Toledo, Ohio's medical community, a philanthropist, mentor, and friend to many, a wife, mother, sister and grandmother. Mary Beth Hayward, RN, MSN, passed from this life at the age of 65.  Born in Grand Rapids, Michigan, Mary Beth was the only daughter of George and Evelyn Ludwig. She received her undergraduate RN from St. Mary's College and her Master of Science in Nursing from Catholic University, graduating from both magna cum laude. She followed graduation with a teaching position at Georgetown University's School of Nursing. That same year, she married John Hayward, a strong union lasting nearly 42 years. In 1966, the Haywards moved to Toledo, Ohio, and Mary Beth began teaching advanced medical and surgical care nursing at the former Mercy School of Nursing. In 1974, Mary Beth joined the faculty of the Medical College of Ohio, where she remained for the next 30 years until her untimely death. A visionary leader in the nursing profession the MCO associate professor pioneered the development of new teaching methods including online courses. She was a member of MCO's Faculty Senate, and a testament to her teaching was the 18 Excellence in Teaching awards she received during her tenure.  A leader in her profession, Mary Beth at the time of her death was president of the Northwest Ohio Nurses Association and secretary of the Ohio Nurses Association Board of Directors. She was a member of the International Honor Society of Nursing, Sigma Theta Tau, and president of the Ohio League for Nursing for a 2000-2003 term.  Along with her husband and singly, Mary Beth was a respected community leader. She' gave service to the Kidney Foundation of Northwest Ohio, Sunset Retirement Communities, the Junior League of Toledo, the Toledo Bar Association Auxiliary, and Hospice of Northwest Ohio. In addition to this service, she could be counted upon to lend her support to many other causes.  Mary Beth Hayward leaves a legacy in nursing and in our community. Yet her strongest legacy is her family. Our prayers remain with her husband John, her children Beth, Mary Bridget, John, Thomas, and Ethan, her eight grandchildren, her brother William, and many more family and friends.  Lofty words and poetic phrase could easily be used to describe the life of Mary Beth Hayward, but the eulogy noting her passing encapsulates her perfectly, ``She loved God, she loved life, she loved her family, and she loved teaching. She was a force for good who gave much and took little.''                          ____________________
