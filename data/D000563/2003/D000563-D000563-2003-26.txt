The Senator starts with the same premise I do--that seniors are most comfortable with Medicare. If this started off as an added benefit to Medicare, this bill would have been much smaller and more understandable and supported by seniors. But when they rejected that and said, we are going to go to private companies, they really opened up all sorts of problems. They guaranteed profitability, put in slush funds, and they complicated it to the point where most seniors will struggle to understand it. This didn't have to be the case.  When you are out to privatize Medicare and reward pharmaceutical companies and help HMOs, that is where you end up.
