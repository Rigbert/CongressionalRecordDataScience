 I ask further consent that, following the disposition of the amendment described above, the bill be advanced to third reading, and a vote occur on passage, all without any intervening action, motion, or debate.  Finally, I ask, following the vote, the Senate insist on its amendments, request a conference with the House, and the Chair be authorized to appoint conferees on the part of the Senate, those conferees being: Senators Grassley, Hatch, Murkowski, Nickles, Gramm, Baucus, Rockefeller, Daschle, and Breaux.
