(a) Findings.--Congress finds the following:       (1) Women around the world are especially vulnerable to      poverty. They tend to work longer hours, are compensated      less, and have less income stability and fewer economic      opportunities than men.       (2) Women's share of the labor force is increasing in      almost all regions of the world. Women comprise more than 40      percent of the labor force in eastern and southeastern Asia,      sub-Saharan Africa, and the Caribbean, nearly a third of the      labor force in Central America, and nearly one-third of total      employment in South Asia. About 250 million young women will      enter the labor force worldwide between 2003 and 2015.       (3) Women are more likely to work in informal employment      relationships in poor countries compared to men. In sub-     Saharan Africa, 84 percent of female non-agricultural workers      are informally employed compared to 63 percent of men. In      Latin America, 58 percent of women are informally employed      compared to 48 percent of men. Informal employment is      characterized by lower wages and greater variability of      earnings, less stability, absence of labor organization, and     fewer social protections than formal employment.       (4) Changes in the economy of a poor country affect women      and men differently; women are disproportionately affected by      long-term recessions, crises, and economic restructuring and      they often miss out on many of the benefits of growth.       (5) International trade can be an important tool of      economic development and poverty reduction and its benefits      should extend to all members of society, particularly the      world's poor women.       (6) Promoting fair labor practices for women, and access to      information, education, land, credit, physical capital, and      social services is a means of boosting productivity and      earnings for the economies of developing nations. For      example, according to the World Bank, in sub-Saharan Africa,      inequality between men and women in employment and education      suppressed annual per capita growth during the period 1960-     1992 by .8 percentage points per year.       (7) Expanding economic opportunity for women in developing      countries can have a positive effect on child nutrition,      health, and education, as women often invest their income in      their families. Increasing women's income can also decrease      women's vulnerability to HIV/AIDS, gender-based violence, and      trafficking, and make them more resistant to the impact of      natural disasters.       (8) Economic opportunities for women, including      microfinance and microenterprise development and the      promotion of women's small- and medium-sized businesses, are      a means of generating gainful, safe, and dignified employment      for the poor.       (9) Women play a vital, but often unrecognized, role in      averting violence, resolving conflict, and rebuilding      economies in post-conflict societies. Women in conflict-     affected areas face even greater challenges in accessing      employment, training, property rights, credit, and financial      and non-financial resources for business development.      Ensuring economic opportunity for women in conflict-affected      areas plays a significant role in economic rehabilitation and      consolidation of peace.       (10) Given the important role of women in the economies of      poor nations, poverty alleviation programs funded by the      Government of the United States in poor countries should seek      to enhance the level of economic opportunity available to      women in those countries.       (b) Statement of Policy.--It is, therefore, the policy of      the United States to actively promote development and      economic opportunities for women, including programs and      policies to--       (1) promote women's ability to start micro, small, or      medium-sized business enterprises, and enable women to grow      such enterprises, particularly from micro to small      enterprises and from small to medium-sized enterprises, or      sustain current business capacity;       (2) promote the rights of women to own, manage, and inherit      property, including land, encourage adoption of laws and      policies that support the rights of women to enforce these      claims in administrative and judicial tribunals, and address      conflicts with customary laws and practices to increase the      security of women's tenure;       (3) increase women's access to employment, enable women to      access higher quality jobs with better remuneration and      working conditions in both informal and formal employment,      and improve the quality of jobs in sectors dominated by women      by improving the remuneration and working conditions of those      jobs; and       (4) bring the benefits of international trade policy to      women in developing countries and continue to ensure that      trade policies and agreements adequately reflect the      respective needs of poor women and men.
