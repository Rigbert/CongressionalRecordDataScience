 President, it is sometimes argued these days that we Americans place too high a premium on the value of individual, yet our experience over more than 200 years as a Nation has taught us that it's almost impossible to overestimate the value of some individual citizens to our community and our country. James I. Williamson of Harrington, DE, who died on Monday of this week at the age of 66, was one of those invaluable individuals without whom the character and history of America would be very different.  During his distinguished 21-year career in the U.S. Army, from which he retired in 1969 as a staff sergeant, James Williamson won many decorations, including the Purple Heart, the Bronze Star and the Silver Star. In 1968, during the last of his three tours of duty in Vietnam, he won the rarely awarded Congressional Medal of Honor for extraordinary, individual valor in combat.  Of the millions of men and women who have served in our military since the award was first conferred during the Civil War, Mr. President, fewer than 3,500 have received the Congressional Medal for voluntary action above and beyond the call of duty, at the risk of the recipient's own life--and the high standard of admission to that elite group of heroes is indicated by the fact that the majority of Congressional Medals have been awarded posthumously.  Sergeant Williamson survived the action that earned him our highest military decoration, but it was his willingness to risk his own life that saved the lives of comrades in arms engaged in that action with him. Alone and armed with a machinegun, he rescued the crew of a mechanized weapons carrier that had taken a disabling direct hit. Remaining exposed to enemy fire, he attached a towing cable so the vehicle and its crew could be pulled to safety.  Despite the controversy that surrounded our involvement in the Vietnamese war, Mr. President, it was a proud nation which presented Mr. Williamson with the Congressional Medal of Honor, because of his enormous personal courage, because of his willingness to risk sacrificing his own life in the service of others, and because neither our military nor our Nation can afford to allow such outstanding individual contributions to go unrecognized.  James I. Williamson was not ``the one-in-a-million'' exception we sometimes refer to; he was the truly exceptional ``one-in-fewer-than-3,500'' who displayed the American character at its best and whose actions made clear why our most precious decoration is dedicated to honor--his own and his country's. His family, his community of Harrington, and his State of Delaware will remember him with pride for his extraordinary individual achievement and with humility in the face of his unselfish bravery.                          ____________________
