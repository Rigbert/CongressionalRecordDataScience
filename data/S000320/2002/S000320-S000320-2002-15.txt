 President, as the Senator knows, one of the most versatile and successful programs in the history of the Army is the development and fielding of the M113 Family of Vehicles. The Army has been in the process of up-grading these vehicles so that they can keep pace on the modern battlefield, improve survivability and drastically increase reliability. Not withstanding the need to transform the Army, the fact remains that in 2016, at the time the Army intends to field the Objectives Force, there will be nearly 10,000 M113s remaining operational including 1,900 in the Counter Attack Corps.
