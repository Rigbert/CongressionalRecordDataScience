I don't mean by the bankruptcy bill, that was bad enough, written by the credit card companies, but the bankrupting, the looting of America that is going on with this administration.  It is just laughable when the Republicans parade down here and talk about the spending of the Democrats when they control everything and they have increased the debt by 62 percent in 5 years. How do you blame the Democrats for that when they are in charge of every branch of government?
