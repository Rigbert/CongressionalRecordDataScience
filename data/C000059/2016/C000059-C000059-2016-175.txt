Chair, I thank the Congressman from Georgia (Mr. Graves), a member of our committee who has been closely tracking this. I appreciate his attention to the issue and the update regarding EPA's activities to implement the direction in fiscal year 2016 report. I look forward to working with him to address this as we move forward with the fiscal year 2017 process.  Ms. McCOLLUM. Mr. Chairman, I reserve the balance of my time.
