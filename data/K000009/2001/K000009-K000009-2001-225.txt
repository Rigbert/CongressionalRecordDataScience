Speaker, I rise today in both celebration and sadness to commemorate the retirement of Margaret L. Hunt, senior citizens advocate extraordinaire, from Toledo, Ohio. A pioneer in the Toledo area senior citizens'movement, Margaret takes with her 45 years of experience in senior services.  Born in Kentucky, Margaret has been a Toledoan since the age of two. She has lived in South Toledo, graduating from Libbey High School and raising a family. She and her husband, Daniel, to whom she was married for more than fifty years, have four children: Rebecca, Nancy, Margaret, and Daniel. Margaret is also grandmother to eleven grandchildren and seventeen great-grandchildren.  Margaret got her start in Toledo area services while a young mother. Even while she was employed by a local bakery, she helped to establish Teen Town in Highland Park, working with the City of Toledo's Parks & Recreation Department. During that time it became apparent that although Toledo actively developed programs for young people, the same could not be said for older Toledoans. Margaret was charged with the task of developing and implementing such programming. She started by promoting the formation of neighborhood social clubs that met regularly in park shelter houses. Prior to the days of the Older Americans Act and thus with no kind of senior nutrition program available, Margaret took the creative approach of encouraging weekly potluck luncheons. While enjoying each other's camaraderie and a hot meal, the seniors participated in games and crafts and planned outings. Soon this very successful program was expanded into local senior housing complexes. These groups were the precursor of the modern senior centers. In fact, Margaret was instrumental in the establishment of Toledo's first senior center, Senior Centers Inc.  In 1981, when the idea of senior centers was still in its infancy and there were just a few beginning locally, Margaret took on the task of growing a center in native South Toledo. The South Toledo Senior Center was born in August of that year, with Margaret at the helm as Executive Director. In the twentyyears that followed, Margaret fostered unprecedented growth in the center, which is now in a large and airy freestanding building and continuing to grow. The South Toledo Senior Center serves hundreds of seniors a nutritious lunch every day, and is the only one in the area serving lunch on Sunday as well. Its programs are varied and all-inclusive: if it's something seniors enjoy doing it's being done at the South Toledo Senior Center. I cannot imagine it without her, nor not being greeted with her cheerful smile upon my visits there.  Hayes's belief that ``Old age is not something to which I have arrived kicking and screaming. It is something I have achieved,'' Margaret Hunt has arrived at this place in her life with grace. While we wish her a wonderful life of retirement, we yet look to her for continued quiet greatness.                          ____________________
