 President, on July 12, the Committee on Foreign Relations reported S. 180, the Sudan Peace Act. At the time the bill was reported, the cost estimate from the Congressional Budget Office was not available.  I ask unanimous consent that the CBO estimate be printed in the Record.  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in the Record, as follows:        CONGRESSIONAL BUDGET OFFICE COST ESTIMATE, JULY 17, 2001                        S. 180: Sudan Peace Act [As ordered reported by the Senate Committee on Foreign Relations on                              July 12, 2001]       S. 180 would condemn slavery and human rights abuses in      Sudan, authorize the Secretary of State to support the peace      process in Sudan, and require the President to devise a      contingency plan for delivering aid to Sudan. CBO estimates      that enacting S. 180 would have no significant budgetary      impact. The act would not affect direct spending or revenues;      therefore, pay-as-you-go procedures would not apply. S. 180      contains no intergovernmental or private-sector mandates as      defined by the Unfunded Mandates Reform Act (UMRA) and would      not affect the budgets of state, local, or tribal      governments.       Each year the United States provides nearly $190 million in      assistance to the people of Sudan through various emergency      food-aid, disaster assistance, refugee assistance, and      development assistance programs. The provisions of S. 180      would not substantially expand the Administration's authority      to provide such assistance. CBO estimates that spending on      those emergency and humanitarian programs would continue at      current levels.       The bill contains several reporting and contingency      planning requirements that would not affect the State      Department's or the U.S. Agency for international      Development's (USAID) workload significantly. Based on      information from the department and USAID, CBO estimates that      enacting S. 180 would increase the agency's spending by less      than $500,000 annually, assuming the availability of      appropriated funds.       On June 7, 2001, CBO prepared an estimate for a similar      bill, H.R. 2052, as ordered reported by the House Committee      on International Relations, on June 6, 2001. Like S. 180,      H.R. 2052 would not significantly affect discretionary      spending. That bill would require disclosure of business      activities in Sudan prior to an entity trading its securities      in any capital market in the United States. That provision      constitutes a private-sector mandate, as defined in UMRA, but      the cost of the mandate would fall below the annual threshold      established in UMRA ($113 million in 2001, adjusted annually      for inflation).       The CBO staff contact is Joseph C. Whitehill, who can be      reached at 226-2840. This estimate was approved by Peter H.      Fontaine, Deputy Assistant Director for Budget Analysis.                          ____________________
