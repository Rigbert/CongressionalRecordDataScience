Chairman, I yield myself such time as I may consume.  I would suggest that, in reading the language, I think it could be more balanced and I think it also should include those other factors which are day-to-day congestion, which do cost our economy hundreds of millions or billions of dollars a year.  So I am opposed to this, as worded. I urge people to oppose it, and I would hope that we can work through the conference committee on something that will give us a more comprehensive analysis of what we need to do to increase the viability of all American ports.  I yield back the balance of my time.  The Acting CHAIR. The question is on the amendment offered by the gentleman from Washington (Mr. Reichert).  The question was taken; and the Acting Chair announced that the noes appeared to have it.
