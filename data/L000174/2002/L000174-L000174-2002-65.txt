President, I rise today to introduce the Missing Children's Assistance Act of 2002, which doubles the funding for the National Center for Missing and Exploited Children and reauthorizes the Center through fiscal year 2006. I am pleased to have Senators Hatch and Biden as cosponsors.  Due to tragic circumstances, the importance of the National Center for Missing and Exploited Children, ``NCMEC'', has become even more pronounced over the past year. We have seen repeated media coverage of missing children from every corner of our nation, and parents and children alike have slept less easily. As a father and grandfather, I know that an abducted child is every parent's or grandparent's worst nightmare.  The Justice Department estimates that between 3,000 and 4,000 children are taken by strangers every year. This legislation will strengthen our efforts to return those children to their homes, and relieve their parents of unimaginable grief.  The Center for Missing and Exploited Children assists parents, children, law enforcement, schools, and the community in their efforts to recover missing children. The professionals at NCMEC have disturbingly busy jobs, they have worked on more than 73,000 cases of missing and exploited children since NCMEC's founding in 1984, helping to recover more than 48,000 of them. They also raise awareness about preventing child abduction, molestation, and sexual exploitation.  As part of its mission, NCMEC runs: 1. a 24-hour telephone hotline to take reports about missing children and clues that might lead to their recovery, 2. a national child pornography tipline, and 3. a program that assists families in the reunification process. NCMEC also helps runaway children, including through attempts to reduce child prostitution.  NCMEC manages to do all of this good work with only a $10 million authorization, which expires after fiscal year 2003. We should act now both to extend its authorization and provide additional funds so that it can continue to help keep children safe and families intact around the nation.                                 ______                                       By
