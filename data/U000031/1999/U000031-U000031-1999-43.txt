Speaker, I would like to thank the gentleman for yielding to me, because a number of us were instrumental in helping to write this trigger.  On Friday, Mr. Speaker, I was reading the Wall Street Journal and there was a story in there and in it apparently Alan Greenspan, the chairman of the Federal Reserve, was asked before the House Committee on Banking and Financial Services what he thought about this trigger and he said this: ``I think that the notion of using a potential trigger is essential,'' Greenspan said. He further went on to add that using the surplus to reduce the Federal debt is ``an extraordinarily effective force for good in this economy.''  He signed onto this. In essence, what the trigger is, it is a stoplight. If what the OMB and the CBO folks say is correct in terms of the expectations of where we are going to be with the budget surplus, things happen the way they say, and the debt, in fact, is coming down, $5.5 trillion is what it is today, the tax cut goes forward.                              {time}  2200  But if, in fact, something happens, if interest rates go up, if spending goes up, and, in fact, the amount of money needed to service the Federal debt goes up rather than declines, the red light goes on. So it is a safety valve. And it also is going to serve as a break on additional spending as well.  So I think that this was a very important measure that a number of us fought for. And furthermore, today I know a number of us communicated to our leadership that we are hoping that the Senate certainly adds this provision in their tax bill that they are debating this week. And if they are not able to get it included, then at least maybe in the conference, when we iron out the differences between the House and the Senate, that certainly the House would prevail on this making sure that the taxpayers are protected by making sure that this trigger device stays in effect.  I applaud the leadership of my colleague on this. It was important as a number of us met with Republican leadership and others. It is a trigger with real teeth. It is going to do the right thing, and that is what we are here for.
