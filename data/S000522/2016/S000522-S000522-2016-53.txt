Mr. Speaker, I yield such time as he may consume to the gentleman from Texas (Mr. Conaway), the chairman of the Committee on Agriculture, who worked very closely with our committee and with me and with my staff on the bill and helped to ensure that it did not have any unintended negative consequences for the domestic programs within his committee's jurisdiction. I want to thank him again for his great leadership.
