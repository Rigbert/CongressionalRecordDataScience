STEVENS. This is a modification of the amendment sent to the desk. I am trying to figure out if there would be a second-degree amendment to it. I am informed that it is modified and that we would not have a second-degree amendment. And I am prepared to agree to the Senator's suggestion of 30 minutes for him. I still want to reserve 10 minutes on this side in case someone wants to speak on it to answer the Senator. I do not intend to do that. But I then ask unanimous consent that the Senator be recognized to call up amendment No. 2128, as modified, and that he have 30 minutes, and we reserve 10 minutes on this side. My advice to the Senator would be to yield 2 minutes to the Senator from Vermont.
