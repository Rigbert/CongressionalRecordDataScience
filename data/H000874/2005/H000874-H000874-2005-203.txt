Speaker, I thank the gentleman for his answer.  Lastly, we were expecting today to have a budget amendment, or an amended budget, on the floor today. That did not happen. He referenced it in his opening discussion of the schedule.  Does he expect that bill to come to the floor next week, and if so, does he expect it to call for reconciliation cuts above and beyond the $35 billion that was in the original budget?  I yield to the gentleman.
