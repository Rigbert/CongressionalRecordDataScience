The ADA is one of America's great civil rights achievements. In its scope and intentions, it ranks alongside major victories for equal justice, like the 15th and 19th amendments, the Civil Rights Act and the Voting Rights Act.  I would like to recognize and congratulate my friend and colleague Tom Harkin for his instrumental role in authoring this legislation 20 years ago. He has been a steadfast advocate for people with disabilities, and with his leadership last Congress we passed the ADA Amendments Act of 2008 to restore the full promise of the ADA after it been distorted and diluted by a series of bad Federal court decisions.  I am deeply proud to have voted for the ADA in 1990 because this law produced changes in society--removing physical barriers, prohibiting discrimination, and changing attitudes--that we might take for granted today.  Before passage of this law, people with disabilities were too often denied the opportunity to fully participate in society. Back then, if you needed a haircut, if you had to see a doctor, if you just wanted to meet a friend for a cup of coffee, you probably had to rely on family, friends, or a social service agency. Very few transit systems in this country had buses or trains that were accessible to people using wheelchairs.  We passed the ADA to fulfill the Nation's goals of equality of opportunity, independent living, economic self sufficiency, and full participation for Americans with disabilities. Twenty years later, it is clear that this pioneering law is fulfilling its promise in many ways.  You can see it right outside on the sidewalk with curb cuts, ramps, Braille signs, and assistive listening devices.
