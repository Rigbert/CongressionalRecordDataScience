You are going to get an education for nothing. You are going to get a college education. You are going to get health care for nothing. That sounds real good. Someone has to pay for all this stuff.  I suggest that if you go up to the Mayo Clinic in the Northern tier of the United States, you will look and you will see a very large population of patients from Canada who are there; patients who have been told: Well, yes, you have breast cancer. But because you are at a certain age, we are not able to operate on you. If we do, it is going to be a waiting period of some 18 months. At the end of that time, of course, the patient is going anyway.  We are talking about, in this country, we need to do something about it, about the way we have been running our health care system. I think improvements can be made. I remember one time the first lithotripter was used, I believe, in a hospital in my State of Oklahoma, in Tulsa, OK, at St. Johns Hospital.  That was a technique where you could submerge a patient and dissolve different things that were within them, kidney stones and that type of thing. However, they could not use it. So theyhad to surgically and very invasively operate on people and cut them open to remove these things that could otherwise have been dissolved.  But the problem was, we have, in our Medicare system, a lot of people who are making medical decisions who are not qualified. So we have a lot of improvements that need to be made. But by adopting a system that has been a failure everyplace it has been tried, whether it is Sweden or Great Britain or Canada, is not something we are prepared to do in this country. I know the effort is out there, and they are going to make every effort to see that that happens. We are going to make sure that does not happen.  I yield the floor.
