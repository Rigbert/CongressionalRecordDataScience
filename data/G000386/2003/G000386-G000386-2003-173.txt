 President, today I am introducing legislation which will set a ceiling on vertical integration in the pork industry. Specifically, this bill will make it unlawful for any packer with an annual slaughter capacity of more than 20 million swine to slaughter more than 10 million packer-owned swine in any calendar year.  I am offering this because I believe the pork industry is at a critical juncture due to the impending sale of Farmland's pork division.  Either we stop the trend toward vertical integration, or we prepare for the inevitable ``chicken-ization'' of the pork industry.  It is vital that we sustain a place in the market for the independent pork producer. This legislation will at least limit the cancerous growth of vertical integration until we can pass a cure.  I ask unanimous consent the text of the bill be printed in the Record.  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the Record, as follows:                                S. 1644       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of      the United States of America in Congress assembled,     SECTION 1. ANNUAL LIMITATION ON NUMBER OF PACKER-OWNED SWINE                    SLAUGHTERED BY CERTAIN PACKERS.
