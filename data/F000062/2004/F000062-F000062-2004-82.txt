 President, I offer into the Record my statement of support of S. 2548, private relief legislation to provide lawful permanent residence status to Shigeru Yamada, a 22-year-old Japanese national who lives in Chula Vista, CA.  I have decided to offer private relief legislation on his behalf because I believe that Shigeru Yamada represents a model American citizen for whom removal from this country would represent an unfair hardship. Without this legislation, Mr. Yamada will be forced to return to a country in which he lacks any linguistic, cultural or family ties.  Mr. Yamada legally entered the United States with his mother and two sisters in 1992 at the young age of 10. The family was fleeing from Mr. Yamada's alcoholic father, who had been physically abusive to his mother, the children and even his own parents. Since the, he has had no contact with his father and is unsure if he is even alive. Tragically, Mr. Yamada experienced further hardship when his mother was killed in a car crash in 1995. Orphaned at the age of 13, Mr. Yamada spent time living with his aunt before moving to Chula Vista to live with a close friend of his late mother.  The death of his mother marked more than a personal tragedy for Shigeru Yamada; it also served to impede the process for him to legalize his status here. At the time of her death, Mr. Yamada's family was living legally in the United States. His mother had acquired a student visa for herself and her children qualified as her dependents. Her death revoked his legal status in the United States. Tragically, Mr. Yamada's mother was engaged to an American citizen at the time of her death. Had she survived, her son would likely have become an American citizen through this marriage.  Mr. Yamada has exhausted his options under our current immigration system of the United States. Throughout high school, he contacted attorneys in the hopes of becoming a citizen. Unfortunately, time has run out and, for Mr. Yamada, the only option available to him today is private relief legislation.  For several reasons, it would be tragic for Mr. Yamada to be removed from the United States and sent to Japan.  First, since arriving in the United States, Mr. Yamada has lived as a model American. He graduated with honors form Eastlake High School in 2000, where he excelled in both academics and athletics. Academically, Mr. Yamada earned a number of awards including being named an ``Outstanding English Student'' his freshman year, an All-American Scholar, and earning the United States National Minority Leadership Award. His teacher and coach, Mr. John Inumerable, describes him as being ``responsible, hard working, organized, honest, caring and very dependable.'' His role as the vice president of the Associated Student Body his senior year is an indication of Mr. Yamada's high level of leadership, as well as, his popularity and trustworthiness among his peers. As an athlete, Mr. Yamada was named the ``Most Inspirational Player of the Year'' in junior varsity baseball and football, as well as, varsity football. His football coach, Mr. Jose Mendoza, expressed his admiration by saying that he has ``seen in Shigeru Yamada the responsibility, dedication and loyalty that the average American holds to be virtuous.''  Second, Mr. Yamada has distinguished himself as a local volunteer. As a member of the Eastlake High School Link Crew, Mr. Yamada helped freshmen find their way around campus, offered tutoring and mentoring services, and set an example of how to be a successful member of the student body.Since graduating from high school, he has volunteered his time as the coach of the Eastlake High School girl's softball team. The head coach, Mr. Charles Sorge, describes him as an individual full of ``integrity'' who understands that as a coach it is important to work as a ``team player.'' His level of commitment to the team was further illustrated to Mr. Sorge when he discovered, halfway through the season, that Mr. Yamada's commute to and from practice was 2 hours long each way. It takes an individual with character to volunteer his time to coach and never bring up the issue of how long his commute takes him each day. Mr. Sorge hopes that, once Mr. Yamada legalizes his status, he can be formally hired to continue coaching the team.  Third, sending Mr. Yamada back to Japan would be an immense hardship for him and his family. Mr. Yamada does not speak Japanese. He is unaware of the nation's current cultural trends. And, he has no immediate family members that he knows of in Japan. Currently, both of his sisters are in the process of gaining American citizenship. His older sister has married a United States citizen and his younger sister is being adopted by a maternal aunt. Since all of his family lives in California, sending Mr. Yamada back to Japan would serve to split his family apart and separate him from everyone and everything that he knows. His sister contends that her younger brother would be ``lost'' if he had to return to live in Japan on his own. It is unlikely that he would be able to find any gainful employment in Japan due to his inability to speak or read Japanese.  As a member of the Chula Vista community, Mr. Yamada has distinguished himself as an honorable individual. His teacher, Mr. Robert Hughes, describes him as being an ``upstanding `All-American' young man''. Until being picked up during a routine check of his immigration status on a city bus, he had never been arrested or convicted of any crime. Mr. Yamada is not, and has never been, a burden on the State. He has never received any Federal or State assistance.  Currently, Mr. Yamada is a sophomore at Southwestern Community College, where he is working on finishing his general education so that he can go on to earn his BA in criminal justice from San Diego State University. Mr. Yamada's commitment to his education is admirable. He could have easily taken a different path but, through his own individual fortitude, he has dedicated himself to his studies so that he can live a better life. In the future, Mr. Yamada is interested in pursuing a career in criminal law enforcement by serving as a police officer or an FBI agent.  With his hard work and giving attitude, Shigeru Yamada represents the ideal American citizen. Although born in Japan, he is truly American in every other sense. I ask you to help right a wrong and grant Mr. Yamada permanent status so that he can continue towards his bright future.  I ask unanimous consent three letters of recommendation be printed in the Record.  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in the Record, as follows:                                         Eastlake High School,                                    Chula Vista, CA, May 21, 2004.     Hon. Dianne Feinstein,     U.S. Senator.       I am writing to bring to your attention the need to support      a fine young man, Shigeru Yamada. I am a teacher and coach at      Eastlake High School; I have known Shigeru for 8 years, both      as a student and as a volunteer coach during the last 5      years. What has singularly impressed me about this young man      is that he has created himself and never complained about his      life's struggles. His mother died when he was young. He got      little support from his aunt--materially, emotionally,      spiritually. Yet all the while you would not have known that.      He set goals for himself academically and athletically;      modeled himself on good ideals of community service and      service to his school. He was vice-president of the      Associated Student Body at Eastlake High and would have      pursued an academic future at UCLA were it not for his      citizenship status. Instead, he did what he could do and has      gone to community college in an effort to pursue his college      degree.       All the while, he volunteered his time during these past 5      years to help coach our school's softball team (as well as      other sports on campus). It was only recently that I had      discovered that it would take him 2 hours with bus transfers      just to get to softball practice.       I provide this information to you as a testimonial to the      character of this young man. Exceptional in attitude and      determination. We need this kind of spirit and resolve in      America. We do not want to export it somewhere else. Please      help.           Respectfully,                                            Charles R. Sorge, EdD,     English Teacher and Head Softball Coach.                                  ____                                        Edminster Learning Center,                                         Eastlake High School,                                  Chula Vista, CA, April 23, 2001.     To Mr. Bob Filner:       I'm honored to write this letter for Shigeru Yamada. I have      known Shigeru since 1997. A very energetic, bright young man      whose personal charge and get after if attitude toward      accomplishing his goals, have no equal. A person who      personifies the notion of a ``hard charger.''       As an Instructional aide and Varsity Football coach I have      earned great admiration toward Shigeru's work ethic. While in      high school, Shigeru received academic honors as an All-     American Scholar ('99), United States National Minority      Leadership Award ('99 & '00), the National Honor Roll ('00),      Golden State Awards, and Who's Who Among High School Students      ('98-'00). His commitment toward his duties goes with out      question. He managed to be a member of the Associative      Student Body. Here he received a Presidential Award ('00),      ASB Leadership Award ('00), and Eastlake High School ASB Life      Membership Award ('00).       Through his many academic accomplishments Shigeru managed      to dedicate himself to many extra curricular activities, such      as Football, Baseball, and Wrestling. Other activities      included, the Boys Choir (The ``E'' Males), AVID (Advancement      via Individual Determination), and Link Crew (assisting      incoming freshmen).       Through my personal experiences as a squad leader in the      United States Army (Infantry) and Department Head at Home      Depot. I have seen in Shigeru Yamada the responsibility,      dedication and loyalty that the average American holds to be      virtuous.       So with great appreciation please endorse a Bill, so that      Shigeru Yamada can stay in the United States and become a      patriotic citizen.           Sincerely,                                                     Jose Mendoza,     Instructional Aide.                                  ____                                         Eastlake High School,                                                  Chula Vista, CA.     To Whom It May Concern:       I would like to write this letter of recommendation on      behalf of Shigeru Yamada for his outstanding contributions to      Eastlake High School and the Eastlake Community. I have been      closely tied to Shigeru for approximately 2 years as teacher,      coach, and as a friend. Throughout his years at Eastlake High      School, Shigeru has participated successfully in many extra-     curricular activities and has earned the respect and      admiration from staff members, fellow students and the      surrounding community. Shigeru has developed into an      outstanding performer in Eastlake's football, wrestling and      baseball programs. He is strongly admired for his      sportsmanship, work ethic and most of all his natural ability      as a team leader. For his efforts, Shigeru was recognized for      athletic and academic achievements by being selected to the      1998-99 San Diego Union Tribune All-Academic Wrestling Team.      Although Shigeru spends much of his time with competitive      sports, he always finds time to help other students in need.      Shigeru is an active participant with the Eastlake Link Crew.      This organization was established to assist our ninth graders      with finding their way around campus, learning school      traditions, tutoring, mentoring, monitoring academic progress      and setting examples of how to be a successful member of our      campus environment. Academically, Shigeru excels in the      mathematics and is presently taking Honors Pre-Calculus while      carrying a 3.8 overall Grade Point Average. In addition,      Shigeru is an active member in the AVID (Advancement Via      Individual Achievement) program. This program helps our      students develop academic skills that are beneficial for them      when they attend college. Shigeru is also a member of the      Associated Student Body. The ASB is the bloodline of our      campus. This outstanding group of students work endless hours      organizing pep assemblies and lunchtime activities, sells      concessions at all extra-curricular events and assist in all      campus elections and dances as well as providing support      services for faculty and staff members. In several      conversations, I have discovered that Shigeru has a strong      interest in the field of Physical Therapy with an emphasis in      Sports Medicine. I strongly believe that Shigeru is capable      of reaching his goals because he is highly motivated,      conscientious and extremely competent.       It is very easy to praise Shigeru for his personal      achievements, but I think his personality is what makes him a      great human being. Shigeru is responsible, hard working,      organized, honest, caring and very dependable. On a daily      basis, Shigeru volunteers his time selling concessions during      nutrition break and lunch hour for the ASB food services.      This job holds Shigeru accountable for large sums of money,      an accurate account of inventories and timely service. Very      few students have been trusted with this major      responsibility. Another word that describes Shigeru is      resiliency. Within the past couple of years Shigeru lost both      of his parents in a tragic automobile accident. Consequently,     this sad episode has left a permanent impression on Shigeru.      Fortunately, Shigeru has overcome this tragedy and has      maintained a standard for other young people to follow.      Shigeru has proven to me that life is too important to waste      and to enjoy every moment by being an active member of      society, not just a spectator.           Sincerely,     John Inumerable.                          ____________________
