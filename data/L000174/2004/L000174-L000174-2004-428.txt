As I know of your strong interest in the region, I hope we can continue to work together to support United States funded programs through Southeast Asia.   Mr. McCONNELL. I look forward to our continued cooperation, and urge the State Department and USAID to meet with our respective staffs to discuss countries of particular concern, including Laos, Vietnam, Cambodia, Thailand, and Burma.
