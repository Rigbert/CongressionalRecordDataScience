Speaker, I rise with great privilege to wish a very happy birthday that will come on February 23 to one of our most distinguished Members who served for so many years, Congressman Louis Stokes of Cleveland, Ohio. He will turn 87 on February 23. And truly, he deserves recognition during this Black History Month, and I pay him his due honor.  He grew up in difficult circumstances in public housing. His widowed mother had to raise her two sons, one of which, Louis, became the first African American congressman ever elected from the State of Ohio, and his brother, Carl, the first African American mayor of Cleveland, Ohio. Can you imagine that family? Can you imagine their struggle?  I wish to place in the Record tonight some of his story. One of the tremendous accomplishments that he achieved as an attorney was trying many cases in front of the U.S. Supreme Court, including a case which created Ohio's first mostly minority congressional district, and then later in life he had the opportunity to run for that seat. He changed the face of this country.  I'm just so pleased to call him our friend, and let us take the time to fully recognize the admirable and path-breaking contributions of former Congressman Louis Stokes during this year's Black History Month. He deserves it.                  [From Cleveland.com, Feb. 13, 2012]   Lawyer Louis Stokes Became Ohio's First Black Congressman: Black                              History Month                           (By Grant Segall)       As part of Black History Month, we honor Louis Stokes,      Ohio's first black congressman.       Stokes, who turns 87 on Feb. 23, still practices law with      Squire Sanders, mostly in Washington, D.C.       At the Outhwaite housing project, a young, widowed Louise      Stokes used to display her hands, callused from maid's work,      and tell her boys to work with their minds. A calm, genial      Lou helped her raise his flamboyant kid brother, Carl, who      became the first black mayor of a major U.S. city.       Lou graduated from Cleveland Central High School and after      serving three years in the military in World War II, earned      his law degree in 1953.       He became a leading lawyer. He argued three cases before      the U.S. Supreme Court and persuaded it to create Ohio's      first mostly minority congressional district in 1968. Local      leaders persuaded him to represent it.       In Washington, Stokes chaired a committee probing John F.      Kennedy's assassination, dressed down Col. Oliver North over      the Iran-Contra scandal and steered vast sums to health      clinics, job programs and veterans care. At home, he launched      a famous district caucus and Labor Day parade. After 30      years, he retired undefeated.       A dozen or so landmarks have been named for him, including      a building at the National Institutes of Health.                          ____________________
