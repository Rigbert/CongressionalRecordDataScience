 President, I say to my friend, that is the case. The question is whether or not we can accommodate another one of our colleagues as well. It is always better than to have a rollcall vote.  If the Senator will seek to lay aside this amendment temporarily and possibly proceed to his next amendment, maybe we can accommodate both at the same time.
