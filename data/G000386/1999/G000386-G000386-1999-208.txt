 President, I have sent a letter to the majority leader requesting that I be consulted on certain nominations. I am asking to be consulted on the nominations of Anthony Harrington to be United States Ambassador to Brazil, Calendar No. 364, and for Charles Manatt to be United States Ambassador to the Dominican Republic, Calendar No. 361. Further, I ask to be consulted on all the promotion lists for career State Department foreign service officers.  I take this step reluctantly but believe it is necessary. The administration is required by law to submit to Congress on 1 November every year the so-called Majors' List, the list of major drug producing and trafficking countries that the President intends to certify on 1 March of the following year. The administration has never met this deadline, despite the fact that Congress extended it several years ago from 1 October to 1 November in order to give the administration more time in which to meet the requirement. Last year the list was over a month late. Despite repeated messages that this deliberate flouting of the law was not acceptable, the administration has again failed to submit the list or to offer any explanations. The list has yet to leave the State Department and must still wait for the laborious interagency review process. There is every likelihood that the list will be significantly late again this year.  With this as background, I have asked to be consulted on any unanimous-consent requests involving consideration of the nominations I have indicated until such time as the administration complies with the law. I will consider additional requests depending on the delay that is involved in the administration complying. I regret this course but I regret more the administration's failure to comply with the law.                          ____________________
