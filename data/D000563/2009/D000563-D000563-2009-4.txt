President, I wish to thank my colleague. That letter from his constituent is heartfelt and should be an inspiration to all of us to get this job done. We have sacrificed. This is the 24th day debating this bill. Some of these sessions have been early in the morning and late at night, but I think the time has been well spent. People have come to the floor and spoken at great length but no one more eloquently than your constituent who sent you that letter.  Come tomorrow morning, we will have the official vote--very early in the morning. I would like to say to my colleagues from West Virginia and Minnesota that we have a piece of news. A lot of what has been said on the floor has been said by others and said before, but this is a piece of news worth reporting. Our bill--the health care reform bill--has been endorsed by the American Medical Association, the largest physician organization in this country; endorsed by the American Hospital Association, the largest organization representing our hospitals; it has been endorsed by the American Association of Retired Persons, the largest senior citizens organization, which focuses intensely on the future of Medicare; and today we have received the endorsement of what is regarded by most as the most highly respected medical organization in America. If you ask most Americans whom do you respect the most, it is the nurses. You know why. Because when you are in a hospital with someone you love or in the care of a doctor, it is the nurse who is with you in those moments that make a lifetime.
