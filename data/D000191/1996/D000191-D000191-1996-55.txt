Speaker, I thank the gentleman and I appreciate that there will not be an amendment on star wars. Here is a fantasy program created by Ronald Reagan that has spent over $40 billion. The total results are one phonied-up test over the Pacific Ocean, which the Pentagon admits it phonied up. It did not actually work. They blew it up with a detonator. And now we are going to go ahead with billions of dollars more.  In fact, we are going to mandate deployment on an antimissile system. Which one? None of them work. Well, we do not know, but within 7 years we will deploy one for up to $40 billion or $50 billion. Probably it will not work and it is not needed.  We have missile defense in this country. It worked against the greatest threat to this country's freedom and security, the Soviet Union, for 50 years. Mutually assured destruction. No Podunk third World terrorist nation is going to launch a missile at the United States of America that is identifiable because they know they would no longer exist.  We do not need that kind of missile defense. We need defense against terrorist weapons. But we will not have the discussion about star wars here on the floor. That amendment will not be allowed.  We are not going to have a discussion about the fact that the Department of Defense cannot account for $15 billion over the last 10 years. Now, if any other agency of government were missing $500,000, we would have special committees and investigations.  Mr. Speaker, members should vote ``no'' on the rule.
