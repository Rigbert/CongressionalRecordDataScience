Speaker, I thank the gentleman for yielding me the time, and I first want to associate myself with the remarks of all who have said that we ought to condemn violence wherever we find it.  Mr. Speaker, I think everybody in this House agrees with that premise. I think we ought to also agree with the premise that the United States really is the best hope for resolution of the peace process as an honest broker. I agree with that premise, but agreeing with that premise does not, in my opinion, adopt another premise, and, that is, that the United States ought not to call things as it sees it.  That we do not adopt the facts as we find them. I find the facts to be as have been stated on this floor, that the two parties share a great enmity for one another, but I believe that one of those parties, Israel, has accepted the premise that they will exist in an area with Palestinians and with Arabs.  Regrettably, however, I must say to my friends that I am not sure that the Palestinians have accepted the premise that they will live in a neighborhood with the Israelis. It is my view that that is the nub of the problem.  Mr. Speaker, because that is the nub of the problem, it is appropriate for us to say so, and it is appropriate for us to urge both sides, but particularly, Mr. Arafat--and I say to my friend, the gentleman from West Virginia (Mr. Rahall), who is a dear and good friend of mine--that I think Mr. Arafat does have a responsibility, and to exercise that responsibility, to articulate to his people whom he leads, that peace is the only avenue to bring resolution, and that the 40,000 police force that he commands should, in fact, make a greater effort to maintain peace.  We know they cannot do it perfectly, but we would urge them, and do so in this resolution, to accomplish peace in the Middle East through reconciliation and not violence.
