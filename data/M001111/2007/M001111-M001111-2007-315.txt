 President, I revise my unanimous consent request: that at 8:30 this evening, the Senate proceed to vote in relation to the following amendments--we will remove the Salazar amendment--and that no other amendments will be in order: Lieberman amendment No. 2407, Sanders amendment No. 2498, and DeMint amendment No. 2481.
