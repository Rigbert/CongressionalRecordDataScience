And I was kidding on saying that.  I want to tell you frankly, on the Republican side, you guys look so much better than you did when we served together, and we want all of you back on our side of the aisle. We're voting to reelect you.  But I am so pleased to be here with all of you. I had the opportunity to say just a few words yesterday, but I particularly wanted to be here, and I don'tsee my Republican Speaker here. I think some of you know that story. Ray LaHood was presiding, and it was the nineties, '95, early '95, and I went up to Ray. We had about--I forget exactly--199 Members at that point in time. I went to Ray and I said, ``Ray, if you can get 20 votes, I will get 199, and we'll elect Bob Michel Speaker.'' But we didn't do that, as you noticed historically.  But I fondly recall with you the days when we really did sit down and work together on a lot of things in a positive way and get things done for our country. We're not doing that as well this time, as you know. Ray would tell you that, working in the administration, but I particularly wanted to be here this morning.  I don't see Bob here. Is Bob coming?
