Mr. Speaker, as ranking member of the House Treasury, Postal Service and General Government Appropriations Subcommittee, I rise today to commend nine members of the U.S. Secret Service for their heroic efforts in helping rescue almost 2 dozen individuals from a burning building in Washington, DC.  Many Americans view the role of agents of the U.S. Secret Service as that of protecting the President of the United States and the members of his Cabinet--which it is. However, on March 14, officers Thomas F. Owens, Jr., Gregory S. Cleckner, Paolo Palumbo, Phillip M. Bernal, George L. Sax, Kenneth J. Bouley, Kenneth B. Parsons, and Sergeants William S. Rick and Charles F. Kuzmovich of the Uniformed Division of the Secret Service, went beyond their assigned duties and helped to evacuate 21 residents from an engulfed building on 14th Street NW in Washington, DC.  The Secret Service officers on the scene, even prior to the arrival of the fire department, not only went door to door and helped residents leave the structure, but they also assisted a number of individuals who were trapped in windows and were afraid to leave the structure.  Mr. Speaker, the quick-thinking efforts by these nine Secret Service agents undoubtedly helped to save the lives of a number of individuals and I hope my colleagues join me in saluting their heroic efforts.                          ____________________
