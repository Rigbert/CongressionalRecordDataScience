Chairman, I move to strike the requisite number of words.  Mr. Chairman, I think it is unfortunate that the gentleman from New Mexico objected. What we see here is a last-ditch attempt to preserve a $10 million subsidy to western cattle and sheep ranchers. Half a million dollars of this money flows to my own State, so I am not just out there cutting in other people's States.  Seventeen western States receive $10 million to conduct activities on predator control to protect livestock on private property at no expense to the landowner. Clearly a large majority of the House supported that amendment and that intent. As the gentleman from New Hampshire stated, due to a drafting error by Legislative Counsel, we may have cut more and may have extended the impact beyond that subsidy in the 17 western States to private livestock and ranching interests. So we have a number of opportunities here.  The gentleman from New Hampshire attempted to insert one word, the word ``operations,'' to make absolutely clear what the 36-vote majority of the House intended at that time. I shortly will offer another opportunity to the chairman and would urge the chairman to take it, because I have got to inform Members at this point in time, despite the potential error, the groups that had vital interest in the original vote are no longer interested in the original vote. The scoring will be on the revote. Because even if the chairman objects, the inadvertent language problem can certainly be fixed in the conference committee.  It was the clear intent of the House and a majority of this House to end this subsidy to private ranching interests while fully protecting public health and safety over a range of other issues that are conducted by APHIS out of its $500 million budget. I am going to in a moment give the chairman one more chance, because I know the chairman believes he will prevailand will be able to preserve the $10 million subsidy to the private ranching interests for one more year.
