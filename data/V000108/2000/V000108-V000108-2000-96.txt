Speaker, Saturday, November 11, 2000, marks the observance of Veterans Day, honoring all veterans who have pledged allegiance to their country and all of its endeavors. This day is sets aside to recognize the boldness and bravery of those who have fought to uphold the standards of democracy.  Just prior to Veterans Day on Thursday, November 9, a special ceremony titled, ``Salute 2000: An American Patriotic Celebration'' will be held at the Radisson Star Plaza Theatre in Merrillville, Indiana, to celebrate patriotism and pride and to honor five local veterans for their dedicated military service. Those veterans that will be honored include: Joseph M. Dzieglowicz, John Gamez, David Hinshaw, Harry Kaczorowski and James J. Thiel.  Joseph M. Dzieglowicz, a United States Army veteran of World War II, served our country from October 12, 1942 to December 28, 1945 as a combat engineer with the 339th Engineer Construction Battalion. He stayed with the 339th Battalion for his entire 30 months of duty in the southwest Pacific theatre of operations. John Gamez is another fine example of one of our American heroes. As a member of the Armed Forces, John Gamez earned numerous medals during his tour of duty in Korea including the Silver Star Medal, two Purple Heart Medals, the Korean Service Medal with three Bronze Service Stars, the Republic of Korea United Citation, the United Nations Service Medal and the Combat Infantry Badge. Additionally, David C. Hinshaw of Hammond, Indiana, is a veteran of the United States Army. He left the active Army in 1973 and joined the Indiana National Guard. While in the National Guard, Captain Hinshaw rose to Lieutenant Colonel and later Commander 2nd of the 151st Infantry in South Bend, Indiana. Hinshaw was a member of the Army Reserves until his retirement in 1998. As a member of the United States Army, Harry Kaczorowski served his country until he was discharged in December of 1944. During the Battle of Kasserine Pass, Kaczorowski was taken as a prisoner of war by General Rommel's Afrika Korps and was later liberated by the Soviets in 1945. A graduate of Dyer High School, James J. Thiel enrolled in the Army Air Corps at age 19 and served his country until 1945. Thiel earned the Presidential Unit Citation with Cluster, Aerial Gunner's Wings, ETO Ribbon with four Battle Stars, Air Medal with Six Clusters, Good Conduct Medal and a WW-2 Victory Medal for his 50 aerial combat missions over northern Italy, Austria, Bulgaria, Yugoslavia, Germany, southern France and the Balkens.  The great sacrifice made by these five men and those who served our country has resulted in the freedom and prosperity of our country and in countries around the world. The responsibility rests within each of us to build upon the valiant efforts that these men and women who fought for this country have displayed, so that the United States and the world will be a more democratic and prosperous place. To properly honor the heroism of our troops, we must make the most of our freedom secured by their efforts.  In addition to the five veterans who are to be honored at this patriotic celebration, I would also like to commend all of those who served this country for their bravery, courage, and undying commitment to patriotism and democracy. May God bless them all.  We will forever be indebted to our veterans and their families for the sacrifices they made so that we can enjoy our freedom. Mr. Speaker, I ask that you and my colleagues join me in saluting these five men and the other veterans who have fought for our great country.                          ____________________
