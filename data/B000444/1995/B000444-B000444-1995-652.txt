 President; today I and Senator McConnell are introducing the Law Enforcement Officers' Bill of Rights Act of 1995, a bill aimed at protecting the rights of law enforcement officers on the front line of this Nation's fight against violent crime and drug trafficking.  Police work is an incredibly difficult job, demanding split-second decisions that have life-or-death consequences. My colleagues may be surprised to find that despite the critical role that front-line law enforcement officers play to enforce the Constitution's rights and guarantees, and the related need to guarantee the highest standards of police conduct, internal disciplinary procedures in law enforcement agencies continue to vary widely across the nation.  The often ad hoc procedures that many departments use to guide internal investigations frequently allows police executives to take arbitrary and unfair actions against innocent police officers, while allowing culpable officers to avoid any punishment at all.  The law enforcement officers' bill of rights is designed to replace the ad hoc nature of many internal police investigations by encouraging States to provide minimum procedural standards to guide such investigations. The standards and protections offered by this bill are modeled on the Standards for Law Enforcement Agencies developed by the National Commission on Accreditation for Law Enforcement.  As the preface to the Commission's standards on internal affairs notes:       `The internal affairs function is important for the      maintenance of professional conduct in a law enforcement      agency. The integrity of the agency depends on the personal      integrity and discipline of each employee. To a large degree,      the public image of the agency is determined by the quality      of the internal affairs function in responding to allegations      of misconduct by the agency or its employees.  The specific standards and rights guaranteed by the law enforcement officers bill of rights introduced today include:       The right to engage or not engage in political activities      independent of an officer's official capacity;       The right to be informed by a written statement of the      charges brought against an officer;       The right to be free from undue coercion or harassment      during an investigation; and       The right to counsel during an investigation.  The provisions of this bill will take effect at the end of the second full legislative term of each State. After such time, a law enforcement officer whose rights have been abridged may sue in State court for pecuniary and other damages, including full reinstatement.  Although the bill provides certain procedural rights, it gives States considerable discretion in implementing these safeguards, including the flexibility to provide for summary punishment and emergency suspensions of law enforcement officers.  It is also important to note what the bill does not do. The bill explicitly provides that the standards and protections governing internal investigations shall not apply to investigations of criminal misconduct by law enforcement officers. As a result, criminal investigations of law enforcement officers would not be affected by this bill.  Moreover, the protections in this bill do not apply to minor violations of departmental rules or regulations, not to actions taken on the basis of an officers' employment-related performance.  I would also like to acknowledge the hard work of several of the Nation's leading law enforcement organizations on this important bill. the real leaders behind this effort--and they have been the leaders since the police officers' bill of rights won passage in the Senate in 1991--are the Fraternal Order of Police, the National Association of Police Organizations, and the International Brotherhood of Police Officers. No one should be confused about where the force behind the law enforcement officers bill of rights lies--it lies with these organizations.  Finally, let me say to the entire law enforcement community--you enjoy one of the most amicable and productive relationships between the rank and file and management. Many have observed that the reason for these relations is the fact that today's chief was yesterday's patrol officer--just as today's patrol officer will be tomorrow's sheriff. That is why I look forward to working with all members of the law enforcement community to pass legislation protecting the rights of all law enforcement officers.  Mr. President, I have heard many Members of the Senate reflect on the commitment of those brave individuals who risk their lives as front-line law enforcement officers. Mr. President, the bill we introduce today gives every Member of the Senate the chance to provide at least some of the protections these police heroes deserve.                                 ______      By Mr. D'AMATO:  S. 337. A bill to enhance competition in the financial services sector, and for other purposes; to the Committee on Banking, Housing, and Urban Affairs.           the depository institution affiliation act of 1995 Mr. D'AMATO. Mr. President, I today introduce the Depository Institution Affiliation Act of 1995 to modernize the antiquated laws governing the financial services industry. I am pleased that Representative Richard Baker, chairman of the House Banking Subcommittee on Capital Markets, Securities and Government Sponsored Enterprises, will today introduce similar legislation. This comprehensive legislation seeks:  To promote competition among bank and nonbank providers of financial services;  To encourage innovation in the design and delivery of financial services and products to individuals, large and small businesses, nonprofit institutions, and municipalities;  To ensure the adequate regulation of financial intermediaries in order to protect depositors and investors;  To preserve the safety and soundness of the banking system and the overall financial system; and  To protect the Nation's taxpayers by requiring that nonbanking activities are conducted in separately capitalized and functionally regulated affiliates.  Mr. President, now is the time to ready the Nation's financial services industry for the 21st century. Congress has allowed regulation of the financial services industry, a goliath with 5 million employees and $16 trillion in assets, to fall far behind market forces. Since the late 1970's, market forces have fueled massive changes in the financial services industry. But the [[Page S2050]] United States still relies on a regulatory system, born in the wake of the Great Depression, which stifles competition among providers of financial services. Without comprehensive reform, the Nation risks losing its leadership in the global market for financial services to Europe and Japan.  Mr. President, this bill is virtually identical to legislation that I have previously sponsored or cosponsored. I first introduced this bill in 1987 as S. 1905, and I reintroduced it in 1989 as S. 530. The actual text of the 1995 bill, and its significant principles and provisions, are identical to the earlier versions. The 1995 version, however, contains technical and conforming changes to reflect the enactment of banking laws since its original introduction, such as the Financial Institutions Reform and Recovery and Enforcement Act of 1989, Public Law 101-73, the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation Improvement Act of 1991, Public Law 102-242, and the interstate banking and community development bills of the last Congress.  Mr. President, I remain committed to comprehensive, fair, and innovative financial services reform. Congress must assert its authority and meet its responsibility to increase the availability of innovative financial products and services for consumers, businesses and Government at the lowest possible cost.  Mr. President, let me summarize the key provisions of the Depository Institution Affiliation Act [DIAA]. I will submit a more detailed section-by-section explanation of the bill at the end of my remarks.  In general, the DIAA retains and reinforces the basic principles reflected in the present framework for regulation of federally insured banks and thrifts, while permitting banks and nonbanks to affiliate in a holding company framework. The DIAA thus preserves all the safety-and-soundness and conflict-of-interest protections of the present system, while providing legal flexibility for a company to meet the financial needs of consumers, businesses and others by removing limitations on affiliations.  Mr. President, the DIAA would establish a new charter alternative for all companies interested in entering or diversifying in the financial services field--a financial services holding company [FSHC]. The bill would permit the merging of banking and commerce under carefully regulated circumstances by allowing a FSHC to own both a depository institution and companies engaged in both financial and nonfinancial activities.  Mr. President, by authorizing an alternative regulatory framework, the legislation would essentially exempt a FSHC's subsidiaries and affiliates from those sections of the Glass-Steagall and Bank Holding Company Acts that restrict mixing commercial banking with other financial--securities, investment banking, and so forth--and nonfinancial activities--retailing, technology, manufacturing. A FSHC would be able to diversify into any activity through affiliates of the holding company with such affiliates subject to enhanced regulation.  Mr. President, the regulation of the bank and nonbank affiliates of financial services holding companies would be along functional lines. The insured-bank affiliate would be regulated by Federal and State bank regulators, the securities affiliate by the Securities and Exchange Commission, and so on. Thus, for each affiliate, existing regulatory expertise will be applied to protect consumers, investors and taxpayers. Functional regulation will also assure that competition in discrete products and services is fair by eliminating current loopholes and regulatory gaps.  Mr. President, I want to underscore that the DIAA would not require existing firms to alter their regulatory structure. By permitting financial services providers to become FSHC's, such providers will have the options to phase gradually into, or expand within, the financial services industry.  Mr. President, our country still relies on a system of financial regulation that was established in the aftermath of the economic collapse of the 1930's and the Great Depression. By restricting competition among the various sectors of the financial services industry, the Glass-Steagall Act of 1933, the Federal securities law of that era, and the Bank Holding Company Act of 1956 sought to enhance the safety of financial instruments and intermediaries.  Mr. President, the past 20 years have seen a growing competition among providers of financial services. Banks seek more freedom to sell securities, mutual funds and insurance. Nonbank lenders, such as brokerage and insurance firms, offer commercial loans and other financing arrangements to business. And, finance companies and their commercial owners now play an increased role in the Nation's financial system. Many financial intermediaries provide functionally equivalent products and services.  Mr. President, the United States must adopt a regulatory regime that recognizes market realities and assesses and controls risk. Our present patchwork of financial laws protects particular industries, restrains competition, prevents diversification that would limit risks, restricts potential sources of capital, and undermines the efficient delivery of services and the competitive position of our financial institutions in world markets.  Mr. President, the Banking Committee and other committees of Congress have already held exhaustive hearings on the issues raised by the DIAA and reviewed bookshelves full of studies and blueprints for financial reform. Rather than enact comprehensive reform, Congress has thus far ceded the playing field to piecemeal deregulation by bank regulators and the courts. We must now end this debate and enact a legal framework that prepares our financial institutions for the new century and the challenges of a rapidly changing global economy.  Mr. President, the DIAA represents a good starting point and a sound approach to modernizing our financial structure. I recognize that this bill can be improved from the 1987 version, and I am specifically requesting constructive and helpful comments to improve and to refine the major principles underlying the bill.  Mr. President, congressional studies, Federal regulators, and industry leaders have supported comprehensive reform of the Nation's financial system. The Treasury Department's study, ``Modernizing the Financial System: Recommendations for Safer, More Competitive Banks'' (1991), essentially endorsed the legislation I am introducing today. In the recently enacted Riegle-Neal Interstate Banking and Efficiency Act of 1994 Congress directed Treasury to conduct another study of the Nation's financial services system. In a letter sent to Secretary Rubin today, I have strongly urged the Treasury Department to endorse and to reaffirm the basic conclusions of its 1991 study and to make further recommendations to promote competitiveness and efficiency, and to protect the taxpayer.  Mr. President, given the broad support for comprehensive reform, why has Congress not overhauled the antiquated laws governing financial services? Why has Congress, by default, permitted the bank regulatory agencies and the courts to rewrite, in an ad hoc fashion, these laws?  Mr. President, the answer is clear. Congress, Federal regulators, and the affected industries have lacked the vision to support the comprehensive reform reflected in this bill. We have debated bank deregulation and expanded bank powers. This polarizing debate has pitted the banks against securities firms, big banks against small banks, and banks against insurance agents and real estate brokers.  Mr. President, history must not repeat itself. Today, as the Fed, the FDIC and the Comptroller of the Currency consider modifying their rules to permit banks, nonbank affiliates of holding companies and operating subsidiaries of national banks to engage in a de novo or additional securities and insurance activities, I have a sense of deja vu. In 1987, the Competitive Equality Banking Act was passed to preserve Congress' ability to conduct a comprehensive review of banking and financial laws, and to make decisions on the need for financial restructuring legislation. Congress imposed a statutory moratorium on the authority of bank regulators to approve certain securities, insurance and real estate activities, 100-86. This moratorium ended on March 1, 1988.  Mr. President, the Banking Committee closely monitors activities and [[Page S2051]] rulemaking of Federal bank regulators. With all the talk around Washington of regulatory moratoriums, I strongly urge bank regulators to support our efforts to rewrite the laws they administer rather than to stretch current laws beyond their statutory terms or the intent of Congress.  Mr. President, our outdated regulatory regime has hurt the global competitiveness of U.S. financial institutions. Over the past 20 years, in part because financial markets in Japan and Europe are less regulated than in the United States, the number of American banks among the top 25 in the world has dropped from eight to none. In an era of increased globalization and free trade, as illustrated by NAFTA and GATT, we must not shackle U.S. financial institutions with a statutory framework that responds to the policy concerns of the 1930's.  Mr. President, the 104th Congress must address and resolve the important questions relating to the health and future of the banking industry in the broader context of a financial system that is increasingly composed of nonbank financial service providers. We must focus on the needs of our economy for credit and growth in the future and the next century. We must focus on financial stability, safety and soundness, fair competition, and functional regulation of all financial service providers--whether they are banks, investment banks, insurance companies, finance companies or even telecommunications or computer companies.  Mr. President, we must live up to the challenge. In recent years, Congress has responded quickly and effectively to correct deficiencies or excesses in the financial system. In the face of problems created by stock market breaks, depleted deposit insurance funds, or credit crunches, we have addressed serious financial crises. In the process, Congress has prudently learned that statutory provisions adopted in the 1930's can aggravate and actually create problems for depository institution and other financial providers in the 1980's and 1990's--for example, interest rate controls, restrictions on interstate banking, portfolio concentrations, and statutory impediments to diversification. Congress has eliminated or modified many of these provisions of law in the past decade for banks and thrifts. The homogenization of financial service and globalization of markets has also necessitated the close coordination by discrete regulators, nationally and internationally, through informal mechanisms, such as the Treasury Department's Working Group and the so-called Basle Committee. In recent years, in FIRREA and FIDICA, Congress has also employed market-oriented substitutes for direct government regulation, such as industry developed codes of conduct, capital strength, internal controls, management information systems and management experience.  Mr. President, Congress must modernize the restrictions on affiliations found in the Glass-Steagall and Bank Holding Company Acts. I introduce this bill today, and make these extensive remarks, to underscore the critical national importance of modernizing our financial system. Last year, Congress was finally able to eliminate barriers to interstate banking, to facilitate the securitization of small business loans, and to prune outdated and burdensome regulatory requirements. Those bills were the result of a successful collaboration among the administration, Federal and State regulators, and providers and consumers of financial services. I seek to sustain this process and pass comprehensive financial services reform during this Congress.  Mr. President, history demonstrates that financial services reform that is not comprehensive will not be enacted. I have previously opposed piecemeal reform because such reform is not pro-competitive, is inconsistent with the objective of ``competitive equality'' articulated by Congress in 1987 and the Treasury's 1991 study, and will not advance the long-term interests of the banking industry or the United States.  Mr. President, the DIAA will make the financial system as a whole safer and more stable. Rather than debate the important but narrow issue of the future of the banking franchise and the role of banks in the economy and attempt to gerrymander markets through piecemeal legislation to protect any single component, Congress must enact comprehensive legislation. Only comprehensive legislation will produce beneficial changes for all financial intermediaries by:  Permitting financial intermedi- aries--commercial banks, investment banks, thrifts, et cetera--to attract capital by eliminating existing restrictions on ownership by and affiliations among depository and nondepository firms;  Facilitating diversification and assuring fair competition by creating a new category of financial service holding companies authorized to engage in any financial activity through separately regulated subsidiaries;  Insulating insured subsidiaries from the more risky business activities of other affiliates as well as the parent holding company;  Enhancing substantially the quality and effectiveness of regulation through functional regulation;  Improving coordination and supervision of the overall financial system by permitting more effective analysis and monitoring of aggregate stability and vulnerability to severe disruptions and breakdown; and  Removing unnecessary barriers to competition between providers of financial service in the United States in order to maintain the preeminence of the U.S. capital markets and U.S. financial intermediaries and to respond to growing competition from foreign companies.  Mr. President, this legislation, as introduced, is not intended to force major changes in the insurance industry. Nevertheless, it will affect issues important to the insurance agents, insurance companies, and financial institutions engaged in insurance activities. The exact impact of the legislation on the relationship between banking and insurance will continue to be examined--especially the issues raised by traditional State regulation of the business of insurance.  Immediately following the bill's introduction, the Banking Committee will begin to examine issues relating to bank involvement in insurance activities. In the end, I expect the bill to balance appropriately fair competition, functional regulation and respect for the traditional leadership of the States in insurance regulation. As the committee proceeds to hearings and further consideration of the bill, I intend to make changes and adjustments in order to ensure fairness, safety and soundness, consumer protection, and effective and efficient regulation, particularly as it relates to insurance and other financial products.  Mr. President, I introduce the Depository Institution Affiliation Act as a prelude to a vigorous debate about the future of our financial system. I strongly believe that this Congress can achieve the passage of a comprehensive financial services reform bill. By working together, the Congress and the administration can overcome the complaints of vested interests and reform our antiquated financial services laws. We should not miss this opportunity for constructive bipartisanship.  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that more detailed section-by-section summary of the bill and a copy of my letter to Secretary Rubin be reprinted in the Record.  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in the Record, as follows:  Depository Institution Affiliation Act--Section-by-Section Analysis       Section 1: Short Title and table of contents.       Section 1 provides that this Act be cited as the      ``Depository Institution Affiliation Act''.       Section 2: Findings and Purpose.       The purpose of this Act is to promote the safety and      soundness of the nation's financial system, to increase the      availability of financial products and services to consumers,      businesses, charitable institutions and government in an      efficient and cost effective manner. In addition, this Act      aims to promote a legal structure governing providers of      financial services that permits open and fair competition and      affords all financial services companies equal opportunity to      serve the full range of credit and financial needs in the      marketplace. This Act also aims to ensure that domestic      financial institutions and companies are able to compete      effectively in international financial markets. Finally, this      Act aims to regulate financial activities and companies along      functional lines without regard to ownership, control, or      affiliation.  [[Page S2052]] title i--creation and control of financial services                            holding companies       Section 101. This section creates a new type of financial      company, a Financial Services Holding Company, and sets out      the terms and conditions under which such a company can be      established and must be operated.       Subsection (a) Definitions. This subsection defines terms      used in this section.       Paragraph (a)(1) Financial Services Holding Company      (FSHC)--defines a FSHC to be any company that files a notice      with the National Financial Services Committee (see Title II      of this Act) that it intends to comply with the provisions of      this section, and controls an insured depository institution,      or, either (i) has, within the preceding 12 months filed a      notice under subsection (b) of this section to establish or      acquire control of a federally insured depository institution      or a company owning such a federally insured depository      institution, or (ii) controls a company which, within the      preceding 12 months, has filed an application for federal      deposit insurance, provided that such notice or application      has not been disapproved by the appropriate Federal banking      agency or withdrawn. Any bank holding company      which elects to become a FSHC will lose its status as a bank      holding company immediately upon filing the notice of its      election to become a FSHC. Similarly, a savings and loan      holding company that elects to become a FSHC will lose      that status upon filing the notice of its election to      become a FSHC.       Paragraph (a)(2) Bank Holding Company--gives the term      ``bank holding company'' the meaning given to it in section      2(a) of the Bank Holding Company Act of 1956, as amended.       Paragraph (a)(3) Savings and Loan Holding Company--gives      the term ``savings and loan holding company'' the meaning      given to it in section 10(a) of the Home Owners' Loan Act.       Paragraph (a)(4) Affiliate--defines for this section,      except paragraph (5) of subsection (f), the term      ``affiliate'' of a company as any company which controls, is      controlled by, or is under common control with such a      company.       Paragraph (a)(5) Appropriate Federal Banking Agency      (AFBA)--gives the term ``appropriate Federal banking agency''      the meaning given to it in section 3 of the Federal Deposit      Insurance Act.       Paragraph (a)(6) Depository Institution and Insured      Depository Institution--gives the term ``depository      institution'' and ``insured depository institution'' the      meaning given to them in section 3 of the Federal Deposit      Insurance Act.       Paragraph (a)(7) State--gives the term ``State'' the      meaning given to it in section 3 of the Federal Deposit      Insurance Act.       Paragraph (a)(8) Company--defines the term ``company'' to      mean any corporation, partnership, business trust,      association or similar organization. However, corporations      that are majority owned by the United States or any State are      excluded from the definition of company.       Paragraph (a)(9) Control--defines control by one company      over another. For purposes of this section, the term      ``control'' means the power, directly or indirectly, to      direct the management or policies of a company, or to vote      25% or more of any class of voting securities of a company.       There are three exceptions from the definition of control:      These pertain to ownership of voting securities acquired or      held:       1. as agent, trustee or in some other fiduciary capacity;       2. as underwriter for such a period of time as will permit      the sale of these securities on a reasonable basis; or in      connection with or incidental to market making, dealing,      trading, brokerage or other securities-related activities,      provided that such shares are not acquired with a view      toward acquiring, exercising or transferring control of      the management or policies of the company;       3. for the purpose of securing or collection of a prior      debt until two years after the date of the acquisition; and       In addition, no company formed for the sole purpose of      proxy solicitation shall be deemed to be in control of      another company by virtue of its acquisition of the voting      rights of the other company's securities.       Paragraph (a)(10) Adequately Capi- talized--the term      `adequately capitalized' with respect to an insured      depository institution has the meaning given to it in section      38(b)(1) of the Federal Deposit Insurance Act.       Paragraph (a)(11) Well Capitalized--the term `well      capitalized' with respect to an insured depository      institution has the meaning given to it in section 38(b)(1)      of the Federal Deposit Insurance Act.       Paragraph (a)(12) Minimum Required Capital--defines the      term `minimum required capital' with respect to an insured      depository institution as the amount of capital that is      required to be adequately capitalized.       Paragraph (a)(13) Domestic Branch--gives the term `domestic      branch' the same meaning as in section 3(o) of the Federal      Deposit Insurance Act.       Subsection (b): Changes in Control of Insured Depository      Institutions. This subsection provides that any FSHC wishing      to acquire control of an insured depository institution or      company owning such insured depository institution must      comply with the requirements of the Change in Bank Control      Act. Failure to comply with these requirements will subject      the relevant FSHC to the penalties and procedures provided in      subsections (i) through (m) of this section, in addition to      otherwise applicable penalties.       Subsection (c): Affiliate Transactions. This subsection      empowers each AFBA to impose restrictions on affiliate      transactions to prohibit unsafe or unsound practices. These      regulations would be in addition to the restrictions on      interaffiliate transactions provided for under sections 23A      or 23B of the Federal Reserve Act. This subsection gives each      AFBA some flexibility to promulgate and adapt rules and      regulations in response to changing market conditions so that      the AFBA has at all times the capability to prevent insured      depository institutions under its      supervision that are controlled by FSHCs from engaging in      transactions that would compromise the safety and      soundness of such insured depository institutions or that      would jeopardize the deposit insurance funds.       Moreover, other provisions of this Act assure that the AFBA      will have the capability to enforce these regulations      vigorously (subsection (i) of this section) and that any      violations of these regulations will be more severely      punished than violations of regulations applicable to insured      depository institutions that are not controlled by FSHCs      (subsections (i), (j), (k) and (l) of this section).       Paragraph (c)(2) Regulatory Activity--provides that any      rules adopted under subparagraph (c)(1)(A) shall be issued in      accordance with normal rulemaking procedures and shall afford      interested parties the opportunity to comment in writing and      orally on any proposed rule.       Paragraph (c)(3) Application to Prior Approved      Transactions--grandfathers inter- affiliate      transactions specifically approved by a AFBA prior to the      enactment of this Act.       Paragraph (c)(4) Federal Reserve Act Treatment--makes it      clear that sections 23A and 23B of the Federal Reserve Act      will apply to every insured depository institution controlled      by a financial services holding company.       Paragraphs (c) (5) and (6) Limitations and Exception--     prohibits any insured depository institution controlled by a      FSHC from extending credit to or purchasing the assets of a      securities affiliate and providing other types of financial      support to that FSHC's securities affiliate except for      daylight overdrafts that relate to U.S. Government securities      transactions if the daylight overdrafts are fully      collateralized by U.S. Government securities as to principal      and interest.       Paragraph (c)(7) Limitation on Certain Marketability      Activities--prohibits insured depository institutions      controlled by a FSHC from providing any type of guarantee for      the purpose of enhancing the marketability of a securities      issue underwritten or distributed by a securities affiliate      of that FSHC.       Paragraph (c)(8) Activities During Securities      Distribution--prohibits insured depository institutions      controlled by a FSHC from extending credit secured by or for      the purposes of purchasing any security during an      underwriting period or for 30 days thereafter where a      securities affiliate or such institution participates as an      underwriter or member of a selling group.       Paragraph (c)(9) Extensions of Credit for Payment of      Dividends--prohibits insured depository institutions      controlled by a FSHC from extending credit to an issuer of      securities underwritten by a securities affiliate for the      purpose of paying the principal of those securities or      interest for dividends on those securities.       Paragraph (c)(10) Securities Affiliate Defined--defines      `securities affiliate' for the purposes of paragraphs (c)(5)      through (c)(9) as a company that engages in underwriting,      distributing or dealing in securities, except insurance      products.       Subsection (d): Capitalization. This subsection regulates      the capitalization of insured depository institutions that      are controlled by a FSHC.       Paragraph (d)(1) In General--requires that insured      depository institutions controlled by a FSHC be well      capitalized.       Paragraph (d)(2) Actions by Federal Regulators--Provides      that if the AFBA finds that an insured depository institution      subsidiary of a FSHC is not well capitalized, the FSHC shall      have thirty days to reach an agreement without the AFBA      concerning how and according to what schedule the insured      depository institution will bring its minimum capital back      into conformance with requirements. During that time the      insured depository institution shall operate under the close      supervision of the AFBA.       In the event that the FSHC does not reach an agreement      within thirty days with the AFBA on how and according to what      schedule the capital of the insured depository institution      will be replenished, the FSHC will be required to divest the      insured depository institution in an orderly manner within a      period of six months, or such additional period of time as      the AFBA may determine is reasonably required in order to      effect such divestiture.       Paragraph (d)(3) Capital of Holding Company--Prohibits a      AFBA from imposing any capital requirement on a FSHC.       Subsection (e): Interstate Acquisitions and Activities of      Insured Depository Institutions. This subsection subjects      interstate acquisitions of an insured depository institution      by a FSHC to the same restrictions as those applicable to      bank holding companies under section 3(d) of the Bank Holding      Company Act of 1956, as amended, and it subjects interstate      acquisitions of savings associations by a FSHC to the same      restrictions as those applicable to savings and loan holding      companies. It also treats a FSHC as a BHC      [[Page S2053]] for purposes of Section 18(r) of the Federal      Deposit Insurance Act regarding affiliate depository      institution agency activities.       Subsection (f): Differential Treatment Prohibition; Laws      Inconsistent with this Act. This subsection does two things.      First, it prohibits adversely differential treatment of FSHCs      and their affiliates, including their insured depository      institution affiliates, except as this Act specifically      provides. Second, this subsection ensures that state and      federal initiatives do not undermine achievement of the      purposes of this Act. Whether couched as affiliation,      licensing or agency restrictions or as constraints on access      to state courts, such laws effectively perpetuate market      barriers and deny consumers the opportunity to choose between      different financial products and services.       Paragraph (f)(1) this paragraph specifically prohibits      states from enacting laws that discriminate against FSHCs or      against their affiliates, including their insured depository      institution affiliates. This paragraph also prohibits,      notwithstanding any other federal law, federal and state      regulatory agencies from discriminating by rule, regulation,      order or any other means against FSHCs or against their      affiliates, including their insured depository institution      affiliates, except as this Act specifically provides. This is      intended to assure that the primary purpose of this Act--the      enhancement of competition in the depository institution      sector--will be fulfilled.       Paragraph (f)(2) Application of State Laws--this subsection      recognizes that certain State affiliation and licensing laws      restrain legitimate competition in interstate commerce, deny      consumers freedom of choice in selecting an insured      depository institution and threaten the long-term safety and      soundness of insured depository institutions by limiting      their access to capital.       Accordingly, with the exception of certain laws related to      insurance and real estate brokerage which are treated in      Subsection (g), this paragraph preempts any provision of      federal or state law, rule, regulation or order that is      expressly or impliedly inconsistent with the provisions of      this section. The preempted statutes include state banking,      savings and loan, securities, finance company, retail or      other laws which restrict the affiliation of insured      depository institutions or their owners, agents, principals,      brokers, directors, officers, employees or other      representatives with other firms. Similarly, laws prohibiting      cross marketing of products and services are preempted      insofar as such cross marketing activities are conducted by      FSHCs, their affiliates, or by any agent, principal, broker,      director, officer, employee or other representative. By      contrast, nondiscriminatory state approval, examination,      supervisory, regulatory, reporting, licensing, and similar      requirements are not affected.       Paragraph (f)(3) Laws Affecting Court Actions--removes a      common uncertainty under state licensing and qualification to      do business statutes, which leaves an out-of-state insured      depository institution's access to another state's courts      unresolved. Under this provision, so long as such an insured      depository institution limits its activities to those which      do not constitute the establishment or operation of a      ``domestic branch'' of an insured depository institution in      that other state, it can qualify to maintain or defend in      that state's court any action which could be maintained or      defended by a company which is not an insured depository      institution and is not located in that state, subject to the      same filing, fee and other conditions as may be imposed on      such a company. This paragraph is not intended to grant      states any power that they do not currently have to regulate      the activities of out-of-state insured depository      institutions.       Paragraph (f)(4) Other Restrictions--makes clear that a      state, except subject to the provisions of this Act, may not      impede or prevent any insured depository institution      affiliated with a FSHC or any FSHC or affiliate thereof from      marketing products and services in that state by utilizing      and compensating its agents, solicitors, brokers, employees      and other persons located in that state and representing such      a insured depository institution, company, or affiliate.      However, to the extent such persons are performing loan      origination, deposit solicitation or other activities in      which an insured depository institution may engage, those      activities cannot constitute the establishment or operation      of a ``domestic branch'' at any location other than the main      or branch offices of the depository institution.       Paragraph (f)(5) Definitions--contains a special definition      of ``affiliate'' and ``control'' for purposes of paragraph      (2) through (4) this subsection only. Control is deemed to      occur where a person or entity owns or has the power to vote      10% of the voting securities of another entity or where a      person or entity directly or indirectly determines the      management or policies of another entity or person. Unlike      the definition of affiliate set forth in paragraph (4) of      subsection (a), this definition encompasses not only      corporate affiliations but affiliations between corporations      and individuals.       Subsection (g): Securities, Insurance and Real Estate      Activities of Insured Depository Institutions. In order to      facilitate functional regulation of the activities of FSHCs      this section prohibits insured depository institutions      controlled by FSHCs from conducting certain securities,      insurance and real estate activities currently permissible      for some insured depository institutions.       Subparagraph (g)(1)(A) Securities Activities--provides that      no insured depository institution controlled by a FSHC shall      directly engage in dealing in or underwriting securities, or      purchasing or selling securities as agent, except to the      extent such activities are performed with regard to      obligations of the United States or are the type of      activities that could be performed by a national bank's trust      department.       Subparagraph (g)(1)(B) Insurance Activities--provides that      no insured depository institution controlled by a FSHC shall      directly engage in insurance underwriting.       Subparagraph (g)(1)(C) Real Estate Activities--provides      that no insured depository institution controlled by a FSHC      shall directly engage in real estate investment or      development except insofar as these activities are incidental      to the insured depository institution's investment in or      operation of its own premises, result from foreclosure on      collateral securing a loan, or are the type of activities      that could be performed by a national bank's trust      department.       Paragraph (g)(2) Construction--clarifies that nothing in      this subsection shall be construed to prohibit or impede a      FSHC or any of its affiliates (other than an insured      depository institution) from engaging in any of the      activities set forth in paragraph (1) or to prohibit an      employee of an insured depository institution that is an      affiliate of a FSHC from offering or marketing products or      services of an affiliate of such an insured depository      institution as set forth in paragraph (1).       Paragraph (g)(3) De Novo Securities and Real Estate      Activities--except for activities permitted under Section      4(c)(8) of the Bank Holding Company Act no FSHC can engage in      insurance or real estate activities de novo. Rather, they      would have to purchase either an insurance agency or real      estate brokerage business which had been in business for at      least two years prior to passage of the Act.       Paragraph (g)(4) Existing Contracts--provides that nothing      in this subsection will require the breach of a contract      entered into prior to enactment of this Act.       Subsection (h): Tying and Insider Lender Provisions. This      section subjects FSHCs to the tying provisions of section 106      of the Bank Holding Company Act Amendments of 1970 and to the      insider lending prohibitions of section 22(h) of the Federal      Reserve Act. These sections prohibit tying between products      and services offered by insured depository institutions and      products and services offered by the FSHC itself or by any of      its other affiliates. Note, however, that these tying      provisions do not apply to products and services that do not      involve an insured      depository institution. The insider lending provisions      severely limit loans by an insured depository institution      to officers and directors of the insured depository      institution. For purposes of both provisions, the AFBA      will exercise the rulemaking authority vested in the      Federal Reserve with regard to these limitations.       Subsection (i): Examination and Enforcement. This      subsection provides that the AFBA shall use its examination      and supervision authority to enforce the provisions of this      section, including any rules and regulations promulgated      under subsection (c). In particular, it is intended that each      AFBA should structure its examination process so as to      uncover possible violations of the provisions of this section      and that the agency should not hesitate to make full use of      its cease-and-desist powers or to impose as warranted the      special penalties discussed below, if it believes that an      insured depository institution under its supervision that is      controlled by a FSHC is in violation of any of the provisions      of this section.       This subsection also grants the AFBA authority to examine      any other affiliate of the FSHC as well as the FSHC itself in      order to ensure compliance with the limitations of this      section or other provisions of law made applicable by this      section such as sections 23A and 23B of the Federal Reserve      Act.       In addition, this subsection grants each AFBA the right to      apply to the appropriate district court of the United States      for a temporary or permanent injunction or a restraining      order to enjoin any person or company from violation of the      provisions of this section or any regulation prescribed under      this section. The AFBA may seek such an injunction or      restraining order whenever it considers that an insured      depository institution under its supervision or any FSHC      controlling such an insured depository institution is      violating, has violated or is about to violate any provision      of this section or any regulation prescribed under this      section. In seeking such an injunction or restraining order      the AFBA may also request such equitable relief as may be      necessary to prevent the violation in question. This relief      may include a requirement that the FSHC divest itself of      control of the insured depository institution, if this is the      only way in which the violation can be prevented.       This injunctive power will enable the AFBA to move speedily      to stop practices that it believes endanger the safety and      soundness of an insured depository institution under its      supervision that is controlled by a FSHC. If necessary to      protect the depositors and safeguard the deposit insurance      funds, the AFBA may request that the injunction proceedings      be held in camera, so as not to provoke a run on the insured      depository institution.       Subsection (j): Divestiture. This subsection states that an      AFBA may require a FSHC to      [[Page S2054]] divest itself of an insured depository      institution, if the agency finds that the insured depository      institution is engaging in a continuing course of action      involving the FSHC or any of its affiliates that would      endanger the safety and soundness of that insured depository      institution. Although the FSHC would have the right to a      hearing and to judicial review and have one year in which to      divest the insured depository institution, it should be      emphasized that the insured depository institution would      operate under the close supervision of the AFBA from the date      of the initial order until the date the divestiture is      completed. This is intended to safeguard the insured      depository institution in question, its depositors and the      deposit insurance funds.       Subsection (k): Criminal Penalties. This subsection      provides for criminal penalties for knowing and willful      violations of the provisions of this section, even if these      violations do not result in an initial or final order      requiring divestiture of the insured depository institution.      For companies found to be in violation of the provisions of      this section the maximum penalty shall be the greater of (a)      $250,000 per day for each day that the violation continues or      (b) one percent of the minimum required capital of the      insured depository institution per day for each day that the      violation continues, up to a maximum of 10% of the minimum      capital of the insured depository institution--a fine that      could amount to tens of millions of dollars for a large      insured depository institution. Such a fine is designed to be      large enough to deter even larger insured depository      institutions from violating the provisions of this section.       For individuals found to be in violation of the provisions      of this section the penalty shall be a fine and/or a prison      term. The maximum fine shall be the greater of (a) $250,000      or (b) twice the individual's annual rate of total      compensation at the time the violation occurred. The maximum      prison sentence shall be one year. In addition, individuals      violating the provisions of this section will also be subject      to the penalties provided for in Section 1005 of Title 18 for      false entries in any book, report or statement to the extent      that the violation included such false entries.       A FSHC and its affiliates shall also be subject to the      Criminal penalties provisions of the Financial Institutions      Reform, Recovery and Enforcement Act of 1989 and the      Comprehensive Thrift and Bank Fraud Prosecution and Taxpayer      Recovery Act of 1990 to the same extent as a registered bank      holding company, savings and loan holding company or any      affiliate of such companies.       Subsection (1): Civil Enforcement, Cease-and-Desist Orders,      Civil Money Penalties. This subsection provides for civil      enforcement, cease-and-desist orders and civil money      penalties consistent with subsections (b) and (s) and      subsection (u) of Section 8 of the Federal Deposit Insurance      Act for FSHCs that violates the provisions of this section in      the same manner as they apply to an insured depository      institution.       Subsection (m): Civil money Penalties. This subsection      grants the AFBA the power to impose and collect civil money      penalties after providing the company or person accused of      such violation notice and the opportunity to object in      writing to its finding.       Subsection (n): Judicial Review. This subsection provides      for judicial review of decisions reached by an AFBA under the      provisions of this section. This right to review includes a      right of judicial review of statutes, rules, regulations,      orders and other actions that would discriminate against      FSHCs or affiliates controlled by such companies.       Section 102: Amendment to the Bank Holding Company Act of      1956. This section contains a conforming amendment to the      definition of the term ``bank'' in the Bank Holding Company      Act to ensure that a FSHC owning an insured depository      institution will be regulated under this Act rather than the      Bank Holding Company Act.       Section 103: Amendments to the Federal Reserve Act. This      section clarifies the application of Section 23A of the      Federal Reserve Act to certain loans and extensions of credit      to persons who are not affiliated with a member bank. Section      23A contains a provision that was intended to prevent the use      of ``straw man'' intermediaries to evade section 23A's      limitations on loans and extensions of credit to affiliates.      Contrary to its original purpose, the provision may also be      literally read to restrict a bona fide loan or extension of      credit to a third party who happens to use the proceeds to      purchase goods or services from an affiliate of the insured      depository institution; such a loan could occur, for example,      if a customer happens to use a credit card issued by an      insured depository institution to buy an item sold by the      insured depository institution's affiliates. This section      clarifies that such loans and extensions of credit are not      covered by section 23A as long as (i) the insured depository      institution approves them in accordance with substantially      the same standards and procedures and on substantially the      same terms that it applies to similar loans or extensions of      credit that do not involve the payment of the proceeds to an      affiliate, and (ii) the loans or extensions of credit are not      made for the purpose of evading any requirement of section      23A.       Section 104: Amendments to the Banking Act of 1933.       Subsection (a) Section 20--amends section 20 of the Glass-     Steagall Act so that it does not apply to member banks that      are controlled by FSHCs.       Subsection (b) Section 32--amends section 32 of the Glass-     Steagall Act so that it does not apply to officers, directors      and employees of affiliates of a single financial services      holding company.       Section 105: Amendment to the Federal Deposit Insurance      Act. This section amends the Change in Bank Control Act to      provide that an acquisition of a FSHC controlling an insured      depository institution may only be accomplished after      complying with that Act's procedures. It also modifies the      definition of ``control'' to conform it to the definition in      section 101(a)(9) of this Act.       Section 106: Amendment to the Securities Exchange Act of      1934. This section amends the Securities Exchange Act of 1934      to provide for the registration and regulation of Broker      Dealers affiliated with a FSHC.       Section 107: Amendment to the Home Owners' Loan Act. This      section amends section 11 of the Home Owners' Loan Act in      order to apply Section 101(c)(1)(B) of this section to      savings associations.       Section 108: Amendment to the Community Reinvestment Act.      This section amends the Community Reinvestment Act to make it      applicable to acquisitions of insured depository institutions      by FSHCs.       Section 106: Amendment to the Securities Exchange Act of      1934. This section amends the Securities Exchange Act of 1934      to provide for the registration and regulation of Broker      Dealers.       Section 107: Amendment to the Home Owners' Loan Act. This      section amends section 11 of the Home Owners' Loan Act in      order to apply Section 101(c)(1)(B) of this section to      savings associations.       Section 108: Amendment to the Community Reinvestment Act.      This section amends the Community Reinvestment Act to make it      applicable to acquisitions of insured depository institutions      by FSHCs.                   title ii--supervisory improvements       Section 201: National Financial Services Committee. This      section establishes a standing committee, the National      Financial Services Oversight Committee (Committee), in order      to provide a forum in which federal and state regulators can      reach a consensus regarding how the regulation of insured      depository institutions should evolve in response to changing      market conditions. In addition, the Committee also provides a      mechanism through which various federal regulatory agencies      could coordinate their responses to a financial crisis, if      such a crisis were to occur. The Committee comprises all      federal agencies responsible for regulating financial      institutions or financial activities, and it is structured to      allow state regulators to participate in its deliberations.       The Committee consists of the Chairman of the Secretary of      the Treasury, who is also the Chairman of the Committee, the      Chairman of the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve      System, the Chairman of the FDIC, the Director of the Office      of Thrift Supervision, the Comptroller of the Currency, the      Secretary of Commerce, the Attorney General, the Chairman of      the SEC, and the Chairman of the CFTC.       The Committee is directed to report to Congress within one      year of enactment of this Act on proposed legislative or      regulatory actions that will improve the examination process      to permit better oversight of all insured depository      institutions. It is also directed to establish uniform      principles and standards for examinations.                                                                    ____         U.S. Senate, Committee on Banking, Housing, and Urban            Affairs,                                 Washington, DC, February 2, 1995.     Hon. Robert Rubin,     Secretary, Department of Treasury, Washington, DC.       Dear Mr. Secretary: The Treasury Department in conducting a      study of the financial services system required by the      Interstate Banking and Branching Efficiency Act of 1994 (P.L.      103-328). The Department must submit recommendations to      Congress for ``changes in statutes, regulations, and policies      to improve the operation of the financial service system'' by      the end of 1995.       I introduced today the ``Depository Institution Affiliation      Act of 1995'' (``DIAA'') and urge you to consider it      carefully as the Treasury Department conducts its study. The      bill and a summary of its major provisions are enclosed.       The DIAA would allow any company--financial or commercial--     to become a financial services holding company and be      affiliated with an insured depository institution. A company      that opts into the alternative regulatory format could engage      in an expanded range of activities with and through its      depository institution and other affiliates. Non-depository      financial and/or commercial activities would be conducted      through separately capitalized subsidiaries and regulated      along functional lines. This separation of the non-depository      institution properly insulates the depository institution      from self-dealing and other inappropriate practices and      serves to protect the deposit insurance system.       The legislation is a rational legislative response to the      need for comprehensive financial services reform. Moreover,      the Treasury Department's 1991 study, Modernizing the      Financial System: Recommendations for Safer More Competitive      Banks, essentially endorsed the principles contained in the      DIAA.       [[Page S2055]] In formulating Treasury's proposal for      financial services restructuring, I urge you to consider and      support the DIAA and the creation of financial services      holding companies.           Sincerely,                                               Alfonse M. D'Amato,                                                 Chairman.                                 ______      By
