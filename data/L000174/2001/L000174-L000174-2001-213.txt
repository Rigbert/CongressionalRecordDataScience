In fact, we have a procedure when we pass the bill; a certain amount is provided upfront. That is not going to be there because we can't do it under a continuing resolution. It would be misleading to suggest otherwise. We have billions of dollars for our friends in the Middle East, held up, as the Senator said. We have military assistance for our European allies. We asked them to stand behind us. We have antiterrorism assistance in this bill.  Imagine that. This bill has $38 million in antiterrorism assistance. I wonder how many Senators who would vote against sending this bill forward are willing to go back home and explain, well, even though the Democrats went a lot faster in judicial nominations than we did, we held up antiterrorism assistance. I would hate to have to make that argument back home, but they are going to have to.  We have assistance for refugees in Africa--the poorest of the poor. Are we going to hold up that money? We have victims of drought and earthquakes in Central America. Are we going to hold up that money? We have funding to combat HIV/AIDS, the worst public health crisis in half a millennium. Are we going to hold up that money? How about assistance for combating poverty around the world, which breeds the hopelessness and resentment that provides the fertile breeding grounds for terrorists?  President Bush spoke about that. The Secretary of State has made the same point. Do we want to hold up that money?  It is self-defeating and shortsighted, and it is irresponsible to hold up funding for foreign policy when anyone can see we have shortchanged foreign policy for years.  It is time to recognize that global leadership requires acting like a leader, not like petulant children in a school ground. It is about more than dropping bombs; it is about diplomacy and foreign assistance.  Let's stop holding up this bill and get on with the Senate's business. It is utterly lacking in judgment. It unfairly punishes the entire Nation to hold up this bill.  Think of the things that are being held back. Then look at the reason. They claim it is because judges are being held up.  I have a chart. I mention this because my friend from Nevada mentioned it earlier. He mentioned how Republicans--Republicans didn't hold asingle hearing on a judicial nomination, not one, didn't confirm a single judicial nominee. When I became chairman of the reconstituted committee, 10 minutes after that we started having hearings. In fact, the Presiding Officer knows that a Republican appointee from his State, a nominee to the circuit court of appeals, the Presiding Officer and his colleague came to me and talked to me about it. That judge moved forward. Look at this chart. We have here the green line.  This is what happened in the first term of George Herbert Walker Bush. By October 15, they had four judges. Take a look at President Clinton. He didn't get his first judge until September. By this time, we had four. Look what happened under our chairmanship. Within a couple of weeks of becoming Chair, I was having hearings on nominations. So this baloney about numbers--I thought I would share the facts.  An easy fact to remember is that during this part of the year the Republicans didn't hold a single confirmation hearing or confirm a single judge. I have gone now faster than the first year of the last two Presidents--both President Bush and President Clinton--twice as fast, actually, moving judges through than it was done in their terms. That is only since becoming chairman of the committee in July. I held hearings two different days during the August recess. I was roundly criticized by two Republican members on the Judiciary Committee for even holding the hearings. You are almost damned if you do, damned if you don't.  That is fine. They have an absolute right. I believe in the first amendment.  The more important question here is not the judges.                          ____________________
