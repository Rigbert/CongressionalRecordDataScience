Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.  Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of H.R. 3245, introduced by the gentleman from Indiana (Mr. Bucshon).  The legislation is very similar to a bill, H.R. 6793, which passed the House by unanimous consent during the 115th Congress but failed to achieve the consideration of the United States Senate.  H.R. 3245 conveys the Harmony Way Bridge to the New Harmony River Bridge Authority in Illinois and the New Harmony and Wabash River Bridge Authority in Indiana.  The bridge currently remains owned by the Federal Government under the White County Bridge Commission, but the commission is no longer active.  The bridge, which was constructed in 1930, connects White County, Illinois, with Posey County, Indiana, across the Wabash River. It was placed on the National Register of Historic Places in 2007 but has been closed since 2012 when an engineer's inspection discovered structural integrity issues, which made the bridge unsafe for vehicular traffic.  This legislation allows the States of Indiana and Illinois to jointly work together to restore the Harmony Way Bridge and determine the future of this historic landmark.  Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to join me in passing this legislation, and I reserve the balance of my time.
