Speaker, I wish to engage in a brief colloquy with the fine chairman of the subcommittee, the gentleman from New York (Mr. Walsh).  I note in the conference report there are two line items through EPA which will help improve the environmental quality of the Kalamazoo River Watershed in southwestern Michigan. One such provision is directed to Western Michigan University's Environmental Research Institute; the other is directed to Calhoun County, Michigan.  I would like to clarify that the line item with respect to Calhoun County would be solely administered through Western Michigan University's Environmental Research Institute, provided that such funds are used to provide environmental quality for that portion of the Kalamazoo Watershed which is in Calhoun County, Michigan. By doing this, we will help ensure that there is no unnecessary duplication of effort in this regard.
