 President, last week, President Obama delivered a speech at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology on the environment and on clean energy. He made an appeal for congressional support for biofuels, wind, and solar energy, clean coal technology. Naturally, as father of the wind energy tax credit of about 18 years ago, I share President Obama's support for homegrown renewable energy. When the President was in theSenate, he and I worked together to promote the production and distribution of biodiesel and ethanol. It is because of our common interest and shared support that I make an appeal today to President Obama.  The Environmental Protection Agency is currently reviewing a number of proposals that are incredibly important to our Nation's ability to reach its potential in terms of renewable fuel production. On September 3, I was fortunate to host EPA Assistant Administrator Gina McCarthy and Margo Oge, Director of the EPA's Office of Transportation and Air Quality, on a family farm in my State of Iowa. I was happy they accepted my invitation. It was a very good visit.  With the tremendous impact EPA decisions have on the family farmer, it seemed worthwhile for Administrator McCarthy and Director Oge to see American agriculture directly through the eyes of a family farmer. I also had the opportunity to share my concerns on many pending issues, and I believe these EPA officials were a welcome audience.  The first issue I am speaking about relates to the EPA's proposal to penalize biofuels for greenhouse gas emissions from supposed changes in international--I emphasize international--land use. I know President Obama is aware of my concerns because I relayed them to him personally over lunch at the White House on May 6 of this year. Their new renewable fuels standard, enacted in the year 2007, requires various biofuels to meet specified life cycle greenhouse gas emission reduction targets.  The law specified that the life cycle greenhouse gas emissions are to include direct emissions and significant indirect emissions from indirect land-use changes. However, the proposed rule relies on incomplete science and inaccurate assumptions to penalize U.S. biofuels for so-called indirect land-use changes. Under the EPA's analysis, ethanol produced from corn reduces greenhouse gas emissions by 16 percent compared to gasoline. However, if you remove the murky science of emissions from indirect land-use changes, corn ethanol reduces greenhouse gas emissions by 61 percent compared to gasoline--remembering that the other figure was just 16 percent compared to gasoline. So you can see what we know from science--sound science--is ethanol is very environmentally positive.  The EPA's models conclude that changes in international land use--again, emphasis upon international land use--contribute more in greenhouse gas emissions than the entire direct emissions of ethanol production and use. The fact is, measuring indirect emissions of greenhouse gases is far from a perfect science. There is a great deal of complexity and uncertainty surrounding this issue. That is why Senator Harkin and I, along with 10 other Senators, asked EPA earlier this year not to include calculations of indirect land-use changes. But the EPA ignored the request of Senator Harkin and myself.  In its proposed rule, the EPA grossly underestimates future crop yields that will help meet the demand without requiring new crop acres. In addition, the EPA fails to adequately measure the land-use credits for the feed value of corn ethanol coproducts. Similar miscalculations exist for biodiesel as I have explained for ethanol. The EPA miscalculated the value of coproducts associated with biodiesel production and even included a nitrogen penalty.  I wish to speak to the nitrogen penalty because it is a case of total ignorance on the part of the EPA. Farmers know that growing soybeans does not require nitrogen use. Soybeans, in fact, capture nitrogen and return that very valuable product to the soil naturally.  During consideration of the Interior appropriations bill last month, Senator Harkin filed an amendment to block EPA from including the international component of the land-use change calculation. In response, EPA Administrator Jackson sent a letter to Congress claiming the amendment would prevent them from carrying out their statutory obligations.  There are two points that need to be made with regard to Administrator Jackson's letter to us in the Congress. First, the statute does not require the inclusion of international land-use changes. Nowhere does the word ``international'' appear in the statute. Second, in measuring greenhouse gas emissions, the statute states clearly:       Direct emissions and significant indirect emissions such as      significant emissions from land use changes.  If the EPA can't determine the impact of land-use changes with any degree of certainty, how can it be sure the impact is significant? Isn't there the same probability it is entirely insignificant?  Importantly, the House of Representatives demonstrated its lack of confidence in the EPA's handling of this issue during consideration of the climate bill in June. In that bill, Agriculture Chairman Peterson, Speaker Pelosi, and Energy and Commerce Chairman Waxman agreed to an amendment that recognized there is no scientific agreement or no consensus that links U.S. biofuels production to international land-use changes. The amendment blocked EPA's consideration of international land-use changes for 5 years, until it can be measured using what we ought to expect them to use--sound science. There is strong bipartisanship on the record in opposition to EPA's finding in this area. So I hope EPA gets the message.  The second issue pertains to the volume mandates required for biodiesel under the expanded Renewable Fuels Standard. The RFS-2 requires the use of 500 million gallons of biodiesel in 2009 and 650 million gallons in 2010. However, EPA's rulemaking to implement these volume requirements has not yet been finalized and may not be until well into next year.  The U.S. biodiesel producers are in a tough financial situation. They need this mandate--which Congress did enact--to ensure a domestic marketplace for their renewable fuels. While the EPA took action to increase the overall volume mandate to comply with the law, it has failed to implement the specific biodiesel mandate.  In early August, Senator Conrad and I were joined by 22 other Senators in writing President Obama to ask for his help.  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to have printed in the Record a copy of the letter to President Obama.  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in the Record, as follows:                                                  U.S. Senate,                                   Washington, DC, August 6, 2009.     Hon. Barack Obama,     President of the United States, The White House, Pennsylvania          Avenue, NW., Washington, DC.       Dear Mr. President: We are writing to ask your assistance      to ensure that America maintains a viable domestic biodiesel      industry that is capable of producing renewable diesel      replacement fuel.       The Energy Independence and Security Act (EISA) of 2007      provides for renewable content in U.S. diesel fuel as part of      the program's Advanced Biofuels schedule. Specifically, the      Renewable Fuel Standard (RFS-2) requires the use of 500      million gallons of biomass-based diesel in 2009; 650 million      gallons in 2010; 800 million gallons in 2011; and 1 billion      gallons in 2012 and thereafter. This policy, if implemented      in a timely and workable fashion, will promote the      significant economic, environmental and energy security      benefits associated with the domestic production and use of      biodiesel.       The RFS-2 program was to begin on January 1, 2009, and the      Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) was required to revise      the current regulations to ensure the mandated volumes are      met, including the volumes for biomass-based diesel.      Recently, the EPA announced a two-month extension to the      comment period for the new regulations. This extension will      likely delay the implementation of RFS-2 well into 2010,      causing further uncertainty and creating additional harm to      biodiesel plants that have, as Congress intended, made      substantial investments based on the volume goals provided      for in the statute. The U.S. biodiesel industry desperately      needs the market provided by the RFS-2 and cannot afford a      significant delay in the implementation of the volume      requirements mandated by EISA.       Domestic biodiesel producers face a practically non-     existent domestic marketplace. Currently, 70% of U.S.      biodiesel production capacity is idle. Domestic production is      expected to be less than 50% of last year's levels and      numerous bankruptcies loom for the industry. If this      situation is not addressed immediately, the domestic      biodiesel industry expects to lose 29,000 jobs in 2009 alone,      and the nation's ability to meet the common-sense volume      targets for biomass-based diesel provided for in RFS-2 will      be compromised. A viable biodiesel industry is key to      reducing U.S. dependence on foreign oil and meeting our      nation's renewable energy goals.       Given the significant delays associated with RFS-2      implementation, the precarious state of the U.S. biodiesel      industry, and the     volume goals established by statute for biomass-based diesel,      we believe this matter must be addressed immediately. While      EPA appropriately increased the overall volume mandate to      comply with EISA, it has, to date, failed to implement the      specific biomass-based diesel mandate. Therefore, we request      that the Administration exercise its authority immediately,      either by Executive Order or through Agency action or      guidance, to provide greater certainty for the 2009 and 2010      RFS-2 volume mandates for biomass-based diesel. Prompt      attention is critical to the survival of the biodiesel      industry, will provide greater certainty in the marketplace,      and is needed to further the energy security, environmental      and economic interests of the country.       Thank you in advance for your consideration on this      important matter.           Sincerely,         Kent Conrad; Chuck Grassley; Tom Harkin; Byron L. Dorgan;            Jon Tester; Amy Klobuchar; Sam Brownback; Max Baucus;            Pat Roberts; Christopher S. Bond; Roland W. Burris;            Blanche L.
