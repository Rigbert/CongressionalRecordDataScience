The intention, as I have articulated all along, and the chairman's intention, was to have a target of marking up the bill in committee prior to the Memorial Day break. So there was never any intention that a bill would be on the floor prior to the Memorial Day break.  Secondly, I would tell the gentleman, I don't know that the chairman has made a decision on whether to mark it up in subcommittee or mark it up in full committee.  I do know that it's going to be marked up in committee and open to an amendment in committee, open to debate and open to a vote. Now, whether it's in subcommittee or full committee, that determination, as I understand it, has not been made. But it will be, certainly, marked up in committee and subject to full debate.
