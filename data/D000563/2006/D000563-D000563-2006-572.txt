This one is from Wednesday, July 12. Turn to page 22, H.R. 810, an act to amend the Public Health Service Act to provide for human embryonic stem cell research. If I am not mistaken, I would like to ask the minority leader--the stem cell research bill has been sitting on the Senate calendar, as passed by the House in a bipartisan way, for more than 1 year, as we meet today.
