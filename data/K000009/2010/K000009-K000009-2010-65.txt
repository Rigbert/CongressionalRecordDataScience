They created rules by which only they could win, and that doesn't seem to me to be the spirit of free enterprise. They created so much collateral damage it brought down the economy of the whole country. They keep using the argument if we didn't have the TARP, then things would have really gone wrong. I thought, How could it be worse? How could it be worse than this? Is what they did with the TARP just bailing themselves out, because they certainly have not done anything for the American people. They have thrown all of the bills of all of their mistakes on Fannie Mae, Freddie Mac, FHA, all of the instrumentalities of the United States for decades to come. They didn't take any losses on those themselves. They were enriched by the taxpayers of the United States who lifted them right up. And they are not dealing with the damage across this country where foreclosures continue to go up.  I place on the Record the names of the six companies that now hold two-thirds of the wealth of this Nation, and they are Goldman Sachs, Morgan Stanley, JPMorgan Chase, Citigroup, Bank of America, and Wells Fargo. They have enriched themselves handsomely. They doubled their importance since the beginning of this crisis while quashing community banks across this country, seeing forced mergers as institutions like PNC bought up National Citibank in Ohio, as local community banks that didn't do anything wrong and were not permitted to do this kind of wild-eyed business deal, found themselves having to pay huge FDIC fees. And the net yield of all of this is the big ones got bigger and the American people are continuing to be kicked out of their homes and these institutions won't return phone calls and they have hold of the auction process and their investment intermediaries are holding the equity and the ownership in these properties. How is that good for this country?
