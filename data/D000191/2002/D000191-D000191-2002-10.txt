Speaker, we usually do not think about The New York Times like we would The Onion, providing humor for America, but today there is an extraordinarily humorous story on the front page. It says, ``Chief of S.E.C.,'' the Securities and Exchange Commission, ``Is Set to Pursue Former Clients.''  Now, let us think about that for a minute. This gentleman, who made a career out of lobbying for the securities industry and the accounting industry, opposing reforms, representing them in their misdeeds, is now going to pursue them. He is the best we can do in a country of 270 million people. The President cannot find anybody who knows about securities, who is not totally ethically and morally compromised from being the chief watchdog.  Here is the vision of Mr. Pitt as the pit bull. Of course, that is a toy poodle, but it says he is going to get tough. Well, if anyone believes that, I have several bridges I would like to talk to you about afterwards.  Now, here are some quotes from the story. This is Mr. Pitt talking to The New York Times. ``This will inevitably sound self-serving, but the fact is it is an enormous advantage to the public to have somebody who knows about the securities business and the securities law as I do, and it would be unthinkable to deprive people of my expertise.'' That was Mr. Pitt.  So the man who represented these miscreants, the man who lobbied against the tougher rules for accounting firms, the man who has had to recuse himself as the chief law enforcement officer of the Securities and Exchange Commission appointed by George Bush, and basically George Bush has continually expressed his utmost faith in Mr. Pitt, he has had to, 29 times in 10 months, in enforcement actions, recuse himself.  That means that people did not pay fines or get prosecuted by the SEC. In one case, unfortunately, both Mr. Pitt and one other Bush appointee both had to recuse themselves. So only one commissioner, who is a Clinton holdover, was left. He voted to fine the company, Ernst & Young, but an administrative law judge threw it out because they had to have two votes. Well, they could not have two votes. Is this not a wonderful Catch 22? The agency that is supposed to get tough and clean this up cannot even vote to prosecute or fine people because they are so compromised, the appointees of President Bush are so compromised because these are their friends, they are their clients, they are their benefactors, and they have worked for them and represented them for years. It borders on being humorous.  But, actually, it is quite sad. It is quite sad for the millions of Americans who have lost money in their stock funds, their 401(k)s, their retirements; the thousands who have lost their jobs when these firms were bankrupted. It is an incredible tragedy. This is the best that President Bush can do. Tell me that out of a country of 270 million people the best he can find is someone who lobbied for and put in place the policies that brought about these scandals and this fraud on the American people. Since he knows how to trick people, how to defraud people, and how to, in fact, make sure there is no real regulation, he is the best man for the job.  He also said in one of his earliest speeches, he fully intended, as head of the SEC, to make it a place that was kinder and gentler for accountants. Does that sound like a pit bull? He went on to say that he thought a regulatory agency was best that regulated least. Does that sound like a pit bull? And he had to recuse himself 29 times from voting because these were his former clients. They are the people he goes to lunch with. They are the people he goes down to visit their $10 million, $20 million homes in Florida, that are exempt under the bankruptcy laws, even if they got the money by fraud, taking money from the stockholders, the pensioners and the employees who were defrauded.  We know in America we can do better than this, and President Bush shoulddo better than this. Mr. Pitt should be removed and we should put in place at the Securities and Exchange Commission someone who will provide justice to American pensioners, stockholders, and employees.                          ____________________
