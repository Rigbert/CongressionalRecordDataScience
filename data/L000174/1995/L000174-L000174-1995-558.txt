President, students on college campuses throughout Vermont have mobilized against cuts in student aid. The strong opposition around the country to these cuts has prevented most student aid programs from being included in the rescission bill we are debating today. The next step will be to make sure that students do not get short-changed in next year's budget.  On Monday, I had the pleasure of meeting with 19 exceptional college students in my office in Burlington, Vermont. These students: John Boyle of Landmark College; Stephen O'Keefe and Sean Brown of Southern Vermont College; Terri Taylor of Lyndon State College; Eric Sorenberger and Marlene Rye of Sterling College; Cecily Muller of Woodbury College; Beth McDermott of the University of Vermont; Alison Maling of Trinity College; Courtney Ryan of St. Michael's College; Kevin Canney of Burlington College; Sue Jean Murray of Champlain College; Theresa Morris of Vermont Technical College; John Wyrocki and Laura Whitney of Green Mountain College; Jeff Albertson of Middlebury College; and Darryl Danaher, Ryan Carter and Matthew Thornton of Norwich University shared with me how cuts in student aid would affect them and other Vermont students.  One student is the youngest of nine children and is holding two work study jobs. Another is a mother of two and on welfare. Her daughter also is in college. Another is the third child in her family to go to school. Her mother went back to school to get a better job to help pay her children's student loans. Another is the mother of four who had to leave an abusive marriage. She relies on work study to help her stay in school. She also will have loans to pay for her daughter's education. Another is returning to school after having to change her occupation due to major back surgery.  I could go on and on about what these students are going through to earn their college degree.  These students are working hard to learn. Now, some Members of Congress would like to pull the rug out from under them by cutting student aid.  Earlier this week, the House Economic and Educational Opportunities Chairman confirmed that Republicans are considering eliminating the in-school interest subsidy on Stafford college loans.  If House Republicans are successful, 20,000 Vermont students will be paying more for college. Individual student debt will increase by 15 to 50 percent, depending on the length of time spent in school. An undergraduate student who borrows the maximum amount for a four year college could owe an additional $3,407 in interest. This is an increase of about 20 percent, on top of debt that already is tough to manage.  There also has been talk about eliminating campus-based aid including Supplemental Educational Opportunity Grants, Perkins loans, and the work-study programs. Eliminating these need-based programs would cause hardship for students at 2-year and 4-year colleges throughout the country. A student who receives an aid package that includes average awards from all three programs would stand to lose $3,152.  Increasing the financial burden to students and their families will discourage many students from attending college or enrolling in vocational or graduate programs.  As we encourage people, both young and old, to pursue higher education, we need to help them achieve this by providing realistic funding options.  These students are our future. All of us know just how difficult it is to pay for a college education these days. It is important that these students and their families do not see the dream of higher education slip beyond their grasp.  Decisions to cut student aid programs are based solely on short-sighted politics.  I am concerned that the debate over next year's budget is going to occur over the summer when many students are not on campus. I hope they will continue to work together to speak out against cuts in student aid.                  restoration of defense cleanup funds
