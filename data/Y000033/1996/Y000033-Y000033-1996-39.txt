Mr. Speaker, again I want to thank the gentleman from New Jersey [Mr. Saxton].  It is funny how these things happen, if the gentleman will just bear with me. It was never the intent, we never thought it was interpreted that way, that the guy who catches the fish cannot eat them. That would not affect me because I do not catch a whole lot, but I would suggest respectfully that is not the intention.
