 President, I rise this morning as a point of personal privilege to welcome a friend and leader in our community in Wilmington, DE. Father Christo opened the Senate in prayer this morning. It may be the only time the entire Greek community in Wilmington, DE, was tuned in to C-SPAN as we opened up the morning session. I want this Senate to know and I hope my colleagues will get a chance to meet Father Christo.  Many who were raised with a parochial education got an opportunity to meet religious teachers.
