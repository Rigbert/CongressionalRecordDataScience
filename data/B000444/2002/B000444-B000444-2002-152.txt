 President, I rise today to introduce the DNA Sexual Assault Justice Act of 2002, a bill that guarantees prompt justice to victims of sexual assault crimes through DNA technology. 99.9 percent, that is how accurate DNA evidence is. 1 in 30 billion, those are the odds someone else committed a crime if a suspect's DNA matches evidence at the crime scene. 20 or 30 years, that is how long DNA evidence from a crime scene lasts.  Just 10 years ago DNA analysis of evidence could have cost thousands of dollars and taken months, now testing one sample costs $40 and can take days. Ten years ago forensic scientists needed blood the size of a bottle cap, now DNA testing can be done on a sample the size of a pinhead. The changes in DNA technology are remarkable, and mark a sea change in how we can fight crime, particularly sexual assault crimes. The FBI tells us that since 1998 the national DNA database has helped put away violent criminals in 4,179 investigations in 32 states. How? By matching the DNA crime evidence to the DNA profiles of offenders. Individual success stories of DNA ``cold hits'' in sexual assault cases makes these numbers all too real.  For instance, in Florida, Kellie Green was brutally attached and raped in the laundry room of her apartment complex. Because of lack of funds, her rape kit sat on the shelf for three years until a persistent detective had it analyzed. The evidence matched the profile of a man already incarcerated for beating and raping a women 6 weeks before Kellie. Or take for example a 1996 case in St. Louis where two young girls were abducted from bus stops and raped at opposite ends of the city. The police were unable to identify a suspect. In 1999, the police decided to re-run the DNA testing to develop new leads. In January 2000, the DNA database matched the 1996 case to a 1999 rape case, and police where able to identify the perpetrator.  Just days ago, the New York Police Department arrested a man linked to the rape of a woman four years ago. In 1997, a woman was horribly beaten, robbed and raped, there were no suspects. Several months ago,the perpetrator submitted a DNA sample as a condition of probation after serving time for burglary. That DNA sample matched the DNA from the 1997 rape. Crime solved, streets safer.  Undoubtedly, DNA matching by comparing evidence gathered at the crime scene with offender samples entered on the national DNA database has proven to be the deciding factor in solving stranger sexual assault cases, it has revolutionized the criminal justice system, and brought closure and justice for victims.  In light of the past successes and the future potential of DNA evidence, the reports about the backlog of untested rape kits and other crime scene waiting in police warehouses are simply shocking.  Today I am introducing legislation, ``The DNA Sexual Assault Justice Act of 2002'', to strengthen the existing Federal DNA regime as an effective crime fighting tool. My bill addresses five, pressing issues.  First, exactly how bad is the backlog of untested rape kits nationwide? A 1999 government report found over 180,000 rape kits were sitting, untested, on the storage shelves of police department and laboratories all across the country. While recent press reports estimate that the number today is approaching 500,000 untested rape kits, I am told that there is no current, accurate numbers of the backlog. Behind every single one of those rape kits is a victim who deserves recognition and justice. Accordingly, my legislation would require the Attorney General to survey every single law enforcement agency in the country to assess the extent of the backlog of rape kits waiting to undergo DNA testing. To combat the problem of rape kit backlogs, it is imperative to know the real numbers, and how best to utilize federal resources.  Second, how can existing Federal law be strengthened to make sure that State crime labs have the funds for the critical DNA analysis needed to solve sex assault cases? To fight crime most effectively, we must both test rape kits and enter convicted offender DNA samples into the DNA database. There has been explosive growth in the use of forensic sciences by law enforcement. A government survey found that in 2000 alone, crime labs received 31,000 cases, a 47 percent increase from almost 21,000 cases in 1999. In addition, the labs received 177,000 convicted offender DNA samples, an almost 77 percent increase from 100,242 samples in 1999.  All across the country, laboratories report personnel shortages in the face of this overwhelming work. According to this same government survey, on average,there are 6 employees in a state crime lab--a lab that must not only do test DNA for hundreds of cases, but also run forensic tests on blood, footprints or ballistic evidence. The bill I'm introducing would: 1. increase current funding levels to both test rape kits and to process and upload offender samples; and 2. allow local governments to apply directly to the Justice Department for these grants. I thank my colleagues, Senators Kohl and DeWine, who began this effort with the DNA Backlog Elimination At of 2000.  Third, what assistance does the FBI need to keep up with the crushing number of DNA samples which need to be tested or stored in the national database? I am told that the current national DNA database, known as the Combined DNA Index, or ``CODIS'', is nearing capacity of convicted offender DNA samples. My bill would provide funds to the FBI to 1. Upgrade the national DNA computer database to handle the huge projections of samples; and 2. process and upload Federal convicted offender DNA samples into the database. Efforts to include more Federal and State convicted offenders in our database just makes plain sense to fight crime. We know that sexual assault is a crime with one of the highest rates of recidivism, and that many sexual assault crimes are committed by those with past convictions for other kinds of crime. Their DNA samples from prior convictions help law enforcement efforts enormously.  Fourth, what additional tools are needed to help treat victims of sexual assault? One group that understands the importance of gathering credible DNA evidence are forensic sexual assault nurse examiners, who are sensitive to the trauma of this horrible crime and make sure that patients are not revictimized in the aftermath. These programs should be in each and every emergency room and play an integral role in police departments, bridging the gap between the law and the medicine.  Likewise, tapping the power of DNA requires well-trained law enforcement who know how to collect and preserve DNA evidence from the crime scene. Training should be a matter of course for all law enforcement. No rape kit evidence will lead to the perpetrator if the DNA evidence is collected improperly. The DNA Sexual Assault Justice Act would create a new grant program to carry out sexual assault examiner programs and training. And it would train law enforcement personnel in the handling of sexual assault cases, including drug-facilitated assaults, and the collection and use of DNA samples for use as forensic evidence.  Fifth, what can be done to ensure that sexual assault offenders who cannot be identified by their victim are nevertheless brought to justice? Profound injustice is done to rape victims when delayed DNA testing leads to a ``cold hit'' after the statute of limitations has expired. For example, Jeri Elster was brutally raped in her California home, and for years the police were unable to solve the crime. Seven years later, DNA from the rape matched a man in jail for an unrelated crime. Yet the rapist was never charged, convicted, or sentenced because California's statute of limitations had expired the previous year.  The DNA Sexual Assault Justice Act of 2000 would change current law to authorize Federal ``John Doe/DNA indictments'' that will permit Federal prosecutors to issue an indictment identifying an unknown defendant by his DNA profile within the 5-year statute of limitations. Once outstanding, the DNA indictment would permit prosecution at anytime once there was a DNA ``cold hit'' through the national DNA database system.  John De/DNA indictments strike the right balance between encouraging swift and efficient investigations, recognizing the durability and credibility of DNA evidence and preventing an injustice if a cold hit happens years after the crime. The law must catch up with the technology. I started looking at this issue almost two decades ago when I began drafting the Violence Against Women Act. In fact, it is the Violence Against Women Act that provided the first funding to sexual assault nurse examiner programs. The DNA SexualJustice Act of 2000 is the next step, a way to connect the dots between the extraordinary strides in DNA technology and my commitment to ending violence against women. We must ensure that justice delayed is not justice denied.                                 ______                                       By
