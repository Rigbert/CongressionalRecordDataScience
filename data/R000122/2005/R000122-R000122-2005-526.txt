President, I rise to recognize my friend John Holt, who is one of the great leaders of our faith community in Rhode Island. In many dimensions, his efforts have made our State a much better place, more decent, more noble, and more caring. He is somebody who recognizes that faith is not just words but it is actions, and each day he tries to put those faithful actions into the lives of the people of Rhode Island. With great pride, it is a pleasure and a real privilege to recognize today his serving as the Chaplain of the Senate.
