 President, I rise today to express my extreme disappointment at the acceptance of amendment 2315 to the Labor and HHS Appropriation yesterday. My disappointment stems from the fact that I objected to considering amendment 2315 both verbally and by letter. And my objection was ignored.  Senator Specter, the manager of the bill, acknowledged the mistake and promised to respect the Finance Committee's jurisdiction. However, a Member on the other side refused to allow the mistake to be rectified, an unfortunate and unfair action.  For the past several Congresses, I attempted to work with the appropriators and other Senators to ensure that they do not encroach upon the jurisdiction of the Finance committee.  Unfortunately, the practice continues as it did yesterday.  These provisions are not without consequence. They are often written without clear knowledge of all the relevant facts. As a result, problems often occur as they are implemented.  I really appreciate the fact that Senator Specter is willing to work with me on this issue and I fully expect that the provision will be taken out during conference.
