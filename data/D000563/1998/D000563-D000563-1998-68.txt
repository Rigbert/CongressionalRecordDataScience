We are trying to stop the abuses in bankruptcy. We say if you want to file for bankruptcy and you do not have good cause, we are going to throw you out of court. We might penalize you, and we are going to do the same thing to your attorney. So from the debtor side--the person who owes the money--it is a pretty tough standard.  What the Senator from Rhode Island says is, let's have a standard as well for the collection agencies and the creditors who are not treating people fairly. I think we want to eliminate all abuses in the bankruptcy court, not just by the debtors and their attorneys, but by the creditors, too. What the Senator from Rhode Island suggests is fairness and balance. It gives the court the ability to look at strong-arm tactics used by collection agencies and creditors to the detriment of debtors who are trying to get out of debt.                          ____________________
