 I wish to be able to reiterate that I, for one, remain as committed as ever to passing these job-creating agreements into law as quickly as possible, given the condition of our economy.  As I see it, every sticking point seems to have been resolved. The White House initially said it needed a deal on trade adjustment assistance on the substance. I think they have gotten that. Then they said they needed an agreement on the process. I believe we have achieved that.  I, myself, am personally committed to working with the majority leader to ensure a fair floor process for my Members so they have an opportunity to try to amend a stand-alone trade adjustment assistance bill separate from the three free-trade agreements. That way, if the administration can generate the votes it needs, TAA will pass on its merits.  I think we have a pretty clear path in front of us at this point. I recognize that the calendar is tight, that we have got a lot of other urgent business to take care of around here, so I don't expect to finish any of this before August. Still, I think the administration should submit the agreements anyway as a show of good faith with our trading allies in Korea, Colombia, and Panama. Then we can work to pass them when we return. The administration has received everything it has publicly asked for on TAA. It is time to show they are serious about creating jobs and getting those deals done.  This is an opportunity to create jobs in America for Americans. It was snarled needlessly by the suggestion that TAA be dropped inside these agreements. That now has been cleared up. We are going to have an opportunity to ratify all three of these trade agreements, which will be good for the country, and the TAA issue will be dealt with separately, and all indications are that the votes are there to pass the TAA bill.  With that, Madam President, I yield the floor.
