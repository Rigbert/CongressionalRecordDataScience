Speaker, I rise today to recognize the outstanding service the U.S. Government Printing Office provides for this body, the other body, the Federal Government, and the citizens of the United States.  The service GPO provides in making the Congressional Record available in a quick and efficient manner would be difficult to beat. The employees of the GPO are dedicated and hard working and I applaud their efforts.  The U.S. Government Printing Office provided key printing and information database support to the 104th Congress on its historic opening day session, January 4, 1995.  For January 4, the Congressional Record, containing the public proceedings of each House of Congress, totaled 603 pages. Manuscript copy for the Record began arriving in the early evening, with the final receipt of copy by 4:30 a.m. on January 5. Because of its size, the Record was printed in three parts to ensure at least partial delivery by the opening of Congress the next day. Part I, 128 pages, was delivered before the House and Senate came in at 10 a.m. Part II, 126 pages, was delivered at approximately 1 p.m. The rest of the proceedings, 349 pages, were combined, printed, and distributed with the January 5 issue.  By comparison, the Congressional Record for the opening day of the 103d Congress, January 5, 1993, contained 338 pages. In all the 103d Congress generated over 63,500 printed pages of the Congressional Record. The largest issue of the Congressional Record last year was over 700 pages.  The Congressional Record is the most important congressional publication produced at GPO's central office plant in Washington, DC. The Record is printed and bound overnight and delivered the next day before Congress convenes.  Approximately 18,300 copies of the Record are printed daily. Of these 5,800 copies are printed for congressional use and 6,800 copies are printed for the recipients designated by law. The remaining 5,700 copies are printed for agencies which requisition them and for GPO's Superintendent of Documents distribution programs.  The average Congressional Record contains slightly more than 200 pages, about as much type as four to six metropolitan daily newspapers. The actual size of each Record can vary significantly, however, depending on how much business Congress transacts.  The Congressional Record is available from GPO's bookstores and by mail order in paper microfiche. In addition, the GPO access service provides online access to the Record, along with the Federal Register, congressional bills, and the U.S. Code, via the Internet.  In addition to providing printing support, GPO worked with the Library of Congress to provide Congressional Record and congressional bills database files for the Library's new THOMAS information service, which provides public access to congressional information.  Mr. Speaker, as you can see the U.S. Government Printing Office is crucial because it preserves the history made on the floor of the House and the Senate. It is crucial because it is efficient and provides a vital information service to the American public.                          ____________________              E X T E N S I O N   O F   R E M A R K S
