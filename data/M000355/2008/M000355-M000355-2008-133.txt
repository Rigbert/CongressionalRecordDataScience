 President, I am heartened by the consent agreement the majority leader was about to offer a while ago, and I think it indicates that we are finally getting serious here about doing something significant about the price of gas at the pump. I appreciate the spirit in which that was offered. As I indicated, I will be getting back to him later this afternoon.  But make no mistake about what has been going on.
