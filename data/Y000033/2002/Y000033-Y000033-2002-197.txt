Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.  Mr. Speaker, the statements of my good friend, the gentleman from Minnesota (Mr. Oberstar), are absolutely true. I am hoping we can convince theleadership on this side of the aisle, and, of course, the leadership on that side of the aisle, that what is sent to us from the other body in the waning hours of any session has been done inappropriately and that we have to have the time to make sure we are actually following the proper procedure and that we do not rush to leave this body and leave, very frankly, some things done inappropriately, as were done last year in October, because we do have to rectify that now.  I have let it be known to Members that went back to their districts and made statements of what they had achieved, and they had not achieved that, that I understand their dilemma. So this is a one-shot deal for them, and I hope everybody watching this in their office who are on that list makes sure they understand this is the only time they are going to get a chance to get projects agreed to, as it goes through our committee, or at least in consultation with the chairman and myself, and of course the ranking member. Because that is the appropriate way to do it.  The other body, the only way we can control that body is to reject what they send to us, and that takes a great deal of courage. I am hoping we have the courage to say no, not until we take the time to do what is right legislatively, with a great deal of deliberation, and the ability to do the job that we have been elected to do. This has been going on now for about 4 or 5 years, and I think it is time the House stands up and says no, this is not going to happen, you are not going to send us a great big bill, bigger than that room itself, and not know what is in it.  My staff and myself have spent time, primarily my staff, and I will admit that, just researching what was done last year to find out what projects were put in that were not authorized and, very frankly, took monies from projects that were authorized; and we do not think that is the correct way to go.  Mr. Speaker, I yield 1 minute to the gentlewoman from Maryland (Mrs. Morella).
