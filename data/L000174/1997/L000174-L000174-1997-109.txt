President, I thank the Chair for his consideration and listening to this long speech. While I have spoken maybe 50 times on this issue on the floor, I thought it was important to put in the Record exactly what has happened and why the United States is not on the treaty, but to also implore the President, who I feel does want to see it ban landmines, to take the steps necessary so the United States can be part of this treaty.  I yield the floor.
