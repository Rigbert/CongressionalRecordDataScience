 President, the situation is that we are now on the Ford amendment, as amended by the McConnell amendment. Then we have, I believe, four other amendments that can be voted on immediately, if the authors of those amendments are done with their discussion, and I hope the authors of those amendments are done with discussion.  I would like to ask the Democratic manager if we can move forward then on the Ford amendment for adoption of the amendment by voice vote. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to set aside the Ford amendment, and I would ask that we go to the Wellstone amendment.
