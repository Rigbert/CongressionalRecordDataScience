President, diabetes is a serious and potentially life-threatening disease affecting more than 16 million Americans at a cost of more than $105 billion annually. Moreover, since 3 million elderly Medicare beneficiaries have been diagnosed with diabetes, and another 3 million are likely to have the disease but not know it, nowhere is the economic impact of diabetes felt more strongly than in the Medicare Program.  Treating these seniors for the often devastating complications associated with diabetes accounts for more than one-quarter of all Medicare expenditures. Therefore, helping diabetic seniors avoid the complications of their disease will not only improve the quality of their lives but also help reduce the economic burden that diabetes places on Medicare. While there is no known cure, diabetes is largely a treatable disease. Many people who have diabetes can often lead relatively normal, active lives as long as they stick to a proper diet, carefully monitor the amount of sugar or glucose in their blood and take their medication, which may or may not include insulin.  However, if these people with diabetes are unable to follow or do not follow this regimen, they put themselves at risk of blindness, loss of limbs and have an increased chance of heart disease, kidney failure and stroke. Therefore, preventive services for people with diabetes has the potential to save a great deal of money that would otherwise go for hospitalizations or acute care costs--not to mention a great deal of unnecessary pain and suffering.  Congress recently took a number of important steps to improve Medicare coverage of preventive care for diabetics. Prior to the enactment of the balanced budget amendment in 1997, Medicare covered diabetics' self-maintenance education services in inpatient or hospital-based settings and in limited outpatient settings, specifically hospital outpatient departments or rural health clinics. Medicare did not, however, cover education services if they were given in any other outpatient setting, such as a doctor's office. Moreover, while Medicare did cover the cost of blood-testing strips used to monitor the sugar in the blood, the program did so for only Type I diabetics who require insulin to control their disease.  The balanced budget amendment of 1997 rightly expanded Medicare to cover all outpatient self-management training services as well as providing uniform coverage of blood-testing strips for all persons with diabetes. With the enactment of the balanced budget amendment, we made significant progress toward improving care for our senior citizens with diabetes. However, there is more that we can do.  External insulin infusion pumps have proven to be much more effective in controlling blood glucose levels than conventional therapy injection therapy for insulin-dependent diabetics whose blood sugar levels are difficult to control. Such pumps help them to avoid the expensive complications and suffering resulting from uncontrolled diabetes. However, Medicare currently does not cover these pumps, even when they have been prescribed as medically necessary by a patient's physician.  I am, therefore, pleased to introduce today legislation, the Medicare Insulin Pump Coverage Act of 1999, that would expand Medicare coverage to include insulin infusion pumps for certain Type I diabetics.  External insulin pumps are neither investigational nor experimental. They are widely accepted by health care professionals involved in treating parties with diabetes. Moreover, studies such as the Diabetes Control and Complications Trial sponsored by the National Institutes of Health have established that maintaining blood glucose levels as close to normal as possible is the key to preventing devastating complications from this disease. For many patients, the use of an infusion pump is the only way that optimal blood glucose control can be safely achieved. That is why virtually all other thirdparty payers--including many State Medicaid Programs and CHAMPUS--cover the device. Moreover, there is precedent in Medicare since it currently does cover infusion pumps for numerous cancer drugs, as well as for pain control medications.  The need for this legislation became apparent to me based on my attempts to help one of my constituents, Nona Frederich of Raymond, ME. She is an example of the Medicare patient who would benefit from the pump but who is currently being denied what is for her the most effective form of glucose control. Nona has been an insulin-dependent diabetic since 1962. Because of her extremely volatile insulin sensitivity, her diabetic specialists placed her on an insulin infusion pump in January 1982. Until she reached the age of 65, the cost of the pump and operating supplies were underwritten in large part by her insurer.  In March of 1995 it became necessary for Nona to purchase a new infusion pump. However, by this time, she was now on Medicare and Medicare refused to cover it, even though her doctor had prescribed it as clearly being medically necessary. With the help of my Portland office, the Frederichs worked their way through the Health Care Financing Administration system of appeals. Unfortunately, in January of last year, they received final notification of a negative decision. Their only remaining option is to file a civil suit which they are simply not in a position to pursue.  The Frederichs literally have notebooks filled with documentation of the procedures they followed and the evidence they submitted. Moreover, they personally paid close to $5,000 in original pump costs and supplies for which they received no reimbursement. For a Medicare beneficiary with a limited income, these kinds of costs would be devastating and would place the pump--the medically necessary pump--completely out of reach. In such a case, they would be forced to return to or to continue with conventional insulin therapy which simply just may not be as effective in controlling blood sugar. As a consequence, these patients are admitted to the hospital over and over again, and Medicare now picks up the bill--a far greater bill than if Medicare had simply paid for the pump in the first place.  While potentially devastating for an individual, the financial costs to Medicare of expanding coverage to include the insulin infusion pump will not be great. Under my bill, the pump would have to be prescribed by a physician and the beneficiary would have to be a Type I diabetic experiencing severe swings of high and low blood glucose levels. Of the estimated 3 million Medicare beneficiaries with diabetes, only about 5 percent are Type I, or insulin dependent; of these, it is estimated that the pump would be appropriate for only about 4 percent. Mr. President, what a difference it would make for those individuals.  The American Diabetes Association, the Juvenile Diabetes Foundation, the American Association of Clinical Endocrinologists and the American Association of Diabetes Educators, as well as officials at the Centers for Disease Control, all have advocated expanding Medicare to cover insulin infusion pumps for Type I diabetics who otherwise would have great difficulty in controlling their blood sugars.  I am pleased to introduce legislation today to do just that. I urge all of my colleagues to join me in support of this important legislation, legislation that would not cost much money but would enrich the lives of those diabetics who need these pumps immeasurably.  I ask unanimous consent that the text of the legislation as well as the letters of support from the American Diabetes Association and the Juvenile Diabetes Foundation be printed in the Record.  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in the Record, as follows:                                 S. 617       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of      the United States of America in Congress assembled,     SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.       This Act may be cited as the ``Medicare Insulin Pump      Coverage Act of 1999''.     SEC. 2. COVERAGE OF INSULIN PUMPS UNDER MEDICARE.       (a) Inclusion as Item of Durable Medical Equipment.--     Section 1861(n) of the Social Security Act (42 U.S.C.      1395x(n)) is amended by inserting before the semicolon the      following: ``, and includes insulin infusion pumps (as      defined in subsection (uu)) prescribed by the physician of an      individual with Type I diabetes who is experiencing severe      swings of high and low blood glucose levels and has      successfully completed a training program that meets      standards established by the Secretary or who has used such a      pump without interruption for at least 18 months immediately      before enrollment under part B''.       (b) Definition of Insulin Infusion Pump.--Section 1861 of      the Social Security Act (42 U.S.C. 1395x) is amended by      adding at the end the following:                        ``Insulin Infusion Pump       ``(uu) The term `insulin infusion pump' means an infusion      pump, approved by the Federal Food and Drug Administration,      that provides for the computerized delivery of insulin for      individuals with diabetes in lieu of multiple daily manual      insulin injections.''.       (c) Payment for Supplies Relating to Infusion Pumps.--     Section 1834(a)(2)(A) of the Social Security Act (42 U.S.C.      1395m(a)(2)(A)) is amended--       (1) in clause (ii), by striking ``or'' at the end;       (2) in clause (iii), by inserting ``or'' at the end; and       (3) by inserting after clause (iii) the following:       ``(iv) which is an accessory used in conjunction with an      insulin infusion pump (as defined in section 1861(uu)),''.       (d) Effective Date.--The amendments made by this section      shall apply with respect to items of durable medical      equipment furnished under title XVIII of the Social Security      Act (42 U.S.C. 1395 et seq.) on or after the date of      enactment of this Act.                                  ____   Statement by the American Diabetes Association in Support of the                    Medicare Insulin Pump Coverage Act       The American Diabetes Association lends its full support to      passage of the Medicare Insulin Pump Coverage Act in      Congress. Effective maintenance of blood glucose levels is      imperative if people with diabetes are to forestall the onset      of the complications of diabetes, such as cardiovascular      disease, end-stage renal disease, blindness or amputations.      External insulin infusion pumps have proven to be more      effective in controlling blood glucose levels than      conventional injection therapy for insulin-dependent people      whose blood sugar levels are difficult to control. Many,      including those who have had access to the insulin pump prior      to becoming a Medicare beneficiary, need access to the pump      for better control. Medicare access to the insulin pump will      help Medicare enhance the quality of life for people with      diabetes and contain the costly complications of diabetes.       Diabetes is a disease that requires a lifetime of medical      care and self-treatment. People with diabetes must have full      access to supplies, equipment and education. The Diabetes      Control and Complications Trial (DCCT), a 10-year clinical      study conducted by the National Institutes of Health, proved      that maintaining blood glucose levels as close to normal as      possible is the key to preventing the devastating      complications associated with diabetes.       ``Unfortunately, many health insurance plans, including      Medicare, do not provide comprehensive coverage for the      supplies and education people with diabetes need to control      their disease,'' said Gerald Bernstein, MD, President of the      American Diabetes Association. ``For example, Medicare does      not provide coverage for the insulin pump,'' Bernstein added.       According to the Health Care Financing Administration      (HCFA), the federal agency responsible for administering the      Medicare program, the insulin pump is not covered because      ``there [is no] medical advantage to using controlled      continuous insulin infusion (via infusion pump) rather than      conventional multiple daily injections to treat diabetes.''       Bernstein added, ``The use of the insulin pump has proven      to be effective for individuals who, despite multiple insulin      injections and frequent monitoring, have unstable diabetes.      For many of these individuals, use of the insulin pump is a      life-enhancing decision.'' The Medicare Insulin Pump Coverage      Act will require Medicare to cover insulin pumps for      beneficiaries with Type 1 diabetes who are experiencing      severe swings of high and low blood glucose levels or who      have used an insulin pump without interruption for at least      18 months immediately before enrollment under Medicare Part      B.       According to Bernstein, ``This legislation is especially      important for those individuals who face the prospect of      losing their coverage of the pump upon entering Medicare. Now      is the right time for HCFA to move forward with coverage of      the insulin pump in these limited circumstances.''       For these reasons the American Diabetes Association      strongly supports The Medicare Insulin Pump Coverage Act and      applauds Senator Susan M. Collins (R-ME) for introducing this      important legislation. Passage of the Collins Bill will      dramatically improve the lives of those striving to maintain      a healthy life, while at the same time, reducing costly      hospital stays.                                       ____         Juvenile Diabetes Foundation International, The Diabetes            Research Foundation,                                    Washington, DC, March 8, 1999.     Hon. Susan M. Collins,     U.S. Senate,     Washington, DC.       Dear Senator Collins: On behalf of the Juvenile Diabetes      Foundation International (JDF), I want to express our strong      support for your insulin pump legislation which would ensure      that pumps are covered by the Medicare program.       Diabetes is a devastating disease that affects 16 million      Americans and 120 million people worldwide. A new case of      diabetes is diagnosed every forty seconds, and diabetes kills      one American every three minutes. Diabetes is the leading      cause of kidney failure, adult blindness, and nontraumatic      amputations, and it substantially increases the risk of      having a heart attack or stroke. In all, the life expectancy      of people with diabetes averages 15 years less than that of      people without diabetes.       As you know, people with diabetes who use insulin take up      to five injections daily to treat their diabetes. However,      injection therapy does not work will for many diabetes      sufferers. In these and other cases, insulin pumps are an      effective and critical tool in assisting persons with      diabetes in more closely controlling blood glucose levels.      Better control of blood glucose levels is likely to lead to      fewer health complications from diabetes, and will result in      enormous cost savings to the Medicare system where one in      four Medicare dollars presently goes to pay for health care      of people with diabetes.       Senator Collins, the JDF applauds you for introducing this      important legislation to help our nation's seniors and other      Medicare-covered Americans have access to cost-effective and      life-improving medical supplies such as the insulin pump.           Sincerely,                                                   Leah J. Mullin,                               Chairman, JDF Government Relations.                                 ______                                       By
