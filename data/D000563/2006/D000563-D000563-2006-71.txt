I hope the people of her home State are watching carefully. Senator Landrieu, even before Hurricanes Katrina and Rita, worked very hard for her State. But since then, it has been nonstop. She is not the only one. There are many elected officials who are doing everything they can to help the families and businesses and others who were devastated. But I commend her to be here so late at night speaking up for her State again. I hope she is successful with her amendment which would bring resources to her State that are badly needed as post-Katrina construction continues.                          ____________________
