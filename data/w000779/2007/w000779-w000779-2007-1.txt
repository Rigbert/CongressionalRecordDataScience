President, I ask unanimous consent that the Committee on Commerce, Science, and Transportation be authorized to meet during the session of the Senate on Wednesday, December 19, 2007, at 10 a.m., in room 253 of the Russell Senate Office Building, for the purpose of conducting a hearing.  The primary focus of the hearing will be on the Federal Motor Carrier Safety Administration's, FMCSA, interim final rule, IFR, governing truck driver HOS. This IFR is in response to a July 2007 U.S. Court of Appeals decision vacating key aspects of the FMCSA's 2005 HOS rule. The Subcommittee will receive testimony on the IFR and related truck driver fatigue and truck safety matters from the FMCSA, truck safety advocates and the motor carrier industry. Subcommittee Chairman Frank R. Lautenberg will preside.
