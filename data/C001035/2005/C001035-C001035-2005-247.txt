President, I rise today to introduce the Port Security Grants Act of 2005. This legislation would establish a dedicated grant program within the Department of Homeland Security to enhance terrorism prevention and response efforts at our ports. It would provide the resources needed to better protect the American people from attack through these vital yet still extremely vulnerable centers of our economy and points of entry.  I am very pleased that my partner in this effort, Representative Jane Harman, today is introducing the same legislation in the House of Representatives. Congresswoman Harman knows well the vulnerability of our Nation's ports. Indeed, earlier this year, I accompanied her to the ports of Long Beach and Los Angeles to witness first hand the incredible volume of activity that occurs at these thriving economic centers--and the incredible security challenges that they pose. Congresswoman Harman's dedication to the security of our ports and our Nation as a whole makes her one of Congress' acknowledged leaders on homeland security matters. I am pleased that we have been able to join forces on this important initiative.  Funding to date to address security needs at our ports has been woefully inadequate. The Coast Guard estimates that implementing the provisions of the Maritime Transportation Security Act and similar requirements for international port security will cost $7.3 billion over the next decade. Yet, since MTSA was enacted, only the fiscal year 2005 budget request contained a line item for this crucial need, and that at a mere $46 million. Although the Administration's fiscal year 2006 budget request includes $600 million for infrastructure protection, it does not contain a dedicated line item for port security grant funding.  As a point of comparison, the Transportation Security Administration's fiscal year 2006 budget dedicates $4.9 billion for aviation security. As Dr. Stephen Flynn of the Council on Foreign Relations testified at a Homeland Security and Governmental Affairs Committee hearing in January, port security has received approximately 5 cents on the dollar--with the remaining 95 cents going to aviation security.  The legislation we propose will break the hand-to-mouth cycle that ports have faced for years. It does the following: First, it creates a competitive grant program administered by the Office of State and Local Government Coordination and Preparedness at the Department of Homeland Security. This is the same office that administers the State Grant and Urban Area Security Initiative programs.  Second, under our bill, grant funds will be used to address port securityvulnerabilities identified through Area Maritime Transportation Security Plans, currently required by Federal statute, or through other DDS-sanctioned vulnerability assessments. In other words, grant dollars must be spent consistent with an established plan, not through a process divorced from efforts already underway.  Authorized uses of these grant funds include: acquiring, operating, and maintaining equipment that contributes to the overall security of the port area; conducting port-wide exercises to strengthen emergency preparedness; developing joint harbor operations centers to focus resources on port area security; implementing Area Maritime Transportation Security Plans; and covering the costs of additional security personnel during times of heightened alert levels.  Third, we require DHS to prioritize efforts to promote coordination among port stakeholders and integration of port-wide security, as well as information and intelligence sharing among first responders and federal, state, and local officials.  Fourth, we authorize funding for port security grants at $400 million per year for fiscal years 2007 through 2012. This steady, dedicated stream of funding would represent a substantial down payment on the billions of dollars of port security needs identified by the Coast Guard. It is also the amount the American Association of Ports Authorities believes needs to be dedicated annually to port security in order to begin addressing serious vulnerabilities.  Under our bill, port security dollars will originate from duties collected by Customs and Border Protection, and--with exceptions made for small or extraordinary projects--recipients will be required to contribute 25 percent of the cost. This cost-sharing requirement has precedents in other transportation funding and will ensure the development of true partnerships between the federal government and grant recipients.  Fifth, our legislation includes strong accountability measures--including audits and reporting requirements--to ensure the grant funds awarded under the bill are properly accounted for and spent as intended.  This legislation does call for a major commitment of resources. I am confident, however, that my colleagues recognize, as I do, that this commitment is fully proportional to what is at stake.  Approximately 95 percent of our Nation's trade, worth nearly $1 trillion, enters through one of our 361 seaports on board some 8,555 foreign vessels, which make more than 55,000 port calls per year. Clearly, an attack on the U.S. maritime transportation system could devastate our economy.  The potential for this devastation was amply demonstrated by the 2002 West Coast dock labor dispute, which cost our economy an estimated $1 billion per day, affected operations in 29 West Coast ports, and harmed businesses throughout the country. An unanticipated and violent act against a cargo port could result in economic costs that are incalculable, not to mention a potential loss of life that would be horrifying.  Much of the discussion regarding port security revolves around the security of inbound containers. At his confirmation hearing, Homeland Security Secretary Chertoff stated that his major concern is the introduction into the United States of chemical, biological, radiological, nuclear, or explosive threats via a shipping container. Secretary Chertoff is absolutely correct in identifying this as a major vulnerability.  But there are many other threats against ports. Just last month, the State Department issued a warning concerning information that terrorists may attempt to mount a maritime attack using speedboats against a Western ship, possibly in East Africa. This isn't the first instance of this type of attack--the USS Cole in 2000 and the French tanker Limberg in 2002 were both attacked by this method. The repeated use of suicide bombers and truck bombs around the world also raises great concern about our ports, and the critical infrastructure and population centers located around them.  Coming from a State with a strong maritime tradition and vital maritime industry, I am keenly aware of what is at stake. Maine has three international cargo ports. Each is a vital and multi-faceted part of our economy: State, regional, and even national.  The Port of Portland, for example, is the largest port by tonnage in New England and the largest oil port on the East Coast. Ninety percent of its foreign cargo was crude oil. In addition, Portland has a booming cruise-ship industry, a vigorous fishing fleet, and an international ferry terminal. This wide range of activity provides economic opportunity and also provides terrorism vulnerability.  It is not my intention to suggest that our security agencies and ports are at a standstill. Indeed, much has been done to improve port security. The Coast Guard's Sea Marshals program places armed units on ships at sea to ensure their safe arrival and departure. The Container Security Initiative Bureau of Customs and Border Protection works with foreign governments to target high-risk cargo and to prevent terrorists from exploiting cargo containers. Detailed information is now required on each ship and its passengers, crew, and cargo. To upgrade security at international ports, the United States worked with the International Maritime Organization for the adoption of the International Ship and Port Security Code, the first multilateral port security standard ever created.  It is, however, my intention to assert that we must do more to improve port security on the front lines--the ports that line the harbor of cities and towns along our vast coastlines, the Great Lakes, our immense inland river network and in Alaska and Hawaii.  We observed this week two anniversaries that bear upon this issue. Monday was Patriot's Day, the 230th anniversary of the ride of Paul Revere. While I am not suggesting ``one if by land, two if by sea'' be adopted as a funding formula for homeland security, that famous phrase does remind us of the bond between security and transportation that has existed since our nation's very first days.  On a far more somber note, Tuesday was the 10th anniversary of Oklahoma City. As we paused to reflect on that horrific attack, we once again were confronted with the harsh reality that terrorists--whether foreign or domestic--will strike wherever they see vulnerability.  Our seaports are vulnerable. I urge my colleagues to join me in cosponsoring this legislation that will help deny terrorists an opportunity to strike at a vulnerable target.                                 ______                                       By
