 President, I rise today to note for my colleagues the passing of a distinguished Kentuckian and my friend, Mr. Thomas ``Brown'' Badgett, Sr., who passed away this June 30 at the age of 88. A leading citizen of Madisonville, KY, Brown was a philanthropist who will be remembered for his many gifts to his community.  From the Brown Badgett Sr. Energy and Advanced Technology Center on the Madisonville Community College campus to the Brown Badgett Loop roadway and Badgett Athletic Complex there that also bear his name, he will have an enduring legacy.  Brown was able to make this mark not only because he was so highly successful in his chosen fields of coal, realestate and highway construction, but also because he was successful at reaching out to other people and sharing his success and his zeal for life. I extend my deepest condolences to his many beloved family members and friends for their loss. He will be missed by many.  The Louisville Courier-Journal recently published an obituary for Mr. Thomas ``Brown'' Badgett, Sr., and I ask unanimous consent that said article be printed in the Record.  There being no objection, the article was ordered to be printed in the Record as follows:          [From the Louisville Courier-Journal, July 1, 2011]                        Thomas Brown Badgett Sr.       Madisonville.--Badgett, Thomas Brown Sr., 88, died      Thursday, June 30, 2011 at 8:10 a.m. at his residence.       He was born January 17, 1923, in Bellefonte, Ark., to the      late Russell and Rheaetta Badgett. In addition to his      parents, he was preceded in death by his wife, Helen      ``Heidi'' Badgett; a daughter, Deidre Badgett Griffin; one      son, Owen Kinsley Badgett; one brother, J. Rogers Badgett;      and one sister, Julia Badgett Badger.       Mr. Badgett loved his community, and he served all walks of      life such as the coal business, highway construction, and      real estate. He received his Eagle Scout in 1991. Mr. Badgett      was a philanthropist who supported education with donations      to college and high schools. His favorite saying was, ``The      youth of today are going to be running this country in the      next 20 to 30 years, and they need to be educated.'' Mr.      Badgett is survived by a daughter, Heidi K. Honchariw, of      Asheville, N.C.; a son and daughter-in-law, Thomas Brown and      Sue Badgett, Jr., of Madisonville; two grandchildren, Corbett      G. and Casey McCormick, of Naperville, Ill., and Kyle Owen      Yates, of Madisonville; and five great-grandchildren, Lily      McCormick, Gavin McCormick and Ryder McCormick of Naperville,      Brice Yates of Madisonville and Kyle Owen Yates II, of      Central City, Ky.
