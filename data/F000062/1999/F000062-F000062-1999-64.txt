 President, I rise to express my strong support for the amendment offered by the minority leader and the Senator from New Jersey. As you know, this amendment is almost identical to the Shays-Meehan bill that passed the House of Representatives by a decisive, bipartisan vote of 252-177. It is time for the Senate to show the same courage and pass this important legislation.  as I enter my eleventh political campaign and my fourth California statewide election, I am one who knows a little about the dynamics of campaigning in expensive races. In the 1990 race for Governor, I had to raise about $23 million. In the first race the Senate, $8 million; in the second race, $14 million. In 1994, my opponent spent nearly $30 million in his attempt to defeat me. My experiences have led me to believe that the current campaign finance system is badly flawed and in need of overhaul.  Since 1976, the first election after the last major revision of campaign finance laws, the average cost of a winning Senate race went from $609,000 to $3.8 million in 1998. The average cost for a winning House candidate rose from $87,000 in 1976 to $679,000 in 1998.  Campaigns in 2000 are very different than they were in 1976. Clearly, our campaign finance system must be reformed to reflect these differences.  I have been a strong supporter of federal campaign finance reform since my first election to the Senate. Campaigns simply cost too much and it is long past time that Congress does something about it.  I believe very strongly that this will be the final real opportunity this millennium to make significant structural reforms to our campaign finance system. Two of the fundamental changes that I believe must be made are a complete ban on soft money contributions to political parties and making independent campaign ads subject to contribution limits and disclosure requirements as are a candidate's campaign ads.  While I have a great deal of respect for the persistence the Senators from Arizona and Wisconsin have demonstrated in pushing the Senate to act on campaign finance reform, I am concerned that the underlying bill, S. 1953, is too narrow to constitute a real reform of the campaign finance system. Banning soft money without addressing issue advocacy will simply redirect the flow of undisclosed money in campaigns. Instead of giving soft money topolitical parties, the same dollars will be turned into ``independent'' ads.  The issues of soft money ban and independent advertisements go hand in hand and one can not be addressed without the other.                             soft money ban  The ability of corporations, unions, and wealthy individuals to give unlimited amounts of soft money to political parties is the largest single loophole in the current campaign finance structure. The lack of restrictions on soft money enables anonymous individuals and anonymous organizations to play a major role in campaigns. They can hit hard and no one knows from where the hit is coming. The form that soft money is increasingly taking is negative, attack ads that distort, mislead, and misrepresent a candidates position on issues. These ads have become the scourge of the electoral process.  This is the third time in as many years that the Senate has had the opportunity to pass meaningful campaign finance legislation. Last year, a minority of Senators blocked its passage and they appear poised to do so again.  The consequence of this action is clear: voters will continue to become disenchanted with the political process and the flow of money into campaigns and the access it buys will continue to grow.  The numbers speak for themselves. According to the Federal Election Commission, the Republican party raised $131 million in soft money during the 1998 election cycle. That is a 149 percent increase over the last mid-term election in 1994. The Democratic party is not much better. We raised $91.5 million, a 89 percent increase.  Soft money contributions are continuing to rise. In the first 6 months of this year, Republicans raised $30.9 million. 42 percent more than in the first six months of the 1997-98 election cycle. Democrats raised $26.4 million, a 93 percent increase.  One organization, Public Citizen, estimates that soft money spending this election cycle will exceed $500 million. That is double the amount spent in the last presidential election cycle and six times as much as in 1992.  At some point this escalation of campaign spending has got to stop. We simply cannot continue down this path. A complete ban on soft money contributions to political parties is the first and most basic way to reduce the amount of money in our campaigns.                             issue advocacy  That brings me to the other disturbing trend in the American political system: the rise of issue advocacy. This campaign loophole allows unions, corporations, and wealthy individuals to influence elections without being subject to disclosure or expenditure restrictions.  During last year's debate, I mentioned a study released by the Annenberg Public Policy Center that estimated that during the 1995-96 election cycle independent groups spent between $135 and $150 million on issue advocacy.  The Center has done a similar study for the 1997-98 cycle and the result is quite disturbing. They estimate that the amount spent on issue advocacy more than doubled to between $275 million and $340 million.  These ads do not use the so-called ``magic words'' that the Supreme Court identified as express advocacy and, therefore, are not subject to FEC regulation. The Annenberg study found, however, that 53.4 percent of the issue ads mentioned a candidate up for election.  The Center found another unfortunate twist to issue advocacy. Prior to September 1, 1998, that is in the first 22 months of the election cycle, only 35.3 percent of issue ads mentioned a candidate and 81.3 percent of the ads referred to a piece of legislation or a regulatory issue.  After September 1, 1998, during the last 2 months of the campaign, a dramatic shift occurred. The proportion of ads naming specific candidates rose to 80.1 percent and those mentioning legislation fell to 21.6 percent.  A similar shift can be seen in terms of attack ads. Prior to September 1, 33.7 percent of all ads were attack oriented. After September 1, over half were.  These findings clearly demonstrate that as election day gets closer, issue ads become more candidate oriented and more negative. This kind of unregulated attack advertisements are poisoning the process and driving voters away from the polls.  The amendment offered by the minority leader defines ``express advocacy'' communications as advocating election or defeat of candidate by: First, using explicit phrases, words, or slogans that have no other reasonable meaning than influence elections; second, referring to a candidate in a paid radio or TV broadcast ad that runs within 60 days of election; or third, expressing unmistakable, unambiguous election advocacy.  This provision draws a clear line between true issue advertising and electioneering activities. It is an important part of any real reform effort and I applaud the minority leader for seeing that we have an opportunity to vote on it.                              other issues  This amendment also contains a number of important issues that are not contained in the underlying bill. I understand the sponsors of the bill removed them in an attempt to force a straight up or down vote on the soft money ban. I do feel, however, that some of these provisions will significantly improve the campaign finance system and are worth mentioning.  The bill mandates electronic filing; allows the FEC to conduct random audits of campaigns within 12 months of an election; makes it easier for the FEC to initiate enforcement action; and increases penalties for knowing and willful violations of election law.  This amendment would lower the threshold for disclosure of contributions from $200 to $50. It would prevent candidates from depositing contributions of $200 if the disclosure requirements are not complete. It would also require the FEC to post contribution information on the Internet within 24 hours of receipt.  These are commonsense steps to making our elections more open to the public. Voters are increasingly feeling cut out of the political process. By allowing an open window into our campaigns, we can begin the process of reconnecting with voters.  In closing, Mr. President, I want to again thank the Senators from Arizona and Wisconsin. Without their leadership on this issue we would not have come as far as we have.  This body is now faced with a choice. We have been at this same point several times in the last couple of years and each time we have failed to act and each time the American public has grown more cynical and lost more confidence in their government.  With the passing of every election, it becomes more and more clear that our campaign system desperately needs reform. I remain hopeful that this is the year that Congress can finally come together in support of legislation that brings about a real improvement in our campaign system. Let's make the first election of the twenty-first century one of which we can be proud. I urge my colleagues to support this amendment.
