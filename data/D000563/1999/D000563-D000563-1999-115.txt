President, I consider my service in the Senate representing the people of Illinois to be the highest honor I have ever been given. I continue to believe it is the very best job in American politics. As I go back to my home State and meet with people who have entrusted me with this responsibility, I literally thank them for giving me this opportunity.  However, this debate may be one of the most painful aspects of serving in the Congress, and specifically in the Senate, because it raises before the Senate an issue which most Senators would rather not look at again. In the course of 17 years, I have voted on this abortion issue countless times. Each time has been a struggle.  I am sure those who are listening to this debate might question what I just said. Don't you get used to it? Isn't it automatic? Don't you just vote the same way you did last time?  That has never been the case for me. I have tried in every instance to be honest about the specific debate that was involved. My views on this issue have changed over the years as I have listened to the debate of those with various positions.  I have come to a position now that I am at peace with personally. Though I know that I am at peace, the people I represent may see differently.  The best I can say in the course of this debate is what I am about to say and what I am about to offer in terms of an amendment which represents my best good-faith effort to deal with a painful issue. This is not like most issues we face in the Senate. I can go home after a week of working most times and people do not have a clue as to what we have even talked about or debated. I can go to family reunions and get-togethers and people do not ask me how did you vote on a certain bill involving grazing rights in the West. It never comes up.  But this issue, the issue of abortion, is one that most Americans have an opinion on because we have been confronted, since the Roe v. Wade decision, with a huge national debate, a very divisive debate as to whether the Supreme Court was correct or incorrect in giving a woman in the United States the right to choose whether to have an abortion procedure.  There are people dug in on both sides of this debate. What I am saying, I am sure, is no surprise to anyone who observes it. There are some who believe that Roe v. Wade was just plain wrong; that the Supreme Court never should have legalized abortion procedures under any circumstances. There are those on the opposite side of the spectrum who believe that Roe v. Wade did not go far enough with respect to a woman's right to choose and her privacy. I think you will find the majority of Americans in between those two groups; struggling, on one hand, I think, to keep abortion safe and legal but, on the other hand, to put restrictions on it which are common sense.  The Senator from Pennsylvania comes before us today with a bill which seeks to address one aspect. He has focused on one particular abortion procedure. It goes by a lot of different names. The common parlance is partial-birth abortion. There are some who say that is just a made-up name for politics; it has nothing to do with medical terminology. But for better or for worse, that is how this debate is characterized, the partial-birth abortion debate, which has been around so many times on this floor and in Congress.  It now has a further shorthand, PBA. I do not think that is fair to the Senator offering the amendment, the Senator from Pennsylvania, nor to the gravity of the issue. This is a serious issue. The Senator from Pennsylvania focuses on this procedure which I will tell you, as I view it, is a gruesome procedure. It is gruesome. I don't know if his description of it is accurate, but if it is close to accurate it is gruesome.  He believes this procedure should be banned at every stage of pregnancy. Let me address that from two perspectives. First, there has been a lot said on the floor already this morning as to whether or not this kind of procedure is ever medically necessary. I am not a doctor. I cannot reach that conclusion on my own. I have to turn to others for advice.  Let me tell you what I did last year, in July. I had just read an article published in the Chicago Tribune in my home State that quoted former Surgeon General Everett Koop. Because of that article and what I read and my respect for him, I sent a letter. My letter was addressed to Dr. Ralph Hale, the executive director of the American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists here in Washington.  I am going to read the letter because I want you to understand I tried my very best to give an open-ended opportunity for this medical doctor in the specialty of obstetrics and gynecology to tell me his professional opinion. Let me read the letter:       Dear Dr. Hale, enclosed is a commentary that appeared in      yesterday's Chicago Tribune. It quotes former Surgeon General      C. Everett Koop as saying that ``Partial-birth abortion is      never medically necessary to protect a mother's health or      future fertility.''       I am writing to request your College's response to this      statement. In the medical judgment of the experts among your      members, is it true that partial-birth abortion is never      medically necessary to protect a mother's health or future      fertility?       As I am sure you know, this is a matter of great concern to      many members of Congress including myself, and I would      appreciate your timely response to this important question.  I sent that letter on July 28, 1998. I received a reply on August 13, 1998,from Dr. Ralph Hale, executive vice president of the American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists. When I finish reading it, I will ask it be printed in the Record. But I would like to read it in its entirety so there is no doubt I asked an open-ended question of experts in the field, and this is Dr. Hale's reply:       Dear Senator Durbin: I am writing in response to your July      28th letter in which you asked for the College's response to      Dr. Koop's statement that ``Partial-birth abortion is never      medically necessary to protect a mother's health or future      fertility.''  The letter went on to say:       The College's position on this is contained in the      statement of policy entitled Statement on Intact Dilation and      Extraction. In that statement we say, ``Terminating a      pregnancy is performed in some circumstances to save the life      or preserve the health of the mother.'' It continues, ``A      select panel convened by ACOG could identify no circumstances      under which this procedure, as defined above, would be the      only option to save the life or preserve the health of the      woman.'' Our statement goes on to say, ``An intact D & X      however, may be the best or most appropriate procedure in a      particular circumstance to save the life or preserve the      health of a woman, and only the doctor, in consultation with      the patient based upon the woman's particular circumstances      can make this decision.'' For this reason, we have      consistently opposed ``partial-birth abortion'' legislation.  It goes to say:       Please find enclosed ACOG's statement on intact D & X.      Thank you for seeking the views of the College. As always, we      are pleased to work with you.           Sincerely,                                                Ralph W. Hale, MD,                                         Executive Vice President.
