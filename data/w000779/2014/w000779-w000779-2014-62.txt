President, I would like to recognize someone who people in my State know very well; someone who for more than three decades has been an inspiring leader and a tireless advocate for children, the elderly and the disabled. She is also a close friend who has never been shy in using her formidable voice to let me know how we can do more to help those in need.  Margaret Louise Carter may be poised for retirement, but that does not mean she is going to stop adding to an impressive list of accomplishments and building on her legacy of hard work and determined advocacy.  Margaret Carter is a true force of nature. A single mother of nine, she graduated from Portland State University with a B.S. in education. She later earned her Master's in Educational psychology from Oregon State University, which led to a career as teacher and counselor at Portland Community College.  Out of concern for the most vulnerable in her northeast Portland neighborhood, she used her compassion, natural leadership ability and tenacity to win a seat in the Oregon House of Representatives in 1984, becoming the first African-American woman elected to the Oregon State Legislature.  She did not stop there. She went on to serve in the Oregon Senate, as chair of the Democratic Party of Oregon, became president and CEO of the Urban League of Portland and president of the National Organization of Black Elected Legislative Women. She helped establish the Job Skills Center for Portland Community College's Cascade Campus, where the Technology Education Building was renamed in herhonor, making it the first building in PCC's 50 year history to be named after a woman.  Margaret accomplished many notable things while in office, including, but not limited to, helping create a permanent Head Start program in Oregon, co-sponsoring a bill to create parity for mental health services, establishing a State holiday to honor Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr. and co-founding the Oregon Youth Conservation Corps.  While Margaret may be leaving the world of work, those of us who know her know that there is no way she is leaving the world of community involvement. Whether it is advocating for affordable home-ownership options for low to moderate-income families, organizing a kids choir to perform at community events, or entertaining friends with a singing voice that is just as strong as her personality, you can rest assured that Margaret will be there.  After a life of service to others, it is fitting that Margaret is retiring from her position at the Oregon Department of Human Services. It is with great pride, both personally and professionally, that I extend my congratulations to Margaret Louise Carter.                          ____________________
