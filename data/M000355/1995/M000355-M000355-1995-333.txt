 968. A bill to require the Secretary of the Interior to prohibit the import, export, sale, purchase, and possession of bear viscera or products that contain or claim to contain bear viscera, and for other purposes; to the Committee on Finance.                        THE BEAR PROTECTION ACT  Mr. McCONNELL. Mr. President, I introduce the Bear Protection Act. This measure is aimed at controlling poaching of bears such as the American black bear which is found in Kentucky. It addresses several enforcement and jurisdictional loopholes that are caused by a patchwork of State laws. The current inconsistencies enable a wildly profitable underground black market for bear parts to flourish in the United States.  Mr. President, my bill would in no way affect legal hunting of bears. Hunters would still be allowed to keep trophies and furs of bears killed during legal hunts. This measure would only prohibit the sale or barter of the internal organs of the bear which are referred to as bear viscera.  This bill is made necessary because of the booming illegal trade in bear viscera. At least 18 Asian countries are known to participate in the illegal trade in bear parts. Bear viscera are also illegally sold and traded in large urban areas in the United States such as San Francisco, Seattle, Portland, and New York City. These cities serve as primary ports for export shipments of these goods.  Bear parts, such as gall bladders, are used in traditional Asian medicine to treat everything from diabetes to heart disease. Due to the increasing demand for bear viscera, the population of Asian black bears has been totally annihilated over the last few years. This has led poachers to turn to American bears to fill the increasing demand. I, for one, will not stand by and allow our own bear populations to be decimated by poachers.  Mr. President, it is estimated that Kentucky has only 50 to 100 black bears remaining in the wild. Black bears once roamed free across the Appalachian mountains, through the rolling hills of the bluegrass, all the way to the Mississippi river. Although we cannot restore the numbers we once had, we can insure that the remaining bears are not sold for profit to the highest bidder.  Poaching has become an astoundingly profitable enterprise. It is estimated that over 40,000 bears are poached in the United States every year. That equals the number that are taken by legal hunting.  Mr. President, the main reason behind these astounding numbers is greed. In South Korea, bear gall bladders are worth their weight in gold, and an average bear gall bladder can bring as high as $10,000 on the black market.  Currently, U.S. law enforcement officials have little power to address the poaching of bears and the sale of their parts in an effective manner. The Department of the Interior has neither the manpower nor the budget to test all bear parts sold legally in the United States. Without extensive testing, law enforcement officials cannot determine if gall bladders or other parts have from threatened or endangered species. This problem perpetuates the poaching of endangered or threatened bears.  The Bear Protection Act will establish national guidelines for trade in bear parts, but it will not weaken any existing State laws that have been instituted to deal with this issue. My bill will also instruct the Secretary of the Interior and the U.S. Trade Representative to establish a dialog with the appropriate countries to coordinate efforts aimed at curtailing the international bear trade.  Mr. President, this measure is crafted narrowly enough to deal with the poaching of the American black bear for profit, while still ensuring the rights of American sportsmen. I urge my colleagues to join me in support of this much-needed legislation.  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the full text of the bill be printed in the Record.  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the Record, as follows:                                 S. 968       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of      the United States of America in Congress assembled,     SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.       This Act may be cited as the ``Bear Protection Act''.     SEC. 2. DEFINITION OF BEAR VISCERA.

SEC. 5. DISCUSSIONS CONCERNING TRADE PRACTICES.       The United States Trade Representative and the Secretary of      the Interior shall--       (1) discuss issues involving trade in bear viscera with the      appropriate representatives of such countries trading with      the United States as are determined jointly by the Secretary      of Commerce and the Secretary of the Interior to be the      leading importers, exporters, or consumers of bear viscera;      and       (2) attempt to establish coordinated efforts with the      countries to protect bears.     SEC. 6. RELATIONSHIP TO STATE LAW.
