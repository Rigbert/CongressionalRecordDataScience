 I also concur that is incumbent upon the IRS to take all steps it can to ensure that the public and the tax preparation community have clear, detailed, and understandable information about any adjustments and modifications it makes to help Katrina victims who qualify for the credits get them.  I believe that the IRS should report to Congress within the next couple of weeks the action it has taken to implement the provisions of section 406 and section 407 HKTRA, pertaining to the EITC and CTC, including outreach and communication efforts undertaken by IRS to inform taxpayers, tax practitioners, and volunteer tax preparation programs of these provisions, including the guidance provided to them by IRS on how the flexible authority to IRS in section 407 is being interpreted and implemented. IRS should publish such guidance, including typical questions and answers, in formats that are accessible to taxpayers, commercial tax practitioners, volunteer tax preparer organizations and low-income taxpayer clinics, including but not limited to the IRS Web site.
