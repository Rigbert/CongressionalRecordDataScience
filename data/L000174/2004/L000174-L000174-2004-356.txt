 The distinguished senior Senator from Utah, who is now on the floor, and I were talking to editors and others at a press gathering in Washington this morning. I mentioned Mary McGrory at the beginning of that.  When Marcelle and I first came to Washington, Mary was one of the first people we met. I always enjoyed my time with her. She was a great writer with searching questions, and did not suffer fools idly. She was very quick and very able in deflating those who had inflated themselves far beyond what they deserved.  She also helped so many people. I remember the girl from an orphanage she helped, referring to her as ``Mary McGlory.'' Indeed, she has gone to her own glory now, but she made it possible for some others.  She was a remarkable person, a remarkable person who will not be matched. There will be many others who will carry the banner, but none will do it with her ability.  I also liked the fact every time she would take a vacation in Italy she would come and chat with me about it. My mother's family is still in Italy. We would discuss favorite recipes, notwithstanding our Irish names.                          ____________________
