Madam Speaker, I am so pleased to join my House and Senate colleagues today in introducing this important and necessary legislation. I would like to thank Senators Dodd and Leahy and Congressman Hulshof for their commitment to justice and to the passage of the Emmett Till Unsolved Civil Rights Crime Act.  Nearly 60 Members of the House of Representatives from across the country joined us in cosponsoring this important and historic bill. There is strong, bipartisan, bicameral commitment to passing and enacting this legislationas swiftly as possible. It is long overdue. The country is ready. The victims' families friends, and loved ones have been suffering indefinitely, and Congress needs to act.  Our purpose here today is not to open up old wounds. There is a need for those who committed horrible crimes to be brought to justice. This process of seeking justice is not just good for history's sake, but it is good for the process of healing. It will help us to put this dark past behind us and to bring closure to the families of the victims of these age-old and vicious crimes.  The Emmett Till Unsolved Civil Rights Crime Act will deliver the added focus and resources necessary to get this job done. It is my hope and prayer that many murders committed during this Nation's struggle for civil rights will be solved as a result of this legislation. I will work tirelessly to see it passed.                          ____________________
