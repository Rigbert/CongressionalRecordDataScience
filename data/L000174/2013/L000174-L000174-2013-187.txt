President, I am pleased today to join my Vermont colleague Senator Sanders to introduce the Upper Missisquoi and Trout Rivers Wild and Scenic River Designation Act.  The Upper Missisquoi River gathers itself from snowmelt and from pristine springs and cedar bogs in the forests of Vermont's Northeast Kingdom. As it flows from the town of Lowell to the town of Westfield, this lovely mountain brook grows large enough to float a small canoe during its winding journey through Vermont's forests and meadows. A paddler on this section is treated to a stream that runs crystal clear and abounds with trout and other fish as it winds through pine forest and silver maple flood plains, to meadows dotted with grazing Holstein cows.  The beauty and wildness of the river is undiminished as it swells on its journey north through the towns of Westfield, North Troy, and Troy, and crosses into the Canadian Province of Quebec. Not far downstream the river reenters the United States and winds its way across more miles of pastoral countryside in Northern Vermont through Richford, Berkshire, and Enosburg. Along the way it gathers the ice-cold, pristine flow of the Trout River in the town of Montgomery.  The scenery along the Upper Missisquoi and Trout Rivers in these towns is spectacularly beautiful, the water quality is superb, public access is unlimited, and Vermonters along the shores are eager to share these treasures with visitors from near and far. The Upper Missisquoi and Trout Rivers epitomize Wild and Scenic Recreational Rivers of national significance, and I am proud to join Senator Sanders in introducing this legislation.  A Federal Wild and Scenic Recreational River designation should only be considered after the resource has been closely studied and if this designation is actively sought by people living in the area. We can report to the Senate that both of these tests are met for the Upper Missisquoi and Trout Rivers.  Seven years ago a group of people living along the rivers asked Vermont's delegation to the Congress to request a Wild and Scenic River Study, and for more than 5 years these Vermonters--with tremendous support from their neighbors, the neighboring towns, and the National Park Service--have assessed the river, turn by turn, mile by mile, and they have worked hard to plan for its protection and recreational use. The study committee kept their neighbors along the rivers and local elected leaders fully engaged at every step. Their hard work paid off this past March when the citizens of each of the affected, towns, at Vermont town meetings--those revered democratic institutions of self-government in our State--voted in favor of seeking the Wild and Scenic River designation.  This has been one of the most locally driven and strongly supported resource conservation initiatives to come before the Congress, and I commend the study committee and all of Vermonters in these towns for their hard work and cooperation.  A National Wild and Scenic River designation will help these two rivers reach their full potential as major engines of the Northeast Kingdom's tourism economy and at the same time help to ensure that the ecosystem is protected and enhanced for future generations.  The Upper Missisquoi River and the Trout River meet each of the criteria for a National Wild and Scenic River designation. The management of the rivers has been carefully planned, and the designation is actively sought by Vermonters living in communities along the rivers. I am proud to join Senator Sanders and Peter Welch, Vermont's Representative in the other body, in introducing this bill and taking this commendable effort to the next level.                                 ______                                       By
