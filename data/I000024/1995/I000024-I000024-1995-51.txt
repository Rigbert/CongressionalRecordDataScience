I appreciate it very much. I will try to return the favor some time.  Madam President, I have a feeling that this is a historic moment right now, that we may not have any more votes, and we may be leaving all of this up here and going back, hopefully, for the Thanksgiving holidays, in which case I have a couple of comments I want to make. They are not really exactly on the focus of today, but I will also go back and wind up with some thoughts I have on this subject.  There have been some rumors--and I always hate to talk about rumors on the floor of the U.S. Senate--that have come from so many different unrelated sources, and I am concerned that during the period of time that we will be in the Thanksgiving recess, there may be some agreement reached and our troops may be deployed to Bosnia.  This concerns me very much, and this is not a very appropriate time to bring it up. But I do think that we need to get on the record and remind the President that this Senate passed, just 2 days ago, a strong sense-of-the-Senate amendment to the DOD appropriations bill which says that we, Mr. President, want you to come to the Senate and to the House of Representatives for authority to send troops into Bosnia.  It was a very similar situation that the President of the United States at that time, George Bush, faced back in the early nineties when he wanted to send troops to the Persian Gulf. He did not want to come to Congress. He felt it was necessary and that we had vital national interests in the Persian Gulf and we had to go. Yet, he did not want to do that and take a chance of being turned down. So we have a similar situation today.  I can remember talking to one of the generals training over at the 1st Armored Division in Germany. Those are the troops that were going to go to the Persian Gulf. Now he is training the troops that would go to Bosnia. He related to me an experience of sitting and listening to the radio, hoping, and praying that George Bush would take this to Congress to get authority. They did not want to be sending their troops into a hostile area without the American people behind them.  I see exactly the parallel situation here. I certainly hope that the President will come to Congress and not use an opportunity when we might be on recess to deploy troops to Bosnia. Not too long ago, before the Senate Armed Services Committee, we had Secretary Christopher, Secretary Perry, and General Shalikashvili. I asked them the question, after they defined the mission the United States has in Bosnia. The mission was twofold: First, to contain a civil war to the former Yugoslavia, and second, to protect our position in NATO and the integrity of NATO. I felt--and I think several other people who have spoken on this floor feel the same way--that those two missions are not worth the loss of one life.  Shortly before, General Rose--Michael Rose, who is the commanding   general of the U.N. forces in Bosnia--had made a statement that if America gets involved and sends troops over to Bosnia, we will lose more lives than we lost in the Persian Gulf war, which was 390. I asked the question to all three of these top officials representing the President of the United States. I said, ``Is that mission worth the loss of 400 or more American lives?'' Secretary Perry said, ``Yes.'' Secretary Christopher said, ``Yes.'' General Shalikashvili said, ``Yes.''  I think there is the honest difference of opinion, and we need to see how that opinion is shared by the American people and by both Houses of Congress.  I certainly admonish the President if, during this period of time, if the temptation comes to deploy troops, to think of the troops going over there without the American people behind them.                          ____________________
