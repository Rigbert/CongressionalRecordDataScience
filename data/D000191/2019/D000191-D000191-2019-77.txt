Chair, this is a ridiculous issue, to put it mildly. This administration has taken two totally contradictory positions on this.  Prior to this administration, if you had a TIFIA loan, you were responsible for paying it back with local funds. It was counted as a local match. It is their obligation. They have to pay it back. They have to pay the loan fees. They have to pay for everything that is involved.  Then, in the first year of this administration, they said it is local. It counts as a match.  Oh, wait a minute, a year ago, they changed their mind. Exactly 1 year apart: June 29, 2017, TIFIA loans will be considered a local match; June 29, 2018, they will not be considered a local match. They will be considered as Federal money, ineligible.  What happened in between? I don't know. I think it had something to do with the Portal Bridge in New Jersey and the Gateway Program, and President Trump being in a dispute with the Democratic leader of the Senate.  This is about politics, plain and simple, rotten politics, for critical infrastructure that this country needs.  If a jurisdiction borrows money--they borrowed it, they have to pay it back--that doesn't count. If they go to a bank and borrow it and pay higher interest rates, putting more burden on local taxpayers, that is okay. But if they got it from the Feds--by the way, the Feds make money on TIFIA loans. It is one of the most amazing programs. We make money on it. There has only been like one default in the history of the program. These are good loans.  They have to pay it back, so why wouldn't it count? Politics, plain and simple. This is trying to return to politics, as opposed to common sense, following preexisting practices and the letter of the law.  By the way, this is just clarifying existing law because of a bizarre interpretation written by the Trump DOT a year ago this June.
