  Mr. DeFAZIO. The Republican minority would say take the advice of the professionals. Well, if this administration had taken the advice of the military professionals, remember General Shinseki, ``400,000 troops on the ground or you'll have an insurgency,'' they fired him because he talked about reality.  From day one they've been dumb: firing Shinseki; delusional: ``we'll be greeted as liberators'' and the war will be short; and deliberately deceptive: Saddam Hussein had links to 9/11 and they had weapons of mass destruction.  It's time for a change in course. They want status quo, stay the course. It's not working. Our troops are mired in the middle of a civil war. Someone needs to take the role of leadership here. It's not going to be Bush and Cheney. It can be the United States Congress reasserting itself as a third co-equal branch of government and the only branch which has the authority to declare war and set limits. Yes, set limits on a war, and bring it to an end.                          ____________________
