This morning Judge Robert Blackburn was confirmed to fill a judicial emergency in Colorado that has been vacant since April 1998. Cindy Jorgenson will be filling a judicial emergency in Arizona that has been vacant since 1999.  Colorado and Arizona are two of the many States with judicial emergencies that the Senate has been able to help so far this year. With the confirmation of these two nominees, the Senate will have resolved five judicial emergencies since we returned to session just a few short weeks ago and at least 10 since I became chairman this past summer. Since the beginning of 2002 alone, we have filled judicial emergency vacancies in Texas, Alabama, and Nevada.  Today, we add Colorado and Arizona to that list. Unfortunately, the President has yet to work with home state Senators to send the Senate nominees to 14 other judicial emergency vacancies around the country.  With the completion of today's votes, the Senate will have confirmed 11 judges since beginning this second session of this Congress toward the end of January and 39 judges since the change in majority last summer.
