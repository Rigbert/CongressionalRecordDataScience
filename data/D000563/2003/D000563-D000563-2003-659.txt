President, I would like to ask for clarification because Ithink this is an important question. If you would provide a response to the following parliamentary inquiry, it is my understanding--in fact, I have the amendment before me that has been suggested by the Senator from Washington. This is an amendment that relates to the use of Department of Defense medical facilities, and it amends section 1093 of title X of the U.S. Code, as amended.  Now, if the Chair would just take legislative notice of the bill, S. 1050, and turn to page 157, you will see title VII, ``Health Care.''  Now, if you turn to page 10, you will find in section 703 an amendment--language within the authorization bill relative to extension of authority to enter into personal service contracts for health care services to be performed at locations outside medical treatment facilities. It goes on to amend section 1091(a)(2) of title X. Here we have an amendment relative to health care, relative to the medical treatment facilities managed by the Department of Defense, which seeks to amend section 1093.  Already in this provision of the bill, we amend section 1091. Can the Chair tell me how we can amend the same section of the law relative to medical treatment facilities, and the amendment being offered by the Senator from Washington not be a relevant amendment? It is in the same section relative to health care, on the subject of health care. It relates to Defense medical facilities, as do many of the amendments within that section.  Yet the Chair is telling us it is not relevant language to this section of the pending bill, which the Senator from Washington seeks to amend.
