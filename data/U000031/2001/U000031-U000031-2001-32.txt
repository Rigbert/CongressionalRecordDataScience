Speaker, it is my distinct pleasure today to recognize my friend, and one of the most dedicated public servants I know--Berrien County Sheriff Robert Kimmerly. With the retirement of Bob Kimmerly, Berrien County and the entire State of Michigan will lose years of valuable service and experience in law enforcement.  As a resident of Berrien County, I have seen the results of Bob's work firsthand. Since being elected Sheriff in 1992, Bob sought to enforce the laws in our area in a firm, fair and impartial way--and I think he's been successful. In addition to working to upgrade the technology and communication between State and local law enforcement agencies, Bob has also worked to facilitate communication between these agencies and the community.  The close and effective working relationship Bob maintained with the community will clearly be remembered as one of the hallmarks of Bob's service. He worked to foster a close working relationship with senior citizens and law enforcement, implemented e-mail communication between Neighborhood Watch Groups, Senior Citizen Centers and law enforcement and partnered with area schools to provide student violence prevention and response programs.  Bob has worked not only for the safety of our communities, but the officers under his charge. During his tenure, he implemented computer aided dispatching, mobile vehicle locators for patrol vehicles, mobile data terminals and squad car video cameras. These advances, however, were implemented with a keen eye toward fiscal responsibility. As Sheriff, Bob worked to firmly enforce the laws while at the same time reducing the cost of inmate incarceration. Bob was also a creative Sheriff. As such, he implemented a ``Work Alternative Program'' which provided Berrien County with over 14,000 hours of community service.  Mr. Speaker, I believe I speak for every citizen in Berrien County when I extend our congratulations and best wishes for a retirement filled with happiness and productivity. I submit my remarks into the Congressional Record to ensure that this and future generations of Americans have the opportunity to reflect on and know of the significant contributions Bob Kimmerly has made to Berrien County and the entire State of Michigan.                          ____________________
