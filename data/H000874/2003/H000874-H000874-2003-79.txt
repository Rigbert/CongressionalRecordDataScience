Speaker, reclaiming my time, I thank the gentleman for that information. I would reiterate, having discussed with the gentleman from Michigan (Mr. Dingell), who is, of course, the dean of this House and has 50 years of experience in this House, his concern that he is not sure what is going on in the conference on the energy bill. He is not sure what the schedule is on the energy bill. Neither his staff nor he know what product is going to be reported out.  Again, we are meeting next week for maybe, if we go late into the night, maybe 10 hours, 15 hours next week, and without really having had the opportunity to be fully involved in that conference. As a result, if that happens, our conferees on our side are not going to have any time to consider that substantively, not to mention the Members who will not have time to consider it in a very substantive way.  So I do not think there is any way to solve it now, because as far as we know, there have been no meetings of the conference scheduled. We have not been noted for conferences either Saturday, Sunday, or Monday. So that if something is going to happen, it apparently is going to happen without a formal meeting of the conference if that conference report comes to the floor on Tuesday.  I do not know whether the gentleman wants to comment on that. That is just our concern, Mr. Leader.  Mr. DeLAY. Mr. Speaker, if the gentleman will yield.
