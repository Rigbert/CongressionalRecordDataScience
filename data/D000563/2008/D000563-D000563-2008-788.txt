I know the Senator from Massachusetts, Senator Kennedy, wishes to speak on an unrelated issue. First, I wish to ask the Senator from Kansas, through the Chair, on the issue of uncertainty: Is the Senator from Kansas aware that on this amendment I am offering, I have narrowed the class of people eligible for this benefit, which would be modification of mortgage in Bankruptcy Court, to those who first qualify to go into Bankruptcy Court which, in many instances, requires credit counseling; secondly, that they must be talking about property that is their primary residence, not a piece of real estate they happen to own; third, that it be subject to a mortgage which is a subprime mortgage, not a prime rate mortgage; and fourth, that it has to be a mortgage that exists as of the date of the enactment of this legislation and none in the future? Also, that if there is to be a modification of the mortgage, it can be to a principal level no lower than the current fair market value; that the interest rate imposed by the court be no lower than the prime rate plus a premium for risk; that the term of the modification of the mortgage can be no more than 30 years, and that if within 5 years of bankruptcy the property is sold at a price higher than the fair market value at the time of bankruptcy, all of the proceeds will go to the lender--not to the owner, but to the lender?  I say to the Senator from Kansas that every time the banking and financial institutions came to me and said: It is too uncertain, too many people could benefit from this, every time they did that I would narrow this more and more and more. I would further say to the Senator from Kansas that if we are talking about a limited group of people who fit the description I have given here, how can you project this to have an impact on real estate mortgages of 1 and 2 percent into the future?  The last time we dealt with this issue in Congress was 30 years ago. The last time we had a housing crisis was 60 years ago. It isn't as if we are meeting every 6 months to change the law on mortgages and bankruptcy. I ask the Senator: How much more can I do to deal with his concern and the stated concerns of the banking industry about uncertainty?
