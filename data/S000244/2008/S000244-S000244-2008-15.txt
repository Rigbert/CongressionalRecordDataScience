 Madam Speaker, I rise in opposition to this resolution.  Yesterday, the Democratic leadership tried to sweep a bipartisan FISA bill under the rug, and today they're trying to throw the President's Chief of Staff in jail. I am curious to know what happened to the pledge of partnership with Republicans in Congress, and with the President, and not partisanship.  The vote we are going to take this afternoon has been festering since July, when the House Judiciary Committee decided to vote on holding White House officials in contempt. This pandering to the left reflected a political and unnecessary escalation on the part of the Democratic majority.  The contempt resolution was approved on a straight party line vote in the committee, and today's vote will be the same. The threat of losing in court should be enough for this institution to back down from this escalation.  My concern with the Democratic leadership's course of action is that it will likely weaken Congress' position in situations where we disagree with the President on matters of executive privilege. If the Speaker and the House Judiciary Committee chairman really cared about getting to the bottom of this matter, they could have taken the nonpolitical route, such as directing the House Office of General Counsel to file a civil lawsuit with the U.S. District Court for the District of Columbia. This proposal, which I suggested last summer, would be a legitimate effort to resolve our issues with the President in an arena where the Congress would have equal footing.  So, what's next? How will we rehabilitate our image to give the public confidence in the Congress? I don't think throwing the President's Chief of Staff in jail will do the trick.  It amazes me that the Democratic leadership would bring such a divisive matter to the floor so soon after receiving accolades for working so well with the minority to pass an economic stimulus package.  I encourage my colleagues to vote ``no'' on this resolution.
