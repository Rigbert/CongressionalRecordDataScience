Mr. Speaker, I rise today to honor the hard work and community service exhibited during the past school year by the students of Veterans Memorial Elementary School in Brick Township, New Jersey. It is my honor and privilege of representing these students, and their parents and teachers in Congress.  During this past year, the students invested many hours of service in projects to help make life better for their school and greater community. For example, in the aftermath of the September 11th terrorist attacks, the students honored local fire fighters who participated in rescue and recovery operations at Ground Zero. They also sent thank you notes to New York City police and fire fighters, and wrote letters to a local serviceman stationed overseas.  It is important to note, Mr. Speaker, that the students'community service did not just begin, nor will it end, with their outstanding efforts related to September 11th.  To highlight the importance of a clean and safe environment, the students commemorated Earth Day by decorating grocery bags with environment-friendly messages. These bags were then used by patrons of a local supermarket so they could take home the students'messages about how we must protect for our environment.  They also implemented a school-wide paper recycling program, and worked to beautify the school's grounds.  To enhance their own understanding of the challenges that older Americans face, the students visit with senior citizens in their community, exchanging ideas, and striking up new friendships. They make special holiday gifts for the seniors and also put on concerts, including one full of patriotic songs. It's the students' way of thanking America's ``greatest generation''; a generation that risked all to secure freedom at home and abroad. As chairman of the House Committee on Veterans Affairs, I am especially grateful for the outreach our students have initiated with seniors and veterans--the namesakes of their school.  When a peer's house tragically burned to the ground, the students of Veterans Memorial Elementary School responded by holding an emergency fund-raiser. They also collected warm winter coats for students in need and helped their school buy new books and playground equipment.  While this is only a small sampling of community service activities performed by the students of Veterans Elementary, it is clear that these children, while learning the subjects and skills they need to succeed in academia, are also learning the generosity, compassion, and service needed to be outstanding members of their community.  I am proud to congratulate the students of Veterans Elementary School. Their leader and my friend, Principal Joe Vicari also deserves our thanks for his many years of hard work and generosity and the dedicated teachers and support staff at Veterans Elementary School also deserve high praise and recognition. I wish them all the very best of success for another year of outstanding community service, and I look forward to working with them in their endeavors in the years to come,                          ____________________
