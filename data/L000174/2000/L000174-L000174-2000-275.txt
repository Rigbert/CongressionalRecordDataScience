President, all Senators have worked very closely on this. We tried to accommodate Senators on both sides of the aisle. I hope we will go to third reading. I am waiting for the chairman of the subcommittee to come back to the floor. I see him on the floor now. We can go to third reading. I hope we will support this bill.  This is not a perfect bill, by any means. It does not do anywhere near enough on debt forgiveness, which is something we are going to have to address, I hope, in conference, and I hope we will have a larger allocation for that. It does not do enough on infectious diseases for the poorest of the poor countries, especially in Africa. It does not do enough for Mozambique and other areas. But it is a considerably well-balanced bill within the resources we had. I do compliment the senior Senator from Kentucky in working as hard as he has to accommodate Senators on both sides of the aisle to do that.
