 President, I want to pay special tribute to an outstanding citizen and participant of the distinguished White House Fellowship Program--Jeffrey Glueck from Newport Beach, CA.  Mr. Glueck, a management consultant with Monitor Co. in Cambridge, Massachusetts, graduated from Harvard University with honors, receiving his BA in social studies. He went on to earn an MA in international relations from Oxford University on a Marshall Scholarship, where he and a partner won the annual Oxford Debating Championship. Mr. Glueck has advised the Peruvian and Bolivian governments on economic competitiveness and from 1995-98, directed a national competitiveness project for the Venezuelan government and private sector. He was also a pro bono advisor to the Center of Middle East Competitive Strategy, an economic development and regional cooperation project for the signatory governments of the Middle East peace process. Mr. Glueck has maintained his long-standing commitment to public service with his involvement in many community-based organizations. He tutored at a housing project as a student in Boston, was editor-in-chief of the Harvard Political Review, was a founding participant of the Harvard Communications Project--an inter-ethnic discussion group--and started a recycling program at the Oxford University dorms.  Since 1965, the White House Fellowship Program has offered outstanding citizens across the United States the opportunity to participate in a once-in-a-lifetime experience. Fellows work closely with influential leaders in government and see U.S. policy in action. The nearly 500 alumni of the program have gone on to become leaders in all fields of endeavor, fulfilling the Fellowship's mission to encourage active citizenship and service to the nation. This program is extremely competitive, choosing individuals that have demonstrated excellence in community service, leadership, and professional and academic achievement. It is the nation's most prestigious fellowship for public service and leadership development.  Mr. Glueck had been assigned to the Export-Import Bank of the U.S. during his White House Fellowship. In this capacity, he works on ways to reconcile free trade with environmental protection around the world. He has helped coordinate a campaign for environmental standards of all OECD governments that would withhold public financing for projects in developing countries that damage the environment. In addition to these responsibilities, Mr. Glueck works to counter unfair trade practices by foreign governments in emerging governments and to promote sales by U.S. companies with environmentally-beneficial products to places in Asia and Latin America that can benefit from American know-how.  Mr. President, I wish to congratulate Jeffrey Glueck for his accomplishments, and especially for being a distinguished recipient of the White House Fellowship. It is an honor to represent Mr. Glueck in the U.S. Senate.                          ____________________
