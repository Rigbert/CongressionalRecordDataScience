 President, today I wish share with the Senate a tribute to Mr. Davis Moriuchi, a leader in the Pacific Northwest who is retiring after 30 years of service with the Army Corps of Engineers. During his tenure with the Corps, Davis has left an indelible mark on the environment, economy, and people of Washington State. His expertise and dedication will be sorely missed.  My work with Davis over the years has served as a reminder of the difference dedicated individuals make in large and complex organizations like the Corps of Engineers. As we all know, the Corps tackles huge projects that have a widespread impact on our Nation. Davis's work has reaffirmed for me the importance of committed individuals on the success of those projects. Our State has been lucky to have been able to rely on his personal touch and expertise for so many years.  In Davis, my staff and I have also found an invaluable resource whose devotion to the region is as great as ours. Time and again, Davis has taken the time to explain even the most detailed aspects of Corps initiatives. His patience, clarity, and honesty have allowed me to be a stronger advocate for programs that will have long-term consequences for the Pacific Northwest.  While the extent of Davis's impact cannot be measured by projects alone, I would be remiss if I did not mention a few of the projects that he has taken on. We in Washington State will particularly miss Davis's leadership on water resource projects. From the new Navigation Lock at the Bonneville Dam to the ongoing Columbia River Channel Improvement Project, Davis's work on the health of our State's critical waterways will have lasting effects.  Davis has also championed interim repairs of the Columbia River jetties. It was a very exciting day last August, when Colonel O'Donavon, Davis, a host of other stakeholders and I stood at the mouth of the Columbia River and saw interim jetty repairs. Davis was instrumental in making that day possible.  Davis is ending his career as the deputy district commander for project management and the chief of Planning, Programs and Project Management Division for the U.S Army Corps of Engineers, Portland District. It is a title that, while long in syllables, does not begin to grasp at the immensity of his service. But then again, Davis has never worked for titles or credit. His main concern has always been that the work of the Corps is well-executed and timely.  Davis's devotion to the region will be truly missed. I would like to wish himthe best of luck in an enjoyable retirement and thank him for his distinguished service.                          ____________________
