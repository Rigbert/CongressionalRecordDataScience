President, earlier this year, I announced my intention to object to any unanimous consent request for the Senate to take up the nomination of Joseph Kelliher to the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission. I did this because at the time, Mr. Kelliher had not convinced me that he fully understood the impact of west coast market manipulation on northwest ratepayers or the problems that the Commission's standard market design proposal could create for the northwest electric power grid.  Today I received a letter from Mr. Kelliher expressing his views on these subjects. It is clear from his letter that Mr. Kelliher has done his homework about energy issues critical to the west in general and the northwest in particular. From opposing a final standard market design rule to supporting voluntary regional transmission organizations and making market manipulation illegal, Mr. Kelliher's letter reflects he now has a better understanding and appreciation of the northwest energy markets and transmission systems and the particular challenges northwest ratepayers face.  Based on his letter, I will no longer object to any unanimous consent request for the Senate to take up Mr. Kelliher's nomination.  I ask unanimous consent that a copy of Mr. Kelliher's letter to me be printed in the Congressional Record.  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in the Record, as follows:                                               September 30, 2003.     Hon. Ron Wyden,     U.S. Senate,     Washington, DC.       Dear Senator Wyden: I am writing to clarify my views on two      issues of importance to you: Standard Market Design and      market manipulation.       You have forcefully stated your opposition to the      Commission's Standard Market Design. In particular, you have      expressed concern that market rules developed in other      regions of the country may not work in the Pacific Northwest,      and emphasized the potential economic impact of the proposal      on your region.       I recognize electricity markets are not national, but      regional. There are significant differences among the      regions--the transmission grids are different, the generation      mixes are different, and the market structures are different.      There are also significant legal differences--the role of      nonjurisdictional utilities such as the Bonneville Power      Administration and municipal utilities is more significant in      the Pacific Northwest than other regions. It is essential      that market rules reflect these important regional      differences.       For these reasons, I do not believe imposition of uniform      national market rules on your region is appropriate. I      support regional flexibility, and if confirmed by the Senate      I would give great deference to the views of your region.      Further, I am not convinced there is a need for a final rule      on Standard Market Design. A better means of achieving      regional flexibility may be through regional proceedings.       Because of the unique regional characteristics in the      Pacific Northwest, I believe any effort to form a regional      transmission organization should be voluntary. In my view,      the Commission could not successfully mandate the      establishment of a regional transmission organization for the      Pacific Northwest, nor should it attempt to do so.       Markets that are subject to manipulation cannot operate      properly. For that reason, I believe there is an urgent need      to proscribe manipulation of electricity markets. There is no      express prohibition of market manipulation in the Federal      Power Act. That stands in contrast with the regulatory laws      governing other industries, such as securities and      commodities. Market manipulation should be expressly      prohibited.       In addition, penalties must be sufficient to discourage      market manipulation. Well before the Western electricity      crisis I advocated tougher criminal and civil penalties. In      my view, the penalties set by Congress in the Federal Power      Act are no longer adequate to discourage criminal behavior.      They need to be increased.       The Commission has some ability to address market      manipulation absent Congressional action. In my opinion, the      Commission has legal authority to proscribe certain market      manipulation practices by jurisdictional utilities. The      Commission also has discretion to revoke authorization of a      public utility to sell power at market-based rates as a      remedy for market manipulation. I would support exercise of      this authority.       In the past, you discussed the relationship between spot      markets and long-term markets. As you know, in its ``Final      Report on Price Manipulation in Western Markets'' the      Commission staff concluded spot prices influenced forward      prices. As a general matter, I acknowledge there is a      relationship between spot markets and forward markets.       There is no question the Commission has legal authority to      reform contracts. In the right circumstances, contract reform      is appropriate. If it can be demonstrated that any Pacific      Northwest contracts impose an excessive burden on consumers      or are unduly discriminatory, or that fraud or duress were      present at the time of contract formation, then I believe      contract reform would be appropriate. You have expressed your      strongly-held view that the just and reasonable standard      should govern in contract reform cases. I respect your view,      and note there is legal precedent supporting your position. I      have not prejudged which legal standard should govern in      contract reform cases, and Federal courts have applied both      the public interest standard and the just and reasonable      standard. As you know, the Commission applied the public      interest standard in recent contract reform cases. I have not      prejudged whether these cases were correctly decided.       I appreciate the opportunity to share my views with you on      these matters.           Sincerely,     Joseph T. Kelliher.                          ____________________
