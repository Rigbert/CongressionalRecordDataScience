Res. 293       Whereas tens of millions of Americans have served in the      Armed Forces of the United States during the past century;       Whereas hundreds of thousands of Americans have given their      lives while serving in the Armed Forces during the past      century;       Whereas the contributions and sacrifices of the men and      women who served in the Armed Forces have been vital in      maintaining our freedoms and way of life;       Whereas the advent of the all-volunteer Armed Forces has      resulted in a sharp decline in the number of individuals and      families who have had any personal connection with the Armed      Forces;       Whereas this reduction in familiarity with the Armed Forces      has resulted in a marked decrease in the awareness by young      people of the nature and importance of the accomplishments of      those who have served in our Armed Forces, despite the      current educational efforts of the Department of Veterans      Affairs and the veterans service organizations;       Whereas our system of civilian control of the Armed Forces      makes it essential that the future leaders of the Nation      understand the history of military action and the      contributions and sacrifices of those who conduct such      actions; and       Whereas on October 30, 2001, President George W. Bush      issued a proclamation urging all Americans to observe      November 11 through November 17, 2001, as National Veterans      Awareness Week: Now, therefore, be it       Resolved, That the Senate--       (1) designates the week of November 10 through November 16,      2002, as ``National Veterans Awareness Week'' for the purpose      of emphasizing educational efforts directed at elementary and      secondary school students concerning the contributions and      sacrifices of veterans; and       (2) requests that the President issue a proclamation      calling on the people of the United States to observe      National Veterans     Awareness Week with appropriate educational activities.
