President, having returned a few days ago from my 14th trip in the area, I think it is particularly meaningful to remember the life and sacrifice of a remarkable young man, Army Staff Sergeant Christopher Hake. Chris died on the 23rd of March, 2008, of injuries he sustained when an IED detonated near his Bradley fighting vehicle in Baghdad, Iraq.  Chris grew up in Enid, OK, with two sisters, Shannon and Keri, and two brothers, Zachary and Skylar. I was in Enid yesterday. I looked around and I could see the area, the type of place where Chris grew up. He spent his time, as most Oklahoma boys did, attending school, playing ball, driving his car, spending time with family and friends, and going to church. His strong faith in Jesus matured during his time at Oklahoma Bible Academy. While there, he became very involved in his youth group and traveled to Mexico on a mission trip. Unsure of what he wanted to do after graduating from Oklahoma Bible Academy, Chris enlisted in the Army in 2000.  Chris excelled during basic training in Fort Benning and was selected to serve as a member of the ``Old Guard''--one of the oldest and most respected infantry regiments in the U.S. Army. As a member of the Old Guard, Chris was responsible for guarding the Tomb of the Unknowns at Arlington National Cemetery and escorting deceased Army servicemembers to their final rest in the ``Garden of Stone,'' as Arlington is sometimes called. While serving in the Old Guard unit, the Pentagon was attacked on September 11. Chris was immediately called upon to clear the Pentagon after the attack. This solidified Chris's commitment to the fight for freedom in the world and to protect the people of America. He saw that opportunity in Iraq.  In 2004, Chris transferred to the 4th Battalion, 64th Armor Regiment, 4th Brigade Combat Team, 3rd Infantry Division at Fort Stewart, GA. While home during the summer of 2004, he met Kelli Short and it was love at first sight.
