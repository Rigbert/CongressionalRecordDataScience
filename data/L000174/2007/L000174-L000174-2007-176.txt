President, earlier today, the President announced his intention that he will, at some appropriate time, send the nomination of Judge Michael Mukasey to the Hill to be the next Attorney General. When that nomination arrives, with the appropriate FBI clearance and all, the Judiciary Committee will approach consideration of this nomination in a serious and deliberate fashion.  The administration, of course, took many months in determining that a change in leadership was needed at the Department of Justice. Then after they made the determination they had to change the leadership, the President spent several weeks before making his nomination public. It wasn't until Saturday of this past weekend that I was told by the press whom he was going to nominate. Our focus now, of course, will be on securing the relevant information the committee needs to proceed to scheduling fair and thorough hearings, and we will do that.  I am not in any way critical of the President for taking so many weeks in deciding whom he wanted. In fact, I would compliment him on his decision not to go with some of the names that apparently were presented to him. I tried to stress to the President and others at the White House, with all the problems at the Department of Justice, that choosing a person who would be there solely for political purposes would not be a wise thing to do. I know the President had a number of names that would have fallen into that category, and to his credit, those names that would have created the greatest political problems were rejected.  Now, I have also been in discussion with White House officials about some of the committee's outstanding requests, and I let them know that cooperation with the White House would be central in determining that schedule. In this regard, I wish to compliment the President's counsel, Mr. Fielding. Mr. Fielding called me yesterday evening. Without going into the details of that conversation, I believe he understands there are certain materials that we have requested from the White House--requested for some time now--that will be necessary so that we can engage in thorough deliberations. I take him at his word that we will try to work out a way to get us some of those materials. It will make it far easier for both Republicans and Democratic members of the Senate Judiciary Committee to ask appropriate questions.  This is a big job, being Attorney General. It becomes even bigger now, as the next Attorney General must regain the public trust and begin the process of restoring the Department of Justice to its proper mission, and also replacing a very large number of key members of the Department of Justice who have resigned and whose replacements, themselves, will require confirmation by the Senate. So I am hopeful that once we obtain the information we need, once we have had the opportunity to consider this nomination, we will be able to make progress in this regard.  As I told the White House last night, I stand ready to work with them in the coming weeks to get the material we need, and then once that material is available, to find an appropriate time to schedule a hearing.  I look forward to meeting with Judge Mukasey in the coming days. We will meet briefly tomorrow and then at greater length once his background check has been completed. I wish to learn more about his record, but I also wish to learn about his ideas on improving the relationship between Congress and this administration so we can conduct more effective oversight and take the steps toward rebuilding the Justice Department to be worthy of its name.  In the meantime, I have told Judge Mukasey he will have a lot on his plate in the coming days. I complimented him and his family for being willing to be considered for this nomination and urged him, even as busy as he may be, to spend time with his family. I understand he has a wonderful family--grandchildren and so forth--and I am sure he will do so.  I again urge the White House that we do not need to have all kinds of press comments about the date for hearings. I think what would be more important to do would be to work, as we have in the past, will to get the information necessary; and in the fullness of time, we will have an appropriate hearing. I will do it--working, of course, with Senator Specter--and, as I think we have demonstrated before, we will have a hearing that will make the Senate proud. Both Republicans and Democrats, with the complete record before them, then will be able to ask all the appropriate questions, the questions of course that the American public wants and deserves to have us ask.                          ____________________
