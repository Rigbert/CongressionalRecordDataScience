 Speaker, today marks the 34th anniversary of the Equal Pay Act, the original legislation to address the wage disparity between men and women. I am of the opinion, Mr. Speaker, that while the Equal Pay Act is a necessary piece of legislation, it has not yet lived up to its promise of ensuring equal pay for equal work.  I recently attended a rally held in my district commemorating Pay Inequity Day, which fell on April 11, 1997. Pay Inequity Day marks the day when working women's 1996-97 paychecks will, on average, finally equal what men earned in 1996 alone. This day falls over 4 months into 1997. This is simply unacceptable.  In my work as a Member of Congress, I often focus on the growing problem of income disparity and how the families of America are affected by this and the growing inequality of wealth in our country. In looking at the statistics we see that even 34 years after enacting the Equal Pay Act, the wage disparity between men and women still plagues this country. In 1995, women earned only 71 percent of wages earned by men. According to the National Academy of Sciences, between one-third and one-half of the wage difference between men and women cannot be explained by differences in experience, education, or other legitimate qualifications. Bureau of Labor Statistics data indicates that women earn equal pay in only 2 out of 90 detailed occupations.  What does this mean for the American family? The picture is not good. Vermont families and families across the country are becoming more and more dependent on women's wages. Today, 40 percent of all working women have children under the age of 18--children who depend upon them for care, shelter, food, clothing, et cetera. Although most American families today must rely heavily on women's wages, women with the same qualifications as men continue to make less than their male counterparts.  If we look closely at the wage gap between men and women over the years, we noticethat it narrowed slightly in the 1980's. Some may have looked at that as a gain for women. The truth is however, that the narrowing of the gap was largely due to a decline in men's wages. Now how does that fare for American families?  As for my district, according to data supplied by the Institute for Women's Policy Research, Vermont ranks 3d in the Nation for wage equity. The Vermont female/male ratio is 75 percent while the U.S. average is 68 percent. Vermont shares its ranking with Alaska and sits below only Washington, DC. Some may try to indicate that since Vermont is ranked third, we do not have a problem and we can relax. I say that is just not acceptable. It is our job to respond that no pay inequity is acceptable--not 68 percent, not 75 percent, not 95 percent. Women should expect and receive 100 percent--equal pay as men for equal work.                          ____________________
