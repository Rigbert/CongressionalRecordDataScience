We are very aware of the dangers fire fighters and other emergency response personnel face every day protecting the lives of our people and we want to provide them with the information they need to handle threats posed by extremely hazardous substances. Nonetheless, the substances generally addressed by S. 880, section 3, do not warrant coverage by a Clean Air Act requirement to submit RMPs. A voluntary, non-regulatory approach, such as the voluntary standards of the National Fire Protection Association for Liquified Petroleum Gas (NFPA 58), can better supply the information needed by fire fighters to protect their and the public's health and welfare.
