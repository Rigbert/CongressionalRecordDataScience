President, for the benefit of my colleagues, I will be very brief. Mr. President, I appreciate efforts of the Senator from Utah to get order, and that is no more than I could expect for somebody that bears certain similarities to the Senator from Vermont.  Earlier, the distinguished Senator from Delaware read a long list of staff and Senators and others who deserve praise for getting us as far as we are.
