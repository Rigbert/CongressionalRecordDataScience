 President, there is a provision in the bill we passed Tuesday on taxes with only two dissenting votes that hasn't been discussed much, and I wish to refer to that provision. It is a modification of the alternative minimum tax credit allowance against incentive stock options. So the important words there are ``incentive stock options.'' Because of how stock options are treated by the AMT, the economic downturn in 2000 created a situation where many individuals owed tax on income they never realized. This is because they owed tax on the value of their stock options when they were exercised and not on what the value of the stock actually was when the shares were sold. Many people owed tax that was several times their actual income. Congress acted to remedy this situation through past legislation, but that did not completelysolve the problem. Many families are still facing an IRS bent on collecting liabilities owed now, despite the fact that those liabilities would be offset by credits in the near future. This means that the IRS was--and could, in the future--be working to seize assets such as family homes to satisfy present tax liabilities that would be eliminated within the next few years under current law.  One Iowa family caught in this AMT trap is the Speltz family of Ely, IA, near Cedar Rapids. Ron and June Speltz found themselves in the crosshairs of the IRS after Ron used stock options to purchase several shares of stock of his employer. I ask unanimous consent that an editorial printed in the Des Moines Register on July 24, 2006, that describes the Speltz family ordeal be printed in the Record.
