As the tragic terrorist attacks of September 11 taught us all too well, our Nation is not as prepared for widespread emergencies as it should be. The legislation I am introducing today, Securing Our States Act, or SOS Act, will help make our Nation more secure by strengthening our first line of defense, the first responders in our States and communities.  As the Presiding Officer is well aware, when a terrorist attack or other disaster occurs, it is the State and local police, firefighters, and emergency medical personnel who are first on the scene. Nearly 2 million State and local police, firefighters, emergency medical personnel, and others are closest to these challenges. They understand best what is needed to respond effectively, and they tell me they need improved training, more and better equipment, greater coordination, and more exercises. They need them as soon as possible. They are the ones who are always on the front lines when disaster strikes.  Properly trained and equipped, first responders have the greatest potential to save lives and limit casualties after a terrorist attack. Currently, however, our capabilities for responding to a terrorist attack vary widely from community to community, State to State, across this great country. Many areas simply have very little capacity to respond to a terrorist attack. In fact, most localities could not respond effectively to a terrorist attack if weapons of mass destruction were used. Even the best prepared States and communities do not possess adequate resources to respond to the full range of possible terrorist attacks.  This legislation I am introducing will help by providing much needed resources. The SOS Act, which is consistent with the first responders proposal in President Bush's budget, will provide $4 billion in critically needed funding, an increase of more than 1,000 percent in Federal resources that will flow to State and local governments.  This bill is designed to accomplish the following objectives: First, more resources to States and communities to conduct important planning and exercises, purchase equipment, and better train their personnel.  Second, it would provide flexibility for States and localities to address whatever the needs of their particular locality may be. States differ in their preparedness, and this would allow flexibility in the use of funds.  Third, another important feature of this bill is its simplicity. We need to speed the disbursement of Federal funds to States and communities without further delay.  Fourth, this legislation is designed to promote cooperation across the Nation so local, State, Federal, and volunteer networks can operate together effectively.  To achieve these objectives, the Federal Emergency Management Agency, known as FEMA, will implement a streamlined and simple procedure designed to speed the flow of resources to States and communities. The funds may be used for a variety of activities, including planning to develop comprehensive plans to prepare for and respond to a terrorist attack; equipment to respond more effectively to terrorist attack, including personal protective equipment, chemical, and biological detectors and interoperable communications gear.  We want to make sure our emergency personnel can communicate with one another. We have learned from the lessons of September 11 that can be a devastating problem.  The legislation would also allow funds to be used for more training to enable firefighters, police officers, and emergency medical professionals to respond and operate in a chemical or biological environment, even a very dangerous environment.  We need to have more exercises to improve response capabilities, practice mutual aid and assess operational improvements and deficiencies.  The legislation I am introducing will help make our Nation safer. Nearly 2 million first responders are always there, willing to put their lives at risk to save the lives of others and to make our country safer. This bill will help these brave men and women do their jobs better and will help all of our communities be more secure. The benefits of the Securing Our States Act are immediate and widespread and the goal is one we can all embrace, the goal of making our Nation safer from terrorist attacks while also bolstering everyday response capabilities.  I urge my colleagues to join me in supporting this legislation.  I yield the floor.                                 ______                                       By
