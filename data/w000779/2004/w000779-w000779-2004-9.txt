President, today I am introducing legislation regarding the way the trade policies of the United States affect the ability of developing countries to access to generic drugs.  The bill addresses concerns that this Administration, through the United States Trade Representative, is pursuing policies that will make it even more difficult for developing countries to gain access to the drugs they need, particularly generics, to treat their public health problems like TB, HIV/AIDS and malaria. This is just wrong.  The policies the Administration seeks to put in place are data exclusivity provisions. Such provisions tend to benefit drug manufacturers. As reported in The Wall Street Journal and elsewhere, when these provisions are included trade agreements they essentially bar countries from being able to get more affordable generic drugs for a period of time, usually five years.  Trade agreements should be about promoting trade. People in developingnations who are suffering from such epidemic diseases should not be denied access to affordable medicines because of trade agreements.  The purpose of what is known as the Doha Declaration was to clarify that trade rules on intellectual property would not interfere with the ability of developing countries to take measures to protect public health. The legislation I am introducing today would prohibit USTR from spending any funds in order to impose data exclusivity for drugs used to treat HIV/AIDS, tuberculosis, or other epidemics, or needed in circumstances of extreme urgency, or national emergency.  I am not one to trample on the need to protect trade secrets, but I cannot condone policies that inhibit developing countries from being able to address their own public health needs. In today's world, it is shortsighted to think that infectious diseases cannot cross borders. By allowing developing countries access to generic drugs, we not only help improve health in those nations, we also help ourselves control these debilitating and often deadly diseases.  I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be printed in the Record.  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the Record, as follows:                                S. 2944       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of      the United States of America in Congress assembled,     SECTION 1. LIMITATION.       (a) In General.--Notwithstanding any other provision of      law, funds appropriated or otherwise obligated to the United      States Trade Representative may not be expended to negotiate      data exclusivity provisions with any country with respect to      public health pharmaceutical products or to require actions      of another country which interfere with a country's access to      public health pharmaceutical products.       (b) Definitions.--In this section:       (1) Data exclusivity provision.--The term ``data      exclusivity provision'' means a provision that restricts for      a set period of time a country from approving for sale      generic public health pharmaceutical products based on      original clinical data of public health pharmaceutical      products previously approved for sale.       (2) Public health pharmaceutical products.--The term      ``public health pharmaceutical products'' means any patented      pharmaceutical product, or pharmaceutical product      manufactured through a patented process, needed to treat HIV/     AIDS, tuberculosis, malaria, or other epidemics, or needed in      circumstances of extreme urgency or national emergency in      accordance with the Decision of the General Council of 30      August 2003 on the Implementation of Paragraph Six of the      DOHA Declaration on the TRIPS Agreement and Public Health and      the WTO General Council Chairman's statement accompanying the      Decision (JOB(03)/177, WT/GC/M/82) (collectively known as the      ``TRIPS/health solution'').                                 ______                                       By
