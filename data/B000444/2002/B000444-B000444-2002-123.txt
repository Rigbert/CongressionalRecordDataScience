 President, I am pleased to note for the record this morning the election of a proven leader in my State to serve in national office.  Diane J. Callaway has worked in the Seaford School District in Delaware for 28 years. In the course of her career, Mrs. Callaway has been active in professional associations at the local, state and national level, serving in virtually every leadership position, both elected and appointed. It came as no surprise to anyone, when Diane Callaway received Delaware's first Educational Office Professional of the Year award.  In 1990, Mrs. Callaway earned a Professional Standards Program certificate and distinction as a Certified Educational Office Employee, CEOE, from the National Association of Educational Office Professionals. She served for four years as the NAEOP's Mid-Atlantic Area Director, and currently serves on the Association's Board of Directors Executive Committee. Mrs. Callaway has been elected to serve as President of the NAEOP for 2002-2003.  Needless to say, we in Delaware are very proud of Diane Callaway proud of her success, proud of the prominent role she is playing at the national level, and most of all, proud of her tremendous contribution to the quality of our schools. We congratulate her on her election, and we thank her for her service to us all.                          ____________________
