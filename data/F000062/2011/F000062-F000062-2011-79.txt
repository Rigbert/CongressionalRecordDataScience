 President, today I wish to express strong support for the Teachers and First Responders Back to Work Act, a bill that provides funding to hire and prevent the layoff of tens of thousands of teachers, police officers, and firefighters.  Difficult economic times have devastated the ranks of these critical positions. Since 2008, California alone has seen more than 70,000 educators laid off. The resources in this bill will help cities and towns across the country avoid more layoffs and start rebuilding their workforce.  Nationwide, some 300,000 education jobs have been lost in the past 3 years, and State and local budget cuts will endanger as many as 280,000 teacher jobs next year.  The difficult economy has also strained police departments across the country. In the past 18 months, 10,000 police officers have been laid off around the country, while 30,000 vacancies have gone unfilled.  I have heard from many police departments in my home State of California that fear that this understaffing will jeopardize public safety. They are concerned that with fewer officers for patrols, investigations and other critical tasks, crime will increase.  Fire departments face similar problems. Thousands of firefighters were laid off in 2009 and 2010, and another 7,000 face layoffs this year.  This legislation will help communities address staffing shortages in these critical positions.  To help our schools, the bill would provide $30 billion to States and school districts to protect and create up to 400,000 education jobs nationwide, which would prevent the layoffs of up to 280,000 teachers and hire tens of thousands more.  In my home State of California, this will safeguard more than 37,000 education jobs.  According to the Government Accountability Office, 72 percent of school districts expect to have less funding in the 2011-2012 school year as compared to last year.  In California, public schools are suffering from State budget cuts. I have heard from thousands of teachers in my State who have received pink slips each spring over the last several years warning that their jobs are in danger.  Many teachers wait for months to find out whether they will still be teaching the following year. Many pink slips are rescinded, sparing jobs, but others are not as lucky. Our teachers should not have to deal with such uncertainty, and this bill helps safeguard those jobs.  With so many teachers losing their jobs in California, classrooms are becoming crowded and the school year is becoming shorter. On average, K-3 classrooms in California are up to 25 students, up from 20 students 2 years ago.  Average class sizes for higher grades have risen from 28 students to 31. The more we squeeze students into one classroom, the more difficult it is to provide standards-based instruction, and the harder it is for students to focus on their education.  This bill invests in education to keep educators on the job, continuing to provide students with a supportive learning environment.  In a country that prides itself on providing children with every opportunity, it does not make sense to lay off the very teachers who prepare our children for the future.  Another casualty of budget cuts is the many talented individuals who are being driven away from the teaching profession because of the lack of job stability. I fear that a deteriorating education system means more children will slip through the cracks and be unprepared for college or to compete in the global economy.  The quality of education is a direct reflection of how firmly we support our teachers.  In addition to supporting thousands of teaching jobs, the Teachers and First Responders Back to Work Act also provides $4 billion for communities to hire police officers. Thesefunds will support more than 17,000 positions over the next 3 years, including about 2,600 in my home State of California.  There is also $1 billion for firefighters, supporting about 6,300 positions nationwide.  These funds go to support the dedicated first responders we depend upon in emergencies--the firefighters who enter burning buildings to save lives and the police officers who risk everything to keep our streets and homes safe.  In recent years, firefighters and police officers have taken on even more responsibilities as they prepare for--and respond to--terrorist attacks. We are reminded of the importance of these first responders when we remember the brave men and women who worked so heroically to save lives after the 9/11 attacks, including more than 400 firefighters, police, and other emergency personnel who lost their lives that day.  Now is the time to stand with our first responders and give them the support they need. We must make sure our emergency personnel are not risking their lives because too many of their colleagues have been laid off.  While this legislation will strengthen our schools and protect our streets and homes, it will not add a penny to the deficit. This is accomplished by paying for the bill with a half-percent tax on Americans with an adjusted gross income over $1 million.  I have long said that those people who have benefited from this economy and can help out should do so. Millionaires can afford to help build a smarter, safer, stronger nation.  It is not the wealthiest Americans who have been bearing the brunt of this recession; it is the middle class and the poor who have suffered.  Our Nation continues to face serious economic difficulties. The unemployment rate is over 9 percent, and remains stuck at 12 percent in California. This lack of employment is causing severe financial strain with too many families losing their homes and too many families struggling to make ends meet.  Congress needs to help Americans get back to work and get our economy moving forward. And this bill will help.  With the Teachers and First Responders Back to Work Act, we will strengthen our schools, help our children get the education they deserve and give our first responders the support they need to keep our communities safe.  I urge my colleagues to support this legislation.                          ____________________
