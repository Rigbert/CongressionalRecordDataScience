 President, but before I do, I wish to respond. This is not a new bill, this so-called 700 pages. These are amendments packaged together which are subsequently divided. These are amendments which have been around for a substantial period of time. It is true some of them have been modified. Senator Hutchison is modifying her amendment. However, wehave had an opportunity to know that and see it and can speak to it. So I object.
