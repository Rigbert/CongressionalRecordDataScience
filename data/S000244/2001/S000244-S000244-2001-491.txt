Speaker, it is with sadness that I note the death of a former colleague and a great Pennsylvanian, Mr. Robert Lawrence Coughlin, Jr., who passed away last month.  Larry grew up on his father's farm near Scranton, Pennsylvania. But he was no farmhand. Making the most of his opportunities, Larry graduated from the Hotchkiss School in Connecticut in 1946, he received an Economics degree from Yale in 1950, a Masters degree in Business Administration from Harvard, and a law degree from Temple University's law school in 1958. While at Temple, Larry attended classes at night, and was a foreman on a steel assembly line during the day.  This ``steely'' resolve served him well throughout his career. As a Marine, Larry fought in the Korean War, and was aide-de-camp to Lt. General Lewis B. ``Chesty'' Puller. When he was elected to Congress, he was Chairman of the Capitol Hill Marines, which represented Members who had been in the Marine Corps.  Larry was first elected to the U.S. House of Representatives in 1968. He came from a family that had some experience in the field of public service as his uncle, Clarence Coughlin, was a former Republican Representative. Representing a wealthy suburb of Philadelphia from 1969 to 1993, Larry was so popular personally and politically, that he was almost always easily elected. It wasn't until after he retired that Democrats were able to field significant competitors for that seat.  A tall and authoritative man, Larry always had a way with people. With his military background and penchant for bow ties, Larry came across--rightfully so--as a gentleman and a scholar. While he briefly served on the House Judiciary Committee, he spent most of his career on the Appropriations Committee. Although I never had the opportunity to directly work with him on the Judiciary Committee, I did work with him on several issues. The nation last a good legislator when Larry resigned, and on November 30, the world lost a good man.  It is with a heavy heart that I say good-bye to Larry. My wife Cheryl and I would like to express our condolences to his wife Susan, and the entire family, in this time of sorrow and sadness. They will be in our prayers.                          ____________________
