President, I am pleased to reintroduce the Pharmacy Education Aid Act along with my colleagues, Senator Enzi, Senator Johnson and others. Last year, the Senate recognized and acted to address the growing, nationwide shortage of pharmacists, by creating a demonstration program under the National Health Service Corps whereby pharmacists agree to serve in rural and medically underserved areas in exchange for partial loan repayment. I commend my colleagues for responding in such a strong, bipartisan way to this critically important health care issue. The bill I am introducing today, the Pharmacy Education Aid Act seeks to build on that bipartisan step while taking a multi-faceted approach to the problem of workforce shortages in the pharmacy sector.  The December 2000 Health Resources and Services Administration, HRSA, report, ``The Pharmacist Workforce: A Study of the Supply and Demand for Pharmacists'' concluded that due to the rapid increase in demand for pharmacists and our limited ability to expand the number pharmacy education programs to train more pharmacists, the shortage was unlikely to abate without significant changes to the current system.  Pharmacists represent the third largest and most trusted health professional group in the United States. In 2000, 190,000 pharmacists were in practice. While this figure is expected to grow to 224,500 by 2010, demand for pharmacists is expected to continue to outpace supply.  These shortages, while particularly acute in rural and medically underserved areas, are felt throughout of health care system. A November 2001 GAO report found that, on average, hospitals report 21 percent of their pharmacist positions are currently unfilled. Vacancy rates are even higher in federal health systems, such as the Department of Veterans Affairs, the Department of Defense and the Indian Health Service.  The Pharmacy Education Act seeks to address these chronic shortfalls in the supply and distribution of pharmacists by building upon Title VII of the Public Health Service Act, with particular emphasis on students with the greatest financial need.  In addition to enhancing students' opportunities to pursue an education in pharmacy, the bill also makes available much needed resources to Colleges of Pharmacy to upgrade and expand facilities and laboratory space as well as to recruit and retain talented faculty to educate future generations of pharmacists.  As Congress works to provide a Medicare prescription drug benefit, the need for more pharmacist involvement in health care decision making, including medication therapy management, formulary development and drug utilization review, will be essential to its long-term success. We must address the pharmacist shortage now. As such, I look forward to working with my colleagues towards expeditious consideration and passage of this timely and important legislation.  I ask unanimous consent that a letter of support be printed in the Record.  There being no objection, the letter was ordered to be printed in the Record, as follows:                                                February 21, 2003.     Hon. Judd Gregg, Edward Kennedy, Billy Tauzin, John Dingell,        Michael Bilirakis, Sherrod Brown.       The undersigned associations and organizations urge you to      ensure Americans continue to have access to comprehensive      pharmacy services. During the 107th Congress you recognized      how important it is to ensure enough pharmacists are      available to care for our nation's citizens, especially the      most vulnerable. We were very grateful that the House      introduced two bills and the senate passed one bill, all      addressing the supply and distribution of pharmacists. We      request your support for similar legislation that is soon to      be introduced during the 108th Congress. Helping the nation's      colleges and schools of pharmacy increase their educational      capacity is an important way of assuring access to this      critical health care professional.       ``The Pharmacist Workforce: A Study of the Supply and      Demand for Pharmacists,'' released in December 2000 by the      Department of Health and Human Service was just a starting      point for raising public awareness of the growing demand for      pharmacists. The American Hospital Association released a      study in April 2002 that showed vacancy rates for pharmacists      in hospitals and health systems exceeded that of nurses.      Recent pharmacy workforce reports from North Carolina, Oregon      and Washington make it clear that there are imbalances in the      supply of pharmacists in rural vs. urban areas. These      reports, and others acknowledge that, like the general      population, the pharmacist workforce is aging, placing      communities at risk of losing access to pharmacy services.       Congress, in some recent Medicare drug benefit proposals,      increases the demand for pharmacists by recognizing the      benefits they bring to health care delivery. Retrospective      drug utilization review, formulary development, medication      therapy management, and prescribing protocols are some of the      mechanisms included in proposed legislation. All these      mechanisms are dependent on or directly involve a pharmacist.      A Medicare prescription drug benefit will dramatically      increase the number of prescriptions dispensed. As a result,      pharmacists will serve an increasingly important role in      utilization control and medication therapy management. This      will only place additional workforce pressure on a health      profession already in high demand.       The President also increases the demand for pharmacists      with his proposals to expand access to health care and      improve health through health promotion activities. Colleges      and schools of pharmacy educate and graduate a health care      professional that is finding growing practice opportunities      across a wide range of clinical and community settings.      Supported by public and private grants and funding, colleges      and schools of pharmacy are working with community-level      health care providers to improve patient safety, boost      immunization rates, increase patient compliance for      treatments associated with chronic illness, and through      health promotion activities, better the health and well being      of our nation.       Increasing the supply of pharmacists is not something that      can be accomplished overnight. We know that you face many      challenges and competing priorities during the 108th      congress. your support and leadership will help meet the      demand for the services of an exceptionally knowledgeable      health care professional and ensure future access. We      recommend you accomplish this by developing and passing      legislation that will assist the nations' colleges and      schools of pharmacy to increase their educational capacity.       Thank you for your continued support of pharmacy education      and the pharmacy profession, and for your efforts to improve      the health and well being of all Americans.
