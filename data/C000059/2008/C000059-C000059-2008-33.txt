Corona has been fortunate to have dynamic and dedicated community leaders who willingly and unselfishly give their time and talent and make their communities a better place to live and work. Cynthia Schneider is one of these individuals. On May 17, 2008, Cynthia will be recognized at the Corona-Norco Family YMCA's 13th Anniversary Distinguished Service Awards Dinner and will receive the YMCA Distinguished Service Award.  Cynthia is senior vice president, director of marketing for American Security Bank, headquartered in Santa Ana, California. She was instrumental in the business case that convinced the bank to open its loan and marketing administration offices and build a new branch office in Corona. For more than 30 years, Cynthia has managed the marketing functions of various Southern California financial institutions, as an officer and as a private consultant. She specializes in improving financial performance through consultative sales training and gaining corporate visibility through strategic marketing and public relations programs.  Cynthia has worked in Corona for 10 years and has been a resident for 8. During that time she has become an active community volunteer. She is a longstanding member of the Corona Chamber of Commerce; has served on their board for 7 years and was chairman of the board in 2006. She currently chairs and is a contributing writer for the Chamber's Corona Business Monthly magazine and heads their legislative action committee. She is the founder and organizer of the Chamber Missions to China and has run the program for 3 consecutive years. Cynthia was recognized by Soroptomist International in 2006 as a Woman of Distinction for her international contributions.  Cynthia was also instrumental in the grassroots campaign by the Corona Chamber of Commerce to help the homeless. The campaign inspired community members to contribute $100,000 during a 6-week period in 2006 to keep the doors of the homeless shelter open over the holidays. Cynthia has also served for 6 years on the board of directors for the Foundation for Community and Family Healthy, is currently president of the Circle City Rotary, and proudly serves on the board of the Corona/Norco YMCA.  Cynthia's tireless passion for community service has contributed immensely to the betterment of the community of Corona, California. I am proud to call Cynthia a fellow community member, American and friend. I salute her and thank her for her service as she receives the prestigious YMCA Distinguished Service Award.                          ____________________
