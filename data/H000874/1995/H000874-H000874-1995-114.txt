Speaker, I thank the gentleman for yielding time to me.  Mr. Speaker, in response to the comments that were just made, this issue that is before us today is about the appropriations process and moving that forward.  The gentleman speaks about the balanced budget. I am one of those who voted for the constitutional amendment for a balanced budget. I am one who voted for the Stenholm budget as an alternative which balances the budget in 7 years. I am one who voted for the coalition budget, which balances the budget in 7 years.  Frankly, in reference to the gentleman from Indiana who mentioned senior citizens, from my perspective, having voted for all of those, taking a $245 billion tax cut and taking a big whack out of senior citizens, $270 billion in Medicare, is not needed. The trustees do not think it is needed and I do not think it is needed.  Having said that, that is not what this is about. This is about what we have been saying would preclude the shutdown of Government. That is, the accomplishment, in the regular order, of the appropriations process. That is why I am going to support this rule. However, I want to say that I very much regret that the Committee on Rules failed to allow the distinguished ranking member of the Committee on Appropriations [Mr. Obey] to offer a clean continuing resolution as an amendment to this bill.  Mr. Speaker, whether we use the figure of 650,000 or 800,000, there are an awful lot of people that were sent home yesterday and are not doing the job today that the American public expects them to do.  The gentleman from Wisconsin, Mr. Obey, has repeatedly tried to bring such a bill to the floor in recent days and has been blocked at every opportunity, frankly, by Speaker Gingrich and others. Today, Federal workers are at home furloughed for just one reason: We have not gotten our work done.  Mr. Speaker, 53 percent of the employees of the Department of Treasury covered by this bill, about 83,000 men and women, are at home today because of the Government shutdown and frankly the inability of Speaker Gingrich and the Republican leadership to resolve the issue that is now resolved in this rule. Fifty percent of the employees of the Office of Personnel Management and 79 percent of the workers of the General Services Administration are at home today, not doing the job that the American public expects of them.  So while I am glad the rule allows this bill to finally move forward, I believe the real business of the House today should be passing a continuing resolution and an extension of the debt limit ceiling without extraneous riders.  We drop an extraneous rider in this rule. I believe that is wise policy. We can consider that issue on some other legislation. Passage of this bill, however, which I believe the President will sign, will put important Government agencies back to work. It will also put about 90,000 furloughed civil servants, some obviously from my congressional district, but I suggest to you from congressional districts all over the United States, back to work.  Mr. Speaker, it is therefore my intention, as I said earlier, to support the rule, I am pleased that the committee rejected, as I requested, the latest attempt to add the Istook-Ehrlich language to gag nonprofit organizations to this bill. That issue alone, not any of the other issues in this bill, that issue alone, an extraneous, unrelated-to-the-appropriations-process issue, has held this bill hostage for 63 days.  The gentleman from Iowa [Mr. Lightfoot], the chairman of the subcommittee, got the conference organized, got this bill agreed upon in conference, did his work. I do not agree with everything in this bill, as I have told the Committee on Rules and as I will say later in the debate on this floor. The gentleman from Iowa does not agree with everything in this bill. But the legislative process, as has been said, is a process of compromise. It is a process of being reasonable. That is what the American public expects us to do.  Therefore, I am going to support this rule because it does move forward a bill that although not perfect, is, in my opinion, probably as good as our side is going to get in terms of this legislative process, and the realities on this floor and in the Senate.  The Istook issue, which I mentioned earlier, has stalled consideration of this bill too long. I commend the other side for finally dropping it from this piece of legislation. There are many problems, as I have said, with this measure which I will detail during the general debate.  Constraints of the 602(b) allocation, however, put a lot of pressure on the gentleman from Iowa [Mr. Lightfoot] and the committee to work within those constraints. I understand that. Within those constraints, this is, in my opinion, an acceptable piece of legislation.  I certainly share the concern that we should be passing a clean continuing resolution, as I said earlier, so we can get the whole Government back to work. It would be very simple to do that, Mr. Speaker. We could have a unanimous-consent request and pass, as we did under President Reagan and President Bush and now under President Clinton, a clean continuing resolution. Recognizing that we have not done our work here in Congress, have not passed those 10 appropriations bills so that the President could sign them and keep Government operating at such levels as we agree upon, then, Mr. Speaker, I think we would be doing our work responsibly.  A clean CR is a responsible act to take. I hope that at some time during this process the gentleman from Wisconsin [Mr. Obey] will be successful in bringing up and seeing passed a clean continuing resolution, and I will support that, and I will support efforts on this bill and others to accomplish that objective. But in the final analysis, I believe this bill does, in fact, warrant our support as moving the appropriations process forward in a responsible way.                              {time}  1215
