Mr. Chairman, I rise in support of the amendment, which would prohibit IMET--foreign assistance for military education and training--to the Government of Indonesia.  For over 20 years, international human rights advocates have been calling attention to abuses by the Indonesian Government in its occupation of East Timor. There is evidence that United States military assistance has helped to further the atrocities in East Timor.  Indonesia's armed forces invaded East Timor in 1975, only weeks after East Timor had attained independence from Portugal. Since then, the Indonesian army has carried out a campaign of what amounts to ethnic cleansing against the Timorese through a program of forced migration. Persecution has been particularly harsh against the Christian majority.  More than 200,000 Timorese--out of a total population of 700,000--have been killed directly or by starvation in forced migrations from their villages since the Indonesian invasion.  There are recent reports of a renewed campaign of repression of Catholics in East Timor. These reports include atrocities such as the smashing of statutes of the Virgin Mary. The campaign has also been directed personally against the Catholic Bishop of Dili, Bishop Belo. His phones are tapped, his fax machine is monitored, his visitors are watched, and his freedom of movement is restricted. But Bishop Belo persists in his courageous efforts to defend justice, peace, and the preservation of the dignity of his people. Recently, he has set up a church commission to monitor human rights abuses, and a radio station to disseminate information and news.  Mr. Speaker, the people of East Timor comprise a sovereign nation. They differ from most Indonesians in language, religion, ethnicity, history, and culture. They are entitled to independence and freedom. And in the meantime, they are entitled to fundamental human rights including the freedom of religion.  Supporters of expanded IMET for Indonesia argue that since one of the purposes of such aid is to educate the military about human rights, we should provide such aid no matter what they do. But this presumes a willingness on the part of the government to change its dismal record. In the absence of such willingness, the only real effect of expanded IMET is to send a signal to the world that our disapproval of the Indonesian military--which we expressed after the 1991 massacre by cutting off all IMET--has softened. This is the wrong signal at the wrong time. We must not put our stamp of approval on a regime that massacres children in churchyards and then remains defiant.  I urge a ``yes'' vote on the amendment.                          ____________________
