President, I rise to pay tribute to a small organization whose existence shows that a few determined individuals can make a difference. I am referring to the Marine Corps--Law Enforcement Foundation, which was formed in February 1995 by five former Marines who decided over lunch one day to help the children of Marines and Federal law enforcement employees.  Less than 3 years after forming, this organization has given away nearly $1.5 million to more than 150 children. The group focuses on the educational and special needs of children who have no where else to turn. They have paid for a hearing aid for a young son of a Marine whose insurance did not cover it. They provided a wheelchair to a ninth grader injured playing football. They gave $250,000 to children whose parents were Federal employees killed or injured in the 1995 Oklahoma City bombing.  Mr. President, I know several of the founding members of this foundation personally, and I want to say that I was not surprised to hear about the success of their collaboration. As Edmund Burke once said, ``Great men are the guideposts and landmarks in the state.'' We can all learn something from them.  I ask that an article from the Newark Star Ledger about the foundation be printed in the Record.  The article follows:   Foundation Formed by 5 Ex-Marines Offers Help, and Hope, Amid Pain                            (By Pat Milton)       New York.--Two years ago, the sky crashed down on Marine      fighter pilot Peter Harmon.       His wife, Shay, was driving with their 5-month-old son when      another driver, allegedly drunk and speeding in Pompano      Beach, Fla., hit them head on. The car burst into a fireball.       Shay managed to push the child out a window before she      died. The infant, George, burned over 33 percent of his body,      was given only a 5 percent chance to live. But he pulled      through, a scarred survivor.       Peter Harmon, who had been on a Marine Reserves training      mission at the time of the accident, almost immediately      received a $10,000 check from a group he'd never heard of:      the Marine Corps-Law Enforcement Foundation.       ``They are awesome,'' says Harmon, who believes the money      gave his son ``a big head start.''       The foundation was formed in February 1995 by five former      marines who decided over lunch one day to help pay for the      education and special needs of children of Marines and      federal law enforcement employees.       So far, the group has given away nearly $1.5 million to      more than 150 children.       ``Just because you take your uniform off, doesn't mean you      end service to your country,'' said one of the five founders,      Richard Torykian, a Vietnam veteran and senior vice president      at the international investment firm Lazard Freres in New      York.       He said the foundation depends entirely on private and      corporate donations.       It provides at least $10,000 for schooling children up to      19 years old who have a parent killed in the line of duty.      The parent must have worked for the FBI; Drug Enforcement      Administration; Secret Service; Customs; Marshals Service;      Alcohol, Tobacco and Firearms; or Immigration and      Naturalization Service.                         scholarships provided       The group also gives scholarships to Marine Corps children      who lose a parent or are in financial need. And it helps      cover medical needs.       This week, a $10,000 check was sent to the widow of Marine      Capt. Robert Straw a day after she gave birth to their second      child, Seth Robert. Straw was killed two months ago in a      helicopter crash outside Dallas.       ``My husband and I had high expectations for our children's      education,'' Mindi Straw said by telephone from her home in      Jacksonville, N.C. ``This money is going to make our wishes      come true.''       The foundation also sent her $10,000 shortly after the      crash for the couple's other child, Molli, 3.       It recently paid for a hearing aid for the son of an active      duty Marine whose insurance did not cover it, and provided an      $800 wheelchair to a ninth grader injured playing football.       ``How are you going to get to college when you can't even      get down the hallway of your high school?'' said Peter Haas,      a retired stockbroker who is president of the foundation,      based in Mountain Lakes, N.J.       The other three founders are James K. Kallstrom, head of      the New York FBI; attorney Patrick McGahn, Jr.; and Steve      Wallace, who owns an investment firm in Los Angeles.       The foundation has more than 900 members, who help identify      worthy cases and sometimes hold fund-raisers.       The largest donation, $250,000, was given to children whose      parents were federal employees killed or injured in the 1995      Oklahoma City bombing. A big chunk of that contribution,      $72,000, was donated by schoolchildren from the Blue Springs      District in Kansas City, Mo., who held dozens of fund-     raisers. Haas, surprised by the size of the donation, carried      the mostly $1 and $5 bills back to New York in laundry bags      and shopping bags.       He was stopped at the Kansas City airport by security      guards who he thought must be suspicious of his swelling bags      of cash. In fact, they wanted to give him $500 they had      collected.       Harmon, now a Federal Express pilot, lives in New Hampshire      and is attending the trial in Florida this month of the man      charged with manslaughter in his wife's death.       He said little George, who he calls ``G-man,'' has a      painful life of operations and skin graftings ahead, but      still liberally dispenses hugs and kisses.       ``To someone who sees him the first time, he may not look      so good on the outside, but he is smiling on the inside,''      Harmon said. ``He's tough, he's a fighter, just like a      Marine.''                          ____________________
