 But let me say to the gentleman, as I have said in the press, and he may have read it, much has been said about who knew what, when and where. Very frankly, my view is what the substance of this issue is what was done, why was it done, and was it done consistent with the law.  There is much opinion that it was a violation of the law and a violation of international law. That is the issue that this country needs to look at. That is the issue that this country needs to examine so that going forward, this country makes a determination as to what is lawful conduct.  In fact, of course, the former President of the United States made it very clear and enunciated, this country does not torture. The problem with that representation, as the gentleman clearly knows, is that many legal experts have indicated that, in fact, torture occurred. So from that perspective, I would tell my friend that what ought to happen is we ought to look at the substance of whether, who knew what, when, why is a distraction. That is my view, I will tell my friend. It is a beating on the table.  What we really need to do is find the facts of what was done, what was the rationale for doing it, was it legal; if it was not legal, why did we pursue it; and was it consistent with our international obligations. And as so many generals have indicated, do we want to subject our own people to such conduct when and if they may be in custody by a foreign power or terrorist?  So I say to my friend that I understand the beating on the table, if you will. But from my own personal perspective, that's not the issue on either side of the aisle, who knew what or when they knew it. What is the issue is what was done. That is my presumption of what a commission would do. I presume as well that committees of this Congress may be interested in that.
