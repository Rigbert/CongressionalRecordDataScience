Mr. Speaker, today I am introducing a bill to make a number of changes to the Magnuson-Stevens Fishery Conservation and Management Act. I believe there are three areas of the current Act that need to be changed. While the language I am proposing may not be the best way to address these concerns, I would like these proposed changes to spark a debate in the coming months.  In addition, I am including language to amend the Bering Sea and Aleutian Islands crab rationalization program to address what I believe was an oversight in the plan. I believe this plan to rationalize the Bering Sea crab fishery is a living plan which will continue to be modified as changes are needed. I believe that the safety issues of this fishery necessitate some action, and I don't believe that no action is an option. Congress asked the North Pacific Fishery Management Council to give the Congress a proposal and they did so. We have studied this fishery for too long without doing something to make it safer. Having said that, I also believe that the plan to rationalize this important fishery needs to be dynamic and we need to be able to make adjustments as we see how the plan works. Everyone involved in this debate has good intentions, but we need to be mindful that good intentions sometimes cause unintended consequences. We need to watch the implementation of the plan very carefully.  Finally, I am asking the Secretary of State to determine whether the retired U.S. staff of two international fisheries commissions who worked in Canada were unduly harmed by exchange rates and to what extent their retirement packages have suffered as a result of the exchange rate.                          ____________________
