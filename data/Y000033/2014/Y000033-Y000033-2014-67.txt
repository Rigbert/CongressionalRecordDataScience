Mr. Speaker, I would like to compliment Mr. Hoyer for his work and Mr. Wolf. They testified before the committee. I asked the question about the extension as far as the length of time. They have assured me that it will be completed. I hope it will be completed. This is a memorial that should be open for the general public. Our police officers are sometimes overlooked.  I urge the passage of this legislation as quickly as possible, and I yield back the balance of my time.
