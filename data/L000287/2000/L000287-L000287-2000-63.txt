Mr. Speaker, I join my fellow colleagues in the Congressional Black Caucus to salute and pay tribute to Curtis Mayfield, a great American songwriter, singer, guitarist, producer, and film composer. He was indeed a poet who wrote lyrics of hope and profound optimism. He was a philosopher and balladeer of the people seeking social action and commitment to the civil rights struggle of the 1960's.  Curtis Mayfield stood on the mountaintop of American music. As a native of Chicago, he was the architect and builder of what has become known as ``Chicago Soul.'' His roots were purely American--originating in the gospel music of his boyhood church. But the heart and soul of his music reached around the world. At the age of 57, after years of fragile health from a near tragic accident, he died on December 26, 1999, during the waning days of the 20th century. Yet, he gave us four decades of song beginning with the formation of The Impressions in the late 1950's, writing soul hits in the 1960's, composing a provocative and memorable soundtrack for the film ``Superfly'' in the 1970's and recording the Grammy-nominated album ``New World Order'' in the 1990's.  During the 1960's, his music tapped into the consciousness of a generation. With songs like ``It's All Right,'' ``People Get Ready,'' and ``Keep on Pushin','' his call to social action was undeniably clear: he urged us to care about a nation whose great promise was so dear yet woefully denied to people of color and the poor. Wherever people were, wherever they lived, whatever they did, Curtis Mayfield made people think. You could not listen to his songs without being stirred to tears of hope. It was like he knew the soul of America because his music changed us in some way. He lifted our spirits and opened our minds with a sharp-edged social commentary on America in the 1960's.  Whether you listened to his powerful songs in a beauty shop in Harlem or on a sunny afternoon at a midwestern university, without his music, the civil rights movement would have been like a bird without song. Simply, Curtis Mayfield wrote the soundtrack to the civil rights movement. With his songs, he demanded and we accepted his challenge to not rest until we build a new America based on peace and justice.  We are lucky. We are more than lucky to have been touched by the creative genius of Curtis Mayfield. He has fed our hearts and minds with spiritual food. He has moved the feet of a nation toward a better society. He has never left us in spirit because his music still inspires us to remember his optimism, his hope, his sense of righteous indignation, and his abiding faith in a better America.  Another great songwriter and musician, Stevie Wonder, once said of Curtis Mayfield:       For as long as there is romance in love, the joy of pride,      the power of words, the teaching of right, and songs with      haunting melodies there will always be a need for the music      of Mayfield.  As we honor this great American, the legacy of his music is still alive. A new generation of musicians are writing and performing new songs, but they stand on the shoulders of Curtis Mayfield, who created a powerful vision of America through word and song.  Like the men and women before him, who shed blood and tears for a better America, Curtis Mayfield was, above all else, a founder of the New America. His music was inspiring, profoundly creative and courageous. And as a civil rights activist, his contribution to the cause in music will never be forgotten.                          ____________________
