 President, this afternoon I had the privilege of meeting with 37 seventh-grade students from Holy Cross Elementary School in Dover, DE. Talking with these bright and energetic young people on the steps of the Capitol reminded me that I was about their age when I first began to develop an interest in government and consider a career in public service.  While we talked out there on this beautiful spring day, I noticed that I was not alone. A number of my colleagues were similarly engaged with young people from their own States.  Today the Senate passed important legislation on immigration reform, legislation which will have a profound impact upon the communities in which these young people are growing up. And I am glad that the students from Holy Cross had the opportunity to witness some of this important debate. It provides them with the opportunity to learn that what we do here has a real-life effect upon many, many Americans. It reinforces that point that young people, whether they are old enough to vote or not, have a stake in keeping abreast of public affairs, because it is their communities', their States', and their Nation's future that is being shaped by the actions we take here in the Halls of Congress.  It will not be too many years before those seventh-graders are our leading businessmen, teachers, doctors, and even Senators, and I think there are few things we as public officials can do that are as important as spending time with the young people who are the future of this country. I have always said that education is the best investment America can make, and as public servants, I believe we have a responsibility to encourage that investment whenever possible.  Beyond that, I honestly believe that spending time with bright, energetic, and thoughtful young people does us a lot of good. Because I never come away from meeting them without gaining a fresh perspective on some of the important questions and issues which confront us today. My meeting with the students from Holy Cross was no exception, and I am grateful to Ms. Marylou Soltys and Ms. Marie McCann and the 13 parent chaperones for bringing their students to Washington. I hope that they all enjoyed their visit, and benefited from our conversation, as much as I did.  I hope to see the day when they return to Washington as leaders in industry, education, medicine, and government.                          ____________________
