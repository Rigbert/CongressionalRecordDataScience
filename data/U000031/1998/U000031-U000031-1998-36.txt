Speaker, I rise today to recognize a special ceremony being conducted in my district in the town of Baroda. Today, the residents of Baroda are celebrating the issuance of the Organ and Tissue Donation stamp. This stamp has long been of extreme interest to me, and I am pleased to see it finally released today.  Last November, I attended the Dedication ceremony in Washington, DC, and at that time I was given a large, poster-size copy of the stamp. Since that time, I have displayed it in my congressional office, providing all visitors with the powerful message of organ and tissue donation; it gives me great pleasure to know that this message will now be received by the entire country.  Around our State and Nation, recipients of organ and tissue donation can testify to the need for greater public awareness of this issue. Although many lives have already been saved, those life-saving numbers can certainly go up through greater public involvement, education and outreach. The stamp being released today can help greatly in this cause.  I'm pleased that the U.S. Postal Service chose Baroda as the site for one of the ``issuance'' ceremonies given the long-time involvement of Baroda resident Edward Heyn. For many years, Edward Heyn sought to commemorate organ donation with the issuance of a United States postal stamp. Through letters to my office and the Postal Service, he and thousands of other concerned citizens made a compelling case as to the importance of such a stamp. Although Ed passed away 4 years ago, his memory and willingness to help his fellow citizen will endure through endeavors like today's postage stamp.  As many of us know, the need for organs is greater than the supply. Across the Nation, over 60,000 people are waiting for organs, with over 2,000 of those in Michigan. Ed Heyn was fortunate to receive an organ, and he had the vision to realize that with the issuance of a postal stamp the number of donated organs could only increase. Every time someone uses a postal stamp with the ``Share Your Life'' image, they will think of the importance of organ and tissue donation, and perhaps in return they will be more likely to donate themselves.  Therefore, this postal stamp has a message that is two-fold: first to express the true life-giving power of organ and tissue donation, and second to raise awareness of medical issues, in hopes that the number of donations and lives saved per year will increase. It is wonderful to see Edward Heyn's vision manifested today, and it is only fitting to have this ceremony in his hometown where many of his family, friends and neighbors could share in this wonderful experience. One person can make a difference and clearly, Ed made a difference for generations to come.                          ____________________
