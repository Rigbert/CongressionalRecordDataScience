Mr. Speaker, I submit the following for publication in the Record.          COMMITTEE RULES OF PROCEDURE FOR THE 108TH CONGRESS                      (Adopted February 11, 2003)                  Rule 1--Applicability of House Rules       The Rules of the House are the rules of the Committee on      Veterans' Affairs and its subcommittees so far as applicable,      except that a motion to recess from day to day is a      privileged motion in Committees and subcommittees. Each      subcommittee of the Committee is a part of the Committee and      is subject to the authority and direction of the Committee      and to its rules so far as applicable.                Rule 2--Committee Meetings and Hearings                    regular and additional meetings       (a)(1) The regular meeting day for the Committee shall be      at 10 a.m. on the second Wednesday of each month in such      place as the Chairman may designate. However, the Chairman      may dispense with a regular Wednesday meeting of the      Committee.       (2)(A) The Chairman of the Committee may call and convene,      as he considers necessary, additional meetings of the      Committee for the consideration of any bill or resolution      pending before the Committee or for the conduct of other      Committee business. The Committee shall meet for such purpose      pursuant to the call of the Chairman.       (B) The Chairman shall notify each member of the Committee      of the agenda of each regular and additional meeting of the      Committee at least 24 hours before the time of the meeting,      except under circumstances the Chairman determines to be of      an emergency nature. Under such circumstances, the Chairman      shall make an effort to consult the ranking minority member,      or in such member's absence, the next ranking minority party      member of the Committee.                   wireless telephone use prohibited       (b) No person may use a wireless telephone during a      Committee or subcommittee meeting or hearing.                          public announcement       (c)(1) The Chairman, in the case of a hearing to be      conducted by the Committee, and the subcommittee Chairman, in      the case of a hearing to be conducted by a subcommittee,      shall make public announcement of the date, place, and      subject matter of any hearing to be conducted on any measure      or matter at least one week before the commencement of that      hearing unless the Committee or the subcommittee determines      that there is good cause to begin the hearing at an earlier      date. In the latter event, the Chairman or the      subcommittee, Chairman, as the case may be, shall consult      with the ranking minority member and make such public      announcement at the earliest possible date. The clerk of      the Committee shall promptly notify the Daily Clerk of the      Congressional Record and the Committee scheduling service      of the House Information Resources as soon as possible      after such public announcement is made.       (2) Meetings and hearings of the Committee and each of its      subcommittees shall be open to the public unless closed in      accordance with clause 2(g) of House rule XI.                          quorum and rollcalls       (d)(1) A majority of the members of the Committee shall      constitute a quorum for business and a majority of the      members of any subcommittee shall constitute a quorum thereof      for business, except that two members shall constitute a      quorum for the purpose of taking testimony and receiving      evidence.       (2) No measure or recommendation shall be reported to the      House of Representatives unless a majority of the Committee      was actually present.       (3) There shall be kept in writing a record of the      proceedings of the Committee and each of its subcommittees,      including a record of the votes on any question on which, a      recorded vote is demanded. The result of each such record      vote shall be mad available by the Committee for inspection      by the public at reasonable times in the offices of the      Committee. Information so available for public inspection      shall include a description of the amendment, motion, order      or other proposition and the name of each member voting for      and each member voting against such amendment, motion, order,      or proposition, and the names of those members present but      not voting.       (4) A record vote may be demanded by one-fifth of the      members present or, in the apparent absence of a quorum, by      any one member. With respect to any record vote on any motion      to amend or report, the total number of votes cast for and      against, and the names of those members voting for and      against, shall be included in the report of the Committee on      the bill or resolution.       (5) No vote by any member of the Committee or a      subcommittee with respect to any measure or matter may be      cast by proxy.                         postponing proceedings       (e) Committee and subcommittee chairmen may postpone      further proceedings when a record vote is ordered on the      question of approving a measure or matter or on adopting an      amendment, and may resume proceedings within two legislative      days on a postponed question after reasonable notice. When      proceedings resume on a postponed question, notwithstanding      any intervening order for the previous question, an      underlying proposition shall remain subject to further debate      or amendment to the same extent as when the question was      postponed.                  calling and interrogating witnesses       (f)(1) Committee and subcommittee members may question      witnesses only when they have been recognized by the Chairman      of the Committee or subcommittee for that purpose, and only      for a 5-minute period until all members present have had      an opportunity to question a witness. The 5-minute period      for questioning a witness by any one member may be      extended only with the unanimous consent of all members      present. The questioning of witnesses in both Committee      and subcommittee hearings shall be initiated by the      Chairman, followed by the ranking minority party member      and all other members alternating between the majority and      minority. Except as otherwise announced by the Chairman at      the beginning of a hearing, members who are present at the      start of the hearing will be recognized before other      members who arrive after the hearing has begun. In      recognizing members to question witnesses in this fashion,      the Chairman shall take into consideration the ratio of      the majority to minority members present and shall      establish the order of recognition for questioning in such      a manner as not to disadvantage the members of the      majority.       (2) Notwithstanding the provisions of paragraph (1)      regarding the 5-minute rule, the Chairman after consultation      with the ranking minority member may designate an equal      number of members of the Committee or subcommittee majority      and minority party to question a witness for a period not      longer than 30 minutes. In no event shall the Chairman allow      a member to question a witness for an extended period under      this rule until all members present have had the opportunity      to ask questions under the 5-minute rule. The Chairman after      consultation with the ranking minority member may permit      Committee staff for its majority and minority party members      to question a witness for equal specified periods of time.       (3) So far as practicable: (A) each witness who is to      appear before the Committee or a subcommittee shall file with      the clerk of the Committee, at least 48 hours in advance of      the appearance of the witness, a written statement of the      testimony of the witness and shall limit any oral      presentation to a summary of the written statement; and (B)      each witness appearing in a non-governmental capacity shall      include with the written statement of proposed testimony a      curriculum vitae and a disclosure of the amount and source      (by agency and program) of any Federal grant (or subgrant      thereof) or contract (or subcontract thereof) received during      the current fiscal year or either of the two preceding fiscal      years.       (4) When a hearing is conducted by the Committee or a      subcommittee on any measure or matter, the minority party      members on the Committee shall be entitled, upon request to      the Chairman of the majority of those minority members before      the completion of the hearing, to call witnesses selected by      the minority to testify with respect to that measure or      matter during at least one day of the hearing thereon.                     media coverage of proceedings       (g) Any meeting of the Committee or its subcommittees that      is open to the public shall be open to coverage by radio,      television, and still photography in accordance with the      provisions of clause 4 of House rule XI.                               subpoenas       (h) Pursuant to clause 2(m) of House rule XI, a subpoena      may be authorized and issued by the Committee or a      subcommittee in the conduct of any investigation or series of      investigations or activities, only when authorized by a      majority of the members voting, a majority being present.                Rule 3--General Oversight Responsibility       (a) In order to assist the House in:       (1) Its analysis, appraisal, evaluation of (A) the      application, administration, execution, and effectiveness of      the laws enacted by the Congress, or (B) conditions and      circumstances which may indicate the necessity or      desirability of enacting new or additional legislation, and       (2) its formulation, consideration and enactment of such      modifications or changes in those laws, and of such      additional legislation, as may be necessary or appropriate,      the Committee and its various subcommittees, consistent with      their jurisdiction as set forth in Rule 4, shall have      oversight responsibilities as provided in subsection (b).       (b)(1) The Committee and its subcommittees shall review and      study, on a continuing basis, the applications,      administration, execution, and effectiveness of those laws,      or parts of laws, the subject matter of which is within the      jurisdiction of the Committee or subcommittee, and the      organization and operation of the Federal agencies and      entities having responsibilities in or for the administration      and execution thereof, in order to determine whether such      laws and the programs thereunder are being implemented and      carried out in accordance with the intent of the Congress and      whether such programs should be continued, curtailed, or      eliminated.       (2) In addition, the Committee and its subcommittees shall      review and study any conditions or circumstances which may      indicate the necessity or desirability of enacting new or      additional legislation within the jurisdiction of the      Committee or subcommittee (whether or not any bill or      resolution has been introduced with respect thereto), and      shall on continuing basis undertake future research and      forecasting on matters within the jurisdiction of the      Committee or subcommittee.       (3) Not later than February 15 of the first session of a      Congress, the Committee shall meet in open session, with a      quorum present, to adopt its oversight plans for that      Congress for submission to the Committee on House      Administration and the Committee on Government Reform, in      accordance with the provisions of clause 2(d) of House rule      X.                         Rule 4--Subcommittees            establishment and jurisdiction of subcommittees       (a)(1) There shall be three subcommittees of the Committee      as follows:       (A) Subcommittee on Health, which shall have legislative,      oversight and investigative jurisdiction over veterans'      hospitals, medical care, and treatment of veterans.       (B) Subcommittee on Benefits, which shall have legislative,      oversight and investigative jurisdiction over compensation,      general and special pensions of all the wars of the United      States, life insurance issued by the Government on account of      service in the Armed Force, cemeteries of the United States      in which veterans of any war or conflict are or may be      buried, whether in the United States or abroad, except      cemeteries administered by the Secretary of the Interior,      burial benefits, education of veterans, vocational      rehabilitation, veterans' housing programs, readjustment of      servicemen to civilian life, and soldiers' and sailors' civil      relief.       (C) Subcommittee on Oversight and Investigations, which      shall have authority over matters that are referred to the      subcommittee by the Chairman of the full Committee for      investigation and appropriate recommendations. Provided      however, That the operations of the Subcommittee on Oversight      and Investigations shall in no way limit the responsibility      of the other subcommittees on the Committee on Veterans'      Affairs for carrying out their oversight duties. This      subcommittee shall not have legislative jurisdiction and no      bills or resolutions shall be referred to it.       In addition, each subcommittee shall have responsibility      for such other measures or matters as the Chairman refers to      it.       (2) Any vacancy in the membership of a subcommittee shall      not affect the power of the remaining members to execute the      functions of that subcommittee.                       referral to subcommittees       (b)(1) The Chairman of the Committee may refer a measure or      matter, which is within the general responsibility of more      than one of the subcommittees of the Committee, as the      Chairman deems appropriate.       (2) In referring any measure or matter to a subcommittee,      the Chairman of the Committee may specify a date by which the      subcommittee shall report thereon to the Committee.                           powers and duties       (c)(1) Each subcommittee is authorized to meet, hold      hearings, receive evidence, and report to the full Committee      on all matters referred to it or under its jurisdiction.      Subcommittee chairmen shall set dates for hearings and      meetings of their respective subcommittees after consultation      with the Chairman of the Committee and other subcommittee      chairmen with a view toward avoiding simultaneous scheduling      of Committee and subcommittee meetings or hearings whenever      possible.       (2) Whenever a subcommittee has ordered a bill, resolution,      or other matter to be reported to the Committee, the Chairman      of the subcommittee reporting the bill, resolution, or matter      to the full Committee, or any member authorized by the      subcommittee to do so shall notify the Chairman and the      ranking minority party member of the Committee of the      Subcommittee's action.       (3) A member of the Committee who is not a member of a      particular subcommittee may sit with the subcommittee during      any of its meetings and hearings, but shall not have      authority to vote, cannot be counted for a quorum, and cannot      raise a point of order at the meeting or hearing.       (4) Each subcommittee of the Committee shall provide the      Committee with copies of such records of votes taken in the      subcommittee and such other records with respect to the      subcommittee as the Chairman of the Committee deems necessary      for the Committee to comply with all rules and regulations of      the House.                    Rule 5--Transcripts and Records       (a)(1) There shall be a transcript made of each regular and      additional meeting and hearing of the Committee and its      subcommittees. Any such transcript shall be a substantially      verbatim account of remarks actually made during the      proceedings, subject only to technical, grammatical, and      typographical corrections authorized by the person making the      remarks involved.       (2) The Committee shall keep a record of all actions of the      Committee and each of its subcommittees. The record shall      contain all information required by clause 2(e)(1) of House      rule XI and shall be available for public inspection at      reasonable times in the offices of the Committee.       (3) The records of the Committee at the National Archives      and Records Administration shall be made available for public      use in accordance with House rule VII. The Chairman shall      notify the ranking minority member of any decision, pursuant      to clause 3(b)(3) or clause 4(b) of the rule, to withhold a      record otherwise available, and the matter shall be presented      to the Committee for a determination on written request of      any member of the Committee.                          ____________________
