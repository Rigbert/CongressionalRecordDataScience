Speaker, it is with great pleasure and immense respect that I stand before you today to honor one of Northwest Indiana's finest public servants, Commissioner Frances DuPey, and to wish her well upon her upcoming retirement. Commissioner DuPey's many years of dedication and commitment to the residents of Lake County, Indiana, have had a tremendous impact on our community. In honor of Fran's retirement, a reception was held on Sunday, November 11, 2012, at Dynasty Banquets in Hammond, Indiana.  Fran DuPey was raised in Hammond, Indiana, and attended Hammond Technical Vocational High School until relocating to Lamoni, Iowa, where she completed her high school courses. Soon after, Fran returned to Northwest Indiana and enrolled in Hammond Business College.  Fran married her beloved husband, Frank, a Hammond police officer who would later become the Chief of Police, on November 14, 1964. Fran and Frank, who passed away last year, were blessed with one daughter, Veronica, and one son, Frank, as well as three beautiful grandchildren. It was her husband who first introduced Fran to the Democratic Party, and she has been a constant voice for the party in Northwest Indiana ever since. A loyal Democrat, Mrs. DuPey served eleven years as vice chair for the Hammond Democratic Precinct Organization, followed by five years as the Hammond Democratic Chairperson, and she has been a vice-precinct committeewoman for the past thirty years.  Commissioner DuPey's commitment to the people of Northwest Indiana spans far beyond party lines. In 1987, recognized for her tenacity and leadership qualities, Fran was elected to serve on the Lake County Council and served ten years in that capacity. With her election in 1987, then Councilwoman DuPey marked her place in Lake County's history as the first woman to serve on the Lake County Council. Fran, never one to rest on her laurels, was subsequently elected to serve as a Lake County Commissioner, again being the first woman to hold this office in Lake County. Commissioner DuPey, who has served in this capacity for the last sixteen years, also has the distinction of being the first woman to serve as president of both the Lake County Council and the Lake County Board of Commissioners.  During her many years of service, Commissioner DuPey has received numerous awards and acknowledgements for always going above and beyond for her constituents. One of her most notable recognitions came when she was honored as the ``Most Enterprising First Term Commissioner'' in the state of Indiana, an award bestowed upon her by the Indiana Association of County Commissioners. Fran's career will be remembered for her dedication to the people of Northwest Indiana and her always candid, up-front approach to tackling the issues at hand.  Fran DuPey has led a life dedicated to the service of others. I am fortunate to call her a friend.  Mr. Speaker, I respectfully ask that you and my other distinguished colleagues join me in honoring a devoted public servant, Commissioner Frances DuPey. Fran's constant efforts to improve the quality of life for people of Lake County, Indiana, have had an immense impact on her peers and the many citizens whose lives she has touched. It has been an honor to work with Fran throughout the years, and I wish her the best upon her retirement.                          ____________________
