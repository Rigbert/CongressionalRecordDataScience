The real losers are the sickest seniors because what is happening is, because they are more expensive to treat, our home health agencies are turning away some of the more expensive patients because they simply cannot afford to provide them care.  I met recently with a group of very dedicated and highly skilled, compassionate home health nurses from the Visiting Nurse Service in Saco, ME. That is southern Maine's largest independent, not-for-profit home health agency. It performs more than 250,000 home visits per year.  During my discussions with these nurses, I heard absolutely hard-breaking stories of how recent cutbacks and regulatory restrictions have affected both the quality and the availability of home health services.  Let me tell my colleague of just one example the nurses related to me. Consider this case. It involves an elderly Maine woman who suffered from advanced Alzheimer's disease, pneumonia, and hypertension, among many other illnesses. She was bedbound, verbally nonresponsive, and had a series of serious health issues, including serious infections.  This woman had been receiving home health care for approximately 2 years, and that had allowed her condition to stabilize through the care and coordination of a skilled nurse. Unfortunately, the care provided to this patient abruptly came to an end when HCFA'S intermediary sent out a notice denying further home health care for this woman.  That is an example of the kinds of regulatory problems that the Senator was talking about.  Let's look at what happened in this case.  The fact is, it produced a tragedy. Less than 3 months later, this woman died. She died as a result of a wound on her foot that went untreated. Undoubtedly, the home health nurse would have caught that problem before it got out of control.  That is just one of the heart-wrenching stories that I have heard not only during that visit but in discussions with patients and health care providers throughout my State.
