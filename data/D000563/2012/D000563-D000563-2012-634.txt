President, I have been in the House and Senate for a number of years. After a while, we detect certain trends. One of the things I am wary of, having seen over the years the abuses associated with it, are these freight train bills that seem as though they are moving so fast, with big majority support--bills that oftentimes will pass one Chamber or the other and come roaring into the other Chamber and maybe pass too quickly and usually with regret.  At a later point someone stops and reflects and says: We went too far. We didn't read into this all the things that could occur. We should have taken a little more time because at the end of the day a lot of innocent people suffer.  The Senate historically has been the Chamber--I served in the House, but the Senate historically has been the Chamber that has, as George Washington characterized it, been the saucer that cools the tea. As I said, I served in the House of Representatives, and with elections every 2 years, as the Presiding Officer knows, many Members of the House move quickly on issues because here comes another election campaign and Members don't want to miss an opportunity. The Senate, with longer terms and a different set of rules, tries to be more deliberate--sometimes too deliberate, I might add, but at least has that charge under our Constitution.  The reason I am raising this point is we have a bill that is coming over from the House, and the Republican leader has been frantic to bring this bill to the Senate floor. It is characterized by the Republicans as a House jobs bill. It is, in fact, a bill which relates to startups, new businesses, and the regulatory requirements of these businesses. The bill basically exempts a large number of new startup companies from basic regulation.  I have a letter that I ask unanimous consent be printed in the Record, dated March 13 of this year, by Mary Schapiro who is the Chairman of the Securities and Exchange Commission.  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in the Record, as follows:                                           Securities and Exchange                                                   Commission,                                   Washington, DC, March 13, 2012.     Hon. Tim Johnson,     Chairman, Committee on Banking, Housing, and Urban Affairs,          U.S. Senate, Dirksen Senate Office Building, Washington,          DC.     Hon. Richard C. Shelby,     Ranking Member, Committee on Banking, Housing, and Urban          Affairs, U.S. Senate, Russell Senate Office Building,          Washington, DC.       Dear Chairman Johnson and Ranking Member Shelby: Last week,      the House of Representatives passed H.R. 3606, the      ``Jumpstart Our Business Startups Act.'' As the Senate      prepares to debate many of the capital formation initiatives      addressed by H.R. 3606, I wanted to share with you my      concerns on some important aspects of this significant      legislation.       The mission of the Securities and Exchange Commission is      three-fold: protecting investors; maintaining fair, orderly      and efficient markets; and facilitating capital formation.      Cost-effective access to capital for companies of all sizes      plays a critical role in our national economy, and companies      seeking access to capital should not be hindered by      unnecessary or overly burdensome regulations. At the same      time, we must balance our responsibility to facilitate      capital formation with our obligation to protect investors      and our markets. Too often: investors are the target of      fraudulent schemes disguised as investment opportunities. As      you know, if the balance is tipped to the point where      investors are not confident that there are appropriate      protections, investors will lose confidence in our markets.      and capital formation will ultimately be made more difficult      and expensive.       While I recognize that H.R. 3606 is the product of a      bipartisan effort designed to facilitate capital formation      and includes certain promising approaches, I believe that      there are provisions that should be added or modified to      improve investor protections that are worthy of the Senate's      consideration.                 Definition of Emerging Growth Company       The ``IPO On-Ramp'' provisions of H.R. 3606 provide a      number of significant regulatory changes for what are defined      as ``emerging growth companies''. While I share the view that      it is important to reduce the impediments to smaller      businesses conducting initial public offerings in the United      States, the definition of ``emerging growth company'' is so      broad that it would eliminate important protections for      investors in even very large companies, including those with      up to $1 billion in annual revenue. I am concerned that we      lack a clear understanding of the impact that the      legislation's exemptions would have on investor protection. A      lower annual revenue threshold would pose less risk to      investors and would more appropriately focus benefits      provided by the new provisions on those smaller businesses      that are the engine of growth for our economy and whose IPOs      the bill is seeking to encourage.             Changes to Research and Research Analyst Rules       H.R. 3606 also would weaken important protections related      to (1) the relationship between research analysts and      investment bankers within the same financial institution by      eliminating a number of safeguards established after the      research scandals of the dot-com era and (2) the treatment of      research reports prepared by underwriters of IPOs.       H.R. 3606 would remove certain important measures put in      place to enforce a separation between research analysts and      investment bankers who work in the same firm. The rules      requiring this separation were designed     to address inappropriate conflicts of interest and other      objectionable practices--for example, investment bankers      promising potential clients favorable research in return for      lucrative underwriting assignments--which ultimately severely      harmed investor confidence. In addition, H.R. 3606 would      overturn SRO rules that establish mandatory quiet periods      designed to prevent banks from using conflicted research to      reward insiders for selecting the bank as the underwriter. I      am concerned that the changes contained in H.R. 3606 could      foster a return to those practices and cause real and      significant damage to investors.       In addition, the legislation would allow, for the first      time, research reports in connection with an emerging growth      company IPO to be published before, during, and after the IPO      by the underwriter of that IPO without any such reports being      subject to the protections or accountability that currently      apply to offering prospectuses. In essence, research reports      prepared by underwriters in emerging growth company IPOs      would compete with prospectuses for investors' attention, and      investors would not have the full protections of the      securities laws if misled by the research reports.              Disclosure. Accounting and Auditing Matters       H.R. 3606 would allow emerging growth companies to make      scaled disclosures, in an approach similar to that currently      permitted under our rules for smaller reporting companies,      and would provide other relief from specific disclosure      requirements, during the 5-year on-ramp period. While there      is room for reasonable debate about particular exemptions      included in the disclosure on-ramp, on balance I believe      allowing some scaled disclosure for emerging growth companies      could be a reasonable approach.       H.R. 3606, however, also would restrict the independence of      accounting and auditing standard-setting by the Financial      Accounting Standards Board (``FASB'') and the Public Company      Accounting Oversight Board (``PCAOB''). These provisions      undermine independent standard-setting by these expert      boards, and both the FASB and the PCAOB already have the      authority to consider different approaches for different      classes of issuers, if appropriate.       Moreover, H.R. 3606 would exempt emerging growth companies      from an audit of internal controls set forth in Section      404(b) of the Sarbanes Oxley Act during the five-year on-ramp      period. IPO companies already have a two-year on-ramp period      under current SEC rules before such an audit is required. In      addition, the Dodd-Frank Act permanently exempted smaller      public companies (generally those with less than $75 million      in public float) from the audit requirement, which already      covers approximately 60 percent of reporting companies. I      continue to believe that the internal controls audit      requirement put in place after the Enron and other accounting      scandals of the early 2000's has significantly improved the      quality and reliability of financial reporting and provides      important investor protections, and therefore believe this      change is unwarranted.                     ``Test the Waters'' Materials       H.R. 3606 would allow emerging growth companies to ``test      the waters'' to determine whether investors would be      interested in an offering before filing IPO documents with      the Commission. This would allow offering and other materials      to be provided to accredited investors and qualified      institutional buyers before a prospectus--the key disclosure      document in an offering--is available.       There could be real value to permitting these types of pre-     filing communications: it could save companies time and      money, and make it more likely that companies that file for      IPOs can complete them. Indeed, there are some SEC rules that      permit ``test the waters'' activities already. However,      unlike the existing ``test the waters'' provisions, the      provisions of H.R. 3606 would not require companies to file      with the SEC and take responsibility for the materials they      use to solicit investor interest, even after they file for      their IPOs. This would result in uneven information for      investors who see both the ``test the waters'' materials and      the prospectus compared to those who only see the prospectus.      In addition, as with the provisions relating to research      reports, it could result in investors focusing their      attention on the ``test the waters'' materials instead of the      prospectuses, without important investor protections being      applied to those materials.           confidential filing of ipo registration statements       H.R. 3606 would permit emerging growth companies to submit      their registration statements confidentially in draft form      for SEC staff review. This reduction in transparency would      hamper the staff's ability to provide effective reviews,      since the staff benefits in its reviews from the perspectives      and insights that the public provides on IPO filings. It also      could require significant resources for staff review of      offerings that companies are not willing to make public and      then abandon before making a public filing. SEC staff      recently limited the general practice of permitting foreign      issuers to submit IPO registrations in nonpublic draft form      because of these concerns, and expanding that program to all      IPOs could adversely impact the IPO review program.                              Crowdfunding       H.R. 3606 also provides an exemption from Securities Act      registration for ``crowdfunding,'' which would permit      companies to offer and sell, in some cases, up to $2 million      of securities in publicly advertised offerings without      preparing a registration statement. For the past several      months, the staff has been analyzing crowdfunding, among      other capital formation strategies, and also has discussed      these strategies with the Commission's newly created Advisory      Committee on Small and Emerging Companies.       I recognize that proponents of crowdfunding believe this      method of raising money could help small businesses harness      the power of the internet and social media to raise small      amounts of very early stage capital from a large number of      investors. That said, I believe that the crowdfunding      exemption included as part of H.R. 3606 needs additional      safeguards to protect investors from those who may seek to      engage in fraudulent activities. Without adequate      protections, investor confidence in crowdfunding could be      significantly undermined and would not achieve its goal of      helping small businesses.       For example, an important safeguard that could be      considered to better protect investors in crowdfunding      offerings would be to provide for oversight of the industry      professionals that intermediate and facilitate these      offerings. With Commission oversight, these intermediaries      could serve a critical gatekeeper function, running      background checks, facilitating small businesses' provision      of complete and adequate disclosures to investors, and      providing the necessary support for these small businesses.      Commission oversight would further enhance customer      protections by requiring intermediaries to protect investors'      and issuers' funds and securities, for example by requiring      funds and securities to be held at an independent bank or      broker-dealer.       Investors also would benefit from a requirement to provide      certain basic information about companies seeking      crowdfunding investors. H.R. 3606 requires only limited      disclosures about the business investors are funding.      Additional information that would benefit investors should      include a description of the business or the business plan,      financial information, a summary of the risks facing the      business, a description of the voting rights and other rights      of the stock being offered, and ongoing updates on the status      of the business.            Changes to Section 12(g) Registration Thresholds       H.R. 3606 also would change the rules relating to the      thresholds that trigger public reporting by, among other      things, increasing the holder of record threshold that      triggers public reporting for companies and bank holding      companies. The current rules have been in place since 1964,      and since that time there have been profound changes in the      way shareholders hold their securities and in the capital      markets.       Last spring, I asked our staff to comprehensively study a      variety of capital formation-related issues, including the      current thresholds for public reporting. At this point, I do      not have sufficient data or information to assess whether the      thresholds proposed in H.R. 3606 are appropriate. I do      recognize that a different treatment may be appropriate for      community banks that are already subject to an extensive      reporting and regulatory regime.                               rulemaking       H.R. 3606 requires a series of new, significant Commission      rulemakings with time limits that are not achievable. For      example, the rulemaking for the crowdfunding section has a      deadline of 180 days, and it specifically requires the      Commission to consider the costs and benefits of the rules.      Given (1) that much of the data that would be used to perform      such analyses is not readily available and (2) the complexity      of such analyses, this time frame is too short to develop      proposed rules, perform the required analyses, solicit public      comments, review and analyze the public comments, and adopt      final rules. I believe a deadline of 18 months would be more      appropriate for rules of this magnitude.       I stand ready to assist Congress as it addresses these      important issues. Please call me, at (202) 551 2100, or have      your staff call Eric Spitler, Director of the Office of      Legislative and Intergovernmental Affairs, at (202) 551 2010,      should you have any questions or comments.           Sincerely,                                                 Mary L. Schapiro,                                                         Chairman.
