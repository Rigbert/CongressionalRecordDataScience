 President, I thank the Senator. I wish to thank my colleague from Maine. As an original cosponsor of her amendment, I would like to point out two things very quickly.  One, this was an oversight in the first place. It was never intended that this drug should not be covered. And No. 2, it is vitally important to the health and safety of millions of Americans. I think it is a good amendment, and I am glad she is introducing it.
