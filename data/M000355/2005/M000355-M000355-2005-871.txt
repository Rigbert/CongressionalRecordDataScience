 President, I say to my colleague from Vermont, it has been a pleasure working with him over the last, gosh, I guess it is 12 years now, either as chairman or ranking member--we have been here long enough to rotate a couple of times--on this measure. He has made an extraordinarily positive contribution every year.  We labored mightily to keep this bill as bipartisan as possible.
