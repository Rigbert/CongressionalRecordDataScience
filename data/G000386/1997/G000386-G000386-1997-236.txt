 President, the House is in the process of taking steps to alter fundamentally the annual certification process for drugs. In addition, there have been a number of statements in the press and elsewhere by Members of Congress and others on problems with certification. Individuals in the Administration, including the Drug Czar, have also broached the idea of change. I agree that some form of strengthening of the certification process is needed. Indeed, I offered my ``Three Strikes and you're out'' bill last year with the idea of making the certification process tougher. I also suggested some fixes this last February in the debate over Mexico. But I also think that it is important to take a hard look at what the certification process is before we tinker with it.  The recent discussion of the certification process is born out of frustration over the decision on Mexico. I share some of these concerns and the frustration. But the present effort is little more than an attempt to water down congressional oversight of US narcotics policy. It does so in the name of flexibility. It does so/so that we won't be too hard on our international partners. I believe this approach is wrong. And I will vigorously oppose efforts to short change the public's interest in upholding tough standards for certification.  Since much of the discussion in recent weeks on certification is based on a series of myths about it, I think it is useful to review some of these misconceptions.  The principal myth is that the certification process unfairly brands other countries for drug supply problems. It also maintains that this is unfair while the United States does nothing to deal with its demand problem.  There are several things wrong with this view. First, even if the United States did nothing about demand, we have a right and an obligation to do something about supply. This is especially true since most of the dangerous, illegal drugs used in this country are produced overseas. These drugs are then smuggled into the United States, often with the collusion of public officials in other countries.  Our right to stop this flow stems from the fact that we and virtually every other country in the world are signatories of international agreements. These agreements bind us and them to action to stop drug production, trafficking, and money laundering. Moreover, most of these samecountries--including the ones we certify--have made drug production, trafficking, and money laundering illegal under their own laws. And, many of these countries have bilateral agreements with the United States that commit them to take meaningful action against drugs. Thus, countries are bound to act in terms of international law. They are committed to binding agreements with the United States. And they have obligations in terms of their own domestic legal frameworks.  It is neither unfair nor presumptuous for the United States to expect other countries to abide by laws and commitments that they have made. Nor are we being a busybody or arbitrary when we expect and require countries to uphold appropriate international standards of conduct. Indeed, it is only by insisting that such principles of conduct be observed that we have any hope of sustaining respect for and observance of international law. This is understood when it comes to judging other countries on their compliance with a host of other international canons.  After all, we expect countries to observe principles governing human rights, sound environmental practices, fair trade, counterterrorism, and intellectual property rights, to name but a few. The United States has been a leader in promoting respect for these areas of concern.  Congress has passed a host of certification requirements regarding them. In part, this is because we recognize that failure to uphold these principles in the face of willful or negligent disregard is to abandon the idea of standards altogether. And it makes at least as much sense to hold other countries responsible for trafficking in dangerous drugs as it does to scold them for trafficking in pirated CD's.  As I said, we also have an obligation to uphold these standards. Our obligation is to the American people and to the policies we promote in their interest. Protection the citizens of this country from enemies, foreign and domestic, is one of our most important responsibilities. Stopping dangerous drugs coming to this country from abroad falls squarely into this category.  If we are prepared to enforce sanctions for violations of intellectual property rights, it is hardly excessive to judge cooperation by other countries to stop the flow of illegal drugs. After all, not one American has died from Chinese counterfeit CDs. China White heroin, on the other hand, has killed countless of our fellow citizens and ruined the lives of tens of thousands more. This points up our obligation to uphold international standards of conduct.  Somehow, though, when it comes to the drug issue, many seem to believe that expecting good conduct is wrong. They seem to hold to the notion that it is unfair. They act as if it is unkind to expect countries to comply with international law, solemn agreements, and their own legal requirements.  Some seem to believe that it is outrageous that we also take steps to protect our national interest. Now, since many of the people who voice this latter concern are the leaders of drug producing and transit countries, we can take their complaints with a grain of salt. But the domestic critics are a different matter. To them, all I have to say is that it would be irresponsible for the United States to put the concerns and interests of other countries before those of the American people. Period.  As I said, we would be justified in certifying other countries on drug cooperation even if we did nothing at home. But we in fact do a great deal. Out of a $16 billion counter-drug budget, less than 10 percent is spent on actions outside the United States.  Over 90 percent is devoted to domestic programs, many of these efforts to control demand. And this is just at the Federal level. States, local communities, and private organizations spend this much and a great deal more on demand reduction. Thus, we spend annually more than $32 billion to deal with our demand problem. There is not another country in the world that devotes such resources to the problem at home.  I remind my colleagues and the critics of the certification process that the standard for certification is not unconditional success. This is true whether we are talking about Mexico or California. To get a passing grade on drug cooperation does not mean that a country has to have totally eliminated drug production or trafficking, or, for that matter, use.  It requires a good faith effort. The certification law takes into consideration the many problems with stopping drug production and transit. Thus, it is not unexpected that individuals can disagree on the results. It is not a sign of failure if the Congress and the President should disagree. Nor should such disagreements be the occasion for throwing overboard the very process we have for ensuring cooperation. And it does do this. Over the course of the certification process, we have seen more countries take the issue seriously. They do this because they are aware that we take it seriously. We have taught our own administration and other countries that cooperation on drugs is important. To now abandon the chief tool that we have is to run from our responsibilities at the first sign of unpleasantness.  Certification is not perfect. No legislative tool is. We must, however, not expect more than is realistic. The present process clearly indicates Congress' expectation that countries, including our own, will demonstrate serious commitment. That commitment requires more than pious words. It expects action and demonstrable results. Failing that, it is wholly within our right to judge and to take appropriate steps. It is also an obligation.  I yield the floor.                          ____________________
