  We met late last night with the staffs from a number of Republican offices. We believe we are able to talk to them about some issues on which we can possibly agree, but as many Members of the Senate on both sides agree, we cannot compromise on some key safety provisions we believe are essential. We are continuing to talk to Senator McCain, Senator Gramm, and other Senators on the other side who do not want to see provisions in this bill regarding safety.  We will continue to have those discussions up to and including the vote tomorrow, but I tell all of our colleagues I think the provisions in this bill regarding safety are absolutely imperative. I think a majority of the Members of the Senate agree with us. That does not preclude us from talking. We have given our full faith to do that.  We will be meeting with those Members again this afternoon and with the Department of Transportation to see if we can come to some agreements on that, but meanwhile we are ready and willing to work.
