 President, I wish to file the following amendment and give notice to the Senate that pursuant to rule 5, section 1 of the Standing Rules of the Senate, notice is hereby given of the motion to suspend, modify or amend rule 25 for the purpose of implementing the 9/11 Commissions recommendations related to congressional reorganization.  Mr. President, the world changed on September 11, 2001, and those changes have reached far and wide. Today, we in Congress must change the way we perform our critical role of intelligence and homeland security oversight.  Today, the Senate majority leader, the Senate minority leader, Senator Harry Reid, and myself will file an amendment to a Senate Resolution that takes significant strides toward strengthening our oversight of intelligence and homeland security.  We urge Members to join this discourse and offer those changes and improvements that will enhance the domestic security of the United States. We not only expect a vigorous debate but we hope for such a discourse and urge Members to help improve this initial product.                          ____________________
