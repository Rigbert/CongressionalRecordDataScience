Speaker. I rise today to recognize a milestone on the long road of service of the East Toledo Family Center in my District. At this Sunday's annual Renaissance Gala, our community will pay tribute to this achievement. The East Toledo Family Center is an incredible community-building resource. Every year, its dedicated staff and volunteers touch the lives of thousands of citizens of all ages--for recreation, health care, meals, community activities, holiday gatherings and family support. Every neighborhood should be so fortunate as to have such a welcoming, caring, and effective community center. The East Toledo Family Center surely is the heart of East Toledo.  Nearly 110 years ago, according to the Center's historical records, on Sunday, August 4th, 1901, Rev. H.W. Hoover held a tent meeting on factory grounds owned by D.J. Nysewander in East Toledo. A list survives of those who contributed towards the ``interest on loan, sidewalks, hymn books, lights and piano tuning'' for this first Industrial Heights Mission Contributors included such well known East side names as Metzger, Rideout, Tracy, and Hirzel. The Mission lasted for several days and was enlarged into ``settlement work'' to help the many new immigrants in the area become adjusted to life in America.  A Baptist minister from Ontario, Canada, Rev. Hoover was just past the age of 40 when he began his mission work in Toledo's East Side. His efforts resulted in the formation of the Neighborhood House, where he spent the remaining years of his life until his passing at the age of 72. By the summer of 1902, property was obtained on Vinal Street, and adjoining lots were soon added through the generosity of East Toledoans Alexander Black, George Metzger, Isaac Gerson, and Mr. Nysewander.  The Center records its early years as the land on Vinal Street near East Broadway, which was originally a neglected dump, was quickly improved. Dirt from the streets was used as fill, grass was sown, East Side florists provided flowers, the Monroe Nurseries gave shrubs and the old dump was transformed. The Ohio Neighborhood Institute, commonly called the Neighborhood House, was incorporated and the property at 1019 and 1027 Vinal Street developed rapidly. M.J. Riggs, superintendent of the American Bridge Company in East Toledo, helped purchase playground equipment along with paint, fencing, and ornamental gates and posts.  A depression in 1908 led to what some families called the ``slim winter.'' When no assistance was available to help the many families who were out of work, Mrs. Hoover and East Side businessmen stepped in to provide food and aid through the Neighborhood House. During the years of World War I there was a need for classes in English for both children and adults as more and more immigrants came to work in the factories of America. Before Oakdale School opened, school classes were held at the Neighborhood House for small children of various grades.  By 1916 the Neighborhood House had a large playground. It featured a merry-go-round, basket swing, May pole and an enormous sand box. A ``Sunshine House'' donated by Dorothy Kimball was used to help children learn how to keep house. Tea parties were held to teach the children ``proper manners'' when entertaining and of course there were sports of all kinds, including boxing matches.  Attendance records from 1916 show just how important the work of the Neighborhood House was to the community. The Vinal Street playground was used by five thousand children that year and almost thirty-five hundred people attended American Citizenship classes. Over two thousand people came to other lectures while a ``School of Conduct'' attracted nearly twenty-seven hundred people. A satellite ministry of the Neighborhood House, the Ironville Neighborhood Settlement, called Lincoln Place, had seventy-eight hundred participants during 1916. For the year, 28,766 people were involved in all the activities of this important East Side ministry.  The importance of the Neighborhood House to the community is apparent by the number of companies and individuals who contributed to its support. A list of hundreds of donors includes the names of some of Toledo's most prominent citizens. Here can be found the names Ernest Tiedtke, Thomas DeVilbiss, Edward Ford, General Sherwood, Mr. Walbridge, Mr. Detwiler and Mr. LaSalle, along with such East Side names as Winchester, Hoeflinger, Eggleston, Gardner and Tucker. Edward Drummond Libbey was also an important early benefactor.  By 1927 there were three buildings on the Vinal Street property. During the dark days of the Great Depression the bad times began to take their toll on the working class families of East Toledo and the Neighborhood House lost its founder when the Rev. Hoover passed away in early 1932. An article by Isabel Toppin of the East Side Sun family records that ``now many are losing the houses they tried hard to maintain.'' she continues ``the streams of little wagons and push carts headed for the city's dole measures the depression into which we have fallen.'' It would be during these times that the Neighborhood House would be needed all the more. Ms. Toppin goes on to say ``In the midst of the general unhappiness, the Neighborhood House has striven to relieve the drab hopelessness of the situation.'' During these hard times the Neighborhood House was often a last resort for people.  Volunteers would bring in clothing, a baker would send surplus stock and mothers, as it was recorded, would ``accomplish wonders with a yard of goods and a button. The Neighborhood House became a clearing house for the needs of the community and the human spirit would not be extinguished by these hard times. By the 1940's as the economic times began to improve and the Neighborhood House continued to provide a place for people of all ages in the community to grow and become better citizens and better Americans.  The Neighborhood House kept growing following the post-World War II boom years until a new building was needed in the early 1970's. The Center stood as a bulwark through neighborhood changes in the 1980s and 1990s and adapted to the changing needs of East Side residents. Now as the 21st century progresses and it is into its twelfth decade of service, The East Toledo Family Center serves more people and provides more services than at any other time in its long history. Tradition has been maintained even as services develop and grow so that efforts continue to be directed toward providing educational, economic, social and recreational opportunities for working class families and children.  Through more than a century of careful stewardship, the leaders of the East Toledo Family Center have carried forth the vision of Rev. Hoover and the founding members. It remains a beacon of light, shining on into a new century of service.                          ____________________
