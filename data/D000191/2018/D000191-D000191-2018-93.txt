Chairman, I yield myself such time as I may consume.  These amendments, en bloc, have been reviewed, both by the majority and the minority, and there is consensus on their merit. I urge my colleagues to support them.  Before I yield to the gentleman from Texas (Mr. Doggett), I would say first that I strongly support his amendment and tried to work with the former FAA Administrator to rectify this issue that led to this extraordinary and unnecessary loss of life.  Mr. Chairman, I yield such time as he may consume to the gentleman from Texas (Mr. Doggett).
