President, I don't want to interfere with the Senator. I see quite a few pages of remarks there. I don't want to interfere with that, but I understood the Senator from Virginia and the Senator from Arkansas were going to introduce legislation, to be followed by remarks of mine on the bill before us in my capacity as the ranking member of the Senate Judiciary Committee, which has jurisdiction over this piece of legislation. My remarks will only be 5 or 6 minutes, but I wish to make them now or as soon as the Senators from Virginia and Arkansas have finished.
