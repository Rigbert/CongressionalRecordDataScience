Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.  Mr. Speaker, I think the chairman has articulated the issue very well. I explained it as well. The reason this motion is being offered at this time, however, is fairly straightforward.  The reason is that we had this debate in July. That is now some 2 months ago, 60 days ago. We were told that this matter was going to be resolved and that agencies would have appropriately the expectation they would have sufficient resources to meet this challenge.  I tell my friend that this is not solved. The Senate has tried to solve it, but we have not solved it on this side, and we are 60 days later, some 2\1/2\ weeks or 3 weeks with I guess about 12 legislative days left in this session supposedly, at least until we adjourn subject, perhaps, to the call of the Chair. We are only a few short legislative days from adjournment.  This matter must be resolved. We must address it. The Committee on Appropriations, the gentleman's subcommittee, Mr. Speaker, and the full committee recommended that we resolve it in exactly the way that the Senate has proposed. Exactly. It is my understanding the Republican leadership, the chairman of our committee and our subcommittee took this action. This is exactly what we proposed.  Now I say to my friend, the gentleman from Arizona, A, I appreciate his allowing us to move forward on this issue, but B, that it is time for us to ensure that this objective is accomplished. If it is not, the losers will be the American public, and the reason we have offered this motion is because contrary to the intention that I think was a good-faith intention expressed by the majority leader on the floor that this would be resolved before the August break, it was not, and we must resolve it.  I would hope the Members of this House, therefore, would approve this motion and that in committee and in conference, Mr. Speaker, we could exceed to the Senate position, which is, I believe, the responsible position to meet this emergency.                              {time}  1045  Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.
