President, I rise today to pay tribute to an exceptional officer of the United States Army, Lieutenant Colonel John D. Wason, upon his retirement after more than 20 years of distinguished service.  Throughout his career, Lieutenant Colonel Wason has personified the Army values of duty, integrity, and selfless service across the many missions the Army provides in defense of our Nation. During his time as--a Congressional Legislative Liaison Officer in the office of the Secretary of the Army, many of us on Capitol Hill have enjoyed the opportunity to work with Lieutenant Colonel Wason on a wide variety of Army issues and programs, and it is my privilege to recognize his many accomplishments. I commend his superb service to the U.S. Army and this great Nation.  Lieutenant Colonel John D. Wason was commissioned as a Second Lieutenant, Field Artillery, after graduating from California State University-Sacramento in 1985. His first assignment was as a Company Fire Support Officer, Battery Fire Direction Officer, and Battery Executive Officer for the 3rd Battalion, 19th Field Artillery, 5th Infantry Division at Ft. Polk, LA from 1985 to 1989. He commanded B Battery, 5th Battalion, 3rd Field Artillery in the Federal Republic of Germany from 1990 to 1992. Following his assignment in Germany, LTC Wason spent 28 months as a Recruiting Company Commander in Northern California from 1992 to 1994. In 1994, LTC Wason was selected as a member of the Army Acquisition workforce. From 1994 to 2001 LTC Wason served in a variety of Army Acquisition positions at White Sands Missile Range, NM and Picatinny Arsenal, NJ working on major Army weapons programs such as the Army Tactical Missiles System, Crusader, and the LW 155 Artillery system.  In 2001, LTC Wason was selected as a Department of Defense Congressional Fellow. His selection was followed by a 1 year assignment working on my personal staff. Following his Fellowship, LTC Wason served in Programs Division, Office of the Chief of Legislative Liaison. Lieutenant Colonel Wason maintained a constant liaison with Professional Staff Members of the Senate and House Armed Services Committees on issues relating to Army Procurement programs focusing on Army Aviation, Weapons and Tracked Combat Vehicles.  Throughout these varied and demanding assignments, Lieutenant Colonel Wason provided outstanding leadership, advice, and sound professional judgment on numerous critical issues of enduring importance to both the Army and Congress. John's counsel and support were invaluable to Army leaders and Members of Congress as they considered the impact of their decisions on these important issues.  On behalf of Congress and the United States of America, I thank Colonel Wason, his wife Betsy, and his entire family for the commitment, sacrifices, and contribution that they have made throughout his honorable military service. I congratulate Lieutenant Colonel John Wason on completing an exceptional and extremely successful career, and wish him blessings and success in all his future endeavors.                          ____________________
