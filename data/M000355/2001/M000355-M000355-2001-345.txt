 President, I would like to refer to an article by David Tell which recently appeared in the March 26, 2001 edition of The Weekly Standard entitled ``Shut Up, They Explained.'' In it, Mr. Tell explains the tenth amendment problems that would result from McCain-Feingold's federalization of State and local campaign activities, and he notes the first amendment problems with the bill's restrictions on outside groups. This article begins:       This week and next, the U.S. Senate will consider      amendments to a piece of omnibus campaign finance reform      legislation--and then approve or reject the result by a      majority vote.                           *   *   *   *   *       The substantive pretext for a soft-money prohibition has      always been deeply flawed. To pay for an expensive campaign      of nationwide image advertising, the 1996 Clinton-Gore      reelection effort organized an unprecedented harvest of soft-     money contributions to the Democratic National committee.      Eventually publicized, the scheme became infamous for its      abuses, responsibility for which the Democratic party was      thereafter eager to evade. The problem, they told us over and      over, was bipartisan: ``the system.'' And McCain-Feingold was      the reform that would make it go away. Except that all the      misdeeds charged to Clinton and Gore in 1996 were illegal      under existing law. And it was the irrationality of a      previous ``reform''--the suffocating donation and expenditure      limits imposed on publicly financed presidential campaigns--     that inspired those misdeeds in the first place. Soft money      per se had nothing to do with it.                           *   *   *   *   *       The Democratic and Republican parties exist to do more than      elect members of the House and Senate. They are national      organizations with major responsibilities, financial and      otherwise, to state and local affiliates that act on behalf      of candidates for literally thousands of non-federal      offices--in campaigns conducted according to non-federal      laws, most of which still permit direct party contributions      by businesses and unions. The McCain-Feingold soft-money ban      would criminalize those contributions by requiring that      virtually all state-party expenditures, during any election      in which even a single candidate for federal office appears      on the ballot, be made with money raised in strictly limited      increments, and only from individual donors. By unilaterally      federalizing all American electioneering practices, in other      words, the McCain-Feingold bill would violate our      Constitution's Tenth Amendment.       Even so stalwart a Democratic interest group as the AFL-CIO      has lately adopted some form of this argument. Since it      happens to be true, it would be nice to hear it echoed more      broadly.       As it would be nice to hear more widespread warnings about      a still more pernicious feature of the McCain-Feingold bill      as presently constituted: its harsh assault on independent      political activity by business, union, and non-profit issue      groups. Some sympathy is certainly due to congressmen and      senators who find themselves, late in a reelection campaign,      subjected to a televised barrage of soft-money-funded      criticism from such groups. Constrained by hard-money rules,      most incumbents are never able to respond at equal volume.      Nevertheless, this problem, real as it is, cannot possibly      justify the elaborate and draconian restrictions McCain-     Feingold seeks to impose on private citizens who might so      dare to criticize their elected officials: rules about whom      the critics are allowed to consult or hire before they open      their mouths in public, for example, and other rules about      what they can say, and with whose money, when they do.       An unbroken, quarter-century-long line of Supreme Court      jurisprudence makes clear: Under the First Amendment, all      this stuff is unconstitutional.  Mr. President, I would like to refer to an article from November 15, 1999 from The New Republic written by Professor John Mueller entitled ``Well Off. Good riddance, McCain-Feingold.'' In it, Professor Mueller notes that the influence of ``special interests'' in the democratic process is not ``a perversion of democracy,'' but ``it's the whole point of it.'' He also notes that ``campaign finance reform'' will not be able to stifle the special interests; if certain forms of political speech are suppressed, citizens groups will simply use other methods.  The article begins:       Once upon a time, carping about campaign finance abuse was      mainly the province of Democrats.                           *   *   *   *   *       But it is the defenders of money in politics, the ones so      widely reviled in the elite press, who speak the truth about      campaign finance reform. In a democratic system of      government, there will always be some inequality of      influence. Yet that is not necessarily a flaw, and it is      rarely as debilitating to good government as reformers would      have you believe. When you dig beneath the rhetoric of      campaign finance reform, you discover that the ``reforms''      being proposed would, in practice, constitute anything but an      improvement.       The essential complaint of reformers is that the present      system gives too much influence to so-called special interest      groups. This is also the most popular complaint. Who, after      all, supports special interests? Actually, we all should.      Democracy is distinguished from autocracy not as much by the      freedom of individual speech--many authoritarian governments      effectively allow individuals to petition for redress of      grievances and to complain to one another, which is some-     times called ``freedom of conversation''--as by the fact that      democracies allow people to organize in order to pursue their      political interests. So the undisciplined, chaotic, and      essentially unequal interplay of special interest groups that      reformers decry is not a perversion of democracy--it's the      whole point of it.       Nor is campaign finance reform likely to subdue special      interests. People and groups who seek to influence public      policy do so not for their own enjoyment but because they      really care about certain issues and programs. If reformers      somehow manage to reduce the impact of such groups in      election campaigns, these groups are very likely to find      other ways to seek favor and redress, no matter how clever      the laws that seek to inconvenience them are. For example, if      Congress prohibited soft money donations to political      parties--which is what the ill-fated McCain-Feingold bill      promised to do--special interests would merely spend more      money on their own advertising and get-out-the-vote efforts,      which are known in the political business as ``independent      expenditures.''                           *   *   *   *   *       What makes the philosophy of campaign finance reform so      ironic is that the laws have such a poor track record of      rooting out the alleged abuses they are intended to      eliminate. In fact, many of the ills reformers now seek to      address are the byproducts of earlier attempts to clean up      the system.                           *   *   *   *   *       Reformers of all stripes argue that political campaigns      cost too much. But the real question is, compared with what?      The entire cost of the 1996 elections was about 25 percent of      what Procter & Gamble routinely spends each year to market      its products. In what sense is this amount too much? Some      people do weary of the constant barrage of advertising at      election time, but democracy leaves them entirely free to      flip to another channel, the same method used so effectively      by anyone who would rather not learn about the purported      virtues of Crest toothpaste.       There is also the related gripe that the ever-increasing      need for donations means that politicians spend too much of      their time raising money. But much of this problem arises      from the absurdly low limit the reformers have placed on      direct campaign contributions. If anything, rather than      restricting soft money (as the McCain-Feingold bill would      have), it's time to raise or eliminate altogether the $1,000      limit on individual contributions to candidates. Politicians      seem to find it politically incorrect to advocate this      sensible change, even though it would probably reduce the      amount of time they spend campaigning or campaign funds.      Getting rid of special interest influence by other means--     say, by regulating independent groups' expenditures--would      only work if reformers successfully dispensed with the right      to free speech. Since the advocacy of special interests is      the very stuff of the democratic process, the unintended goal      of the campaign reformers ultimately seems to be the repeal      of democracy itself.  Mr. President, I would like to refer to an excerpt from an article by Washington Post columnist David Broderthat ran on February 21 of this year entitled ``Campaign Reform: Labor Turns Leery.'' In it, Mr. Broder notes that Big Labor has echoed my concerns about the unconstitutionality of the McCain-Feingold bill. Specifically, Mr. Broder writes that:       Last week the AFL-CIO, which in the past had endorsed a ban      on soft money contributions, announced that it has serious      misgivings about other provisions of the McCain-Feingold      bill. Limiting ``issue ads'' that criticize candidates by      name--even if not calling specifically for their defeat--in      the period before an election would inhibit its ability to      communicate freely with union members, the memo said. Other      sections would make it impossible for labor to coordinate its      voter-turnout efforts with those candidates it supports. None      of these concerns is trivial. But they point up some of the      very same constitutional objections Mr. McConnell and other      opponents--including a variety of conservative groups and,      yes, the American Civil Liberties Union--have made for years.  Lastly, Mr. President, I would like to refer to another article by Professor Kathleen Sullivan, professor of constitutional law and dean of Stanford Law School. This article is entitled ``Sleazy Ads? Or Flawed Rules?'' and appeared on March 8, 2000 in the New York Times. In this article, Professor Sullivan notes the controversy that surrounded the running of television ads last year by supporters of then-candidate George W. Bush. She explains why the real problem with today's campaign finance system is the quarter-century-old contribution limits, and that real reform would be to raise these limits, bringing them into the 21st century. Specifically, Professor Sullivan notes:       Many have professed to be shocked, shocked that recent      television commercials attacking Senator John McCain's      environmental record turned out to be placed by Sam Wyly, a      wealthy Texas investor who has been a strong supporter of      Gov. George W. Bush.       Predictably, many have called for more campaign finance      reform to stop such stealth politics, and Senator McCain      filed a formal complaint on Monday with the Federal Election      Commission, alleging that the ads, though purportedly      independent, were in reality a contribution to the Bush      campaign that exceeded federal contribution limits.       Such calls for greater regulation of campaign donations,      however, ignore the real culprit in the story: the campaign      finance laws we already have. Why, after all, would any Bush      supporter go the trouble of running independent ads rather      than donating the money directly to the Bush campaign? And      why label the ads as paid for by Republicans for Clean Air,      rather than Friends of George W. Bush?       The answer is the contribution limits that Congress imposed      in the wake of Watergate and that the Supreme Court has      upheld ever since. The court held that the First Amendment      forbids limits on political expenditures by candidates or      their independent supporters, but upheld limits on the amount      anyone may contribute to a political campaign.       The result: political money tries to find a way not to look      like a contribution to a political campaign. Unregulated      money to the parties--so-called soft money--and deceptive      independent ads are the unintended consequence of campaign      finance reform itself.       This result is not only unintended but undemocratic.      Contribution limits drive political money away from the      candidates, who are accountable to the people at the voting      booth toward the parties and independent organizations, which      are not.       If Governor Bush places sleazy ads misleading the voters      about Senator McCain's record on clean air, voters can      express their outrage through their votes. No similar      retribution can be visited on private billionaires who decide      to place ads themselves.       The answer is not to enlist the election commission to      sniff out any possible ``coordination'' between the      advertisers and the official campaign, or to calculate      whether the ads implicitly supported Mr. Bush.       It is unseemly in a democracy for government bureaucrats to      police the degrees of separation between politicians and      their supporters. And it is contrary to free-speech      principles for unelected censors to decide when an      advertisement might actually incite voters to vote. What      else, after all, is political speech supposed to do?       The solution is simple: removal of contribution limits,      full disclosure and more speech. If it had been clear from      the outset that the dirty ads on dirty air had come from Mr.      Wyly, a principal bankroller of the Bush campaign, the voters      could have discounted them immediately--with vigorous help      from the vigilant press and the McCain campaign. A      requirement that political ads state their sources clearly is      far less offensive to free-speech principles than a rule that      the ad may not run at all.       Better yet, the removal of contribution limits would      eliminate the need for stealth advertising in the first      place. If Mr.. Wyly could have given the money he spent on      the television spots directly to the Bush campaign, the      campaign alone would have been held responsible for any      misleading information that might have been put out. And such      accountability would have made it less likely that such ads      would have run at all.       As it turned out, Senator McCain was able to use the Wyly      commercials to attack Governor Bush's campaign tactics. So,      in the end, who gained more from the flap? All Mr. McCain      really needed to preserve his competitive edge was the First      Amendment, which protects his right to swing freely in the      political ring. The people are far more discerning than      campaign finance reformers often give then credit for; they      can sift out the truth from the cacophony.
