 The resolution would basically restore us to the moment in time before the Citizens United decision and before the McCutcheon Supreme Court decision which would allow the Federal Government and the States to regulate campaign spending. It is content neutral in terms of the efforts to be made by the government but reestablishes new standards in terms of contributions in spending across America.  I ask the Senate majority leader, who has followed this closely, as he has followed the amount of money being spent on elections in this country, what he can foresee as the ultimate result if we fail to undo the Citizens United decision?
