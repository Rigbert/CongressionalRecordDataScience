Speaker, it is with great honor and esteem that I wish to congratulate Mr. Michael Lopez for being selected as the East Chicagoan of the Year. For thirteen years, the Twin City Community Services in East Chicago, Indiana has awarded prominent members of the community with this title. This year's activity will be held on Thursday, April 25 at the Knights of Columbus Hall in East Chicago. During this prestigious event, his family and friends will participate in a roast held in his honor.  As a child growing up in East Chicago, Mickey Lopez, as he is affectionately known to his friends and family, understood that if he were armed with patience and determination, he would overcome all obstacles as he ventured on the path to success. After graduating from Washington High School, Mickey left the confines of the Harbor to attend Indiana University in Bloomington. While on campus, a patriotic spirit awakened within him, and he sought an outlet for its release. Selflessly setting aside his own aspirations so that his natural leadership abilities could serve a greater good, Mickey enlisted into the United States Marine Corps, where he served as a sergeant for over three years. The ideals of discipline, honor, and loyalty that he presently upholds were fomented during these years as he fulfilled his duty to his country.  Having completed his commitment to the Marine Corps, Mickey returned to East Chicago, eager to establish himself among the business leaders of the city. His years spent at the Laidlow and Industrial Disposal companies became the foundation from which his entrepreneurial spirit flourished. Ever conscious of the relationship between industry and community, Mickey keenly observed the growing need for an industrial and environmental cleaning organization in East Chicago that would serve both the Northwest Indiana and Chicago steel mills. Bolstered by his ambition, he approached his childhood friend John Hurubean, and together in 1980, the two partners opened Actin, Inc. Now more than twenty years later, from this small seed has sprouted many other services spanning different types of business throughout Northwest Indiana and the Chicagoland area. In spite of the vast area the company covers, the business is still intimate and family oriented, employing roughly 100 people. More impressive, however, is Mickey's commitment to extending his success to underrepresented individuals in the business world, 85 percent of his employee base are minorities.  Under the leadership of Mickey Lopez, Actin Inc. continues to provide a valuable service to the residents and businesses of Northwest Indiana. Yet his devotion to his fellow East Chicagoans is not limited to this particular enterprise. His philanthropic nature extend to various civic organizations in his native city. Among those touched by his generosity and his tireless efforts are the Northwest Indiana Business Development Commission, the Saint Catherine's Hospital Foundation, the East Chicago School Foundation, Twin City Community Services, the Lake Shore Chamber of Commerce, and the Lake Area United Way. He is one of the founders of American Legion Post 508 and most recently he was asked to participate in the newly developed High Tech Business Incubator sponsored by Purdue University. These organizations, as well as various minority organizations, reciprocate in kind--their gratitude is evident as they bestow upon him and Actin, Inc. awards commending his service to the community and to his field of expertise. As always, Mickey accepts these accolades with a deep sense of humility.  The Knights of Columbus Hall will be filled with individuals who have been blessed with the opportunity to enjoy Mickey's quick wit, his friendly winks, and his warm, inviting smile. Perhaps the most fortunate are his sister Cathy and his six children--Laura, Michael, Melissa, Chris, Mark, and Eric--all of whom have been able to glean from him an appreciation for all the opportunities life has to offer, and a respect for the delicate relationship forged as one interacts with the greater human family. The next generation of Lopezes, which currently includes ten beautiful grandchildren, will undoubtedly embrace these virtues as they continue to uphold Mickey's tradition of civic mindedness.  Mr. Speaker, I ask that you and my other distinguished colleagues join me in congratulating Mr. Michael Lopez on being recognized as the East Chicagoan of the Year. His commitment and dedication to the citizens of the First Congressional District deems him worthy of this commendation. I wish him continued success, both personally and professionally, and I am honored to represent him in Congress.                          ____________________
