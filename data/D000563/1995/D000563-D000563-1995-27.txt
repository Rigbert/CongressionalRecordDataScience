Speaker, it was good fortune in life as a college student to go to work for U.S. Senator Paul Douglas of Illinois, a man who literally wrote the book on ethics and government.  He had a gift policy in the early 1960's, where he would not accept a gift of value more than $2.50. He ended up retuning almost everything. Sometimes it created embarrassment and a stir, but it was a standard that he lived by and people respected him for that.  Mr. Speaker, I am going to support this bipartisan effort. It holds Members of Congress to a higher standard, and we should be held to that standard. I have personally established a gift ban in my office and it has been in place for quite some time. This disclosure and the gift-ban provisions here are consistent with that, and I think a good measure for this House to follow. I am sorry it has taken us this long to bring this matter before us.  Mr. Speaker, having said that, now that we have established ourselves a higher standard for Members of Congress, let me suggest that we are in the midst of a governmental crisis where we are holding Members of Congress to a lower standard. I make reference to the bill I introduced, H.R. 1221, ``No budget, no pay.''  We sent home 800,000 Federal employees without pay while Members of Congress still receive their paychecks. We have said to those widows and dependents of veterans, ``You may not get a check December 1, but your Congressman will.'' We have said to our staff people, ``You may not get a check for your services, but your Congressman will.''  Frankly, I think this is an outrage. Members of Congress have basically created a political crisis which could be solved in a heartbeat. I frankly think if we turned off the TV cameras and the machines printing congressional checks, this crisis would be over in 15 minutes.
