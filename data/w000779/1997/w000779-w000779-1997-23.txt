At the end of a session when there is a rush to complete the business is when this practice which, as the majority leader points out, is a long tradition, that is when this practice is abused. I think the majority leader makes a very good point with respect to the need for courtesy and respect for traditions.  I see our friend, Senator Grassley, is here. This is a bipartisan amendment. We share the majority leader's view with respect to this tradition. We are not seeking to eliminate the hold, seeking to eliminate the filibuster, seeking the right of Senators to work matters out. What we are concerned about is secrecy. At a time when the American people are so skeptical about our Government, when they go to hearings and day after day look at practices that they question, when they look at the U.S. Senate and see these procedures that are secret, it smacks of a backroom deal.  I think the majority leader is right, the Senate is a good institution. It is not going to suffer if a bit of sunlight comes in. This is an institution strong enough to have a bit of sunlight and to have Members held accountable. I don't want to disrupt the tradition of the Senate, but if an important health or environmental measure or other important issue is held up for months on end because a Senator genuinely objects, then it is not just a matter of courtesy, it is a matter of being accountable to the American people.  I will interpret the majority leader's response to this colloquy as willing to work with the Wyden-Grassley effort, and I appreciate the fact that it is going to pass today. I know the majority leader has other matters that he has to attend to. I want to thank him for his colloquy and look forward to working with him.  I yield the time now to the Senator from Iowa, Senator Grassley.  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Brownback). The Senator from Iowa.
