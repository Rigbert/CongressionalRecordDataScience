 President, I know the Senator from Texas wishes to speak. I will only be a minute.  I ask unanimous consent that at 2 p.m. today the Senate proceed to vote in relation to the DeMint amendment No. 11, to be followed by a vote in relation to amendment No. 13, regardless of the outcome of the vote with respect to amendment No. 11; that there be 2 minutes of debate equally divided before the first vote and between the votes; further, that at 12:30 p.m. today, Senator Byrd be recognized to speak for up to 25 minutes, and that Senator Kyl then be recognized for up to 15 minutes; and that no second-degree amendments be in order to either amendment prior to the vote. Senator DeMint would have up to 45 minutes under his control.
