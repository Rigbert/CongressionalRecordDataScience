The Clerk read as follows:                               H.R. 1787       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of      the United States of America in Congress assembled,     SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.       This Act may be cited as the ``Good Samaritan Volunteer      Firefighter Assistance Act of 2004''.     SEC. 2.

(b) Exceptions.--Subsection (a) does not apply to a person      if--       (1) the person's act or omission proximately causing the      injury, damage, loss, or death constitutes gross negligence      or intentional misconduct; or       (2) the person is the manufacturer of the fire control or      fire rescue equipment.       (c) Preemption.--This Act preempts the laws of any State to      the extent that such laws are inconsistent with this Act,      except that notwithstanding subsection (b) this Act shall not      preempt any State law that provides additional protection      from liability for a person who donates fire control or fire      rescue equipment to a volunteer fire company.       (d) Definitions.--In this section:       (1) Person.--The term ``person'' includes any governmental      or other entity.
