 It is happening. Let us not be naive about this. What is going on now is the standard of living of the average American worker is in serious decline. The gap between the rich and the poor is growing wider. The control of the political parties is growing sharper by the very wealthy.  Ultimately, I think as a nation, we have to ask ourselves how much is enough? When does it end? How much do they want: 209 times more than the workers, 500 times more than their workers? Will we hear a movement here to bring back slavery? When does it end?  We have people in this country, in my State, that are not working one job, they are working two jobs and three jobs, as the gentleman from Michigan said. I have met a husband and wife who hardly ever see each other. They are both working three part-time jobs. When does it end?  This is a wealthy country. This is a great country. But we need policy so that we redevelop our manufacturing sector; we create decent paying jobs in this country. With all of the new technology, the working hours should go down, should they not? With all these new machines, people should be producing more.
