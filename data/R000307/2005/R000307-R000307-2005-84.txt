I am concerned about us talking about intercepts and all of this that I went through in the letter on the Senate floor. I am concerned about many things that have been talked about publicly, quite frankly, leaks that appeared in the press that I find out about later as chairman and have to address. I cannot speak to them because they are classified. It is the classic case of Catch-22, where something appears in the press or perhaps somebody says something on the floor inadvertently--if it is done on purpose, that is another matter. That can be referred to the Ethics Committee--and that certainly is not the case in terms of my distinguished colleague. Then comes sort of a feeding frenzy and we end up with things that should not be in the public discourse that are highly classified, highly compartmented. Signals intelligence is one of the highest compartmented topics we deal with.
