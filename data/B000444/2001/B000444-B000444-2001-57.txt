 I know my good friend, the majority leader, was asked this morning about comments the Senator from Delaware allegedly made speaking to the New York Council on Foreign Relations, which surprised me the question was asked.  I was informed that a high-ranking Republican on the House side put out a statement--and I am sure he did not understand the context--suggesting I implied Americans were high-tech bullies who were bombing Afghanis, and we should be fighting on the ground and not bombing.  I want to assure my friend from South Dakota, in his response to the question, he was correct. I did not say anything like that. I will read from the transcript from the New York Council on Foreign Relations speech.  I was asked by a gentleman, whose name I will not put in the--well, his name is Ron Paul, whom I do not know, who says: I concur with everybody else in commending you on your comments, and he goes on.  Then he says: With regard to the bombing, every day it goes on the harder it may be for us to do something next, referring to rebuilding Afghanistan. He said: What do you see as the situation if we do not defeat the Taliban in the next 4 weeks and winter sets in in Afghanistan?  The context of the question was, Is it not a hard decision for the President to have to choose between bombing, knowing it will be unfairly used for propaganda purposes by radical Muslims in that area of the world, and bombing to make the environment more hospitable for American forces to be able to be successful on the ground?  I said it was a hard decision. The question was repeated, and my answer was: I am not a military man--I will read this in part.       The part that I think flies in the face of and plays into      every stereotypical criticism of us----  Referring to the radical Muslims, that part of the world that is radical----       is we're this high-tech bully that thinks from the air we      can do whatever we want to do, and it builds the case for      those who want to make the case against us that all we're      doing is indiscriminately bombing innocents, which is not the      truth.  So I want the majority leader to know, and I am sure when the gentleman on the House side sees the comments, he will be able to put it in the proper perspective because the irony is anyone who has been in the Senate knows I was the first, most consistent, and the last calling for the United States to bomb in Bosnia, bomb in Kosovo, use the full force of our air power.  I have been around long enough to know unless someone stands up and clarifies something, it can get out of hand very quickly.  I thank my colleague for his response this morning to the press and for his faith in his chairman of the Foreign Relations Committee. I assure him, in this case at least, it was well placed.  I ask unanimous consent that my entire speech--which I would not ordinarily do because it is my own speech--to the Council on Foreign Relations be printed in the Record, along with the question and answers that follow.  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in the Record, as follows:   [Remarks By Joseph R. Biden, Jr., United States Senator--Delaware]  From Tragedy to Opportunity: Acting Wisely in a time of Uncertainty  (Council on Foreign Relations, New York City, October 22, 2001, (As                                Prepared))       When I accepted this invitation I expected to be talking      about the ABM treaty, about our military priorities in the      context of an evaporating budget surplus, or about missile      defense versus the more urgent threats we could face--and      now, in fact, do face.       I thought the questions I might be asked would be about      strategic doctrine, about relations with traditional      adversaries like Russia and China, and whether the Yankees      will win another World Series.       I certainly did not, for one instance, think we'd be here      today wondering about our short-and long-term goals in a war      against terrorism: Will we succeed? How long will it take?      What constitutes victory?       But those are, in fact, the questions facing the United      States, and, I confess, they're not easy to answer.       First, our immediate goal is to cut off the head of Al      Qaeda, break up the network, leave them no safe haven. That      means the removal of Osama bin Laden, Mullah Omar, and the      Taliban leadership.       I don't know how long it will be before the regime is      toppled. I wouldn't want to guess. But the handwriting is on      the wall. They've lost the support of their key sponsors and      are essentially isolated. But some of these sponsors may need      reminding that they've got to make a clear break with the      past, and we should not hesitate to spell that out.       After Al Qaeda and the Taliban fall, and--to use the phrase      of the day--we drain the swamp, the medium-term goal is to      roll up all Al Qaeda cells around the world.       Then, with the help of other nations and possibly with the      ultimate sanction of the United Nations, our hope is we'll      see a relatively stable government in Afghanistan--one that      does not harbor terrorists, is acceptable to the major      players in the region, represents the ethnic make up of the      country, and provides a foundation for future reconstruction.       In the long term, our goals are easy to articulate, but      much more difficult to achieve.       We'll need to deter any potential state sponsors of      terrorism from providing support or haven to future bin      Ladens.       We'll work with others and try to help rebuild a      politically and socially stable Afghanistan that does NOT      export terrorism, narcotics, or militancy to its neighbors      and to the wider world--more like it was in the 1950s.       We'll need to stabilize Southwest and Central Asia and      prevent the Taliban-izing, if you will, of Pakistan and other      countries.       And we'll need to address some of the economic and      political forces that can be manipulated by men like bin      Laden. We must do this with the full awareness that attention      to social and political development alone won't prevent      another bin Laden from emerging. But, at least, it will      severely limit the pool from which he can draw recruits and      support.       If we're successful in prosecuting this effort in      Afghanistan, it ups the ante for other nations harboring or      sponsoring--directly or indirectly--other terrorist groups.       The President believes, and I agree, that we must stay      involved in the region, not necessarily with American troops,      but with American leadership, and resources.       The President has repeated many times, and it's important      that we say it over and over again: This is not a war against      the Afghan people or any one faith. This is a war between      nation states and transnational terrorist organizations,      between civilization and chaos.       We need to remind the world's 1.2 billion Muslims--the vast      majority of whom are sickened by the attempted hijacking of      their faith--that our beef is with bin Laden and Al Qaeda,      not with them.       American policy has long been marked by a blend of the      Wilsonian trend and realpolitik, but whatever our motive, it      has not been guided by religious imperatives.       When we sought to bring peace and stability to the Balkans,      the Muslims in Bosnia and Kosovo were the primary      beneficiaries.       When we went into Somalia, our aim was to feed starving      people who happen to be Muslims.       And, when we provided 170 million dollars in humanitarian      assistance to the Afghan     people in the last year, it had to do with our principles,      and the people there were Muslim, too.       Unfortunately, we're doing a terrible job of disseminating      information. We have to take a fresh look at public diplomacy      and determine the most effective ways we can get out our      message.       But I'm under no illusions. Winning the hearts and minds of      ordinary citizens in the Islamic world is an uphill battle,      but one we must undertake.       We must enhance the means we use as well as the message--     whether it's people to people visits that explain our      principled respect for the diversity of all faiths and      cultures--or radio and television broadcasts that inform and      ultimately empower moderate Muslim voices.       What we cannot do is let the Taliban wage the same      propaganda war Saddam waged in Iraq, with photographs of      mothers and children scrambling for food and endless footage      of destroyed buildings--all designed to portray America as      anti-Islam. That's a bald-faced lie.       Regardless of whether we succeed in getting our message      out, the truth is, we CANNOT and we certainly WILL not walk      away from seven million displaced and desperate Afghans      surviving on little more than grass and locusts.       We must do more to help the Afghan people, and we must do      FAR more to make our aid visible across the Muslim world.       I'm reluctant to use the word ``nation building'' because      it's such a loaded political term--but, if we leave      Afghanistan in chaos, it'll be another time bomb waiting to      explode. And there's an enormous powder keg right next door      in Pakistan.       If we think we have a problem now, imagine a nation with      six times the population of Afghanistan, a nuclear arsenal,      and a Talibanized government.       To avoid that scenario, we have to work with the World      Bank, the IMF, the U.N., other NGOs and our allies,      especially those in the region, to help build an      infrastructure in Afghanistan that works.       United Nations Secretary General Kofi Annan said it will      take nearly $600 million just to get the Afghan refugees      through the winter. But that's only the beginning.       In the long term, Afghanistan will need to find a way to      break the hold that the madrassas have had on a generation of      young men.       They will need to educate a generation of young women, to      give them the tools necessary to seize the rights so cruelly      denied them under Taliban rule.       They'll need to de-mine the most heavily mined nation in      the world.       They'll need crop substitution programs to rid themselves      of the title of the world's foremost producers of heroin and      opium.       They'll need wells, water purification centers, hospitals,      village clinics, even simple roads from one town to the next.       I commend the President for promising $320 million in      Afghan aid. In my opinion, this might be the best investment      we could make. I say this notwithstanding the many obstacles      to achieving these goals that exist in a region that has not      proved fertile for incubating democratic institutions.      Clearly, we can't do it alone.       As demonstrated since September 11th, it's even more      obvious, at least to me, that our national interests can't be      furthered, let alone achieved--in splendid indifference to      the rest of the world.       Our interests are furthered when we meet our international      obligations, keep our treaties, and engage the world.       Far from the black and white of campaigns and up against      the gray of governing, it's much easier to see the virtues of      multi-nationalism and the shortcomings of unilateralism.       The same tools we used to build this coalition may, in the      long term, help change the dynamics of bilateral relations,      and present real and unexpected opportunities to define this      new century.       And by the way, the Administration has figured it out.       Where the Administration may have once been tempted to see      only strategic differences with China over national missile      defense and Taiwan, today there's a growing recognition that      we have common strategic interests as well--like fighting      terrorism and maintaining peace and stability in Central      Asia.       Where the Administration may have once seen relations with      Russia through the prism of the Cold-War, today there's the      promise of entering into a fundamentally different      relationship with the Russian Federation.       Where the Administration may have once viewed relations      with Iran within the confines of a twenty-year time warp,      today Iran has signaled a desire to at least explore a      relationship based on newly defined common interests. They've      even said they would assist in search and rescue operations      of any downed American pilots.       Clearly there's an internal rift in Iran. The reformists      would like to go further. All they could get through the      system was this modest gesture. But because the system      operates on consensus, I'm virtually certain Khamene'i      approves, which is significant in itself.       Let's not be under any illusion that there will be full      blown rapprochement with China, Russia, and Iran. But if we      do this right, if we look at our adversaries in a new light,      there will be much to build off in the future.       This weekend the President was in Shanghai for the Asia      Pacific Economic Cooperation Summit. He met with China's      leaders, who now see more clearly than ever the threat posed      to them by the proliferation of nuclear, chemical,      biological, and ballistic missile technology.       I guarantee that Jiang Zemin can imagine a plane crashing      into an 80 story office tower in Shanghai. I expect that      China's leaders will never think of their nuclear and      ballistic missile exports to Pakistan in quite the same way.       Working with China against terrorism, however, does not      mean jettisoning our concerns about China's human rights      record, or overlooking proliferation. In fact, we may need to      remind China's leaders that respect for the human rights and      religious liberty of China's Muslim minorities is not only      morally right, but also essential if we are to deprive the      terrorists of recruits.       In Russia, President Putin has emerged as a strategic      thinker who realizes that, in order for Russia to advance      into the ranks of highly developed nations, he must cast his      lot with the West.       Putin recently said ``Today we must firmly declare: the      Cold War is over.'' And with respect to our efforts in      Afghanistan, he said ``I have no doubt that the U.S.      leadership and President Bush will do their best so that the      peaceful population does not suffer, and they are already      doing their best.''       Putin is willing to confront entrenched, reactionary      domestic opposition when necessary. He overruled his senior      military, and gave the green light for American planes to      overfly Russian territory and to permit troops on former      Soviet territory in Central Asia, actions virtually      unimaginable not long ago.       We have a genuine opportunity to pursue a new relationship      with Russia, and we should. If the news out of Shanghai this      weekend is accurate, it may well be possible to reach      agreement on mutually limiting offensive capabilities and      allowing Tests of missile defense systems. I hope the      President will resist those in his Administration who would      have him risk squandering this opportunity by withdrawing      unilaterally from the ABM treaty.       I've always said: nations, like people, use crises to      resolve differences, or create opportunities.       In the case of Russia, we have a momentous opportunity. It      may well be possible to deal not only with strategic forces,      but also with NATO enlargement and our non-proliferation      concerns.       That new relationship could shape this half-century as the      Cold-War shaped the last.       Three days ago, Secretary Powell said in Shanghai, ``Not      only is the Cold War over, the post-Cold War period is also      over.''       If the Administration proceeds pragmatically, rather than      ideologically, the new era could be good, indeed.       But let's remember that Russia is not the only country that      matters in developing a new strategic doctrine. We must take      care not to provoke a major Chinese arms build-up, which      could lead to more nuclear arms in India and Pakistan. We      need the help of both in the war on terrorism. And nobody      needs more nuclear weapons along a border that is already      getting too hot for comfort.       The time is right to consider joint efforts to reduce      strategic arms; commit to a joint program to combat      terrorism; develop a bilateral plan to prevent other      countries or terrorists from gaining weapons of mass      destruction; find ways to counter infectious disease      epidemics and clean up the residue left by our weapons      programs. And we should do everything we can to help Russia      stay on a path of economic and political growth and      stability.       Once the foundation of cooperation is firmly established,      we can pursue missile defense--if that's what we want--     without rocking the boat of strategic stability.       Look, in the long-term--even if the coalition breaks down--     we'll have the potential opportunity to create a new day of      enhanced bilateral relations with China, Russia, and maybe      even with Iran.       So, in the short term we want to eliminate bin Laden and      his top aides and remove Mullah Omar and the Taliban      leadership.       In the medium term, we'll need to establish a relatively      stable regime in Afghanistan and roll up Al Qaeda cells      around the world.       And in the long-term, we have to deter state sponsorship of      future bin Ladens, help rebuild Afghanistan, and stabilize      Southwest and Central Asia.       What will be much more difficult, will be to clearly      identify and address some of the root causes of this hard-     core, hate-driven zealotry so we can limit the pool from      which another bin Laden can draw recruits.       The list of root causes is long--from the lack of      legitimate channels of dissent in the Arab world, to      desperation, resentment at American material success, a      perception that our actions don't match our ideals.       All of these issues are worthy of our attention, but they      can never be excuses for terrorism.       Which brings us to Israel. Let me just say, Israel did not      produce bin Laden, and we can't let Israel be the scapegoat.       We are in a tough stage right now, and there are many      cross-winds buffeting our relationship, but our friendship      with Israel is not a transitory event, a marriage of      convenience, or a short-term alliance.       Differences are normal even among friends, but airing them      in public is never useful. Surely there are sufficient      channels to communicate our views. Let us not create any     false impressions about the fundamental, long-term basis upon      which the U.S.-Israel relationship rests: we continue to be      bound by unshakable, shared democratic values.       After all this, the question remains--what constitutes      victory in the war on terrorism?       If we cut off the head of Al Qaeda, help to rebuild a      stable Afghanistan, and if, in the process, we find a way to      stabilize the relationship between Pakistan and India, and      enhance bilateral relations with China, Russia, and Iran,      then we have achieved a victory that may well define the 21st      century.       In sum, just as we could not have put together a viable      coalition if President Bush had already walked away from the      ABM treaty, so too will we have trouble nurturing future      bilateral relations if we decide, when the crisis is over, to      go it alone, again.       We should be figuring out right now how we revive the      Comprehensive Test Ban Treaty (CTBT), the Biological Weapons      Treaty, move on arms control proposals that go to Start III,      environmental treaties, and how to amend--and not jettison--     the ABM Treaty.       Before I take some questions let me leave you with these      final thoughts. On September 11th the world changed for the      terrorists. It was, I believe the beginning of the end of a      way of life, not for America, but for international      terrorism.       Out of our dark grief our nation is newly united and abroad      we have new opportunities.       As my mother says, ``Out of every tragedy, if you look hard      enough, you can find one good thing.''       Or, in the words of another great Irish poet, Seamus      Heaney:     ``History says, don't hope     On this side of the grave.     But then, once in a lifetime     The longed-for tidal wave     Of justice can rise up,     And hope and history rhyme.''       I truly believe, notwithstanding incredible difficulties we      face in doing even half the things I mentioned here, that      we're on the verge, if we do it right, of making hope and      history rhyme. But we cannot squander this opportunity. I      believe the President has made a genuine transition in his      thinking on foreign policy. I hope I am not kidding myself.      If he has, I think not only will he go down as a great      President, I think we will have marked the beginning of a new      era in international relations.                                  ____       The following transcript of the Question and Answer period      has been provided by the Council on Foreign Relations. The      moderator is former Congressman Vin Weber.       VW: Thank you. It's my job to screen questions for the      Senator without trying to get too much between the questioner      and the answer. Under the rules of these engagements, when I      call on you will you please stand up and state your      affiliation, and try to state your question as concisely as      possible. To get things going, though, I'm going to take the      prerogative of the Chair and ask the first question.       Senator, you talked at some length about some possibilities      in terms of relationships around Russia and other places.      Talk about a place where there might be some strains, the      American people at least are being fed a significant diet of      negative information about our relationship with the Saudi's      and their relationship to terrorism over these past many      years. Is there a deeper problem there than we thought, and      how should the American people and the government think about      that relationship?       JB: I've been admonished to make the answers very, very      brief, so I will make them brief, if you want me to expand I      will attempt to do that. Number one, I do not doubt the      pressure that the Saudis are under, like other Arab states in      the region, having to essentially buy off their extreme      groups in order to maintain themselves. But the Saudis have      gone above and beyond the call in destabilizing the region,      in my view, in terms of essentially funding a significant      portion of what we are now dealing with in the extreme      example of Islam gone awry. It's one thing to decide you're      going to export Wahhabi Sunnism, by setting up Madrassas      around the region. Okay, I get that. But what I don't get is      setting them up where they have a third feature: that they're      a hate-filled, anti-American breeding ground.       I think we should have a very simple, straightforward      discussion with the Saudis and they should understand that      they have a hell of a lot more to lose in the break up of the      relationship than we do. That is taking a great risk. I am      not sanguine about the fact that we get 1.6 million barrels      of oil a day from there, but I would be prepared, were I the      Secretary of State, or I was in another position, to tell the      Saudis: Don't push it. Don't push it. Cease and desist on      this activity. There will be consequences. At any rate,      that's my view.       SR: I'm Steve Robert of Robert Capital Management. As I      listened carefully to your address, which I thought was very      good, it seems the center of gravity in the debate over      missile defense has changed. Because while the opponents of      missile defense prior to September 11th would have just      probably said it's a foolish idea and the wrong priority,      what you seem to be saying is that, it's almost inevitable if      we also cut nuclear arms stockpiles, renegotiate the arms      control treaty and the strategic arms treaty and so forth. So      is this in fact what you mean to communicate, that we're now      just talking about how we get to missile defense, as opposed      to whether we should have missile defense at all?       JB: What I'm suggesting is, and it's a very good question,      what I'm suggesting is, we should be prepared to explore,      assuming we can amend the ABM Treaty to do the exploration,      whether or not a viable missile defense system is feasible      without starting a new arms race, and without producing an      economic hemorrhage of a half a trillion dollars with little      return on our investment.       Right now we're caught between the rock and the hard place.      In order to go forward, according to this administration--and      I think they're inaccurate--but the gentleman sitting behind      you has forgotten more about this issue than I am going to      know. But in order for them to go forward with the testing      program they have in mind, they can do it without having to      violate the ABM Treaty. But it has become sort of religious      doctrine on the right that the ABM Treaty is, per se, bad.      I'm hopeful that we're at a place now, where the President,      if we in fact--and I happen to support significant further      reductions in all offensive capability--if we get the Joint      chiefs to agree upon a number significantly below where we      are, I'm willing to go along with an amendment of the ABM      Treaty, assuming that we have scrubbed this in a way that we      understand what the likely response in China will be to such      a system.       If in fact, notwithstanding the fact that the Russians      would agree, this will start a significant--and our      intelligence agencies publish widely, and I can only tell you      what was in the paper, only confirm . . . I won't confirm,      I'll state what's in the paper--that they will do ten times      as much as they would have otherwise done in offensive      capability if we build such a system. If we cannot get      through that wicket, then it seems to me it is not worth a      candle. The cost is not worth it, and the consequence of      going forward with the limited benefit that would flow from      it may very well start that arms race which I worry most      about in the most dangeorus part of the world. It was      dangerous before, and it's considerably more dangerous now.       So I cannot fathom India sitting by if China rapidly racks      up their nuclear capability, and I cannot figure Pakistan      doing the same, and so I see it as a disaster. But this is a      beginning step, and I guess the polite way of saying this,      I'm happy the President seems to be moving in the direction      where he may not unilaterally walk away from the ABM Treaty.      That's a big deal.       VW: I want to go to Rita next, but if there are other      questions on either strategic defense or the ABM Treaty, I'll      take them now, before we leave that topic. If not, we'll go      to Rita.       RH: Rita Hauser. You didn't mention Iraq. Do you see Iraq      in the second stage as a target for the terrorists counter-     offensive, and what is your view on the continuation of our      policy of sanctions?       JB: I happen to think that the sanctions policy needs to be      changed. The Secretary of State has discussed a smarter      sanctions policy. I thought he was going in the right      direction, I was hoping that it would be embraced, although I      now think there's an opportunity to embrace it because the      dynamics have changed in Moscow, and the dynamics have      changed in France, and the dynamics have changed in China      somewhat, and I would further explore going back to that      approach, that is, a smart sanctions policy.       I'm of a view that what has changed has all been bad from a      Iraq standpoint, for the Iraqis. The idea now that we are      going to just disregard what Saddam has done, walk away and      just seek economic opportuinty, as some of our friends and      allies have done, I think is being reconsidered in those very      capitols. Rather than have a second phase, the way in which      the press uses it, and I assume you're talking about, that      is, after we finish with Afghanistan, do we invade Iraq? I      think that is not the prudent approach. I think what we      attempt to do is to build a coalition, reconstruct a      coalition that is tighter and stronger and with more demands      placed upon the behavior of Iraq.       My view is, if we're able to do that, and the behavior is      still as bad as it has been in the past, you will be able to      much more likely generate a consensus on at least standing by      as we took action, or having multilateral action. But to just      go from here to there I think would be a disastrous mistaken      in the near term.       VW: Go back to that table. I'm going to try to move the      audience as best I can.       FW: Frank Wisner from the American International Group. The      current crisis . . . (Overlap)       JB: Why are you taking folks out of Delaware? We want to      talk about that . . . (Laughter) . . . I want to know this,      Mr. Ambassasdor, this a parochial, this a serious stuff.      (Laugher) I'm only joking . . . (Overlap)       FW: . . . we have commitment . . . (Overlap)       JB: . . . I just want to kind of throw you off. (Laughter)       VW: . . . He's not really joking. (Laughter)       JB: . . . Former Congressman, I can tell you, I'm worried      about it, but . . .       FW: Senator, coming back to the subject of your terrific      speech today, (Laughter) . . .       JB: It went from good to terrific. (Laughter)       FW: This crisis has brought to light other tensions, and      among them has been the sparking of tension between India and      Pakistan, with very heavy Indian shelling, acts of     terror in Kashmir. As you look at that aspect of the      challenge to American diplomacy, what message do you have to      the parties in the region, how they can get on top of the      problem they have and the role the United States can play?       JB: Let me answer it in reverse order. The role of the      United States. The United States should stay engaged the way      the Secretary has gotten engaged in the last week. It's made      a difference already. I think there has to be a clear      understanding, both in Delhi and Islamabad that we are      interested, we are looking and we are watching.       Secondly, I think a message should be delivered very      strongly to the Indians, do not attempt to take advantage of      the circumstances this moment, it's against your interests      across the board. And thirdly, we have to make clear to the      Pakistanis that, notwithstanding the fact we need you very      much right now, you are in a position where if you are going      to continue to foment the terror that does exist in Kashmir,      then you are operating against your own near term interests,      because that very viper can turn on you. And I think we have      to talk and talk and talk and talk, and engage and engage and      engage. Because as you well know, part of the cry on the part      of India has been, just somebody pay attention . . . or      excuse me, in Pakistan, someone pay attention.       And on India, we don't want any part of anybody being      involved and looking at any of this problem. The truth of the      matter is, the whole world is looking at their problem now in      Kashmir, not just us, the spotlight is on and the      consequences for how they will be treated relative to all      other nations in the world is very much up in the air right      now, and they should be made constantly aware of how tenuous      the circumstance is for both of them. In this case,      particularly India . . . in my view, particularly India.       VW: Can I follow up on that myself? Because at the      beginning of this administration, the administration seemed      to be tilting, to use a term, toward India, the Indian      Foreign Minister was given a meeting with the President, and      it seemed as if the administration was going to try to, as      one of the cornerstones of their foreign policy, build a much      better relationship with India than we've had in the past. In      view of what you just said, do you think that that was then,      and this is now, or is there still an opportunity going      forward to forge a much closer relationship with the Indians?       JB: I think that was then, and it's almost still that way      now. (Scattered Laughter) And let me explain what I mean by      that. I may be mistaken, and I may be a bit cynical, but I      think the initial, quote, tilt toward India was related to      Beijing more than it was to Pakistan or anything else. And I      think that the relationship with Beijing was going south very      rapidly. And continued to move south in a precipitous way      until Powell made his visit.       I coincidentally happened to take a small delegation of      Senators to some very high level meetings for six days in      China, just on the heels of that visit, and you could      literally see, maybe a mild exaggeration, a sigh of relief on      the part of the Chinese, that maybe this collision is not      inevitable, it is not inevitable. I think it chastened the      Chinese a little bit, I think it made them focus on the      precipice, as well as us.       Now what's happened is, I think, you have, and it's a . . .      I cannot prove this, I think what you have in India now is a      look north and saying, whoa, it looks like these guys are      talking again. We may have moved past our opportunity to make      a substantial change in the relationship. That would be a      mistake on their part, to think that. Because I think that      there is a desire in the administration to actually,      genuinely better relations with India. I think it is an      absolute essential element of American foreign policy that      that be done. And part of that is simply engaging . . .      engaging them and treating them like what they are. They      will, in not too long, be the largest, most populous nation      in the world. They are a democracy, as flawed as you may      think it is. They are someone with whom we should and must      have a much, much, much better relationship and      understanding.       And the whole world has changed for India. It has changed      not only when the Wall came down, and when their protector      evaporated, it changed now as the relationship with China      begins to mature, and they're going to have some great      difficulty internally figuring out how to deal with that. But      we should be engaged at the highest level on a daily basis,      literally with India. So I don't think the administration is      jettisoning India, but I think they're beginning to look at      India in a different way, not as cynically as just a card to      have been played against Beijing.       VW: Questioner behind Frank, then I'm going to try to go      the back of the room for a question.       ME: Monsoor Ejaz. Senator, it's always good to hear you      speak so frankly, so I'm going to try and get you on the      record on another sensitive issue. Does the United States      need a military policy to deal with an eventuality in which a      Taliban-like force would hold control over Pakistan's nuclear      weapons? And if it does, what should that policy look like?       JB: Well, I think we're engaged in that policy right now.      And I have every reason to believe from my conversations with      the President, and I don't pretend to be his confidant, I      don't want anyone . . . I know you all know that, but the CNN      audience might think I'm trying to foist myself off as the      President's close advisor. I've been flattered the President      has engaged me as the opposition and as Chairman of the      Foreign Relations Committee, and we've had, as they say, full      and frank discussion, probably five, six hours worth in the      last several months, and . . . but my impression and my      understanding is, coming from both the Secretary of State as      well as the Secretary of Defense and as well as the President      of the United States personally, that that is the essence of      their policy at the moment.       It is reflected in certain ways. You see, and I'll be very      parochial, and I'm going to give you a specific example.      Right now there has been, and continues to exist, a real      dissatisfaction on the part of the Northern Alliance that we      have not done, which is fully without our capability to do      now, and that is with air power, essentially provide air      cover that could decimate the Taliban capability of holding      them back, not only from Mazar i Sharif, but also holding      them back from the capitol.       And the President has not been as blunt as I'm going to be,      because I don't speak for him, so I can say it, I believe the      President's actions have been somewhat circumspect for very      good reasons. He understands that if in fact the Northern      Alliance marches into Kabul and sets up a government, that we      will have the potential for a disintegration in Islamabad,      and that Pakistan may very well, and Musharraf may in fact      collapse, it may be gone.       And so I think that . . . I'll give you that as one example      of my view of the President's understanding of how difficult      this is. We have also done things which were not particularly      comfortable for me to do, quite frankly. I'm the guy, as      Chairman of the Foreign Relations Committee, that was      responsible for either facilitating and/or proposing the      lifting of all the sanctions, of which I have supported      relative proliferation, not to proliferation questions, as      well as democratization. And we've even looked at Section      508, and so my point is that we have taken extraordinary      actions, which is sort of against our instincts, with only      the promise, only the promise of elections a year from      now, with the commitment to be kept, and only the hope,      the hope that we will be able to stabilize, that the      region will, with our help and others, be stabilized in      such a way that we don't have to face that God awful      specter of radical Islamic groups taking over a country      that is multiple sizes larger than Afghanistan, with      nuclear weapons.       So I think the administration is fully appraised, fully      understands, and is doing everything within its power,      understanding, and I don't . . . in defense of the      administration, no one has a hole card here. No one that I      know, maybe some of you do, and if you do, let me know      because I want to nominate you for the Nobel Peace Prize in      advance. No one I know has a surefire way to assure that      stability in this part of the world will result from the      actions undertaken. Conversely, I don't know of anyone who .      . . I do know of some, I don't know anyone in this room would      like to suggest we should not and need not have taken the      action we are taking. We're not going to get into the weeds      here. It's going to start to get . . . we talked, and I hope      I don't offend anybody saying this, at our table here, we      talked about how long the honymoon, how long the      unquestioning period of unabashed support for the President's      policy will continue. I think everyone . . . I shouldn't say      everyone . . . I mean the vast majority of the foreign policy      establishment, of the Democratic and Republican sides of the      aisle, in fact share the view that up to now the President's      done a pretty darn good job of assembling this multilateral      force, resisting what were very strong entree's from parts of      the administration to bypass Afghanistan and go straight to      Iraq, et cetera. I think he's done well. But now we're going      to get into the tough calls.       Case in point, and I'll stop with this. How much longer      does the bombing continue? Because we're going to pay every      single hour, every single day it continues, we're going to      pay an escalating price in the Muslim world. We're going to      pay an escalating price in the region. And that in fact is      going to make the aftermath of our, quote, victory more      difficult to reconstruct the region. Conversely, the      President's in a very difficult spot. How much does he have      to do to make the environment in which we are going to send,      and we will, American forces, hospitable to the extent . . .)       (Council on Foreign Relations tape turned to side B . . .      several seconds missing . . .)       . . . tell you, though, I hope to God it ends sooner rather      than later, becasue every moment it goes on, it makes the      aftermath problem more severe than it is . . . was an hour      ago. And so that's what I mean when I say they're fully      appraised of their problem. They are going to engage in      activities that we may . . . I may be able to Monday morning      quarterback and second guess, but I know of no clear path      that suggests how they secure the notion that there is no      possibility of Pakistan degenerating into chaos, and us      dealing with a problem there. The ultimate answer would be,      if that were the case, we would find ourselves with a whole      hell of a lot more forces in that region than we have now,      which would be a very bad idea.       VW: Going to go right straight to the back of the room, and      then I have a question at the middle table up front.       DG: I'm Davey Gaw(?), with the conference board. Senator,      you gave us a picture that was historic, and it raised the      question in my mind, to this effect. Is there an advertising      problem, is there a genuine insoluble intellectual issue, or      simply have we not solved the following? It seems to me that      for the past 50 years or so, the U.S. has always been stuck      in a corner, on the one hand we launch into the world with      noble causes, and then we tie ourselves to ignoble regimes so      that we have (Inaudible) for purposes, but people think that      we're married to these regimes, and the same thing is      occuring now in the Middle East. What's wrong? Why can't we      do a dual track strategy? Why can't we send a message that's      credible, that we do serve double purposes on the one end,      but we also do not want to marry ignoble regimes on the      other? Why can't we solve that issue?       JB: Because life's tough (Scattered Laughter) There are      hard choices. I don't know. I don't want to get him      in trouble, but I suspect Les Gelb may remember, about a      dozen years ago, my proposing we start to distance      ourselves from some of those various regimes, and for      example, during the Gulf War, one of the reasons I voted      against the resolution that was put forward was, I did not      get any commitment from the administration personally that      they would in fact make sure that when we freed Kuwait,      the circumstance in Kuwait would change. I did not see      merely putting the Emir back in power as anything that      inured to our great benefit. The territorial principle of      not crossing a border was a big deal, and important and      oil mattered, but it seemed to me we should have extracted      in return for that some commitment toward the movement      toward, some movement toward, not outright democracy, but      some movement toward a liberalization of the system.       I have been the odd man out on that for a long time with      regard to Saudi Arabia as well, and other countries in the      region. But I acknowledge to you, it is incredibly difficult      to do. And you got to be prepared to take a risk, and the      risk is serious. The down side is high. The costs      economically are severe. But I think we're at the point now      where we have to take those risks. But it's not easy. It is      not easy because the truth of the matter is, we inherited      what was there, we helped make and sustained what was there,      but we did it for reasons relating to our immediate self      interests that were of consequence to us, enabling us to do      other things in other parts of the world that were necessary      to be done.       So, it's, yes, as a former President once said, life ain't      fair. Well, the world ain't fair, and we're left with a lot      of Hobson's Choices. If I can elaborate on one piece. This      dissemination of information, I put together a proposal that      I've been discussing with the administration. I've been sort      of the guy who has, and a lot of you have as well, but I mean      in the Senate, in the House, I've been sort of the godfather      of the radios lately, Radio Free Europe, Radio Liberty, the      Voice of America, et cetera. It's woefully underfunded. For      example, in the largest Muslim state in the world, where they      have 220 million people, we spend two million dollars on the      radio, for example. So I put together a proposal at the      President's urging, quite frankly, because one of the things      I discussed with him, that I'm going to present to him when      he gets back, is over a half a billion dollar initial      investment, 250 million dollars a year, for public diplomacy,      and fundamentally altering the way in which we're able to      broadcast to that part of the world. As part of this, I asked      my staff, and I have some very talented staff people who know      the region well, have worked in the region, and are very      academically qualified as well as practically qualified, if      they would get together some two or three or four of the most      knowledgeable folks on Islam in the world, so that we in      fact, when I propose this, I was doing something that was      counterproductive. So that we wouldn't find we were causing      more problems than there were solutions. And I sat with these      four folks, I'll tell you what they said to me. Now, they're      not the end of the day, but they said to me, they said, look,      the idea of winning the hearts and minds of the Islamic      world, and the Arab Islamic world is not likely. The best you      can do is give some reasons for the moderates within that      regime to have a reason to sustain their position against the      extremists in . . . did I say regime? I meant to say region,      against extremists in the region. And they went on to say,      the problem isn't with the American people, it's with      American foreign policies, and then they ticked off the      foreign policy. Being part of propping up regimes that in      fact are anti-democratic and are part of the problem, because      again, Osama Bin Laden is after Riyadh, not after Jerusalem.       And it's a different problem. And also they then point out      Israel, and they say part of the problem relates to our      policy relative to Israel. Well, there are certain things      we're not going to change. There are certain things we're not      going to change, so the question is, what utility would a      significant investment in our public diplomacy have? And it      seems to me the minimum what it would have, it would give a      context in which we were able to . . . they were able to make      judgments about the totality of our action, and would not in      fact change the attitude in that part of the world toward us,      but would moderate it. And so these are very difficult      questions, though, but I am going to propose we make this      major investment, and I think it will fall on, quite frankly,      friendly ears in the administration, based on my      conversations with the President.       VW: Is there an opportunity to take that a step further to      the whole foreign policy budget of the government, the United      Nations that you've been involved in, support for our      embassies abroad that's been underfunded for some time,      foreign aid budget, is that a part of the whole response?       JB: No, because . . . and I'm not being . . . I didn't mean      to be so sure. (Laughs) I don't mean . . . (Overlap)       VW: . . . short answer (?) . . .       JB: . . . that's right. (Scattered Laughter) Now, well . .      . the answer is no for the following reasons. For the federal      government to engage in public diplomacy at home is a very      dangerous thing, in my view. For us to fund news      organizations that promote a governmental position, it seems      to me is not what we need, domestically in the United States.      But we do need it abroad. What will change, and has changed      that, as Ambassador Negroponte knows, he not only . . . I      mean, I love the guy. We held him up for God knows how long      before we approved him, so everybody made sure any accusation      ever against wouldn't rub off on them, and they all turned      out to be false, and we approved unanimously, wasn't it? I      don't think anybody voted against it. And he went up there      and did something no one's been able to do, including Prince      Holbrooke, no one's been able to do this. (Laughter) And you      know what he did? He went up and there and got immediately      the right wing Republicans to free up the money in the House.      You know what did that? The world changed. They did not want      to have to, as former Senator Carol Moseley Braun would say,      wear the jacket of us not being able to put together a      coalition because he was unable to do his job in the United      Nations because he had to face the constant charge that we      weren't meeting our end of the deal.       So I think events alter those kinds of things and I think      you're going to see foreign policy much more on the front      burner of American domestic politics for the reasons that      were stated at the outset, that we'll, in fact, up those      budgets and people are beginning to understand the      complexity. It's not all military, it's diplomacy. We have to      lead in other ways, and I think that will be helped by this      terrible circumstance.       VW: Senator Biden, thank you for . . . (Overlap)       DG: I'm Dick Garwin, Council on Foreign Relations. Thank      you for an insightful and constructive presentation. Now, on      the ABM Treaty and missile defense, I can just say Amen, but      the rest of the topics you mentioned, we need to have not      only some priorities, but more than that. That administration      and the Congress are going to have to do a number of things      together. First, it seems to me that we have to have refugee      camps, and the refugee camps have to be training grounds for      democracy. So, we need to work with the United Nations to do      this, and to accomplish that. We need to provide security,      but we need to provide more than security.       The next priority I think has to be the chemical and      biological weapons conventions, especially the BWC . . .      essentially all the nations of the world have signed up, but      they're not all obeying it. They're not all doing what they      said. Before we have any compliance, we've got to have them      say, we're going to do this, we're passing a law, everybody      has to stop affiliating with biological weapons and we're      going to destroy our stocks. Seems to me that's the next. And      finally, in my talk, is the Pakistani nuclear weapons. You      read in the New York Times Bruce Wehr(?), saying we ought to      provide means of going in, and capturing them in case      Pakistan regime falls. Well, we'll get a lot more cooperation      if we fund Pakistani regime in order to destroy their own, or      render them ineffective if the regime falls, and with uranium      weapons that can be done in reasonably expeditious fashion.      But how do you solve the problem of priorities, and doing a      number of things at the same time which neither      administrations nor Congress are good at?       JB: Let me tell you, I fully agree with your list, I      shortened my speech on the fly here, I'll give you a copy of      it, it mentions all three of those things, particularly the      biological and chemical weapons treaty and the      implementation. And I think you do just what you said. Those      discussions are underway with the Democratic Congress and the      Republican members of Congress and the President on setting      those priorities. The question is, the President has an      internal dilemma he has to overcome first. He is focusing on      first things first, but then he has to deal with . . . and      I'm going to get in trouble for saying this . . . but he has      to deal with what has not gone away. There is, for lack of a      better phrase, still a Rumsfeld-Powell split on how they      look at the world, and how they look at these very issues      that you've stated here. I was discussing here at my      table, my perception, and maybe, what's that old      expression, the father is . . . the wish is the father of      the thought, or whatever it is, that maybe I'm just sort      of making this up as I go along because I want to feel it.      But my impression is, this President is arriving at his      own foreign policy. He is arriving at his own foreign      policy. I think he accepted wholesale sort of the movement      right position on foreign policy issues, because as a      Governor he hadn't paid much attention to those. And I      think he's finding that those as a prescription don't fit      the modern day world as easily as he thought they may.       And so I see the first thing that has to happen is the      President himself has to decide     what he thinks about these issues. And I hope we throw in      CTBT here, because I think to me that is one of the . . .      that is the single most important thing we could do at the      front end. But . . . Vin is looking at his watch,      understandably, I happen to agree with you. With regard to      priorities, Dick Lugar and I are going to be introducing this      week after call for a commission that is, I know we got a lot      of commissions, but a commission made up, appointed by the      President, the House and the Senate, made up of the leading      people in America that we could find with the greatest      stature, to come forward with us with a threat assessment, a      threat assessment that in fact reflects, for purposes of      deciding what priorities we should be focusing on. And so I      can talk to you more about that later, but my time is . . .      (Overlap)       VW: I don't know if we have time for one or two more, but      one there, and if there's time for two, it's over there. Les      is telling me only one, I'm sorry to say, (inaudible).       M: (inaudible) Talbot(?). Senator, thank you for this broad      guarded approach to the problems we face. My question is      this, do you foresee the need or the expectation of a      Congressional declaration of war, which the Constitution      calls for, and if so, against whom? (Scattered Laughter)       JB: The answer is yes, and we did it. I happen to be a      professor of Constitutional law. I'm the guy that drafted the      Use of Force proposal that we passed. It was in conflict      between the President and the House. I was the guy who      finally drafted what we did pass. Under the Constitution,      there is simply no distinction . . . Louis Fisher(?) and      others can tell you, there is no distinction between a formal      declaration of war, and an authorization of use of force.      There is none for Constitutional purposes. None whatsoever.      And we defined in that Use of Force Act that we passed, what      . . . against whom we were moving, and what authority was      granted to the President.       And why don't you take that question, it's not two o'clock,      I'll give a yes or no. He may be from Delaware. (Laughter)       RP: Roland Paul, Senator, I concur with everybody else in      commending you on your comments, and anyone who's heard you      before would certainly not be surprised at how good they      were. I would return to a question you answered earlier, and      you said as long . . . the bombing, every day it goes on, the      harder it may be for us to do something in the past(?). What      do you see as the situation if we don't defeat the Taliban in      the next four weeks, and winter sets in in Afghanistan?       JB: Again, I'm not a military man. I think the American      public and the Islamic world is fully prepared for us to take      as long as we need to take, if it is action that is mano-a-     mano. If it's us on the ground going against other forces on      the ground. The part that I think flies in the face of and      plays into every stereotypical criticism of us is we're this      high tech bully that thinks from the air we can do whatever      we want to do, and it builds the case for those who want to      make the cause against us that all we're doing is      indiscriminately bombing innocents, which is not the truth.      Some innocents are (indiscriminately) bombed, but that is not      the truth. I think the American public is prepared for a long      siege. I think the American public is prepared for American      losses. I think the American public is prepared, and the      President must continue to remind them to be prepared, for      American body bags coming home.       There is no way that you can in fact go after and root out      al-Qaeda and/or Bid Laden without folks on the ground, in      caves, risking and losing their lives. And I believe that the      tolerance for that in the Islamic world is significant . . .      exponentially higher than it is for us bombing. That's a      generic point I wish to make. I am not qualified enough to      tell you, although I can tell you what the military guys have      said to me, this is not 1948. This is 2001, I'm not at all      they're correct, and our ability to wage conflict in the      winter, in parts of this region, is within our control, I      don't know enough to vouch for that or not, but I do think it      clearly makes it more difficulty, and the weather window is      closing, as opposed to the tolerance window for a behavior,      in my view. Thank you all very, very much. (Applause)
