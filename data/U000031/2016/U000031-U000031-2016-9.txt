Speaker, I yield myself an additional 2 minutes.  These agencies and the rules and regs they produce, affecting the discovery, development, and delivery of lifesaving drugs and devices, also need modernization and innovation. They need a game-changer, and now we have it. This legislation breaks down regulatory barriers and expedites the approvals for drugs and devices, coupled with billions more for research.  The former head of the NCI and the FDA, Andy von Eschenbach, has called this the most transformational biomedical legislation in the past 3 years. He is right.  But this package is not just about Cures. No. It also achieves several additional top-line priorities for our Energy and Commerce Committee, including valuable resources to fight the opioid epidemic and delivering landmark mental health reforms spearheaded by Dr. Tim Murphy to help families in crisis and treat mental illnesses rather than incarceration. This is, without a doubt, the most important and impactful bill that we will enact in this Congress.  Patients aren't interested in debating the timelines. The failure rates, the size and cost of conducting clinical trials, are at an all-time high. They just know that despite the promise of scientific breakthroughs, they can't get the therapy that might save their life. That is why we need this bill.  I want to give a special thanks to my many partners, including especially Diana DeGette, not to mention Joe Pitts, Frank Pallone, Tim Murphy, and Lamar Alexander, the leadership on both sides of the aisle in both Chambers. I thank my truly brilliant committee and personal staff led by Gary Andres and Joan Hillebrands, Health Counsel Paul Edattel, and, of course, my wife, Amey.  We are on the cusp of something special, a once-in-a-generation opportunity to transform how we treat disease. With this vote, we are taking a giant leap on the path to Cures. Working together, we will deliver Cures now.  Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.
