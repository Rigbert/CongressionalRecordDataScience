 President, I have listened closely to the comments of my good friend from Ohio, and I would like to thank him for them and commend him for his tireless efforts in supporting the children's causes, not only here in the United States but throughout the world.  I would like to assure my good friend from Ohio that I will give every possible consideration to his request when we go to conference with the House on the bill.  Mr. DeWINE. I appreciate that very much.  Mr. President, if I could inquire of my colleague from Kentucky, I have a statement which I would like to give at some point this evening in regard to the vote we are going to have tomorrow. I can refrain from doing that if it works with the chairman's schedule, or I can do it now.  Mr. McCONNELL. I have a block of amendments that have been cleared on both sides that I would like to offer. Senator Bennett is also here.  Mr. DeWINE. I yield the floor at this time, Mr. President.
