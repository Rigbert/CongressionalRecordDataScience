 President, it is my intention to object to the Senate proceeding to the consideration of Senate Executive Calendar Nos. 756 through 766, Nominations to various Ambassadorial posts. I request that a hold be put on these nominations.  A vacancy has existed since March 31, 1995 on the Board of the Farm Credit Administration. For over a year the White House has had the name of Ann Jorgensen to fill that Republican vacancy. All background work with regard to the nomination has been completed. All that needs to be done is for her name to be submitted to the Senate for confirmation.  I have repeatedly contacted the White House about this nomination and, to date, have not had the courtesy of a reply. The FCA has oversight responsibilities for the farm credit system, the backbone of agricultural finance. It is important for the smooth functioning of the FCS that the FCA have a full complement on its board.  It is my intention to maintain this objection until the White House has disposed of this nomination.                          ____________________
