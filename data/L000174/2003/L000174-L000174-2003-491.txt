President, the delineation between an ``internationalist'' and ``isolationist'' has too often been drawn at the doctrine of preemption. Those who supported the war in Iraq are considered ``internationalists'' while those who did not, are shunted as ``isolationists.'' This classification is unprecedented in the more than two centuries of American foreign policy. Opposition to an unprovoked invasion is not isolationism. And internationalism is more than merely waging war.  On May 12, the Washington Post published an op-ed by my friend and our former colleague, Senator George McGovern. As he has done many times in the past, Senator McGovern has provided important and timely insights on U.S. foreign policy.  The debate over U.S. policy towards Iraq over the past several months has been littered with references to ``internationalists'' and ``isolationists.'' Senator McGovern has penned some important reflections about how these labels have been used in previous foreign policy debates.  I ask unanimous consent that a copy of the op-ed by Senator McGovern in the Washington Post on May 12, be printed in the Record so that all Senators and staff have an opportunity to review his comments.  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in the Record, as follows:                [From The Washington Post, May 12, 2003]                  A More Constructive Internationalism                        (By George S. McGovern)       In his May 1 op-ed piece, Will Marshall praised      presidential candidates Dick Gephardt, Joe Lieberman, John      Kerry and John Edwards as ``Blair Democrats''--     internationalists who are willing ``to use force in the      national interest.'' He rejoiced that the Democratic Party      ``is moving away from McGovernism and back to its      international roots.''       One wonders why Marshall went to Britain for an example of      how American Democrats ought to behave. It is more puzzling      why he concluded that I'm opposed to internationalism and the      ``use of force in the national interest.'' I first used force      in the national interest during World War II, when I flew 35      combat missions in Europe.       American involvement in that war was clearly in our      national interest, and that is why I volunteered at the age      of 19 to be part of it.       It is true that I opposed the American war in Vietnam, but      not because I had ceased to be an internationalist. That war      was a disastrous folly, as all literate people now      acknowledge. We were never more isolated from the      international community than when our troops were deepest in      the Vietnam jungle. A close second in isolating us from the      international community was the invasion of Iraq, a largely      defenseless little desert state that posed no threat to us      and had taken no action against us.       The best way to support our troops is to keep them out of      needless wars such as Iraq and Vietnam. The best way for      America to play a constructive role internationally is to      support the United Nations and to work toward expanding      international trade, aid and investment while protecting our      workers and the environment. An internationalist would also      support the Kyoto Protocol on global warming, the      International Criminal Court, the Anti-Ballistic Missile      Treaty and an international ban on land mines.       An internationalist also would support the International      Food for Peace Program, which I directed during the Kennedy      administration, as well as the efforts I carried forward to      reduce global hunger during my service as a Clinton      administration ambassador to the U.N. Food and Agriculture      agencies in Rome. Former senator Bob Dole and I have teamed      up to press for an international school lunch program that      would reach 300 million elementary school children who are      not being fed.       I am opposed to the Bush doctrine of ``preemptive war''--     what heretofore has been known as aggression or invasion. I      am also opposed to congressional resolutions that give the      president a blank check to go to war when he pleases.       I have always thought America to be the greatest country on      earth. One of the reasons I think so is because of our great      founding fathers, including Thomas Jefferson, who spoke of      ``a decent respect to the opinions of mankind.'' Is there any      doubt that the opinion of mankind was overwhelmingly against      our wars in Vietnam and Iraq?       We don't measure a nation's internationalism by the number      of troops it sends to other countries. But that test, Adolf      Hilter would be the greatest internationalist of the 20th      century. I might add for Marshall's edification that I would      not have won the Democratic presidential nomination in 1972--     winning 11 primaries, including two largest states, New York      and California--if I had been perceived as an isolationist. I      also believe that if the disgraceful conduct of President      Richard Nixon during that campaign had been known before the      election, I would have been elected. If so, I would have led      as an internationalist unafraid to use force in the national      interest.
