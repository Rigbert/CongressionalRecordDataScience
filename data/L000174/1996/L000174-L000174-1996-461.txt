President, tomorrow, like other Members of Congress, I will receive a paycheck for the last 2 weeks. In good conscience, however, I cannot use this money while thousands of Federal Government employees are denied their paychecks because Congress refuses to reopen the Government. Until this Government shutdown ends, I will be putting the amount of my paycheck into escrow.  As a matter of principle, Members of Congress should be treated the same as all Federal employees. I work for the people of Vermont, including the hard-working Federal workers who are being punished by this Government shutdown. If the Federal workers in my home State cannot receive a paycheck, then I will not receive a paycheck.  I am a cosponsor and strong supporter of Senator Boxer's no budget-no pay bill which would stop the pay of Members of Congress during a Government shutdown. The Senate has passed this legislation three separate times, but the leadership of the House of Representatives refuses to bring the bill to a vote. I would also note that the Senate has passed legislation to put people back to work. The distinguished majority leader, Senator Dole, introduced a continuing resolution which passed to that effect. But that has been rejected by the House of Representatives.  I urge the House Speaker and my other colleagues in the House and Senate to also give up their paychecks until Congress ends this foolish Government shutdown. Speaker Gingrich and the House Republicans are all accepting their pay while Federal workers are working without pay or forced to stay home without pay. In fact, at least one Member of the other body said he would accept his pay ``because he is in the Constitution,'' although I do not find his name in my copy of the Constitution. I believe it is the height of arrogance for them to accept it. In fact, they even accepted travel money from the taxpayers to go home for a Christmas vacation.  If the Speaker and his followers would also give up their pay as I am, I believe the House would quickly vote to reopen the Government. Maybe if they went without pay for a while, they would find out what it is like when you are working but not getting paid. They would learn that the bills keep coming even though the paychecks do not, which is what thousands of Federal workers in Vermont and throughout the country are now finding out.  My family is no different than any of the other hundreds of Vermont families that are going to miss that paycheck because of this shutdown. I will not enjoy my pay if they cannot enjoy theirs.  Mr. President, I yield the floor.                          ____________________
