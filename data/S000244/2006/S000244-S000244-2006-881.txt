Speaker, I would like to include the following House Judiciary Committee press releases that highlight important civil liberty safeguards that are contained in the PATRIOT Act conference report.       PATRIOT Act Conference Report Civil Liberty Safeguard #1--     Requiring High-Level Approval and Additional Reporting to      Congress for Section 215 Requests for Sensitive Information      Such as Library or Medical Records:       Section 215 of the PATRIOT Act authorizes the Director of      the Federal Bureau of Investigation or a designee of the      Director to apply to the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance      Act (FISA) Court for an order requiring the production of any      tangible things (including books, records, papers, documents,      and other items) for a foreign terrorism or spy      investigation. This authority provides counterterrorism and      law enforcement officials a helpful tool to uncover what      activities suspected terrorists or spies are engaged in. The      Department of Justice testified in April 2005 to the House      Judiciary Committee that a Section 215 order had not been      used to request sensitive information such as library,      bookstore, medical, or gun records and no evidence has been      presented to demonstrate otherwise. Nonetheless, some have      raised concerns that this authority could be abused by mid-     level officials to seek sensitive categories of records about      law-abiding Americans.       To address these concerns, the conference report provides      that when the documents sought relate to certain sensitive      categories of records (such as library, bookstore, tax      return, firearms sales, educational, and medical records),      only the FBI Director, Deputy Director, or Official-in-Charge      of Intelligence may approve the application before it can be      submitted to the FISA court. Without the personal approval of      one of these 3 officials, the 215 order for these sensitive      categories of records may not be issued. Additionally, the      conference report establishes enhanced reporting requirements      to Congress regarding the use of Section 215, including a      breakdown of its use to obtain library, medical, educational,      and other sensitive types of records in order to further      protect this authority from possibly being abused. These      civil liberty safeguards contained in the conference report      do not exist under current law.       PATRIOT Act Conference Report Civil Liberty Safeguard #2--     Statement of Facts Showing Relevance to a Terrorism or      Foreign Spy Investigation Required for Section 215 Requests:       Section 215 of the PATRIOT Act authorizes the Director of      the Federal Bureau of Investigation or a designee of the      Director to apply to the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance      Act (FISA) Court for an order requiring the production of any      tangible things (including books, records, papers, documents,      and other items) for a foreign terrorism or spy      investigation. This authority provides counter-terrorism and      law enforcement officials a helpful and less invasive tool to      both uncover what activities suspected terrorists or spies      are engaged in and clear innocent people suspected of      terrorism or spying. Without Section 215 authority, counter-     terrorism and law enforcement officials seeking to discover      whether a person is involved in     terrorism or spying activity would be forced to use more      invasive investigative techniques such as obtaining a search      warrant. Current law only requires that an application for a      Section 215 order state that the requested records are sought      for an authorized investigation to collect foreign terrorism      or spy information.       The conference report requires that a Section 215      application must include a statement of facts demonstrating      that the records sought are ``relevant'' to an authorized      investigation to obtain terrorism or foreign intelligence      information. This statement of facts requirement contains      language offered by Senator Leahy. This statement of facts      civil liberty safeguard contained in the conference report      does not exist under current law. In addition, the      conference report maintains the specific prohibition that      the requested information not concern a U.S. person unless      it is to protect against international terrorism or spying      activities.       PATRIOT Act Conference Report Civil Liberty Safeguard #3--     Explicitly Allowing a FISA Court Judge to Deny or Modify a      Section 215 Request:       Under current law, upon receiving the Section 215      application, the FISA Court judge must approve or modify the      order; the current law does not include specific authority      for the court to deny an application. The PATRIOT Act      conference report explicitly provides a FISA Court judge the      discretion to not only approve or modify a Section 215      application, but also to deny an application. This civil      liberty safeguard contained in the conference report does not      exist under current law.       PATRIOT Act Conference Report Civil Liberty Safeguard #4--     Requiring Minimization Procedures to Limit Retention and      Dissemination of Information Obtained About U.S. Persons From      Section 215 Requests:       In order to address concerns that information sought in a      Section 215 order might be unnecessarily retained or      disseminated, the PATRIOT Act conference report requires that      the Attorney General create minimization procedures for the      retention and dissemination of this data and that the FBI use      these procedures. Specifically, the A.G. must establish      minimization procedures to minimize the retention, and      dissemination, of nonpublicly available information      concerning non-consenting United States persons consistent      with the need of the United States to obtain, produce, and      disseminate foreign intelligence information. This civil      liberty provision provides another safeguard to ensure      information about innocent U.S. persons is not kept or used      in nefarious or inappropriate ways. This civil liberty      safeguard is not contained in current law and was requested      by Senator Leahy.       PATRIOT Act Conference Report Civil Liberty Safeguard #5--     Explicitly Providing for a Judicial Challenge to a Section      215 Order:       Current law requires judicial review before a Section 215      order can be issued. Specifically, the FISA Court is required      to review all applications before a Section 215 order is      approved. However, current law does not provide a judicial      review process after a 215 order has been issued. The pending      PATRIOT Act conference report explicitly establishes a      judicial review process after the 215 order has been issued      to allow the recipient of a 215 order to challenge the order      before the FISA Court. The FISA Court may quash a Section 215      request if it does not meet the requirements of the statute      or is otherwise unlawful. This civil liberty safeguard      contained in the conference report does not exist under      current law.       PATRIOT Act Conference Report Civil Liberty Safeguard #6--     Explicitly Clarifying that a Recipient of a Section 215 Order      May Disclose Receipt to an Attorney or Others Necessary to      Comply with or Challenge the Order:       Current law prohibits the recipient of a 215 order from      disclosing the receipt of such an order except to those      necessary to comply with the order. This is done for 2 main      reasons: 1) fear of tipping off terrorists or spies that they      are being investigated; and 2) irreparably harming the      reputations of innocent people by publicly disclosing their      activities were investigated because of terrorism or spying      links. Current law is silent as to whether a 215 order      recipient may disclose the receipt of such an order to an      attorney to comply with the order. The pending PATRIOT Act      conference report clarifies this issue by stating explicitly      that the recipient of a 215 order may disclose receipt to an      attorney or others necessary to comply with or challenge the      order. This civil liberty safeguard contained in the      conference report does not exist under current law.       PATRIOT Act Conference Report Civil Liberty Safeguard #7--     Requiring Public Reporting of the Number of Section 215      Orders:       On April 6, 2005, Attorney General Alberto Gonzales      testified before the House Judiciary Committee that as of      March 30, 2005, the FISA Court had approved the Justice      Department's request for a Section 215 order 35 times.      However, under current law, the number of Section 215 orders      is not required to be made public. At the request of Senator      Leahy and other Senate Democratic conferees, the PATRIOT Act      conference report requires the Justice Department to report      to the public annually the aggregate number of Section 215      applications submitted, approved, modified, and denied.      Despite the concerns of some that this public reporting      requirement unnecessarily informs America's enemies of the      sources and methods being used to thwart terrorism and      spying, the conference reports includes this civil liberty      safeguard to assuage any concerns that the Section 215      authority is being abused. This civil liberty safeguard      contained in the conference report does not exist under      current law.       PATRIOT Act Conference Report Civil Liberty Safeguard #8--     Requiring the Justice Department's Independent Inspector      General to Conduct an Audit of Each Justice Department Use of      Section 215 Orders:       The PATRIOT Act conference report provides additional      public information and congressional oversight by requiring      the Justice Department's independent Inspector General to      conduct an audit for each Justice Department use of Section      215 orders. These audits will be compiled into two Inspector      General public reports with classified annexes. This civil      liberty safeguard contained in the conference report does not      exist under current law.       PATRIOT Act Conference Report Civil Liberty Safeguard #9--     Explicitly Providing for a Judicial Challenge to a National      Security Letter (NSL):       Current law does not specify that an NSL can be challenged      in court and provides no process for challenging an NSL. The      conference report provides explicit authority to challenge in      court an NSL under all existing statutes authorizing NSLs.      Specifically, the conference report provides that the      recipient of an NSL may petition for an order modifying or      setting aside the NSL request in the U.S. district court      for the district where the recipient does business or      resides. This civil liberty safeguard is stronger than the      Senate-passed bill, which only addressed one of the NSL      statutes, does not exist under current law, and was      written by Rep. Jeff Flake (R-Ariz.).       Originally created by a Democrat-led Congress and signed      into law by President Carter, NSLs are a long-standing tool      by which the FBI and other appropriate federal law      enforcement officials request, for sensitive foreign spying      or international terrorism investigations, subscriber      information and toll billing records of a wire or electronic      communication service provider, such as a phone company or      AOL.       PATRIOT Act Conference Report Civil Liberty Safeuard #10--     Explicitly Clarifying: that a Recipient of a National      Security Letter (NSL) May Disclose Receipt to an Attorney or      Others Necessary to Comply with or Challenge the Order:       As NSLs may only be used in highly sensitive international      terrorism or foreign espionage investigations with national      security implications, current law prohibits the recipient of      an NSL from disclosing the receipt of such an order. Current      law is silent as to whether an NSL recipient may disclose the      receipt of such an order to an attorney to comply with or      challenge the order. The pending PATRIOT Act conference      report clarifies this issue by stating explicitly that the      recipient of an NSL may disclose receipt to an attorney or      others necessary to comply with or challenge the order. This      civil liberty safeguard contained in the conference report      does not exist under current law and was written by Rep. Jeff      Flake (R-Ariz.).       PATRIOT Act Conference Report Civil Liberty Safeguard #11--     Providing that a Nondisclosure Order Does Not Automatically      Attach to a National Security Letter (NSL):       Current law automatically prohibits the recipient of an NSL      from disclosing receipt of it. The conference report amends      the law so that a nondisclosure order does not automatically      attach to an NSL. Instead, a nondisclosure requirement will      attach to an NSL only upon a certification by the government      that disclosure could cause one of the harms specified in the      conference report, such as endangering a witness or      threatening national security. This civil liberty safeguard      does not exist in current law and was written by Rep. Jeff      Flake (R-Ariz.).       PATRIOT Act Conference Report Civil Liberty Safeguard #12--     Providing Explicit Judicial Review of a Nondisclosure      Requirement to a National Security Letter (NSL):       Current law does not allow the recipient of an NSL to      challenge a nondisclosure order attached to the NSL. The      conference report changes this by explicitly providing for      judicial review of a nondisclosure requirement to an NSL. The      NSL recipient may challenge the nondisclosure requirement in      the U.S. district court for the district in which      the recipient does business or resides. This civil liberty      safeguard does not exist in current law and was written by      Rep. Jeff Flake (R-Ariz.).       PATRIOT Act Conference Report Civil Liberty Safeguard #13--     Requiring Public Reporting of the Number of National Security      Letters (NSLs):       At the request of Senator Leahy and other Senate Democratic      conferees, the PATRIOT Act conference report includes--for      the first time--public reporting on the aggregate number of      NSLs requested for information about U.S. persons. Despite      the concerns of some that this public reporting requirement      unnecessarily informs America's enemies of the sources and      methods being used to thwart terrorism and spying, the      conference reports includes this civil liberty safeguard to      assuage any concerns that the NSL authority is being abused.      This civil liberty safeguard contained in the conference      report does not exist under current law.       PATRIOT Act Conference Report Civil Liberty Safeguard #14--     Requiring the Justice Department's Independent Inspector      General to Conduct Two Audits of the Use of National Security      Letters (NSLs):       The PATRIOT Act conference report provides additional      public information and congressional oversight by requiring      the Justice Department's independent Inspector General to      conduct two audits on the use of NSLs     during the years 2003--2006. These audits will be compiled      into two Inspector General public reports with classified      annexes. This civil liberty safeguard contained in the      conference report does not exist under current law.       PATRIOT Act Conference Report Civil Liberty Safeguard #15--     Requiring Additional Reporting to Congress by the Justice      Department on Use of National Security Letters (NSLs):       The PATRIOT Act conference report enhances congressional      oversight over the use of NSLs by requiring additional      classified reporting to Congress on the use of NSL      authorities. Specifically, the conference report requires the      House and Senate Judiciary Committees to receive all      classified reports regarding use of NSLs; currently these      committees only receive classified reports under one of the      five statutes authorizing NSLs.       PATRIOT Act Conference Report Civil Liberty Safeguard #16--     Requiring the Justice Department to Re-Certify that      Nondisclosure of a National Security Letter (NSL) is      Necessary:       The PATRIOT Act conference report explicitly allows an NSL      recipient to challenge a nondisclosure requirement in U.S.      district court. If an NSL recipient challenges the      prohibition on disclosure more than a year after the NSL is      issued, the Justice Department must re-certify that      nondisclosure is necessary, or else the nondisclosure      requirement lapses. This civil liberty safeguard contained in      the conference report does not exist under current law.       PATRIOT Act Conference Report Civil Liberty Safeguard #17--     Narrowing the Deference Given to the Justice Department on a      National Security Letter (NSL) Nondisclosure Certification:       The PATRIOT Act conference report provides greater judicial      discretion by narrowing the deference given to certifications      by the Justice Department on NSL nondisclosure requirements.      Like the Senate-passed version, the conference report      provides an additional level of deference if an NSL      nondisclosure certification is made on the grounds that      disclosure may endanger national security or diplomatic      relations. At the request of Senator Leahy, this heightened      degree of deference is only provided to certifications made      by a few Senate-confirmed officials at the time the      nondisclosure petition is filed. This civil liberty safeguard      contained in the conference report does not exist under      current law.       PATRIOT Act Conference Report Civil Liberty Safeguard #18--     Requiring a Report to Congress on Any Use of Data-Mining:      Programs by the Justice Department:       Data-mining programs take vast amounts of information and      try to utilize it for specific purposes such as identifying a      group with similar features. These programs can be helpful in      ``connecting the dots'' and are becoming more useful as a      tool to bolster homeland security. Congress wants to ensure      that agencies using data-mining programs take all necessary      steps to protect privacy and the unauthorized dissemination      of information.       The PATRIOT Act conference report enhances congressional      oversight of data-mining programs by requiring the Justice      Department to report to Congress on the use or development of      any of these programs by the Justice Department. This report      will help inform Members of Congress of the civil liberty      protections that are built into--or should be built into--     these Justice Department data-mining programs. This new civil      liberty safeguard contained in the PATRIOT Act conference      report does not exist in current law and was written by Reps.      Howard Berman (D-Calif.) and William Delahunt (D-Mass.).       PATRIOT Act Conference Report Civil Liberty Safeguard #19--     Requiring Notice Be Given on Delayed-Notice Search Warrants      Within 30 Days of the Search:       Prior to the enactment of the PATRIOT Act in 2001, the U.S.      Courts had authorized delayed notice search warrants under      limited circumstances. For these special situations, the      PATRIOT Act adopted the Courts' practice of requiring law      enforcement to provide notice within a reasonable amount of      time after the search has been carried out. Some were      concerned that using a ``reasonable amount of time'' standard      could allow abuse. Thus, the PATRIOT Act reauthorization      conference report narrows and clarifies this standard by      providing a Court the discretion to delay notice for up to 30      days after the search is executed. This new conference report      civil liberty safeguard is not found in current law.       Notice has been delayed in only rare cases. As of January      31, 2005, the Justice Department has requested delayed-notice      search warrants approximately 155 times since passage of the      PATRIOT Act on October 26, 2001 out of the tens of thousands      of search warrants authorized each year. These warrants make      up fewer than 1 in 500 search warrants obtained in that      period. Delayed-notice search warrants have been a valuable      tool used by law enforcement for decades. Like all criminal      search warrants, a delayed-notice search warrant is issued by      a federal judge only upon a showing that there is probable      cause to believe that a crime has been or will be committed      and that the property sought or seized constitutes evidence      of this criminal offense. Notice is delayed only to protect      an on-going investigation and the safety of the American      public. Not delaying notice could allow a terrorist or      criminal to flee the country, destroy evidence about his      activity, alert associates to go into hiding, or even kill      witnesses who could implicate the individual.       PATRIOT Act Conference Report Civil Liberty Safeguard #20--     Limiting Delayed-Notice Search Warrants Extensions to 90 Days      or Less:       Like the versions passed by the House and the Senate, the      PATRIOT Act conference report narrows and clarifies the      permissible extension period by providing a Court the      discretion to extend the delay of notice for up to 90 days      except under exceptional circumstances. This new conference      report civil liberty safeguard is not found in current law.       PATRIOT Act Conference Report Civil Liberty Safeguard #21--     Requiring an Updated Showing of Necessity in Order to Extend      the Delay of Notice of a Search Warrant:       To ensure that a Court considering extending a delay of      notice has the best and most up-to date information, the      PATRIOT Act conference report requires an updated show of      necessity by the applicant in order to extend the delay of      notice of a search warrant. This new conference report civil      liberty safeguard is not found in current law.       PATRIOT Act Conference Report Civil Liberty Safeguard #22--     Requiring Annual Public Reporting on the Use of Delayed-     Notice Search Warrants:       To assuage concerns that delayed-notice search warrants      could be abused, the PATRIOT Act conference report requires      public reporting on the use of these search warrants.      Specifically, the annual public report will include the      ``number of applications for warrants and extensions of      warrants authorizing delayed notice, and the number of such      warrants and extensions granted or denied during the      preceding fiscal year.'' This new conference report civil      liberty safeguard is not found in current law.       PATRIOT Act Conference Report Civil Liberty Safeguard #23--     Requiring Additional Specificity from an Applicant Before      Roving Surveillance May be Authorized:       In an age of disposable cell phones, ``roving'' wiretaps      are a reasonable and common-sense updating of investigative      techniques to account for technological advances. A      ``roving'' wiretap follows the target rather than just a      single phone or communications device. The PATRIOT Act      conference report addresses concerns about vagueness in      applications for ``roving'' wiretaps in foreign spying and      terrorism investigations by requiring additional      specificity in these applications in order for a Foreign      Intelligence Surveillance Act (FISA) Court judge to      consider authorizing a ``roving'' wiretap. This civil      liberty safeguard is not included in current law.       Congress has authorized criminal wiretaps for decades as an      effective crime-fighting tool. Because of technological      advances, including the use of cell phones, in 1986 Congress      authorized ``roving'' wiretaps in criminal cases that allowed      for the surveillance to target a person rather than a      specific phone or communications device. However, prior to      the PATRIOT Act, this authority did not exist for      international spying or terrorism cases; thus, for these      cases the government had to return to the FISA Court and      apply for a new wiretap every time the suspected spy or      terrorist used a different phone or communications device.      This costly, cumbersome, and time-consuming requirement      served as a major impediment in foreign spying and terrorism      investigations. The PATRIOT Act extended the ``roving''      wiretap authority to international spying and terrorism cases      by allowing a FISA Court judge to authorize a ``roving''      wiretap provided the applicant demonstrates there is probable      cause to believe the target is a foreign spy or terrorist.       PATRIOT Act Conference Report Civil Liberty Safeguard #24--     Requiring Court Notification Within 10 Days of Conducting      Surveillance on a New Facility Using a ``Roving'' Wiretap:       The PATRIOT Act conference report addresses concerns the      ``roving'' wiretap authority could be abused by requiring the      investigators to inform the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance      Act (FISA) Court within 10 days when the ``roving''      surveillance authority is used to target a new facility.       PATRIOT Act Conference Report Civil Liberty Safeguard #25--     Requiring Ongoing FISA Court Notification of the Total Number      of Places or Facilities Under Surveillance Using a ``Roving''      Wiretap:       The PATRIOT Act conference report enhances judicial      oversight to address any concerns that the ``roving'' wiretap      authority could be abused. Specifically, the conference      report requires the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act      (FISA) Court to be informed on an ongoing basis of the total      number of places or facilities under surveillance using a      ``roving'' wiretap authority.       PATRIOT Act Conference Report Civil Liberty Safeguard #26--     Requiring Additional Specificity in a FISA Court Judge's      Order Authorizing a ``Roving'' Wiretap:       The PATRIOT Act conference report addresses concerns about      vagueness about the target in a Foreign Intelligence      Surveillance Act (FISA) Court judge's order authorizing a      ``roving'' wiretap in foreign spying and terrorism      investigations by requiring additional specificity. The      conference report requires the FISA Court judge's order      authorizing a ``roving'' wiretap to specify ``the identity,      if known, of the specific target'' of the surveillance.      Current law requires ``the identity, if known, or a      description of the target.'' This new civil liberty safeguard      is not included in current law.       PATRIOT Act Conference Report Civil Liberty Safeguard #27--     Providing a Four-Year Sunset on FISA ``Roving'' Wiretaps:       Despite no evidence that the FISA ``roving'' wiretap      authority has been abused, the PATRIOT Act conference report      aggressively     attempts to avoid any potential abuse of FISA ``roving''      wiretaps by providing a four-year sunset of this authority.      This civil liberty safeguard will ensure Congress revisits      this authority in four years.                          ____________________
