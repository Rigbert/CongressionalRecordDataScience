 President, I rise today to introduce the Fluorescent Light Implementation Program to Save Americans Value and Energy, or FLIP-to-SAVE. This bill does something very simple to save Americans money and make us more energy efficient. It distributes compact fluorescent light-bulbs. We can save green two ways by changing our light-bulbs.  Compact fluorescent light-bulbs, or CFLs, are highly efficient light-bulbs that use less than a quarter of the energy of traditional incandescent bulbs. The FLIP-to-SAVE program will spend $50 million to increase public awareness of how CFLs save money and the environment and to distribute them to households across the Nation. It is modeled after a successful program in my home State of Delaware, which distributed 140,000 CFLs through public libraries. The FLIP-to-SAVE program will give States grants, to allow each State to develop a program that suits it best, though I expect many will be modeled after Delaware's system.  Through this program, we can expect to replace 16 million inefficient incandescent bulbs with CFLs, reducing total residential energy bills by over $60 million each year. That means the program ought to pay for itself in terms of savings to families in just one year. And that's without considering the environmental benefits.  By reducing our energy consumption in the equivalent of 127,000 homes, about the size of Buffalo, NY, we can help alleviate our energy dependence and reduce our greenhouse gas emissions. In fact, one equivalent CFL replacing a 60 watt incandescent will prevent 1000 pounds of carbon dioxide through reductions in coal-powered electricity. That is 1.1 million tons of carbon dioxide each year.  Energy efficiency is a key to our efforts to address climate change. There are many simple steps we can take to use less energy, and this is one. The FLIP-to-SAVE program will not just reduce carbon emissions, but also reduce electric bills for American families by more than its price tag. I ask that the text of the bill be printed in the Record.  There being no objection, the text of the bill was ordered to be printed in the Record, as follows:                                S. 1562       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of      the United States of America in Congress assembled,     SECTION 1.
