I want to thank the distinguished majority leader for his exemplary leadership for many years, but especially as majority leader, and for reminding all of us that the unborn child, especially over the last 2 decades, has become the littlest patient, where microsurgeries and interventions can save children and enhance their life. I appreciate his extraordinary leadership.  I now yield to our distinguished colleague, the gentleman from Michigan (Mr. Walberg).
