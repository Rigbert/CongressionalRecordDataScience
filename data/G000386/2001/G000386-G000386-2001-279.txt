 I appreciate very much what the Senator said. I hope we can have such a list. We need to proceed in the bipartisan spirit under which Senator Baucus and I have been working and try to bring this bill to finality.  We have been able to defeat most amendments that have come before us. We know what this bill is going to look like for final passage and that we ought to get to final passage.                           Amendment No. 693
