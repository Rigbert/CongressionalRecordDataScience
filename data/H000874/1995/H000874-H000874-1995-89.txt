Speaker, I thank the gentleman for yielding, and I would again address the question to the majority leader.  We are now, as I said last night, in the longest shutdown of Government by virtue of the inability of the President and the Congress to come to grips with funding the Government in the history of this Nation. We, apparently, are going to have a relatively short day tomorrow. Everybody is going to go home. Eight hundred thousand people across this land are going to worry about whether or not they have a job to go to on Monday, whether they are going to have a paycheck Thanksgiving week, or a couple weeks before Christmas.  I am concerned, Mr. Leader, that we are apparently having a short day tomorrow. We are not going to be here Sunday, and we are not coming back, essentially, apparently to vote, until after 5 p.m. on Monday. That means that we are most assuredly going to have at least another 24 hours on Monday of a Government shutdown.  I am wondering what kind of negotiations are ongoing to try to overcome this impasse between the Congress and the President so that Government can get back to work.
