 President, when Congress approved and the President signed the comprehensive welfare reform legislation last year, it was clear to many that it was not a perfect bill.  I, along with many of my colleagues expressed grave concern about a number of provisions that will have a devastating impact, not only on States and counties in terms of a huge cost shift, but on the lives and well-being of many elderly and disabled people--people who are now dependent upon public assistance for their survival.  The provision denying supplemental security income [SSI] and food stamps to virtually all legal immigrants who are noncitizens, even those who are elderly and disabled, who cannot support themselves, who have no sponsor or other means of support, such as refugees, in my view, is one of the most egregious flaws in that bill, and one of the main reasons why I voted against its passage.  Today, Senator Chafee and I, along with Senators D'Amato, Moynihan, DeWine, Lieberman, and Mikulski are offering legislation to correct this flaw.  The Fairness for Legal Immigrants Act of 1997 would grandfather in from the ban on SSI and food stamps: those elderly and disabled legal permanent residents who were receiving SSI and food stamps on or before August 22, 1996 and, those refugees who were in the country as of August 22, 1996.  This legislation prohibits SSI and food stamps for legal permanent residents who are not refugees and who were not receiving SSI and food stamps as of August 22, 1996.  This legislation also prohibits SSI and food stamps for all legal permanent residents and refugees coming to this country following the date of enactment of the Welfare Reform Bill, August 22, 1996.  Mr. President, to not correct this flaw in the bill represents an enormous unfunded mandate to States and counties by simply shifting the cost of caring for the seriously ill, disabled, and elderly legal immigrants who are destitute and have no other way to survive.  As I speak, SSA is sending out 125,000 SSI ban notices per week, to 800,000 legal immigrants who are on SSI nationwide. SSA estimates that more than 62.5 percent or 500,000 people currently receiving SSI benefits nationwide will lose their benefits under the current law--more than 40 percent, 205,000 of them in California. Many of these elderly and disabled legal immigrants have no family or friends to turn to for support and will become completely destitute. Their only recourse will be county general assistance programs or, at worst, homeless shelters.  Let me give you an example from my home State:  My staff met with a 73-year-old legal immigrant on SSI. She was welcomed to this county from Vietnam in 1980. She was a refugee from communism with no family in the United States. She speaks no English and she is suffering from kidney failure. She requires dialysis three times a week. Under this new law, this 73-year-old woman will lose SSI, her only source of support. Her well-being will become the responsibility of the county.  I am the first to acknowledge that prior to welfare reform, there was abuse of the SSI program in this country. Elderly noncitizens could collect SSI, even if they lived with their children, as long as they claimed to be financially independent from the children.  And the number of noncitizens receiving SSI has skyrocketed at a disproportionate rate to that of citizens. The number of noncitizens collecting SSI increased 477 percent in 14 years, from 1980 to 1994, while the number of U.S. citizens receiving SSI increased 33 percent during that same period.  Although I strongly support efforts to hold sponsors accountable for the support of legal immigrants they bring into the country, the welfare reform bill passed by Congress simply went too far. It banned SSI and food stamps for virtually all legal immigrants, even those whose sponsors cannot afford to support them, or who have no sponsors at all.  The current welfare reform bill will not just eliminate fraudulent cases from the SSI rolls. It will eliminate truly needy people like the 73-year-old elderly refugee. Surely, it was not the intent of this Congress to leave elderly, disabled, and destitute people with nowhere to go to except county relief or the streets.  If we do not revise the welfare ban for legal immigrants the financial costs to States and counties will be enormous, and the human toll even greater:  Los Angeles County estimates that 93,000 legal immigrants in its county will lose SSI benefits at a cost of up to $236 million a year to the county.  San Francisco estimates that 20,000 legal noncitizens may turn to the county's general assistance program, at a total cost of up to $74 million annually.  I believe this body must finish what it started last year. In this time of budgetary constraints where tough choices have to be made, we must act with prudence and compassion toward those who truly have no one to turn to, while at the same time preserving portions of the savings needed to balance the budget and enact meaningful reform.  I urge my colleagues to support this legislation.  Mr. President, I ask that the SSA table be printed in the Record.  There being no objection, the table was ordered to be printed in the Record, as follows:    NUMBERS OF SSI RECIPIENTS RECEIVING PRELIMINARY NONCITIZEN STATUS      NOTICES BY STATE, NUMBERS OF SSI RECIPIENTS CODED AS NONCITIZENS BY      CATEGORY BY STATE, AND NUMBER OF SSI RECIPIENTS RECEIVING TYPE II                               NOTICES BY STATE                            ------------------------------------------------------------------------                                     Notices            Noncitizens                                   --------------------   recipients on SSI              State                         Type II ----------------------                                All \1\     \2\      LAPR      Refugees -----------------------------------------------------------------\3\----Alabama......................     9,800     9,215       502         123 Alaska.......................       757       117       569          95 Arizona......................     8,511     2,979     6,318       1,295 Arkansas.....................     4,958     4,569       335          96 California...................   310,409    76,356   206,038      80,803 Colorado.....................     6,149     1,898     3,353       1,426 Connecticut..................     5,071     1,111     3,440       1,009 Delaware.....................       665       334       275          55 D.C..........................     1,473       769       741         127 Florida......................    77,560    21,999    52,489      15,921 Georgia......................    13,794     9,474     3,235       1,366 Hawaii.......................     4,616     1,026     3,461         554 Idaho........................       811       405       364         144 Illinois.....................    27,446     6,783    16,233       6,769 Indiana......................     2,874     1,749       904         304 Iowa.........................     2,055     1,053       631         454 Kansas.......................     1,928       608       979         412 Kentucky.....................     4,781     4,028       439         357 Louisiana....................     8,694     6,550     2,002         536 Maine........................     1,500     1,039       318         191 Maryland.....................     9,645     2,456     5,424       2,087 Massachusetts................    27,171     7,782    16,184       7,383 Michigan.....................    12,136     5,232     5,364       2,069 Minnesota....................     8,025     1,529     3,319       3,362 Mississippi..................     8,232     7,852       363          72 Missouri.....................     4,971     3,141       996         872 Montana......................       462       302       103          75 Nebraska.....................     1,023       427       402         238 New Hampshire................       510       187       264         100 New Jersey...................    25,918     6,403    18,918       3,244 New Mexico...................     4,412     2,195     3,049         360 New York.....................   125,919    28,583    81,701      32,917 North Carolina...............     9,645     7,468     1,659         627 North Dakota.................       429       314        66          70 Ohio.........................     9,298     4,281     3,074       2,228 Oklahoma.....................     4,785     3,743       923         243 Oregon.......................     5,511     1,323     2,547       1,952 Pennsylvania.................    17,176     6,579     6,485       4,737 Rhode Island.................     3,755     1,194     2,640         724 South Carolina...............     6,119     5,535       505         124 South Dakota.................       504       337        56         115 Tennessee....................     8,952     7,622       968         426 Texas........................    66,750    31,421    50,434       5,772 Utah.........................     1,753       389       995         503 Vermont......................       543       385       110          73 Virginia.....................    10,336     3,830     5,247       1,500 Washington...................    15,583     2,622     7,579       6,242 West Virginia................     1,316     1,181       118          23 Wisconsin....................     7,472     2,562     2,591       2,490 Wyoming......................       144        97        41          77                               ------------------------------------------      Totals.................   895,204   299,817   526,695     193,142 ------------------------------------------------------------------------\1\ Number of notices differs from number of noncitizens recipients       because some SSI recipients' records do not contain information about   their citizenship status (Type II notices) plus some of those           designated as noncitizens did not receive notices because SSA records   indicated that they met certain exemption from the ban on eligibility.
