 President, some of my constituents are asking questions about the meaning of the small engines provision included in the fiscal year 2004 omnibus appropriations conference report. They raise the question about whether subsection (c) applies only to ``new'' and ``nonroad'' spark-ignition engines smaller than 50 horsepower. That was my understanding. I ask my colleague from Missouri, Senator Bond, one of the authors of this provision, whether that was his intent?
