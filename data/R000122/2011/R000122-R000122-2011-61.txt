President, I join my colleague Senator Whitehouse in welcoming Bishop Wolf to the Senate today. I commend Senator Whitehouse for his invitation. Bishop Wolf is not only a pastoral leader in our community, she is also a great community leader. She not only preaches the gospel, she lives the gospel.  As Senator Whitehouse indicated, she went on the mean streets of Providence, and there are such streets in every town in this country, to experience firsthand the travails and the troubles of people just trying to get by. That experience informed her ministry and informed her public positions, and we thank her for that. She has a global vision as well as a vision in Rhode Island. That global vision is a world inspired by American actions that is peaceful and progressive and finds opportunity for all.  So on behalf of the people of Rhode Island, I wish to thank her for her service, and I thank her especially for the grace she has brought to us today and has brought the State of Rhode Island as a result of her service.                          ____________________
