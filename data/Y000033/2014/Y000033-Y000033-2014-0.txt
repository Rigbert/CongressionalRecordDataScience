Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentleman for yielding.  Mr. Speaker, I rise today to support H.R. 4329, the NAHASDA reauthorization act of 2014. Over the last 2 years, I have had the privilege of working with a bipartisan group of my colleagues on this crucial legislation. I would like to first start by thanking and commending Mr. Pearce for his leadership in sponsoring this bill. This bill wouldn't have been possible without the efforts of Mr. Cole, Ms. Moore, Mr. Denny Heck, Ms. Hanabusa, Mr. Kildee, and all the others. I also would like to thank Chairman Hensarling for his dedication in moving this bill through the committee and for his statesmanship in resolving the difficult issues.  I would be remiss without thanking Alex on my staff, who has done great work on this legislation for the good of the First Americans.  Finally, it is important to acknowledge the many tribes and organizations that contributed to this legislation. These include the National American Indian Housing Council, which has developed a foundation for the legislation, and the Cook Inlet Housing Authority, which has been a tireless advocate in my State.  As my colleagues note, NAHASDA continues to be a successful and well-liked program throughout Indian Country. NAHASDA exemplifies the spirit of self-determination by allowing Native communities to create their own innovative housing assistance programs in ways that best serve their members. This bill upholds the success of NAHASDA and includes improvements to the programs that empower Native communities to better confront their housing challenges.                              {time}  1430  Furthermore, the bill responsibly streamlines administration of the programs so that both tribes and HUD will spend less time navigating red tape and more time advancing housing that makes a difference for native people.  As we pass this bill, the Senate must act quickly to take up the legislation before the end of this Congress. I call on our colleagues in the Senate to recognize the bipartisan nature of the bill and listen to the voices on this side of the aisle in support of Indian Country. It is my hope that the legislation will be signed into law before the end of the year.  As I said, I urge and I thank those for passage of this bill, H.R. 4329.
