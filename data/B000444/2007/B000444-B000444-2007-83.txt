 President, today I voted in favor of tabling the Alexander-Collins amendment on the REAL ID Act, Senate Amendment 2405, because I wanted to prevent reducing by almost 1 percent critical Federal spending on port and rail security, first responders' resources, and other homeland security protections. Rail infrastructure is the most widely attacked terrorist target in the world, and we must increase, not decrease, funding for our railroads. Similarly, port security is a top priority in our antiterrorism campaign, and I opposed this effort to divert funding from protecting our ports. I appreciate the work of my colleagues on the Senate Appropriations Committee to craft a balanced spending bill.
