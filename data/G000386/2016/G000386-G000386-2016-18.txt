 President, early this month, in my home State of Iowa, a tragedy took place that shocked our entire State. On Wednesday, November 2, 2016, the lives of Des Moines Police Sergeant Anthony Beminio and Urbandale Police Officer Justin Martin were taken at the hands of an assailant. It is almost unimaginable for somebody to attack the people who dedicate their lives to protecting our communities. Unfortunately, it is a threat all too familiar for everybody who has a family member in law enforcement.  Just after 1 a.m. on November 2, police responded to reports of shots fired and discovered that Officer Martin was shot and killed in his car while he was on duty. A short while later, Sergeant Anthony Beminio was found shot and killed in his car. He was believed to have been responding to the report of shots fired when he was killed by the lone assailant who moments earlier had allegedly killed Officer Martin. At this time, police do not have a motive for the shootings.  Nothing excuses the unforgivable act of attacking a police officer. I praise these heroes who gave their lives carrying out their mission to protect and serve.  Justin Martin obtained a bachelor's degree in criminal justice from Simpson College, with a lifelong dream of becoming a police officer. As Officer Martin's father said, ``He went into law enforcement for one reason--because he wanted to help people.'' Justin achieved that dream when he joined the Urbandale Police Department in 2015.  I want to express my deepest sympathy to Officer Martin's parents, Randy and Jayne Martin; his brother Ryan Martin; his maternal grandmother, Ann Margaret Krommendyk; his paternal grandparents, Gene and Carolyn Martin, as well as his extended family and friends for their loss. Officer Martin was an Eagle Scout. He was active in many extracurricular activities such as football, swimming, and he also played the trombone. Officer Martin, like Sergeant Beminio, was a fine example of a community leader whom our young people should aspire to be like. By all accounts, he was a well-rounded, upstanding citizen. Officer Martin left a lasting impact on the communities he was part of, and we should follow the example that he set for us.  These trying times serve as a reminder to show our appreciation to those who watch over our communities and run to danger. We can look to the words of wisdom from an Iowa mother who lost her son, Officer Carlos Puente-Morales, in the line of duty earlier this year. As she said, ``We shouldn't wait for a tragedy to recognize our heroes.'' We should all live by this sentiment and show appreciation to the brave men and women who walk in the footsteps of Officer Martin and Sergeant Beminio to protect and serve our communities across the country.                          ____________________
