President, I ask unanimous consent that when the Senate completes its business today, it recess until 10 a.m. on Friday, May 28; that following the prayer and pledge, the Journal of proceedings be approved to date, the time for the two leaders be reserved for their use later in the day, and the Senate proceed to a period of morning business, with Senators permitted to speak for up to 10 minutes each.
