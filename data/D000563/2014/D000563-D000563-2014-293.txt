Bush, and is currently enforced by this President. And what the Senator from Texas is suggesting is that the law in and of itself has at least a loophole or an opening that if the person doesn't appear in court--the young child or the parent with the child--then they could be lost in our system. The Senator from Texas seems to be suggesting we need to change the law or at least address the law.  I have two questions. Will the Senator concede the fact that President Obama is enforcing the law as it is written? Secondly, what would the Senator do with these children once they show up in the United States?  Let's assume you had a 12-year-old child--which is a case I heard lastnight--on top of a freight train for 4 days; finally made it into the United States, possibly at the hands of a coyote or smuggler--I make no excuse for them--pushed across the river, or Rio Grande, in a raft and told to report to the first person in uniform? What would the Senator have us do with the child at that point?
