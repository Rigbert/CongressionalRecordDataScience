 I would like to address the issue that the chairman of the Judiciary Committee raised, and I am glad he stayed in the Chamber. I could not disagree with him more. If this really is a contest over the professionalism of Attorney General Janet Reno, I feel very confident to stand by her. On four separate occasions, Attorney General Reno has exercised the right to call for an independent counsel within the Clinton administration, three of those counsel investigating members appointed to the President's Cabinet and a fourth investigating the Whitewater controversy involving the Clinton family itself. It is very clear to me that Attorney General Reno is calling these as she sees them.  Look at the situation that we now have before us. The Speaker of the House of Representatives, Mr. Gingrich, leaders of the Republican Party, all come forward and say that if Attorney General Reno does not ask for an independent counsel, they are going do drag her up to Capitol Hill, put her before the committee, maybe put her under oath, and demand to know why she has not called for an independent counsel.  I suggest to my colleagues in the Senate the independent counsel statute itself is hanging on by a slender thread if we try to politicize this process and pressure the Attorney General into calling for an investigation where it is not warranted.  Keep in mind the creation of this statute came from an era when President Nixon fired Archibald Cox as a special prosecutor, the so-called Saturday Night Massacre. The independent counsel statute was created to try to put in place a third party or a dispassionate or a detached approach to investigations. And now, because those in the majority, the Republican Party, are dissatisfied that Attorney General Reno has not called for an independent counsel, you hear all sorts of comments about we are going to put the pressure on her; we are going to bring her up here and put her before a committee to answer all these questions.
