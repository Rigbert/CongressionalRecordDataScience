 Senator Obama defines middle class as everyone below $150,000. Senator Obama defines as a neutral area those earning between $150,000 and $250,000. Senator Obama defines families earning above $250,000 as upper class.  Now that we have the stated definitions of middle class, let's take a look at where Senators McCain and Obama would change the current family tax rate. If you take a look at Senator McCain's plan, you can get a handle of where he wants to cut middle-class taxes. In effect, you can get an idea of where Senator McCain believes further middle-class tax relief ought to go. Senator McCain would lower current law levels of taxation in two widely applicable proposals. The first would double the dependent personal exemption for a family of four. This relief would apply to taxpayers with incomes up to $120,000. This new tax relief would be phased out for those families between $50,000 and $120,000. I have a chart that shows which groups of families would be affected by Senator McCain's tax proposal. It is called the regular tax, between $32,000 and $132,000, by increasing the dependent personal exemption from $3,500 to $7,000.  The other area of family tax relief that Senator McCain is targeting is relief from the alternative minimum tax. During the last couple of weeks, the House and Senate have debated AMT extension bills. Take a look at the Congressional Record and examine the debate. If you do, you will see nearly all the Democrats and most Republicans in both bodies describe the overreach of the alternative minimum tax as a middle-class family tax problem. If the AMT patch is almost universally defined as middle-class tax relief, then a fair question is: Who benefits from this fix?  I have a chart that shows this. The chart refers to a Joint Committee on Taxation analysis of the last fix that became law, meaning the 2007 alternative minimum tax fix. You can see how it affected people in different categories. You will see from the chart that the AMT patch benefited families between $40,000 and $50,000 on the low end. And as we travel across the chart, you will see the biggest category of families benefiting to be in the $75,000 to $100,000 category and the $100,000 to $200,000 category. Roughly half the families benefiting, over 9 million, earned between $100,000 and $200,00. On the higher end, we find about half a million families earning between $200,000 and $500,000 also benefited from making sure that the alternative minimum tax doesn't hit middle-income people, a group of people who could be hit if Congress didn't fix it from year to year so that they didn't get hit. This year that number is 23 million people who would get hit if the Senate hadn't passed the bill we did last week.  The AMT patch relief conforms to polling data on how Americans define themselves. The AMT patch problem that the patch remedies spreads across a broad swath of American taxpayers, as we saw from the chart.  Senator McCain's second major tax relief proposal would build upon the alternative minimum tax fix. Senator McCain would extend the alternative minimum tax fix and enlarge it, starting in the year 2013. Under Senator McCain's plan, we would start to reduce the reach of the alternative minimum tax by expanding the patch by 5 percent per year on top of the increase in exemption amount of the patch for inflation. That proposal would provide more relief to some of the 4 million families currently paying the alternative minimum tax.  If we step back and take a look, we see that Senator McCain would further reduce regular taxes for families between $32,000 and $120,000. Again, we have up the same chart. Senator McCain would extend the AMT patch and gradually enhance it, and most of the families who would benefit from the AMT patch have incomes between $50,000 on the low end and $200,000 on the high. So it looks as if Senator McCain's operational definition of middle class probably conforms to the definition that we find in public opinion polls.  Senator Obama's stated definition of the middle class, in terms of further tax relief, consists of taxpayers earning under $150,000. Let's take a look at how his plan would operate. Senator Obama used a different definition of middle class in contrasting his tax relief plan with that of Senator McCain. Here is what Senator Obama's campaign said:       According to the Tax Policy Center, the Obama plan provides      three times as much tax relief for middle-class families as      the McCain plan.  Behind that claim is a comparison of the Tax Policy Center analysis of Senators McCain's and Obama's plans, proposals on families in the middle-income quintile. The middle-income quintile refers to the middle 20 percent of all families in America. According to the Tax Policy Center, that band of income runs between $37,596 and $66,354. I have a chart that depicts the band of income that would represent that middle income. We would point here to Senator Obama's tax relief down there, the light blue, between $37,000 and the $66,000 figures. As we can see, this is a much smaller group, 20 percent of the population topping out a bit above $66,000 a year income. That is far below the $150,000 and $250,000 figures Senator Obama mentioned in the Fox News interview I placed in the Record.  On the AMT patch, Senator Obama supports his words ``fiscally responsible'' AMT reform, whatever that vague concept means. Unlike Senator McCain, Senator Obama conditions extension of the AMT patch on his notion of ``fiscal responsibility.'' The Tax Policy Center assumes that this means that Senator Obama would extend the AMT patch and index it for inflation. However, this is just one think tank's interpretation of Senator Obama's statement that he supports fiscally responsible AMT reform. But for the sake of comparison, at least until 2013, the two candidates seem to be targeting the same middle-class family population. I depicted that band of middle-class tax relief on the chart, as we can see.  When we look at how both plans operate, Senator McCain's plan targets new regular family tax relief at middle-class families between $32,000 and $120,000. Senator Obama targets new regular family tax relief at middle-class families between $38,000 and $66,000. Both candidates target the same population for AMT patch extension. Senator McCain proposes additional alternative minimum tax relief by expanding the AMT patch in the year 2013 and beyond.  Let's turn to the second question. The question is, How will Senators McCain and Obama deal with middle-class family tax relief that will expire? The bipartisan tax cuts, from 2001 and 2003, provide a very large amount of tax relief to middle-class families. So the question is, Should we allow this tax relief to expire, as it will at the end of 2010? And if Congress doesn't do anything, as you have heard me say, we will get the biggest tax increase in the history of the country without even a vote of Congress because that is what sunsets do. You go back to old law. These 2001 and 2003 bipartisan tax cuts are set to expire at the end of 2010. If these tax cuts are extended, then in 2011 a married couple making $50,000 with two children would save an average of $2,300 on their tax bill. It is clear enough. I don't have to dwell on what the chart says. If we don't do anything for this class of taxpayers, the tax bill is going to go up $2,300 per year.  Likewise, you can take any class of people, but let's look at a single mom with two kids who makes $30,000 a year. She would save an average of $1,100 off of her tax bill in 2011, if the 2001 and 2003 tax cuts are extended--the same wall only with different figures. The 2001 and 2003 bipartisan tax relief bills provide much needed tax relief, almost all of which is scheduled to expire by the end of 2010. This bipartisan tax relief doubled the child tax credit, allowed this child tax credit to be used against any AMT liability, and made a large portion of this child tax credit refundable. This bipartisan tax relief also permanently extended the adoption tax credit and increased the credit to $10,000 per child. This bipartisan tax relief also increased the dependent care credit to a maximum of $6,000. In addition, it also provided tax relief from the marriage penalty. This bipartisan tax relief also provided a number of tax relief provisions to help make education more affordable.  For example, one provision gave a deduction up to $4,000 for college tuition and related expenses. In addition, another provision increased the annual limit on contributions to education IRAs from $500 a year to $2,000 a year.  I believe it is useful to look at where the candidates have been with respect to their positions on middle-class tax relief. Senator McCain has consistently supported middle-class tax relief in his Senate career. As far as I am aware, Senator McCain has never voted to raise taxes on middle-income families. Senator McCain helped prevent tax increases on middle-income families in 2004 by voting for the Working Families Tax Relief Act of 2004. Senator McCain's budget votes have consistently provided room for the extension of the lower income tax rates as well as suspension of the harmful PEP and PEASE provisions that are now being phased out because of the 2001 tax bill. In addition, Senator McCain has been consistently a supporter of even the repeal of those two provisions.  On the other hand, Senator Obama voted for the Democratic budget and the budget conference report this year that did not provide room to protect Americans in the 25-, 28-, 33-, and 35-percent tax brackets from being hit with this tax increase that will automatically happen at the end of 2010 because of sunsets. So we get, as I said once before, the biggest tax increase in the history of the country, without a vote of Congress.  According to the IRS, single individuals falling within the 25-percent bracket in 2008 start at taxable income of more than $32,550. They earn taxable income of no more than $78,850. Singles in the 28-percent bracket will earn taxable income of more than $78,850 or less than $164,550.  Senator Obama said in the Presidential candidates' September 26, 2008, debate he would not raise taxes a dime on people making under $250,000. But his two budget votes in 2008 do not provide room for him to keep that promise. In fact, he could not even make good on that promise to those singles making over $32,550 on taxable income based on the Democratic budget he voted for.  Instead, these taxpayers with over $32,550 in taxable income would be hit with a hidden marginal tax rate increase in the PEP and PEASE categories as well as a transparent marginal tax rate increase according to the budget that Senator Obama voted for.  I turn now to the harmful alternative minimum tax, or the AMT. Both parties agree the AMT is a tax on the middle class that the middle class should never have to pay. Why it hits them--and they should never have to pay it--and why Congress takes corrective action is because it was never indexed. In addition, both parties deserve blame for the problem we have, that the AMT is not indexed. However, the Omnibus Budget Reconciliation Act of 1993, passed strictly on party-line votes by a Democratic majority and signed into law by President Clinton, did even a lot more damage to the alternative minimum tax.  In the 1993 tax bill, the exemption level was increased to $33,750 for individuals and $45,000 for joint returns, but this was accompanied by yet great increases beyond what was already in law. Importantly, as in previous bills related to the AMT, these exemption amounts were not indexed for inflation. By the way, the 1993 tax increase was passed on strictly party-line votes, with the Democrats supplying the majority.  Once again, graduated rates were introduced, except this time they were 26 percent and 28 percent. By tinkering with the rate, as well as the exemption level of the AMT, these bills were only doing what Congress has been doing on a bipartisan basis for almost 40 years, which is to undertake a wholly inadequate approach to the problem that keeps getting bigger. By ``problem'' I mean taxing middle-income people by the alternative minimum tax--a class of people whom it was never supposed to apply to.  Aside from this futile tinkering I suggested from the 1993 bill, Congress--and, of course, we have tinkered with the AMT over the years to keep it from hitting additional middle class--Congress has in other circumstances completely ignored the impact of tax legislation on taxpayers caught by the AMT. In the 1990s, a series of tax credits, such as the child tax credit and the lifetime learning credit, were adopted without any regard to the AMT. The AMT limited the use of nonrefundable credits, and that did not change.  However, Congress quickly realized the ridiculousness of this situation and waived the AMT disallowance of nonrefundable personal credits, but it only did it through the year 1998. In 1999, the issue again had to be dealt with. The Congress passed the Taxpayer Refund and Relief Act of 1999. In the Senate, only Republicans voted for the bill. That bill included a provision to finally repeal the alternative minimum tax that was on the books from 1969 to that point. Senator McCain voted in favor of this bill to repeal the AMT. However, then-President Clinton vetoed the bill. So we still continued to have the alternative minimum tax.  Later on, in 1999, an extenders bill, including a fix good through 2001, was enacted which held harmless AMT for a little while longer.  In 2001, we departed from these temporary piecemeal solutions to fix the AMT through the tax bill of 2001. That bill permanently allowed the child tax credit, the adoption tax credit, and the IRA contribution credit to be claimed against a taxpayer's AMT. While this was certainly not a complete solution, it was a step in the right direction. More importantly, the 2001 bill was a bipartisan effort to stop the further intrusion of the alternative minimum tax hitting the middle class. The package Senator Baucus and I put together effectively prevented inflation from pulling anyone else into the AMT through the year 2005.  Our friends in the House originally wanted to enact a hold harmless only through the end of 2001. But the final compromise bill signed by the President increased the AMT exemption amount through 2005. Since the 2001 tax relief bill, the Finance Committee has produced bipartisan packages to continue to increase exemption amounts to keep taxpayers ahead of inflation, including the bill of 2005. Most currently, the 2007 AMT patch was extended in late 2007. Hopefully, the House will go along with what we did last week, and we will extend that through 2008.  These packages put together since 2001 are very unique in that they are the first sustained attempt undertaken by Congress to stem the spread of the AMT through inflation, hitting the middle class who was never intended to be hit.  Now, admittedly, these were nothing but short-term fixes. But they illustrate a comprehension of the AMT inflation problem and what needs to be done to solve it.  I now look at how the candidates have voted with respect to the AMT. Senator McCain has consistently voted to protect Americans from the alternative minimum tax. Senator McCain voted for the Tax Refund and Reconciliation Act of 1999, which contained a proposal to completely phase out the AMT. In fact, in the Senate, that conference report passed on Republican votes only, including Senator McCain's. In 2001, when the AMT patch began, Senator McCain supported the Senate version of the tax relief bill that patched the AMT for a longer period of time. Moreover, Senator McCain voted for the Tax Increase Prevention and Reconciliation Act of 2005 and later bills that extended the AMT patch.  In stark contrast to Senator McCain's voting record of providing relief from the AMT, Senator Obama voted against the AMT patch contained in the Tax Increase Prevention and Reconciliation Act of 2005. Also, Senator Obama opposed Republican budgets in 2005 and 2006 that provided revenue room for the AMT patch. Senator Obama supported the 2007 Democratic budget that omitted any revenue room for such an AMT patch. In 2008, Senator Obama supported the Democratic budget that, for the first time in this election year, provided some tax relief revenue room for fixing the AMT.  Senator McCain supported the 2008 Republican budget that provided similar revenue room for the AMT.  Therefore, when looking at each candidate's voting record, the conclusion that becomes apparent is Senator McCain has been much more supportive of middle-class tax relief than Senator Obama.  I will now turn to that third and final question I posed at the beginning of my remarks: What new proposals do the candidates offer on middle-class tax relief? We are going to move from the actions of the candidates and look, instead, at their words and what we can anticipate on whoever is sworn in on January 20 next year.  Let's take a look at Senator McCain's tax plan. Senator McCain proposes to extend all of the 2001 and 2003 bipartisan tax relief. In other words, for the most part, it seems to me you can say Senator McCain does not want to increase taxes, by keeping the present tax policy basically where it has been, at least as far as not sunsetting in 2010 what we did in 2001 and 2003 and, hence, not get the biggest tax increase in the history of the country, without even a vote of Congress, because that is what happens when those tax provisions expire. Also, that is where you go back to that family of four getting a $2,300 tax increase on a married couple making $50,000. Likewise, a single mom with two kids who makes $30,000 a year would save an average of $1,100 if the 2001 and 2003 tax cuts are extended. Now, we have gone through those figures before, but they are up here on the chart so you can recall what I previously had said. But I think it is necessary to emphasize it because that is exactly what is going to happen at the end of 2010 if Congress does not step in and keep the American people, but, more importantly, the American economy, from being harmedby the biggest tax increase in the history of the country without a vote of the Congress.  In addition, Senator McCain proposes additional AMT relief by expanding the AMT patch in 2013 by indexing the patch by an additional 5 percent per year in addition to the indexing done for inflation, until the joint exemption amount is $143,000, at which time the patch would only be indexed for inflation. Therefore, those families making $143,000 and below would eventually be exempt from the AMT, and this $143,000 amount would be indexed for inflation.  Senator McCain would also double the dependent exemption from the current amount of $3,500 to $7,000. Senator McCain proposes to do this by increasing the dependent exemption by $500 each year beginning in 2010, until it reaches that $7,000 by the year 2016.  Therefore, this would provide significant additional tax savings for any married couple or single parent with one or more children. The tax relief provided by the doubling of the dependent exemption would be in addition to tax relief provided by the alternative minimum tax patch and extension of the 2001 and 2003 tax cuts.  Now, let's look at Senator Obama. He has said he is in favor of extending what he calls the Bush tax cuts, except for those Americans who make over $250,000 a year. As I have mentioned before, these should not be referred to as the ``Bush tax cuts,'' because if President Bush had gotten his way in 2001, they would have been much more than what they were. So Senator Baucus and I sat down in 2001. We were the leaders of the Finance Committee, as we are still; in his case, the chairman now, and I am ranking Republican. We worked on a bipartisan basis and did something significantly different than what President Bush wanted to do.  Regardless, Senator Obama says he would extend all of the 2001 and 2003 bipartisan tax relief for those making $250,000 or less. This includes the provision I discussed above regarding the 2001 and 2003 bipartisan tax relief, including lowering some of the marginal tax rates, providing marriage penalty relief and doubling the amount of the child tax credit to $1,000 per child.  Although Senator Obama's voting record might indicate otherwise, Senator Obama claims that he is in favor of ``fiscally responsible AMT reform.'' The Tax Policy Center assumes this means using the alternative minimum tax patch and indexing that patch for inflation to prevent more middle-class Americans from being hit by the AMT each year.  Senator Obama is proposing a new $500 tax credit called the making work pay credit that has the effect of exempting the first $8,100 of earnings from the Social Security tax. He also proposes a credit of up to $800 equal to 10 percent of the mortgage interest paid by Americans who do not itemize deductions.  Senator Obama also proposes turning the current nonrefundable saver's tax credit into a refundable credit, and the maximum credit for a married couple is $500.  Senator Obama proposes to rename the HOPE and lifetime learning credit by calling it the American opportunity tax credit. In addition, he would like to increase the maximum amount of this refundable credit from $1,800 to $4,000 and to make the credit refundable.  Finally, Senator Obama claims he wants to expand the earned-income tax credit in various ways. He also claims he wants to expand the child and dependent care credit by making it refundable.  I turn now to examine whether Senator McCain's and Senator Obama's promises regarding middle-class tax relief are realistic. Even if we assume both Senators want to enact all the tax cuts they are promising, could they deliver on these promises?  The nominally nonpartisan Tax Policy Center estimates that Senator Obama's tax plan will lose $2.9 trillion over 10 years when compared to current law. I have used this chart before in my speeches. I won't go into detail, but you can see the Obama plan is the top red line there which says how much it would lose. As I mentioned in a previous speech, this $2.9 trillion figure inaccurately assumes that Senator Obama's plan will be partially offset by $925 billion in revenue raisers. The Tax Policy Center refers to Senator Obama's $925 billion number as an ``unverifiable campaign-provided revenue estimate.'' As I mentioned in that previous speech, a more realistic estimate of revenue raisers over 10 years is approximately $220 billion, meaning Senator Obama's tax plan would actually lose another $705 billion in revenue. Therefore, the total revenue lost from Senator Obama's plan is not $2.9 trillion over 10 years but instead is approximately $3.6 trillion over 10 years.  The figure for Senator McCain's plan is higher. As my colleagues can see, the Tax Policy Center shows Senator McCain's plan to prevent widespread tax increases would lose revenue of $4.2 trillion over 10 years. In addition, as I mentioned in my prior remarks to the Senate, Senator McCain's proposal assumes revenue raisers of $365 billion. If we net that $365 billion number against the known revenue raisers number of $220 billion, we find that Senator McCain's plan is short of revenue raisers by $145 billion. Therefore, adding this $145 billion to the revenue loss of $4.2 trillion that the Tax Policy Center estimates for Senator McCain's tax relief plan results in total revenue loss of $4.3 trillion.  The National Taxpayers Union, also referred to around here as the NTU, is a nonpartisan public policy research organization. The NTU's analysis, updated September 25, 2008, says that Senator McCain's plan would include new spending of $92.4 billion per year. According to the NTU, this would result in spending increases of $924 billion over 10 years. Adding this $924 billion in estimated new spending to the revenue loss from Senator McCain's tax plan, this results in a total of $5.2 trillion of revenue loss, plus spending for Senator McCain's plan.  Now let's look at Senator Obama's tax and spending plans. Would Senator Obama's Democratic colleagues who have an obsession with pay-as-you-go on the tax side but not on the spending side, including House Blue Dog Democrats, go along with increasing the deficit approximately $3.6 trillion by Senator Obama's proposed tax cuts? This is even before taking into account the spending increases Senator Obama is proposing.  According to the nonpartisan NTU's analysis, which was updated September 25, 2008, Senator Obama has proposed to increase spending by $293 billion per year, which amounts to $2.9 trillion in additional spending over the 10-year window the Congressional Budget Office uses. Therefore, Senator Obama is proposing tax and spending programs that would increase the deficit by $6.5 trillion before even considering the cost of interest resulting from such an astronomical addition to our national debt. Therefore, Senator Obama proposes to increase the national debt by a whopping $1.3 trillion more than Senator McCain over that next 10-year period.  A portion of Senator Obama's March 13, 2006, speech regarding fiscal responsibility is posted on his campaign Web site. A portion of this speech states:       If Washington were serious about honest tax relief in this      country, we would see an effort to reduce our national debt      by returning to responsible fiscal policies.  Senator Obama's proposal to increase the national debt by $6.5 trillion is inconsistent with his statement regarding a return to fiscally responsible policy.  Even if he really did want to provide the tax relief he is promising, would a Democratic Congress let Senator Obama make good on most of his promises that would provide middle-class tax relief? Also, would a Democratic Congress fight attempts by Senator McCain to enact the tax relief proposals he has made?  Similar promises to those made by Senator Obama were made by candidate Clinton in 1992. Candidate Clinton said taxes wouldn't be raised on people making under $200,000 a year. However, President Clinton then raised taxes on everyone making $20,000 and over in 1993.  Perhaps Senator Obama would be able to provide some of the tax relief he has been promising but only to those Americans falling within his narrow version of the middle class, stopping at individuals making $66,000 or less, that he has been using in his campaign ads stating that he will provide three times more tax breaks than Senator McCain. Senator Obama has changed his definition of the middle class from $250,000 and below in his public statements to those making$66,000 and below in his campaign ads and on his campaign Web site. This is definitely a change, but if you make more than $66,000, I wouldn't think this is a change you would ever want to believe in. One man's change is another man's flip-flop.  Considering the history when the Democratic Party has had control of the House, the Senate, and the Presidency--and I am going to put my thermometer chart back up here--considering the history of when the Democratic Party had control of the House, the Senate, and the Presidency, are you confident that Democrats won't raise taxes on you if you make $67,000, which is above the middle class, according to one of Senator Obama's two inconsistent definitions of middle class? As history has shown us, the largest tax increases come when Democrats control the House, the Senate, and the Presidency, and you see it at the top of the thermometer there. The lowest levels of taxation happen when you have a Republican President and you have a Republican Congress. As you look at the bottom, the figures appear at the bottom of the thermometer.  We need to carefully scrutinize Senator Obama's claims that Senator McCain wouldn't provide any tax relief at all for 100 million Americans, citing the IRS statistics of income tax stats. Moreover, Senator Obama has criticized Senator McCain's tax relief plan by saying that Senator McCain's plan would not provide any direct tax cut other than increasing the dependent exemption. Even the nominally nonpartisan Tax Policy Center states that Senator McCain would provide tax cuts for all Americans, as did the 2001 and 2003 bipartisan tax relief packages.                               Exhibit 1       Q: Is there a standard, accepted definition of what      constitutes the ``middle class''?       Is there a standard, accepted definition of what      constitutes the ``middle class''? Politicians are fond of      talking about how the middle class will be affected by      policies and laws, but rarely do they define who is actually      part of that group.       A: No, there isn't. ``Middle class'' means different things      to different people--and politicians.       There is no standard definition, and in fact, an      overwhelming majority of Americans say they are ``middle      class'' or ``upper-middle class'' or ``working class'' in      public opinion polls. Hardly anybody considers themselves      ``lower class'' or ``upper class'' in America.       It's possible to come up with a definition of what      constitutes ``middle income,'' but it will depend on how      large a slice of the middle one prefers. If we look at U.S.      Census Bureau statistics, which divide household income into      quintiles, we could say that the ``middle'' quintile, or 20      percent, might be the ``middle'' class. In 2006, the average      income for households in that middle group was $48,561 and      the upper limit was $60,224. But we could just as reasonably      use another Census figure, median family income. In 2006, the      median--or ``middle''--income for a family of four was      $70,354. Half of all four-person families made more; half      made less.       Journalist Chris Baker examined the ambiguous meaning of      the term ``middle class'' in a 2003 Washington Times story.      He, too, found no generally accepted definition, but he did      get this broad one from Jared Bernstein, an economist at the      liberal Economic Policy Institute: ``There are working      families who can pay their bills, but they have to really      think about such minimal expenditures as picking up a pizza      after work, going to the movies, making a long-distance      telephone call. They may have some investments, but they      depend on each paycheck for their well-being.''       But others could have different definitions. Baker      interviewed a man who earned about $100,000 a year and a      woman who made $35,000, both of whom said they were middle      class.       Public opinion polls show how slippery the term can be. An      Oct. 2007 poll by the Kaiser Family Foundation, Harvard      School of Public Health and National Public Radio asked 1,527      adults what income level makes a family of four middle class.      About 60 percent said a family earning $50,000 or $60,000 fit      that description. But 42 percent answered an income of      $40,000 and 48 percent said $80,000 were both middle class.       Other polls suggest that 90 percent or more of Americans      consider themselves to be ``middle class'' or ``upper-middle      class'' or ``working class.'' An April 2007 poll by CBS News      found that of 994 adults surveyed only 2 percent said they      were ``upper class,'' and 7 percent said they were ``lower      class.'' In another poll, taken by Gallup/USA Today in May      2006, 1 percent said they were ``upper class,'' and 6 percent      said they were ``lower class.'' Interestingly, since 12.3      percent of Americans were living below the official federal      poverty level in 2006, these poll findings suggest many who      are officially poor still consider themselves to be ``middle      class'' or ``working class.''       So what do politicians mean when they say ``the middle      class''? Good question. Each politician may be talking about      a different group of Americans, but the message many voters      hear is that the politician is talking about them.       For example, Democratic presidential candidate John Edwards      calls for ``tax breaks to honor and strengthen three pillars      of America's middle class: savings, work, and families.'' One      of his proposals is to expand a tax credit to give dollar-     for-dollar matches on savings up to $500 a year. Some version      of that credit would be available to families earning up to      $75,000.       Republican candidate Mitt Romney, meanwhile, has proposed      eliminating ``taxes on dividends, capital gains, and interest      on middle class families.'' He defines ``middle class'' as      anyone with an adjusted gross income of under $200,000--and      acknowledges that such a proposal would affect ``over 95      percent of American families.''--Lori Robertson                                sources       U.S. Census Bureau. 2006 American Community Survey.
