Madam Chairman, I yield myself such time as I may consume. Madam Chairman, the gentlewoman from Idaho (Mrs. Chenoweth-Hage) makes a lot of arguments about the designation of monuments, but this bill has nothing to do with monuments. In fact, very frankly, I do not think if this amendment was adopted, it would stop the President from designating monuments. Only on Federal lands can monuments be created, and it has to be by an edict of the President.  As my colleagues know, the gentleman from Utah (Mr. Hansen) introduced the bill, and we voted for that bill, and it moved out of the House and sent it over to the Senate to, in fact, keep this type of action from occurring. I supported that and voted for it. Because I think what has been done in Escalante, what was done in Alaska by Stewart Udall, those things were done incorrectly. But that was the prerogative of the President. Until we change that law, that is the only way we can address that problem.  But under this bill, it does not pertain to the monument problem at all. There is no money spent out of this bill for monuments. There is no action out of this bill for monuments. In fact, this bill has nothing to do with monuments.  Now, although I sympathize with the gentlewoman from Idaho (Mrs. Chenoweth-Hage) and the problem of monuments, in fact, I would support it, have supported the legislation, this is not the place to try to have an amendment adopted to solve that problem. In fact, I oppose the amendment. I strongly object to the amendment.  Madam Chairman, I reserve the balance of my time.
