I am happy for my fiends in Washington State that their apples are going to Japan. That is great. But at 50 cents an apple, with a $60 billion trade deficit with Japan, all we have to do is sell the Japanese 120 billion apples this year and we will be in trade balance. That is a great deal. Now, that is going to be a lot of apple-eating for the Japanese.
