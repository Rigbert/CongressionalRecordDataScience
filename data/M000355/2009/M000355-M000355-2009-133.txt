 President, reserving the right to object, and I will not object, I would just like to point out we have had some difficulty actually on both sides getting to the two votes that are designated in this consent agreement.  Our side of the aisle, the Republican side of the aisle, was prepared to vote on both of those amendments tonight. Then a problem developed on the other side, which I understand because we had had a problem on our side earlier. But I do just want to make it clear that Republicans were prepared and fully ready and willing to vote on the two amendments in the consent agreement tonight.  Mr. President, I do not object.
