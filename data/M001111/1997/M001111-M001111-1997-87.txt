 President, I am delighted to once again join my colleague from Vermont, Senator James Jeffords, in introducing the James P. Grant World Summit for Children Implementation Act. I particularly want to pay tribute to Senator Jeffords for his continuing leadership in the effort to aid all children.  The World Summit for Children Implementation Act is our effort to ensure that the United States implements the plan of action adopted at the 1990 United Nations World Summit for Children. Our legislation proposes a series of life-saving, cost-effective programs to protect the health and well-being of children worldwide. Importantly, while this legislation proposes several increases in individual foreign assistance programs, it does not call for an increase in overall foreign aid levels.  Specifically, the Jeffords-Murray bill increases funding allocations for child survival, basic education, vitamin A and other micronutrients, UNICEF, AIDS prevention and care, refugee assistance, and family planning. Our bill also calls for an increase in funding for two important domestic programs: WIC and Head Start.  The world's children have a right to adequate nutrition, full immunization, a decent education, and health care. The United States has traditionally led the way in promoting the well-being of children. Because the nations of the world are more interdependent than ever before, the well-being of children around the globe affects us here in the United States. Children are not just the foundation of our society and our future; they are truly the foundation of the future of the world.  According to UNICEF, more than 33,000 children die each and every day; most from easily preventable diseases. The under 5 mortality rate for children in the least developed countries is 20 times greater than that of the United States and other industrialized nations.  More than 2 million children under age 5 die each year from vaccine preventable diseases like diphtheria, measles, pertussis, polio, tuberculosis, and tetanus. Diarrhoeal diseases, often caused by a total lack of clean sanitation facilities and clean water, kill an additional 3 million children per year. And for every child that dies, several more live on with stunted growth, ill health, and diminished potential.  The world's political leadership can ill-afford to ignore these statistics. These are just the mortality statistics for young children. Equally disturbing figures are available regarding access to education, the treatment of young girls, nutrition, and child labor. Clearly, our work on behalf of children is far from completed. While we have much to celebrate, we have much more to do. And I am delighted to be joining Senator Jeffords to unequivocally state our belief that the United States must continue to champion the future health, education, and economic well-being of children everywhere.  Importantly, to reach children, we must reach out to the world's women including young mothers, family providers, and elders. Women are often overlooked in tradition development programs. Fortunately, the WorldSummit for Children recognized to improve the lot of children, the status of women also had to improve.  For example, recognizing the important link between child survival and family planning, the World Summit for Children called for universal access to family planning education and services by the end of this decade.  Family planning saves the lives of both women and children. We know that babies born in quick succession to a mother whose body has not yet recovered from a previous birth are the least likely to survive. Increasing funds in this area has been a top priority for me in my work in the Senate, and is addressed positively in the legislation we are introducing today.  Basic education is another important component of this legislation. Of the 143 million children in the developing world not attending school, 56 percent are girls. Of the world's 900 million illiterate adults, nearly two thirds are women. World Bank studies have estimated that each additional year of education for a young girl results in a 10-percent decrease in birth rates and child death rates, and a 10 to 20 percent increase in wages earned.  Foreign aid is never a popular item. I applaud Secretary of State Madeleine Albright for her advocacy work in support of foreign aid and U.S. assistance abroad. And I am pleased that the both bodies of the Congress have voted to provide additional moneys for foreign assistance in fiscal year 1998. In my view, our foreign aid dollars are best spent when we are investing in programs that strengthen families around the globe, and give a special hand to women and children.  That is exactly what Senator Jeffords and I propose to do with the James P. Grant World's Summit for Children Implementation Act. I urge my colleagues to review and support this important legislation.                                 ______                                       By
