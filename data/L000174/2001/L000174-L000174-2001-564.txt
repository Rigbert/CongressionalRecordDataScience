President, I am today introducing the Landmine Elimination Act of 2001. I am joined by Senators Collins, Bingaman, Crapo, Conrad, Specter, Feinstein, Rockefeller, McConnell, Kerry, Sarbanes, Dorgan, Jeffords, Reed, Harkin, Mikulski, Murray, Feingold, Torricelli, and Durbin.  This legislation does three things.  It expresses the sense of Congress that the Department of Defense should field currently available weapons, other technologies, tactics and operational concepts which provide suitable alternatives to landmines. It is our view that such alternatives exist and are, in fact, better suited than mines to protect United States Armed Forces in today's fast-moving battlefield. This view is shared by many active and retired military officers.  The bill calls on the United States to end its use of mines, and to join the Convention on the Prohibition of Anti-Personnel Mines as soon as possible. It also codifies the U.S. moratorium on mine exports, which has been in effect since 1992 and is official United States policy. Finally, it establishes an inter-agency working group to develop a comprehensive plan for expanded mine action programs, including programs to assist mine victims.  Mr. President, the havoc wreaked by landmines throughout the world is well known. They have been responsible for by far the majority of casualties of NATO and peacekeeping forces in the Balkans. They were a cause of American casualties in Somalia. They maimed and killed thousands of our troops in Vietnam. And, most often, they cripple and kill innocent civilians, thousands and thousands each year.  In 1992, the United States became the first country to stop exporting landmines. That led other countries to take similar action, and in 1994 President Clinton called for an international treaty banning the weapons. That treaty, which came into force in 1998, has been signed by 139 countries and ratified by 110.  The United States is not among them, because of concerns at the time about Korea and the fact that the treaty would require the United States to stop using most of its anti-vehicle mines. Those were not frivolous concerns, although I do not believe either issue was fully understood or examined when the decision was made, and I have worked to obtain the funds to develop alternatives to mines.  Over the past year, however, I and others have spent a great deal of time discussing these issues with both active and retired military officers. These discussions have revealed a number of interesting facts, which I intend to discuss with Secretary Rumsfeld, the Joint Chiefs, President Bush and others. Most importantly, I and others have become convinced that landmines are inconsistent with current U.S. military doctrine. They are neither cost effective nor compatible with our highly mobile forces, and in fact they pose serious logistical problems and dangers for our troops. We can do better, and we should be working together to get rid of these outdated weapons. It is not necessary to waste years developing costly new alternatives. We have the ``smart'' weapons and other technologies to more effectively protect our Armed Forces.  I look forward to the day when the United States joins the Treaty, because I am convinced that without U.S. participation and leadership the Treaty will never achieve its promise. But having said that, I have never regarded the Treaty as a kind of ``holy grail'' of landmines. My interest in this issue, which dates to 1989 when I met a young Honduran boy who had lost a leg from a mine, has always been to achieve a mine-free world. That is an ambitious goal, but it is the right goal. And regardless of when the U.S. joins the Treaty, we can develop a mine-free military.  Ironically, when that happens, the United States, which at times has been unfairly blamed for causing the mine problem, will become the world's leader on this issue. We will have ended not only our use of anti-personnel mines, which the Treaty prohibits, but also of anti-vehicle mines, which, while not prohibited by the Treaty, are responsible for the indiscriminate deaths and injuries of countless innocent people.  I look forward to an opportunity to work with the Department of Defense and the White House to develop a common approach, because the issue is no longer whether we develop a mine-free military, but when. It is a far more political issue than a military issue, and it is time to leave past disagreements and disappointments behind and work together on this common goal.  The problem of landmines continues to be an issue of deep concern to people across this country and around the world. This week, hundreds of people from dozens of countries are in Washington to focus attention on this issue. Among them is Her Majesty Queen Noor, who I am honored to call a friend and who has been an eloquent advocate for a mine-free world and particularly for assistance for mine victims.  One of the purposes of this legislation is to develop more effective programs to address the urgent needs of mine victims. It is one thing for a person who has lost an arm or a leg from a mine to obtain an artificial limb. It is another to get the counseling and training to be able to earn income in poor countries where the disabled are often ostracized. We need to do what we can to help mine victims reintegrate into the social and economic life of their communities.  I want to thank the cosponsors of this legislation, who, like other legislation I have sponsored on landminesspan the political spectrum. This is not and has never been a partisan issue. It is a humanitarian issue. If landmines were a problem in our own country, they would have been prohibited years ago.  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be printed in the Record.  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the Record, as follows.                                 S. 497       Be it enacted by the Senate and the House of      Representatives of the United States of America in Congress      assembled,     SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE       This Act may be cited as the ``Landmine Elimination and      Victim Assistance Act of 2001''.     SEC. 2 FINDINGS.       Congess makes the following findings:       (1) The threat posed by tens of millions of unexploded      landmines to innocent civilians is a global problem requiring      strong United States leadership in cooperation with other      governments.       (2) Landmines continue to maim and kill thousands of      people, mostly civilians, each year, and most mine victims      lack the care and rehabilitation services they need.       (3) Landmines, which remain active for hours, days or      years, impeded the mobility and threaten the safety of United      States Armed Forces, North Atlantic Treaty Organization      forces, and other friendly forces in combat and other      military operations.       (4) At least 139 countries have signed, and 110 countries      have ratified, the Convention on the Prohibition of the Use,      Stockpiling, Production and Transfer of Anti-Personnel Mines      and on Their Destruction (opened for signature at Ottawa,      Canada, on December 3 and 4, 1997, and at the United Nations      Headquarters beginning December 5, 1997). Many of these      countries are former producers, exporters, and users of anti-     personnel mines. Worldwide adherence to the Convention would      greatly reduce the threat to future generations from anti-     personnel mines.       (5) It is United States Government policy that the United      States will search aggressively for alternatives to anti-     personnel mines and mixed anti-tank mine systems and that the      United States will join the Convention by 2006 if suitable      alternatives are fielded by then.       (6) Since 1992, United States law has prohibited the export      or transfer of anti-personnel mines.       (7) Since 1997, the United States has capped its inventory      of anti-personnel mines and has not produced anti-personnel      mines.       (8) The United States Government has contributed hundreds      of millions of dollars to the costly, dangerous, and arduous      task of humanitarian demining around the world.     SEC. 3. SENSE OF CONGRESS.       It is the sense of Congress that--       (1) the Department of Defense should field currently      available weapons, other technologies, tactics and      operational concepts that provide suitable alternatives to      anti-personnel mines and mixed anti-tank mine systems; and       (2) The United States should end its uses of such mines and      join the Convention on the Prohibition of the Use,      Stockpiling, Production and Transfer of Anti-Personnel Mines      and on Their Destruction as soon as possible.     SEC. 4. TRANSFERS OF ANTI-PERSONNEL MINES       Section 1365(c) of the National Defense Authorization Act      for Fiscal Year 1993 (22 U.S.C. 2778 note) is amended by      striking ``During'' and all that follows through ``1991--''      and inserting ``Beginning on October 23, 1992--''.     SEC. 5. INTER-AGENCY WORKING GROUP ON MINE ACTION.       Not later than 90 days after the date of the enactment of      this Act, the President shall establish an inter-agency      working group to develop a comprehensive plan for expanded      mine action programs, including mine victim rehabilitation,      social support, and economic reintegration. The working group      shall be composed of the Secretaries of State, Health and      Human Services, Veterans Affairs, Defense, Education, and the      Administrator of the Agency for International Development.      The comprehensive plan shall be developed in close      consultation with relevant nongovernmental organizations. As      part of the development of the comprehensive plan, the      working group shall determine an estimated cost of carrying      out the plan.     SEC. 6. REPORT ON ALTERNATIVES TO MINES.       No later than 120 days after the date of the enactment of      this Act, the Secretary of Defense shall submit to the      Committees on Armed Services and the Committees on      Appropriations of the Senate and the House or Representatives      a report describing actions taken by the Department of      Defense to field currently available weapons, other      technologies, tactics and operational concepts that provide      suitable alternatives to anti-personnel mines and mixed anti-     tank mine systems.                                 ______                                       By
