President, in a few minutes it is our intention to bring up the substitute amendment, to have the pending amendment withdrawn and bring up the substitute amendment. We are not quite ready for that. We are waiting for a few things to be done in a few minutes. I think it will be worked out, but the managers' amendment is going to do a lot of things to offset some of the problems people had with the bill. When that time comes, we want a chance to go over it in detail and make this a reality.
