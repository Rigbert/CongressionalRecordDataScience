President, since coming to Washington, Marcelle and I have had an opportunity to meet very special people who have become special friends. Among those are Bill and Dorothy McSweeny.  A great regret I had was having to miss Bill's surprise 70th birthday party recently, but it showed the genius of Dorothy that she was able to keep it a secret. That so many turned out shows a great respect for this multi-faceted man--people across the political spectrum and including some of the best representatives of arts and entertainment. It definitely reflected all of his background.  I would ask unanimous consent that an article in Monday, March 15th Washington Post be included in the Record at this point.  There being no objection, the article was ordered to be printed in the Record, as follows:               [From the Washington Post, Mar. 15, 1999]A Full-Blown Surprise for Bill McSweeny's Birthday, 70 Candles and 200                                 Friends                          (By Roxanne Roberts)       Some men think birthdays are depressing. Some think getting      older is preferable to the alternative, but nonetheless      annoying. Then there are the few, the happy few, who think      each birthday is a passport to wonderful new opportunities.       ``The great thing about being 70 is that you get to kiss      all the beautiful ladies,'' said. Bill McSweeny with only a      slightly wicked grin. ``When you're 70, you don't look      dangerous. Little do they know.''       The local businessman, arts advocate and community leader      was the guest of honor at a surprise party Friday night at      Ford's Theatre. What started out as a small gathering for      family ballooned into a celebration with more than 200      friends and longtime fans. Everyone was sworn to not drop a      single, solitary hint--and judging by the look at McSweeny's      face when he walked into the theater, they succeeded.       ``Who said people couldn't keep secrets in Washington?''      said his wife, Dorothy.       This was no small feat, considering the guest list included      the likes of Mayor Anthony Williams, former mayor Marion      Barry, Education Secretary Richard Riley, Dorothy Height,      Veterans Affairs Secretary Togo West, comedian Mark Russell,      WJLA anchor Paul Berry, talk show host Diane Rehm, NASA      administrator Dan Goldin, media moguls Arnaud de Borchgrave      and Phil Merrill, and former FBI director Bill Sessions. The      crowd was full of prominent Washingtonians--LaSalle Leffall,      John Hechinger, Esther Coopersmith, Marshall Coyne, Peggy      Cafritz and Frankie Hewitt, to name a few--a testament to      McSweeny's lifelong involvement with his adopted home town.       ``I met him more than 40 years ago and we've been friends      ever since,'' said Height, the president emerita of the      National Council of Negro Women. ``He's so genuine. And in      addition to everything else, he's lots of fun.''       ``When you think about people who have done something for      the community, you think about Bill,'' said Leffall. ``He's      always been there.''       McSweeny, former president of Occidental International, has      spent most of his life trying to make Washington a better      place to live. He was crucial in reopening Ford's Theatre and      has served on the boards of the Kennedy Center, Folger      Shakespeare Theatre and Helen Hayes Awards. He's been a      longtime advocate for the D.C. schools, housing and inner-     city youth, and a key fundraiser for the Lombardi Cancer      Center and other charities.       ``Bill is a real inspiration for this city,'' Williams      said. ``I think he's a real role model for every American      citizen to contribute to Washington, D.C.''       ``I think Bill McSweeny is one of God's special people on      Earth,'' said Cora Masters Barry.       They like him. They really, really like him. So his wife      and friends wanted to do something special for his 70th      birthday this month.       Problem was that the birthday boy already had decided how      he was going to celebrate. McSweeny made a deal with his wife      to bring their four children and grandchildren down to Mexico      for two weeks. The official birthday is March 31, and he      planned to scuba-dive and have a nice, low-key party on the      beach.       So, naturally, his wife of more than three decades decided      that a huge bash was exactly what he needed.       Dorothy McSweeny proceeded to issue invitations, juggle a      thousand details, lie sweetly when her husband walked in on      telephone conversations and lure her unsuspecting spouse      to the theater with the help of pals Leon and Lynn Fuerth.      It was natural to go to Ford's, where McSweeny--a longtime      member of the board--thought he was going to see      ``Eleanor: An American Love Story,'' a musical based on      the marriage of Eleanor and Franklin Roosevelt.       The hardest part for the guests was remembering not to      blurt out something stupid in advance: ``When you see someone      an awful lot, it's hard not to let the cat out of the bag,''      said Victor Shargai, who serves with McSweeny at the Kennedy      Center and Hayes awards.       The surprise worked, it seems, because the party took place      two weeks before his actual birth date. McSweeny walked in,      did a double take and slapped hand to forehead as his friends      sang a ragged rendition of ``Happy Birthday.'' There was much      hugging and kissing. Everyone looked terribly pleased,      probably because the surprise was not on them.       ``I love surprise parties--for others,'' said Leon Fuerth.       ``I want to choose the people who come to my birthday      party,'' said Diane Rehm.       ``It's about control,'' Rehm's husband, John, said      knowingly.       Luckily, McSweeny is one of those rare creatures who like      surprise parties. ``I think it's the most wonderful way of      all,'' he said. ``You don't have to worry about anything.      It's a very emotional thing to walk in and see all your      friends.''       In this case, he also got to see ``Eleanor''--any      resemblance to the current first lady is strictly      coincidental: Then the party moved downstairs to the Lincoln      Museum, where there were more hugs and kisses, a telegram      from Vice President Gore, a medal from the VA's West and a      presentation and testimonial by NASA's Goldin.       ``He helps people,'' Goldin said of McSweeny. ``In addition      to knowing people, he helps people.''       The menu consisted of McSweeny's favorite foods: hot dogs,      Boston baked beans, corn pudding and Black Forest cake.      McSweeny was having such a good time he kept inviting      everybody to his 100th birthday party.       No wonder they like him: This is an optimist, count-your-     blessings, look-to-the-future kind of guy. ``Hey, Bill!''      shouted Mark Russell. ``Seven more years and you'll be old      enough to be an astronaut!''       Meanwhile, there are plenty of ladies to kiss.                          ____________________
