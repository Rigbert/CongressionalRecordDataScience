 President, I rise today to offer legislation that provides permanent resident status to Sergio Lozano who, with his younger sister and brother, were granted immigrant visas to come to the United States with their mother in 1997. Unfortunately, they lost the opportunity to be come immigrants when they tragically lost their mother in that same year.  Sergio Lozano lived with his siblings and their mother, Ana Ruth Lozano, until her death in February of this year due to complications from typhoid fever. Since their mother's death, the three siblings have been living with their closest relative, their U.S. citizen grandmother who lives in Los Angeles and has since adopted the two younger children.  Without his mother, Sergio does not have the legal right to remain in the United States. When he first arrived in the U.S. at 17, he was unable to obtain lawful permanent residence because immigration law prohibits permanent legal residency to minor children without their parents. However, as a child of 17, he was also outside the age limit for adoption by his grandmother. As a result, Sergio, through no fault of his own, has been left in limbo in the United States.  Without legal status, this young man can be deported by the INS despite the fact that he has no immediate family in El Salvador except their estranged father who was alleged to have been abusive to the mother and the children.  Without the legislation, Sergio will most likely be separated from his brother and sister and sent back to El Salvador. Here in the U.S., he can remain with his brother and sister, further his education and continue to thrive in the loving environment provided by his U.S. citizen grandmother and uncles.  I have previously sought administrative relief for all three Lozano children by asking the INS district office in Los Angeles and Commissioner Meissner if any humanitarian exemptions could be made in their case. INS told my staff that there was nothing further they could do administratively and a private relief bill may be then only way to protect the children from deportation. Since then, the two younger Lozano children have been adopted by their grandmother and have received approval of their lawful permanent resident petitions. Like his siblings, Sergio has too suffered a sense of loss and bewilderment after losing a parent. However. unlike his sister and brother, he stands to be deprived of the security of his American family and deported back to a land he no longer knows, if only as a consequence of being born two years too soon.  Last year, the Senate passed by unanimous consent the private bill I introduced on behalf of Sergio Lozano and his siblings. However, the 105th Congress came to a close before the House was able to act.  This year, I hope you will support the bill on behalf of Sergio Lozano so that we can help him begin to rebuild his life with his loving family in the United States.                                 ______                                       By
