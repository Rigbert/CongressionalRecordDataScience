 President, this morning, the distinguished Senator from Alaska, Senator Murkowski, was on the floor speaking about a provision in the State Department Authorization conference report that was voted out last night.  The provision was section 1601, which declares that the provisions of the Taiwan Relations Act supersede provisions of the United States-China Joint Communique of August 17, 1992.  His basic point was that the provision was written not to be a wholesale repudiation of the 1982 Joint Communique, but rather to say that where the two conflict, specifically with respectto arms sales to Taiwan, the Taiwan Relations Act, as the law of the land, must override the communique. He referred to an April 22, 1994 letter he received from Secretary Christopher saying that the Administration agrees that the Taiwan Relations Act takes legal precedence over the communique.  Indeed, it is true that the Taiwan Relations Act takes legal precedence over the 1982 Joint Communique. One is the law of the land, and the other is a diplomatic agreement not ratified by Congress.  But that is precisely what makes this provision superfluous. If the intent is to say that the law of the land takes legal precedence over other documents, it is absolutely unnecessary. If we add this language to the Taiwan Relations Act, we may as well add it to every other law we pass: ``The provisions of this act supersede the speech made by the President on a similar topic on such-and-such a date.''  The Senator from Alaska says the meaning of the word ``supersede'' is that the Taiwan Relations Act overrides the Communique only if their provisions conflict. He cites the Oxford English Dictionary's definition of ``supersede.'' But, according to Webster's Third New International Dictionary, the word ``supersede'' also means ``to make obsolete,'' ``to make void,'' `` to annul,'' ``to make superfluous or unnecessary,'' and ``to take the place of and outmode by superiority.''  Therefore, regardless of the provision's intent, it has the appearance of Congress issuing a wholesale repudiation of the 1982 Joint Communique.  This Joint Communique includes not just a paragraph on arms sales, but a reaffirmation of the One-China policy and the principles of sovereignty and territorial integrity as espoused in the two previous Joint Communiques of 1972 and 1979. By saying we supersede the 1982 Joint Communique, we give the impression that we might be repudiating it outright. To do this would shake United States-China relations to their very core. The fundamental basis of the relationship would be called into question.  Under any circumstances, this would be a dangerous course of action, but it is especially so at this extremely sensitive time in relations between the United States, China, and Taiwan.  Congress needs to be exceedingly careful not to take actions that will have farther-reaching effects than we intend. We should not underestimate how seriously this provision--which may seem harmless to us--would be viewed not just in Beijing, but also in Taipei.  It seems particularly foolhardy to take such a risk over an unnecessary provision, which essentially says nothing more than that the law of the land is the law of the land, which of course it is.                          ____________________
