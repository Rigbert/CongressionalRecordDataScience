 President, today I wish to honor the life of Judge Junius Foy Guin, Jr., of Russellville, AL, who passed away on November 8, 2016. He will be long remembered for his service to our Nation, his contributions to the legal community, and his dedication to both kindness and fairness in the courtroom.  Judge Guin was born in Russellville and graduated from Russellville High School in 1940. He went on to earn his B.A. and J.D. from the University of Alabama. Judge Guin took time off of school to serve as an infantry first lieutenant in World War II. During his service, he was sent to Camp Swift near Austin, TX, where he met and married his wife. After the war, he returned to the University of Alabama to complete his law degree and subsequently joined his father's private law practice from 1948 to 1973.  As an attorney, Judge Guin served on the Alabama State Bar Commission, the Board of the Alabama Law Institute, and the Alabama Supreme Court's advisory commission. He was also the first chairman of the judicial commission, which is now the judicial inquiry commission.  Judge Guin began his career in public service when he was nominated by President Richard Nixon to serve on the U.S. District Court for the Northern District of Alabama. He was confirmed by the Senate on April 10, 1973, and assumed senior status on February 3, 1989.  In addition to his professional achievements, Judge Guin was named Citizen of the Year for Russellville in 1973. He served as an elder and chairman of the foreign missions committee of the North Highlands Church of Christ in Russellville, as well as the West End Church of Christ and Palisades Church of Christ in Birmingham. Judge Guin also enjoyed playing golf, valued music and traveling the world, and always loved cheering on the Crimson Tide.  I offer my deepest condolences to Judge Guin's wife, Dorace, and his children Jan, Judy, Jay, and David, as well as his many grandchildren and great-grandchildren. I join all of their loved ones as they celebrate his many life accomplishments and mourn his loss.                          ____________________
