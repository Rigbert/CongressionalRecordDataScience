These are young men and women who handle cases on appeal after the trials and work for a government salary. When I announced this amendment--that we had the possibility of student loan forgiveness--two young women came to the press conference. One of them said to me that she has plotted out how long it will take her, working as an appellate defender, to pay off her student loan. She said, ``I will be paying when I qualify for Social Security.'' That is hard to imagine, but it is a fact. The debt these young lawyers incur to get through law school, unless they are lucky enough to grab the brass ring and go to a big law firm, is so large that it haunts them for a lifetime. It colors their life decisions as to where they will work, whether they can own a car, whether they can finally have an apartment of their own and move out of their parents' homes. All of these things are associated many times with student debt.  Whether we are talking about appellate defenders or prosecutors or public defenders, I think we want to make sure these young people are spared some of this financial worry and some of this financial burden if they are willing to dedicate themselves to public service. That is what this is about.  I think this is a noble calling, and I have to recall it has not been but a few weeks since a Justice of the Supreme Court testified before the Senate Judiciary Committee. This Justice came and said he thought the current pay for Federal judges was inadequate in America. That pay is in the realm of $165,000 to $200,000 or maybe more, certainly more at the Supreme Court level. We asked how much more he thought these Federal judges should receive.
