 President, today I recognize the outstanding service of a remarkable Kentuckian, Mr. Ralph E. Walz. Mr. Walz is the executive liaison officer for the Louisville District of the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers. He will retire from the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers on January 3, 2007, with over 34 years of dedicated service to our Nation as a member of the U.S. Army (1969-1972) and as a civil servant.  A native of Louisville, KY, Mr. Walz is a graduate of Western Kentucky University. As a young man in the 1960s, Ralph Walz served with the U.S. Army in Vietnam as an enlisted infantryman. Performing his duty on the front lines as a non-commissioned officer, facing the daily dangers of active combat, he bravely and honorably served his country.  Mr. Walz began his distinguished civil service tenure with the Louisville District, U.S. Army Corps of Engineers, in 1977. He began his career in the Comptroller's Office, later named Resource Management, where he participated in numerous efficiency reviews, organizational studies, and business-process analysis. During this time, Mr. Walz was instrumental in the transfer of Smithland Lock and Dam to the Louisville District.  In 1981, Mr. Walz helped develop the proposal that resulted in the military construction mission being reinstated at the Louisville district, making it a full-service district whose impact is felt worldwide.  In 1990, Mr. Walz was chosen as the executive liaison Officer and assigned to the Executive Office. In that capacity, he has been instrumental in coordinating many significant events that showcased our great Commonwealth, including National Society of American Military Engineers Conferences which included military personnel and civilians from all over the United States and overseas.  Mr. Walz has also been a champion of quality-of-life initiatives. He helped implement the Uncle Sam's Child Care Center and initially served as board chairman. He served as board chairman and as a member of the board of directors for his local credit union. And he was chairman of the Kentucky Federal Agency Tourism Council, among many other volunteer activities.  Finally, Mr. President, Mr. Walz is a good neighbor and valued steward of our natural resources and defense assets. He will be long remembered for his patriotism, leadership, mentorship of others, and service to his Nation and the Commonwealth of Kentucky. On the occasion of his retirement, I wish to extend my best wishes to Mr. Ralph Walz, his wife, Mary Lou, and their children, Matthew (Matt) and Jake, and I ask my colleagues to salute this esteemed Kentuckian.                          ____________________[Page S11681]From the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]                        TRIBUTE TO RALPH E.
