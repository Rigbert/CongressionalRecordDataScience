 I have seen some of the ``527'' commercials advising constituents to get hold of their Congressman because minority rights are going to be trampled.  I, obviously, find that ludicrous. I know this debate is not about changing anything dealing with legislation. It is just maintaining the system we have had in the Senate on judges for 214 years. I wonder if the Senator would clear up that we are talking just about judicial nominees, and not even all judicial nominees, and nothing to change the filibuster on legislation.  Mr. McCONNELL. I say to my friend from Iowa, if the majority leader does have to exercise the constitutional option and ask us to support it, it will be narrowly crafted to effect only circuit court appointments and the Supreme Court, which are, after all, the only areas where there has been a problem.  I further say to my friend from Iowa, in the years I have been in the Senate, the only time anyone has tried to get rid of the entire filibuster was back in 1995 when such a measure was offered by the other side of the aisle.  Interestingly enough, the principal beneficiaries of getting rid of the filibuster in January of 1995 would have been our party because we had just come back to power in the Senate, yet not a single Republican, not one, voted to get rid of the filibuster. Nineteen Democrats did, two of whom, Senator Kennedy and Senator Kerry, are still in the Senate and now arguing, I guess, the exact opposite of their vote a mere 10 years ago.
