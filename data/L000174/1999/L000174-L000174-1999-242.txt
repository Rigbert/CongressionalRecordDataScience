President, to reiterate, we have to wonder what is going on. I know the upper Midwest massively overproduces milk. We are simply asking to produce the milk we are going to consume in our area. They massively overproduce it. As the Minneapolis Star Tribune explained, Minnesota farmers want to sell ``reconstituted milk in Southern markets.'' They talk about drawing water out and shipping down some ``glop.'' I will let the reporter of debates figure out how to spell that. I don't know how. It sort of looks like it sounds.  All we want is fresh milk in our region. We are not trying to take over any other part of the country. We have something that we have proved works. It doesn't cost the taxpayers anything. It helps stabilize farm income. Consumers have a voice in it and like it in the area. All we are saying is let us make some determination in our own part of the world. We are talking about billions and billions of dollars in farm aid in this bill. The amendment that Senator Jeffords, Senator Lott, and I, and others support says we don't want any Federal money; we want to set things the way we are now doing it, protecting our consumers and our farmers.  Mr. President, I know the Upper Midwest massively overproduces milk--they overproduce far more than they can consume--and thus want to sell this milk in the South.  I have read the press reports about how they want to dehydrate milk--take the water out of milk--and then hydrate it by adding water in distant states. The Minneapolis Star Tribune explained that Minnesota farmers want to sell ``reconstituted milk in Southern markets.''  The article from February 12, 1992, points out that ``technology exists for them to draw water from the milk in order to save shipping costs, then reconstitute it.''  Regular milk needs refrigeration and weighs a lot and is thus expensive to ship. Also, only empty tanker trucks can come back since nothing else can be loaded into the milk containers.  But dehydrated milk can be shipped in boxes.  By taking the water out of milk, the Upper Midwest can supply the South with milk.  I realize that according to a St. Louis Post-Dispatch article in 1990 that Wisconsin farmers defended the taste of reconstituted milk. The article points out that Dan Hademan, of Wisconsin, ``says fluid milk should be treated the same nationwide, whether it is fresh whole milk or reconstituted milk.''  That article notes ``Upper Midwest farmers say technological advances in making powdered milk and other concentrates has improved the taste and texture of reconstituted milk.''  However, the House National Security Committee had a hearing on this reconstituted milk issue in 1997. I will quote from the hearing transcript:       . . . the Air Force on Okinawa decided that the      reconstituted milk was not suitable for the military and as a      quality of life decision they closed the milk plant and opted      to have fluid milk transported in from the United States.  There was a great article in the Christian Science Monitor a few years ago that talks about the school lunch program. It mentions the first time that the author, as a first-grader, was given reconstituted milk.  He said: ``Now, I like milk. . . . But not this stuff. Not watery, gray, hot, reconstituted milk that tasted more like rusty pump than anything remotely connected with a cow. We wept. We gagged. We choked.''  The second problem with the strategy of Wisconsin and Minnesota farmers selling their milk down South is what about ice storms or snow? What happens when flooding or tornado damage or other problems stop these trucks laden with milk?  Southern parents might not be able to buy milk at any price any time an ice storm hits the Upper Midwest if the South does not have fresh, local, supplies of fresh milk. Just remember the panic that affects Washington, D.C., when residents think we might get what is called in Vermont a ``dusting of snow.''  Most Americans do not remember why Friday, March 5, 1999, is significant. But most dairy farmers will remember that date as long as they live.  On that date, the Department of Agriculture announced the largest cut in milk prices ever--a month-to-month drop of $6.00 per hundredweight.  This was the largest month-to-month drop in history--yet retail store milk prices remained high. Processors made huge windfall profits. And, while the milk prices received by farmers dropped by almost 40 percent the prices stores charged to consumers hardly dropped.  Imagine a month-to-month drop in other commodity prices of almost 40 percent. Imagine what that would do to your family farmers.  The only region in the country that enjoyed some modest protection against this huge drop in farm prices was New England--because of the Northeast Dairy Compact.  Half of the states have approved a similar system regarding dairy pricing. While a regional diary compact does not offer complete protection against huge and unexpected drops in the price of milk for farmers, it does provide a modest measure of relief.  It is a safety net that prevents farmers from hitting rock bottom.                 the compact increased interstate trade  Contrary to the views of opponents of the compact, note that OMB reports that the Northeast Compact has increased interstate trade in fluid milk.  This only makes sense. Dairy farmers fortunate enough to be living in states neighboring the Northeast compact region have increased milk sales into the compact area to gain the benefits of the higher compact price. OMB reported an 8 percent increase in trade--increased sales of milk into the compact region from New York and other neighboring states to take advantage of the higher prices.  If other states could trade places with New York, I am certain that those farmers would quickly figure out that they should sell milk into the Compact region to take advantage of the modestly higher benefits of the compact.  The Northeast Compact does not cost taxpayers a single cent. This is different from the costliness of many farm programs.  If you support farmland protection programs, regional compacts are the answer. Major environmental groups have endorsed the Northeast Dairy Compact because they know it helps preserve farmland and prevent urban sprawl.  And if you are concerned about the impact of prices on consumers, regional compacts are the answer. Retail milk prices within the compact region are lower on average than in the rest of the nation.  The Northeast Compact has done exactly what it was established to do: stabilize fluctuating dairy prices, ensure a fair price for dairy farmers, keep them in business, and protect consumers' supplies of fresh milk.  Many of our friends in the South have seen how the compact provides a modest but crucial safety net for struggling farmers. They, too, want the same for their farmers, and their farmers deserve that same opportunity.  Congress should not stand in the way of these state initiatives that protect farmers and consumers without costing taxpayers a penny.
