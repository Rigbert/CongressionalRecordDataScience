 President, tomorrow the Senate will resume consideration of S. 1072, the highway bill. The chairman and ranking member have been in the Chamber all day to receive amendments. They will be back here in the morning. We encourage all Members who have amendments to contact the managers as soon as possible. Rollcall votes are expected during tomorrow's session, and Senators will be notified when the first vote is scheduled.                          ____________________
