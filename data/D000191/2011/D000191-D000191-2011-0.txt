  Mr. DeFAZIO. Congress excels at doing nothing; but sometimes doing nothing or empty political posturing, as we've just seen from the Republican majority, ignores our Nation's critical needs.  By leaving town without extending unemployment insurance, the 2.3 million long-term unemployed Americans who want to work and can't find work in this economy is especially cruel on the eve of the Christmas season. And for 48 million seniors and disabled, the new year will dawn with a 28-percent decrease in physicians' reimbursement. Many will find that they can't get in to see a doctor. It will be slammed in their face.  So with these actions, or rather these inactions by the Republican majority, they truly embody the spirit of the season: the Grinch.                          ____________________
