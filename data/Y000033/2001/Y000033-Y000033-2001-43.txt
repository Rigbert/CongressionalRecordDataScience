I thank the gentleman for yielding.  Mr. Chairman, I regret that the points of order were raised because of the important message that my colleague, the gentleman from Alaska (Mr. Young), has mentioned: the importance of funding these important programs.  I want to say that it was a real privilege and pleasure to work with him most of today to come to an agreement, and I wanted to say to him for the Record that regardless of the fact that points of order were raised that were not consistent with that agreement, that I will keep the agreement that the gentleman and I reached personally as this bill proceeds through the conference.
