 President, later this month, a man we have all become accustomed to welcoming into our living rooms will leave behind a decades-long journalistic career and embark on a new journey with his wife, Pat.  Bob Lloyd Schieffer has been a Pentagon reporter. He has served as a State Department reporter. He has covered the White House. And he has roamed the halls of the Capitol as a congressional reporter.  It is rare to see any journalist serve in all four of the big DC national assignments. But Bob Schieffer has.  Bob has interviewed every President since Nixon. He has moderated debates between Kerry and Bush, between Obama and McCain, and most recently between Obama and Romney. He has won just about every award possible in broadcast journalism, including a few Emmys. And he has turned out chart-topping hits, like ``TV Anchorman,'' as the front man for a honky-tonk band.  Perhaps that is the passion Bob will follow in retirement. We will see.  But here is one thing we do know: Bob Schieffer is one of the most famous Horned Frogs ever to graduate from his beloved TCU. It is no wonder Bob Schieffer's alma mater elected to name its School of Journalism after the man who hosts CBS' ``Face the Nation'' every Sunday.  I have been a guest on his show many times. He can ask tough questions. But he is fair.  The last time I appeared with Bob, we talked about the new majority's drive to restore the Senate. He later shared his view on our efforts with his audience.  ``What's happening is by no means on the scale of an Old Testament miracle,'' he said.  ``But,'' he noted, ``Every journey begins with a first step.''  I agree with him. It is not like we are parting the Potomac. But we are getting the Senate moving again, debating again, amending again, and working again. I think it is good for our country.  Perhaps Bob might take some of his own advice as he looks to the future too.  Because every journey does begin with a first step.  So whatever it is Bob ultimately chooses to do in retirement, whether it is penning a memoir or cutting more honky-tonk hits, it all begins with that first step. He will take it on May 31, when he signs off for the last time.  I am sure it will be a bittersweet moment for him. But it is a step he is likely to ultimately welcome after so many years in the spotlight. The Senate wishes him all the best in retirement.                          ____________________
