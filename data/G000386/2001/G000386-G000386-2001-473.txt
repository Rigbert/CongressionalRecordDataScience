 President, I have a few clarifying comments regarding the bankruptcy reform bill which the Senate passed last week, During the debate on the small business provisions in S. 420, Senator Kerry erroneously characterized how the National Bankruptcy Review Commission voted on the small business changes that were contained in the bill. Senator Kerry maintained that the provisions were controversial and passed by a narrow 5-4 vote. This was not true. In fact, the National Bankruptcy Review Commission voted for these provisions by a vote of 8-1.  I also want to clarify another point in the bankruptcy legislation. Senator Schumer offered an amendment in committee and then on the floor that changed a provision in the bill that prohibited corporate entities in Chapter 11 from discharging fraud debts in bankruptcy. I opposed this amendment since I think that corporations should not be able to commit fraud and get away with it by filing for bankruptcy.Nevertheless, to accommodate Senator Schumer, I reached this compromise which prohibits corporations from discharging fraud debts owed to Government entities or to plaintiffs under the False Claims Act. I want to make clear for the Record that I oppose letting corporations defraud private businesses and individuals, and then discharging those debts in bankruptcy. Hopefully, I will revisit this issue in the near future to make sure that corporate scam artists can't use bankruptcy as a safe haven.  I also want to take this opportunity to thank a number of staff members that were especially helpful in getting this important bill passed: Rene Augustine, Makan Delrahim, and Sharon Prost of Senator Hatch's staff; Ed Haden and Brad Harris of Senator Session's staff; Ed Pagano and Bruce Cohen of Senator Leahy's staff; Jim Greene and Kristin Cabral of Senator Biden's staff; Jennifer Leach of Senator Torricelli's staff; and Rita Lari Jochum and Kolan Davis of my staff. I also want to acknowledge my former staffer John McMickle who worked on this bill for several years. In addition, I want to thank Laura Ayoud in the Office of Senate Legislative Counsel. This bill would not have passed if it were not for the hard work and tremendous efforts of all these staff members.  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to print in the Record three letters from former Bankruptcy Review Commissioners.  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in the Record, as follows:                                              Stephen H. Case,                                      New York, NY, March 7, 2001.     To: Senator Grassley     Re: National Bankruptcy Commission--Small Business       1. I understand Senator Kerry today said on the Senate      floor Bankruptcy Review Commission approved its small      business provisions by a 5-4 vote.       2. I was the NBRC's Senior Advisor on that project.       3. I was present when the full Commission voted. I remember      it very distinctly, because I had just broken by jaw and I      had to participate with my mouth wired.       4. The vote was 8 to 1.       I hope the record can be corrected on this point.     S.H. Case.                                  ____                                              Adams and Reese,                                        Mobile, AL, March 8, 2001.     Senator Charles Grassley,     U.S. Senate, Washington, DC.     Re: Amendment by Senator Kerry of Massachusetts to Strike the          Small Business Provisions in the Bankruptcy Reform          Legislation       Dear Senator Grassley: Senator Kerry of Massachusetts has      offered an amendment to strike entirely the provisions      relating to small businesses in the bankruptcy legislation      currently pending on the Senate floor.       When offering this amendment, Senator Kerry misstated the      position of the National Bankruptcy Review Commission, of      which I was a member.       The small business provisions, which are very similar to      the provisions in the current legislation, were strongly      endorsed by the National Bankruptcy Review Commission. In      fact, the vote in support of these provisions was 8 to 1 by      the Commission. The adoption of these small business      provisions are vitally important to the future wellbeing of      the bankruptcy system.       I urge you to table the Kerry amendment.           Sincerely,     Jeffery J. Hartley.                                  ____                                                    March 8, 2001.     Senator Charles Grassley.     Re: BRA 2001--Small Business Provisions       Pleased be advised that the National Bankruptcy Review      Commission, of which I was a member, voted 8 to 1 in favor of      the Commission's recommendation to enact the Small Business      Provisions. There was very little dissent among the      Commissioners; the vote was not 5 to 4, as has been reported.      There was solid support for the recommendation and for the      proposals.           Thank you,                                                 James I. Shepard,     Bankruptcy Tax Consultant.                          ____________________
