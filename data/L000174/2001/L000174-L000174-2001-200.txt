President, for the notice of Members, the Senate Judiciary Committee had originally been scheduled to meet tomorrow for a markup. We have about 14 or 15 nominations on the list, ranging from U.S. attorneys to Federal judges--actually more than that. I forget the exact number. The Dirksen Building in which we were scheduled to meet is going to be closed, as will the Russell and Hart Buildings.  For those Senators who may have an interest, I am arranging for a meeting room off the Senate Chamber, probably in the President's room. We will start the meeting about halfway through the vote, whenever we have the vote, which I understand now is sometime between 12 and 12:30. I have talked to a number of Senators. This seems to be the most convenient way because we don't know where else we will get a meeting room.  Senators on the Judiciary Committee should plan, if they possibly can, to vote here relatively early, when the rollcall starts. Come to the room. We will make sure somebody is here to tell them where it is going to be. Obviously, if somebody wants to debate something, they can. We will try to move those nominations out as quickly as possible.  Having heard the travel plans of some Senators, we may try to get them moved out prior to or within the same amount of time as the rollcall vote. I urge Senators to get over there and make a quorum. As soon as we have a quorum, we will start moving.  For several Senators who have inquired, mostly from the other side of the aisle, who have judges up for nomination hearings tomorrow--I know the Senators from Alabama and Oklahoma and others do--we are going forward with those hearings. Senator Schumer, the distinguished senior Senator from New York, will be chairing. Again, I think we may have arranged a room right back here.
