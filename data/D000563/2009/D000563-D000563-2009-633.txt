Beck, political adviser to some, and Senator Hutchison, and even you use, that under President George W. Bush, the previous Republican administration, one could characterize his officials and advisers in the Executive Office of the President and other agencies as an Afghanistan czar, an AIDS czar, a drug czar, a faith-based czar, an intelligence czar, a Mideast peace czar, a regulatory czar, a science czar, a Sudan czar, a TARP bailout czar, a terrorism czar, and a weapons czar, under the previous administration. I ask the Senator from Maine if she proposed this amendment under a Republican President who clearly had his own stable of Muscovite czars of a lot of different versions?
