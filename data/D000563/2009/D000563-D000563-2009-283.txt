President, I certainly agree with the Senator from Vermont. I would add one more statistic. Of the nearly 1 million people filing for bankruptcy in America each year because of health care costs, medical bills they can't pay, three-fourths of them have health insurance. Three-fourths of them were paying premiums. These were the people turned down when they needed coverage. These were the people who ran into caps on coverage on their policies. These are folks who had to battle it out and lost the battle with the insurance companies to try to get lifesaving drugs. That is the reality of the current system.  The fact is, the Republican side of the aisle has not produced an alternative. We have. We have worked long and hard to do it. They have not.
