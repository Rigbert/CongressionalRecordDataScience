 President, today I rise to express my opposition to the nomination of Mr. James A. Williams to be the Administrator of the General Services Administration, GSA. My concerns are based on my investigation of a dubious GSA contract with Sun Microsystems. In 2006 and 2007, my oversight staff conducted a thorough inquiry into the GSA Multiple Award Schedule contract with Sun Microsystems for computer products and services. GSA inspector general, IG, auditors had alerted GSA's top management of alleged fraud on this contract as early as 2005.  In 2006, Mr. Williams became the Commissioner of the GSA Federal Acquisition Service, FAS. His office was directly responsible for this questionable contract with Sun Microsystems. He and Administrator Doan were alterted to the alleged fraud and the referral of the matter to the Department of Justice, DOJ.  I previously made the findings of my inquiry known in a floor statement on October 17, 2007.  In a nutshell, all the evidence developed in my oversight investigation appears to indicate that top-level GSA management, including Administrator Doan and FAS Commissioner Williams, may have improperly interfered in the ongoing contract negotiations with Sun Microsystems in May-September 2006; and Administrator Doan and Mr. Williams pressured the GSA contracting officer to approve the new Sun contract even though they both knew that the IG had detected alleged fraud on the existing Sun contract and hadreferred the matter to the DOJ for possible prosecution/litigation. This case is now pending in Federal court.  The facts appear to show Mr. Williams, as FAS Commissioner, failed to act in the best interest of the American taxpayer. He had the opportunity to put an end to or bring into compliance a contract that was allegedly fraudulent, but in the end he could not do it. Instead, he sided with former Administrator Doan by taking steps to remove the GSA contracting officer. When the final contract was signed with Sun Microsystems by a newly appointed contracting officer, he chose to look the other way. He didn't even try to have the IG audit or examine the terms of the proposed contract. At the very least, this was a very poor management decision by Mr. Williams. It was a deplorable error in judgment that he probably regrets today.  We need a strong leader at GSA. The responsibilities of GSA Administrator require an individual who will stand up to anyone to protect the financial interests of hard-working American taxpayers. Although I agree he is well qualified and a devoted civil servant, I don't believe Mr. Williams has the bureaucratic and intestinal fortitude to make the tough decisions at GSA when it matters.  Reports of alleged fraud on the Sun contract surfaced on his watch. He knew about the alleged fraud. The taxpayers may have been cheated out of tens of millions of dollars. As FAS Commissioner, he was the top GSA official responsible for making the tough calls, and he chose not to protect the taxpayers. He made the wrong choice. He is now accountable for that decision. Because he failed to protect the taxpayers at a crucial moment, we should not elevate Mr. Williams to high office.  For all these reasons, I oppose his nomination to be GSA Administrator.  Mr. Williams's nomination is now before the Homeland Security and Governmental Affairs Committee. On July 22, I wrote to the chairman, Senator Lieberman, laying out the reasons behind my opposition to this nomination.  I ask unanimous consent to have that letter printed in the Record.  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in the Record, as follows:                                                      U.S. Senate,                                         Committee on Finance,                                    Washington, DC, July 22, 2008.     Hon. Joseph I. Lieberman,     Chairman, Committee on Homeland Security and Governmental          Affairs, U.S. Senate, Washington, DC.       Dear Senator Lieberman, I am writing to express opposition      to the nomination of Mr. Jim Williams to be the Administrator      of the General Services Administration (GSA).       My opposition to Mr. Williams' nomination is rooted in an      in-depth oversight investigation conducted by my staff in      2006-2007. This investigation focused on the re-negotiation      of a Multiple Award Schedule contract with Sun Microsystems,      Inc. for computer products and services. The contract was      initially awarded to the company in 1999. Sales on this      contract totaled $268,987,689.00.       The results of this investigation were presented in three      separate reports in October 2007. These reports were provided      to your committee, Administrator Doan, the House Oversight      Committee, the White House Chief of Staff, and GSA Inspector      General (IG). In addition, there was a follow-up report      issued by the U.S. Postal Service in May 2008. None of these      reports have been released to the public. However, on October      17, 2007, I spoke about the findings in these reports in very      general terms on the floor of the Senate. My remarks appear      on pages S12952-12954 of the Congressional Record.       At the time of my investigation, Mr. Williams was the      Commissioner of GSA's Federal Acquisition Service (FAS).       In a nutshell, all the evidence developed in my oversight      investigation appears to indicate that: 1) top-level GSA      management, including Administrator Doan and FAS Commissioner      Williams, may have improperly interfered in the ongoing      contract negotiations with Sun Microsystems in May-September      2006; and 2) Administrator Doan and Mr. Williams pressured      the GSA contracting officer to approve the new Sun contract      even though they both knew that the IG had detected alleged      fraud on existing Sun contract and had referred the matter to      the Department of Justice (DOJ) for possible prosecution/     litigation.       The IG auditors first blew the whistle on alleged fraud on      the Sun contract in 2005--at least a year before Mr. Williams      became FAS Commissioner.       The GSA IG auditors had the Sun contract under a microscope      for several years. They had uncovered extensive contract      violations, including potential civil and criminal fraud.      These problems were first reported to GSA acquisition      management in February 2005. The IG auditors briefed DOJ on      the alleged fraud on April 20, 2006. In April 2007, DOJ      charged Sun in a False Claims Act suit. That case is now      pending in the Arkansas Federal Court District (Norman Rille      and Neal Roberts vs Sun Microsystems, Inc.).       The GSA IT Acquisition Center staff was briefed on these      issues on May 2, 2006. FAS Commissioner Williams ``grilled''      the IG auditors about the alleged fraud and DOJ referral      during the contract ``Impasse'' briefing on August 14, 2006.      On August 29, 2006, Administrator Doan was briefed by the IG      audit team on the decision to refer the Sun contract to DOJ      for possible prosecution/litigation. Mr. Williams and Ms.      Doan discussed the alleged fraud on the Sun contract on      several different occasions in August 2006.       Despite the red warning flags raised by the IG auditors,      according to my findings, Administrator Doan and Mr. Williams      pressured the GSA contracting officer to sign the contract.      When that person refused to sign the contract, they had the      contracting officer removed and replaced under duress.       The record shows that Mr. Williams played a key role in the      removal of the contracting officer as follows:       A high-level meeting--known as the ``Baltimore Conference      Call''--was held on August 31, 2006. All the key players      participated, including Commissioner Williams. According to      interviews with a number of participants, Mr. Williams made      it very clear that the Sun contract was of ``strategic      importance'' in Administrator Doan's view, and it had to be      awarded. Still, the contracting officer refused to back down      in the face of mounting pressure from the very top. He had      dug in his heels and refused to sign what he considered a bad      contract. During interviews, the contracting officer told my      staff that he thought the price reduction clause, discounts,      and maintenance deals offered by Sun were ``essentially      worthless,'' and he said he was equally concerned about the      alleged fraud referral to DOJ. Mr. Williams then asked the      contracting officer if he wished to step down, and the      contracting officer accepted the offer.       Under standard GSA procedures, contracting officers make      the final decision on whether or not to sign a contract. They      have ``Go No Go'' authority. No other person is authorized to      preempt or otherwise interfere with that authority. So when      the contracting officer said ``No'' on the Sun contract, why      didn't that mean ``No''? Why didn't the story end there?       One of Mr. Williams' directors suggested that the      ``Impasse'' in the negotiations was caused by the      intimidation of the contracting officer by IG auditors. On      September 5, 2006, in response to that complaint, Mr.      Williams lodged a quasi-formal complaint with the IG,      alleging that the IG auditors had made threatening statements      to GSA contracting officers.       Mr. Williams' complaint of IG auditor intimidation came      just five days after the contracting officer was removed and      four days before the new contract was signed. Mr. Williams      also passed these allegations to Administrator Doan.       Mr. Williams' allegations of IG auditor intimidation were      examined in detail by the GSA IG, by my staff, and by the      U.S. Postal Service IG. There is not one shred of evidence to      support those allegations. They appear to have been bogus      allegations. A senior official in the IG's office suggested      that Mr. Williams' allegations regarding IG auditor      intimidation were ``a smokescreen for things going on in the      agency itself.''       After forcing the contracting officer to step down, GSA      management appointed a new one. It took her just nine days to      negotiate a final deal with Sun. In interviews, the new      contracting officer claimed that she did not need to talk to      the IG auditors who had years of knowledge on the contract.      She said that she could solve the impasse in the negotiations      by listening to the contractor. Many of the provisions she      accepted were ones steadfastly opposed by the previous      contracting officer--the very same terms that led to the so-     called ``impasse'' and the removal of the previous      contracting officer. She even admitted during questioning      that she did not fully understand key provisions in the      contract she signed. She admitted making ``big oversights''      in some of the contract terms. I found these revelations very      disturbing. They raised questions about the motives behind      her appointment. She later received a $1,400 cash award for      signing off on the Sun contract.       Following my staff's interview of the new contracting      officer, I had grave concerns about the new contract. Was Sun      continuing to cheat on government discounts mandated by the      price reduction clause--as feared by the IG auditors? I      thought I would be remiss in not asking more questions.      Consequently, on June 5, 2007, I asked the IG to conduct an      audit of the new contract. Since Sun claimed it was such a      ``good deal for America,'' I felt sure the company would rush      to cooperate. How wrong I was! For three months straight, Sun      stonewalled and procrastinated. Sun withheld information. Sun      fought the audit tooth and nail every step of the way. They      even lashed out at the GSA IG. Then suddenly and      unexpectedly, on September 13, 2008, Sun canceled the      contract. What happened? Why would Sun cancel a contract it      had fought so hard to get? Was Sun trying to avoid the audit?      Did Sun have something to hide? Something about this just      does not smell right.       Mr. Chairman, Mr. Williams was the Commissioner of GSA's      Federal Acquisition Service at the time of the Sun/GSA      contract debacle. That made him the top dog overseeing and      managing the procurement of     computer equipment and services for the whole government. The      Sun Microsystems contract was being re-negotiated right under      his nose. He was the top official accountable for that      contract. When he was informed in August 2006 by IG auditors      about the alleged fraud on the Sun contract and the DOJ      referral decision, he should have brought the Sun contract      negotiations to a screeching halt. He should have called for      a comprehensive, independent review and/or audit and      assessment of Sun's corrective action plan. He should have      carefully weighed the gravity of the fraud allegations before      proceeding any further.       Mr. Chairman, instead of heeding all the IG's warning      signals, Mr. Williams pushed the throttle to the firewall at      Administrator Doan's direction. The record shows pressure was      put on the contracting officer to sign a potentially bad      contract. When the contracting officer refused to bend under      pressure, Mr. Williams involved himself directly in the      contracting process. He participated in the decision to      remove that contracting officer from the Sun contract      negotiations. His actions eliminated the last standing      barrier to contract approval. In doing these things, he may      have improperly interfered in the contracting process and      hurt the taxpayers.       The alleged contract violations and alleged fraud on the      Sun contract, which supposedly occurred over a long period of      time, may have wasted tens of millions of dollars in taxpayer      money. Mr. Chairman, there must be more accountability in the      government contracting process. Elevating those who have been      detrimental to this process would certainly be anti-     accountability and anti-taxpayer. That would clearly send the      wrong message to the whole contracting community.       For these reasons, I intend to oppose the nomination of Mr.      Williams to be the next Administrator at GSA, and would      expect your Committee to do so, too.       Your careful consideration of my concerns would be      appreciated.           Sincerely,                                              Charles E. Grassley,     Ranking Member.                          ____________________
