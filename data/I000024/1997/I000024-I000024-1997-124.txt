That is the reason that, again, it is somewhat arbitrary as to whether it is 75, 80, or 85 percent. The GAO again said that you should operate the three remaining air logistics centers somewhere between 75 and 85 percent capacity to leave enough capacity so that, as the Senator suggests, in time of war we would have that capacity and then we would be at full capacity. Clearly this is a national defense issue.
