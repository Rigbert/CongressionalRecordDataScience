Speaker, I thank the gentleman. The FSC bill is also listed for the floor next week. Again, I think that bill will clearly not go to committee; but let me ask the gentleman first, is it the gentleman's expectation that the FSC bill will be marked up in committee?  Mr. DeLAY. If the gentleman will yield, yes, the Committee on Ways and Means will mark up the Americans Jobs Creation Act on Monday, which would give us time, if the markup went well, we could see that bill on the floor either Thursday or Friday.
