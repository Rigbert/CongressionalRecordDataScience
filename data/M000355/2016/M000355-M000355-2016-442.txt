 President, before the Senator from New Hampshire leaves the floor, I just want to say again what I said previously. We wouldn't be where we are today on the Comprehensive Addiction and Recovery Act without the Senator from New Hampshire, who made an extraordinary contribution to this early on and played an important leadership role. So on behalf of all Members of the Senate, Republicans and Democrats, I want to thank the Senator from New Hampshire for all she did to bring this forward.                          ____________________
