Speaker, I rise today on behalf of the Lebanese American communities in our district, who are celebrating the 70th anniversary of Lebanon's independence. On November 22, 1943, Lebanon obtained its independence from France. Shortly thereafter, Lebanon became a founding member of both the United Nations and League of Arab States. Signaling its commitment to the idea that human rights were global and that it was ready to be a full partner in the post World War II world, Lebanon participated in the drafting of one of the UN's most distinguished documents--the Universal Declaration of Human Rights.  The United States and Lebanon have been blessed by a historically strong friendship, owing in part to the emigration of Lebanon's sons and daughters. They embraced America and followed the words expressed by the poet Kahlil Gibran, that ``To be a good citizen is to acknowledge the other person's rights before asserting your own, but always to be conscious of your own.'' The contributions of those early immigrants and those who followed helped to build our nation.  Since 1965, over 135,000 new immigrants have come from Lebanon. Ohio has one of the largest Lebanese American communities in our nation and our citizens are richer for it. The Lebanese community willingly shares its culture and values; the result has been innumerable contributions to the arts, sports, medicine, politics, education, science and industry.In fact, Toledo, Ohio became the first major city in America to elect a citizen of Lebanese ancestry to the position of Mayor, Mr. Michael Damas who served with distinction.  As one of the world's early cradles of civilization, Lebanon has persevered, both suffering hardship and sharing in prosperity. Remarkably, the spirit of its people shines through. I join the people of Lebanon, those of Lebanese ancestry around the world, and the Lebanese American community in celebrating Lebanese Independence Day.                          ____________________
