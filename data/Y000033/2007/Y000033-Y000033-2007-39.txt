This species is not at the end of its rope, contrary to those who proposed this amendment. Thirteen of the 19 polar bear populations are under the jurisdiction of Canada. Canada has one of the best management programs, using state-of-art scientific practices to manage these populations. While that should be enough, it's not the end of the oversight or management of polar bears in Canada.  The United States Marine Mammal Protection Act requires the Fish and Wildlife Service to review the status of polar bear populations in Canada. After conducting their review of the service-approved, stable and healthy populations, hunters can only import trophies from those approved populations.  Supporters of the amendment like to refer to the 1994 amendments of the Marine Protection Act that allowed an importation of polar bear trophies as a loophole. It was the law. These statements are far from the truth. In fact, we worked on it with a Democrat-controlled Congress. We worked on it together to improve the species in Canada because Canada asked us to do so.  In 1970, many marine mammal populations faced numerous threats. The Marine Protection Act was very effective in restoring many marine mammal populations to healthy or historic levels. Unfortunately, the act does not discriminate between healthy marine mammal populations and those still in need of rebuilding. Robust populations of marine mammals are treated like they are on the verge of extinction.  While the 1994 amendments did not address this issue, the Democrat-controlled Congress, specifically those enlightened members of the Merchant Marines Fisheries Committee, had the foresight to understand that the sustainable use of resources and conservation activities are not mutually exclusive. The committee developed strict requirements to ensure the protection of polar bear populations in Canada, while allowing for the importation of sport-hunted polar bear trophies.  The idea of incentives to give value to natural resources was very new at the time. A similar program was developed for African communities to protect big game resources in Africa using the same incentive structure. These programs have proven their worth and are very successful.  There will always be a sector of the population that believes we should not kill anything or eat anything and, in fact, we should eat grass. However, we need to keep in mind there are still areas in the world that rely on the natural resources around them and still subsist on these resources.  The argument is not that polar bears need to be protected due to the effects of a warming climate. The argument is that certain groups do not like hunting, regardless of what those are saying promoted, and want it stopped.  The Canadian polar bear populations are healthy and well managed. Sport-hunting activities provide important incentives and support remote Native villages and important conservation programs in Canada, the U.S., and Russia.  Mr. Chairman, I suggest, respectfully, go back to the history. This saves the polar bear as is in place. This amendment will extinguish the polar bear.  For those who don't know anything about the polar bear, and I suggest, respectfully, those two gentlemen that introduced this have never seen a polar bear in the wild, don't know anything about it, read it in a book.                              {time}  1500  I suggest respectfully that before this was in place, in 1994, what was happening was that the Canadian natives, bless their hearts, would hunt polar bears. They would kill the sows and the cubs but not the boars. The boars would kill the cubs so they can breed the sows. Our polar bear population was going down. Because of our actions, in fact, the polar bear population increased. That is what we were trying to do. It was a true conservation method, a method of science, a method that works.  Mr. Speaker, if this amendment is adopted, you can forget your polar bears in the wild. They will be extinguished. This is a bad amendment.  Mr. Chairman, I yield to the gentleman from Wisconsin.
