 President, today it is my privilege to recognize a prominent member of Kentucky's agricultural community, David Beck. During his four decades with the Kentucky Farm Bureau, KFB, David has been an effective advocate for our farm families and rural communities. Now, after great success with KFB, he has decided to leave the bureau for a new challenge. David has accepted the role of president and CEO of Kentucky Venues, an organization responsible for many of the Commonwealth's most beloved traditions like the annual State fair.  Graduating from Murray State University in Calloway County with a degree in agriculture, David set out to dedicate his career to promoting farm communities in Kentucky. Since joining KFB in 1977 as a field service director in Central Kentucky, David has worn a lot of hats within the organization. Advocating in Frankfort and in Washington and working to implement KFB programs at all levels, he has also done a lot of good.  In my work on the Senate Agriculture Committee, David has provided me with many valuable insights helping me better represent Kentucky farm families. Through multiple fly-ins and Farm Bills, we worked closely to develop policy to help support our agriculture communities. I would like to note one important project in particular we collaborated on: the 2004 Tobacco buyout. This landmark legislation not only reoriented our Depression-era Federal tobacco program toward the free market, but it also provided much-needed relief to some of the hardest hit farming communities in our State. With David's assistance, I championed this major legislation and worked with my colleagues in Congress to bring it to the President's desk.  In his role as KFB executive vice president, David has time and again proven his leadership to benefit the organization's members and farmers throughout the country. Through seminars, conferences, and workshops he led with the American Farm Bureau Federation, AFBF, David helped build the farm economy nationwide. One clear measure of his success is the growth in our Nation's farm communities during David's time advocating for American agriculture. The AFBF cites a growth of more than 3 million member families across the Nation in the last four decades. He has led a remarkable career and has so much to be proud of.  David's dedication to the Commonwealth has extended beyond the farm, helping families throughout Kentucky thrive. His work with our State's council on postsecondary education has helped students gain the skills they need to succeed in the workforce. By serving in leadership roles for the Kentuckians for Better Transportation, David helped encourage economic development with a safe and reliable infrastructure network. His passion for service runs deep, and David's experience continues to be an asset to the Commonwealth.  On behalf of the many men and women from our home State who have benefited from his leadership, I would like to express our gratitude to David for his career at the KFB. As he leaves the bureau to take the next steps in his career, I wish him the best and look forward to his great accomplishments to come.                          ____________________
