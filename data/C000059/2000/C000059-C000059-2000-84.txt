Chairman, I do not know the instances in these various products, but I have confidence that the appropriators have looked into this.  I have confidence that the USDA does not have time to look sometimes into the minutiae of what the gentleman is trying to do. They must respond immediately, not only with research but with dollars to back up that research, or we are going to have an epidemic on our hands with various produce and products in this country.  I would like to say one thing, produce is extremely important to this country. Fresh vegetables are important to this country, not just to the farmers but to the people who consume them. We need to have the research and the response as quickly as possible in this country to make sure that we continue to have the best produce at the best possible price for the consumers in this country.  In that sense, I would absolutely oppose the gentleman's amendment, and would urge all our Members to vote against it.
