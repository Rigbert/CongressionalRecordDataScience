Speaker, over the years, both Republican and Democratic Speakers have ruled that questions of privilege may not be used to criticize the legislative process, such as charges of inactivity in regard to a subject reported from committee. This precedent dates back to at least 1974 and has been renewed by Speakers of the House ever since.  The question of privilege that the gentleman from Pennsylvania (Mr. Holden) raises relates to scheduling of legislation. Just yesterday, the House passed a bill on the subject of family farmer bankruptcy protection, which the gentleman from Pennsylvania supported; and I thank him for that support. But this resolution is definitely not a question of privilege. The issue has been raised with the first alleged resolution of privilege that came up. The question is identical to that on which the Speaker has already ruled and on which the House has tabled an appeal.  I would urge the Speaker to sustain the point of order.
