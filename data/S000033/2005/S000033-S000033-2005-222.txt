 Speaker, I want to celebrate the remarkable work done by the young Vermonters who participate in the Child Labor Education and Action group at Brattleboro Union High School. CLEA is a student-run group dedicated to community education around issues of sweatshop labor in the developing world. It examines the dark and inhumane side of globalization, doing extensive research and traveling to amass the real story on what globalization means for low-income workers who toil in third-world sweatshops. The students then take what they learn and share it with their community in a variety of ways. They have also organized student groups throughout Vermont to address the problems with global sweatshops.  Four years ago, over 20 CLEA members traveled to Guatemala to build a school. Last year, 13 CLEA members went to Nicaragua to learn about the effect of international trace policies on labor conditions in that country. Let me cite a brief report from one of those travelers, Sarah Maceda-Maciel:       When our plane touched down in Managua, our bags might have      been stuffed with light cotton shirts and water bottles, but      our heads were filled with numbers like 90,000--the number of      Nicaraguan children who are not in school. Or 70 percent, the      amount of Nicaraguans who live on less than two dollars a      day. Or 6 billion dollars, the sum that Nicaragua has      accumulated in foreign debt.       We found the harsh realities of life in the third world.      There is something profoundly different between knowing that      children are hungry and learning that eight year old children      sniff glue to dull the knife of starvation. There is      something profoundly different between knowing that maternity      leave is not offered in sweatshops and learning that pregnant      women are forced to work so hard that they end up having      miscarriages in factory bathrooms.  The students returned from their trip determined to make a difference in how Americans view the harsh realities occasioned by free trade. In the words of Katherine Nopper, another CLEA member, ``Within our school we hope to engage and inform our classmates on the issues of child labor, free trade, fair trade, and what it means to be part of a sweat-free campaign. And we will continue to present our message to other area schools.''  This past year CLEA students have helped with the publication of a remarkable book, Challenging Child Labor: Education and Youth Action to Stop the Exploitation of Children. Several of the contributors are present and former CLEA members; other contributors include Senator Tom Harkin, Charles Kernaghan of the National Labor Committee, Kailash Satyarthi of the Global March Against Child Labor, and Upala Devi Banerjee of the U.N. Development Fund for Women.  I admire the work CLEA does, and am continually impressed, year in and year out, by the dedication of these young people to making the world a better place. They see the whole world as their province; they also realize that speaking to their peers in school, speaking to the larger community in southern Vermont, is part of the struggle to create a world in which justice has a higher value than profit. These students represent what is best about American youth, just as their advisor, Tim Kipp, represents what is best about American teachers.  Combining learning with service, the international with the local, passion for justice with the willingness to work hard to achieve justice, the members of CLEA serve as a model, ashining beacon, for what high school students can accomplish.                          ____________________
