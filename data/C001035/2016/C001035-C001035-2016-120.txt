President, I am pleased to report that due to a lot of hard work on both sides of the aisle by Senators and their staffs, the leaders, and particularly my colleague Senator Reed of Rhode Island, we have another group of amendments we are able to clear tonight.  I therefore ask unanimous consent that the following amendments be called up en bloc and reported by number: amendment No. 3934, offered by Senator King; amendment No. 3918, offered by Senator Rubio; amendment No. 3905, offered by Senator Heller; amendment No. 3926, offered by Senator Rubio; amendment No. 3961, offered by Senator Manchin; and amendment No. 3941, offered by Senator Booker.
