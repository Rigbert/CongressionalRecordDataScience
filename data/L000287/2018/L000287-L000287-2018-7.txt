Madam Speaker, our Nation is mourning. Our Nation is crying out to save our little children, save our babies.  History will not be kind to us as a nation and as a people if we continue to go down this road. We must stop the madness, and stop it now.  There was a man by the name of A. Philip Randolph, who was the dean of Black leadership during the sixties when we were planning the March on Washington. He kept saying: ``Maybe our foremothers and our forefathers all came to this great land in different ships, but we're all in the same boat now.''  Our little children, our babies, our young people, are crying out for help. We need help from Members of Congress. We can do better.                          ____________________
