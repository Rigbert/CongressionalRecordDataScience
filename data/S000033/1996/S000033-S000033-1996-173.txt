 Speaker, for the benefit of my colleagues I would like to have printed in the Record this statement by Kyle Anderson, a high school student from Rutland, Vermont, who was speaking at my recent town meeting on issues facing young people.       My topic is the UN Convention on the Rights of the Child,      and its applicability to us as citizens of the United States      and for our children in this country.       The world that we live in today is one of waste, want and      needless suffering. But in November of 1989, a dramatic step      was taken to treat this. On November 20, 1989, the General      Assembly of the United Nations adopted the Convention on the      Rights of the Child, a treaty that focuses on the protection,      survival, development and well-being of children.       Among the many rights which the Convention gives to      children are the following: the right to health care      services; the right to education; the right to protection      against discrimination on the basis or race, sex, religion,      etc.; the right to protection against abuse, neglect or      injury; the right to a name and nationality; the right to      express the child's views in matters affecting the child; the      right to have the child's interests be a primary      consideration in all proceedings concerning the child; the      right to be protected from economic exploitation, or      hazardous work; the right to be protected against torture, or      other cruel, inhumane or degrading treatment; and the right      to freedom of thought in conscience, religion and expression.       As an international goal it is certainly important; and      immediately after it was drafted, over 100 nations signed it,      and then ratified it, obligating themselves to nurture the      children of their respective territories. The U.S. wasn't      among the original signers, but signed the document on the      16th of February, 1995. But without ratification, the      Convention lies dormant. The United States didn't, and still      hasn't, fully recognized the importance of the document, or      its applicability to us.       Let me show you what I mean. (set up overhead: Cents of the      Absurd) Can everybody read that? . . . All right, it says the      1995 State of the World Children Report from UNICEF says that      we need to kindle a sense of absurdity at the idea that the      world cannot afford to meet the needs of all the world's      children for adequate nutrition, basic health care, primary      education and clean water. The following figures are offered      as kindling: it shows that all we really need to provide      basic care in nutrition, primary education, safe water and      sanitation, and family planning, for all the children, would      be $34 billion. Now, if you look at what is spent, they give      a few statistics, like $85 billion/yr. is spent on wine, $160      billion on beer, $400 billion on cigarettes, $250 billion on      advertising, and $800 billion on the military--that's      worldwide.       For the U.S., (next overhead: Winners & Losers--Federal      Spending) here we see a drastic decrease in spending on      housing, health care services, employment and training, mass      transit, Farmer's Home Administration, child nutrition,      especially, and education. All of these things have      decreased, between 1980-1990, and military spending has      increased 46%.       The fortunate and unfortunate kids of our age have      recognized the need for greater action in the sector of      children's well-being. Some of the things that youth has been      doing are as follows:       Nov. 20, 1992, in Washington, D.C.--The National Committee      on the Rights of the Child: Speaking Truth to Power;       May 4, 1992, at the Statehouse in Montpelier, VT--Rights of      the Child Day;       Feb. 10-14, 1993, in New York City and Vermont--New York      City and Vermont Student Homes Day;       Nov. 22, 1993, in Clarendon, VT--Youth in Action      Conference: Children First;       June 13-19, 1993, in Vienna, Austria--Children's World      Conference on Human Rights; and       April 29, 1995, in Montpelier, VT--Empowering Youth to      Action.       In closing, I would like to reemphasize the importance of      child development. This Convention is a great reminder of our      obligation, and a helper in those situations where our      priorities are trodden upon, in such areas as: the home,      during war, or just all alone on the streets. The Convention      will help, and will decrease the suffering. Thank you.       Congressman Sanders: Michael, thank you very much. I have      some familiarity with that issue, because I introduced the      Resolution in the House, trying to win support of the UN      Convention on the Rights of the Child, and Senator Leahy did      the same in the Senate, so Vermont has a strong interest in      this issue. In your judgment, why has the Congress not      ratified the Treaty?       Answer: Well, I really don't know. I thought . . . when      Bill Clinton came in, I thought that . . . he's an advocate      for this thing, and I was wondering why it hadn't gotten      ratified yet, but he needs the help of the Congress . . .       Congressman Sanders: Well, I think in fact, Clinton did      sign it but the problem is, it doesn't go into effect until      it is ratified, and the Senate has not ratified it. Are you      familiar with some of the arguments that the opponents of the      Treaty are making?       Answer: No.       Congressman Sanders: Okay. A lot of the arguments center      around the fact that they think it would take away from the      rights of American citizens, which is incorrect, and that the      UN would have too much power over what goes on in the United      States--those are some of the arguments that are being used.      I think you've raised a very important issue, and I think      that the chart, which shows the spending priorities, in our      nation and in our world, is very important. And what you're      suggesting, is that if we changed our priorities just a      little bit, we could wipe our hunger among children, we could      end the disgrace of having, in our own country, the highest      rate of childhood poverty in the entire industrialized world.      Okay, thank you very much for your presentation.                          ____________________
