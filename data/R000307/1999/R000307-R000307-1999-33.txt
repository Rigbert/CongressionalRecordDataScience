President, I ask unanimous consent that when the Senate completes its business today, it adjourn until the hour of 10 a.m. on Tuesday, September 28.  I further ask unanimous consent that on Tuesday, immediately following the prayer, the Journal of proceedings be approved to date, the morning hour be deemed expired, the time for the two leaders be reserved for their use later in the day, and the Senate then begin a period of morning business until 12:30, with Senators speaking for up to 5 minutes each with the following exceptions: Senator Durbin, or his designee, 10 to 10:30; Senator Snowe, or her designee, 10:30 to 11.
