 President, today I am introducing bipartisan legislation that, if enacted, will enable the Immigration and Naturalization Service (INS) to cut through and eventually eliminate the unacceptably long backlogs in its processing of applications for naturalization, adjustment of status, and other immigration benefits.  I am pleased that Senators Abraham, Jeffords, DeWine, Leahy, Reid, Moynihan, Mikulski, Graham, and Durbin have joined me as original cosponsors of this important bill.  All of us have heard the horror stories of the long delays in processing naturalization and immigration applications. What was once a 6-month process has now become a 3- to 4-year ordeal.  The ``Immigration Services and Infrastructure Improvement Act of 2000,'' which I am introducing today, would provide the Immigration and Naturalization Service with the direction and resources it needs to reduce the current immigration backlogs and hold it accountable to get the job done.  It is unacceptable that millions of people who have followed our nation's laws, made outstanding contributions to our nation, and paid the requisite fees have had to wait months--and in too many cases, years--to obtain the immigration services they need. The enormous delays in processing have had a negative impact on the reunification of spouses and minor children, and on businesses seeking to employ essential workers to help keep them globally competitive.  The fact is, there are many victims of an agency that is in dire need of a change in the way it does business. Today, it has become all too clear that the INS needs to re-engineer its adjudication process, which will require both additional resources and strong congressional direction and oversight.  The ``Immigration Services and Infrastructure Improvement Act'' would enable millions of law-abiding residents, immigrants, and businesses, who have played by the rules and paid fees to the INS, to have their applications processed in a timely manner.  This bill evolved from discussions with immigration advocates, the business community, State and local leaders, and the Administration. Specifically, this legislation would do three things.  First, it would create a separate ``Immigration Services and Infrastructure Improvement Account'' (``Account'') and authorize such sums as may be necessary to fund it.  This account would permit the INS to fund across several fiscal years infrastructure improvements, including additional staff, computer records management, fingerprinting, and nationwide computer integration. Moreover, it would pay for these infrastructure improvements through direct appropriations rather than through increased application fees.  Second, the ``Immigration Services and Infrastructure Improvement Act of 2000'' would require the INS to put together a plan on how it will eliminate existing backlogs and report on this plan before it could access any of the funds.  In its report, the INS would be required to describe its current processing capabilities and detail its plans to eliminate existing backlogs in immigration benefit applications and petitions.  And third, it would require the Department of Justice to submit an annual, detailed report to Congress, including data on the number of naturalization applications and immigration petitions processed and adjudicated in each of the fiscal years following enactment of the act.  The act would also require the INS to report on the number of cases still pending in the naturalization, immigrant and nonimmigrant visa categories. In some cases this would involve a state-by-state or regional analysis of INS's progress in processing applications in a timely fashion.  In the past 7 years, 6.4 million people applied for U.S. citizenship--more than the previous 37 years combined. Today, INS faces a backlog of 1.3 million naturalization applications. Although the INS has put more resources into processing naturalization applications, this has come at the expense of processing other immigration-related applications, such as those for lawful permanent residence. At the beginning of this year, the INS had a pending caseload of 951,350 adjustment of status applications--an eightfold increase since 1994.  As a result, major cities continue to face tremendous delays in the processing of INS naturalization and immigrant applications. Five cities--Los Angeles, New York, San Francisco, Miami, and Chicago--handle 65 percent of the nation's naturalization workload.  By now, most of us are familiar with the numbers. Indeed, it would be easy for one to look at and decry the statistics reflecting the enormous number of backlogged applications. Instead, I come to floor of the Senate today to talk about the human cost of these backlogs and what I intend to do through legislation to help the INS put itself on its proper course.  As one who represents California, a State that is number one among immigrant-receiving States, I have seen firsthand how families and businesses can be disproportionately affected by the smallest fluctuations in INS resources and services.  One out of every four Californians--about 8.5 million people--is foreign born. The average number of new immigrants to the State is more than 300,000 annually. Population growth of this magnitude is like adding a city the size of Anaheim, California each year.  The constant processing delays at the INS have had a tremendous impact on the ability of immigrants to naturalize, and seek services related to their application for green cards, work authorization, and family reunification.  On almost a daily basis, my office fields calls from people who have been waiting three or four years to naturalize or to adjust their status to that of lawful permanent resident. And this is after having paid a fee of $225 per naturalization application, and $220 for an adjustment of status application--per person. Imagine how much of an investment a family makes in order to play by the rules.  Applicants for these services are never really sure if their application is still in the process or lost, especially when the expected time for a fingerprint or interview notice comes and goes.  I have received numerous letters from constituents that vividly portray the human toil these backlogs have taken.  For example, one person wrote that he and his family have been in the country legally for more than 10 years. They filed their request for permanent residency at the right time. Their file, however, has moved so slowly within the INS that one of their sons is now about to ``age out'' of qualifying for permanent residence because he will turn 21 soon.  Just recently, I received a letter from a young student at Berkeley who filed a citizenship application in October 1996. She is still waiting to receive word from the INS on the correct status of her file.  She was told by the INS in January this year that it had closed her case in June 1999 without her knowledge or ability to address any concerns they might have had with her case. In fact, she was never told there were problems with her case.  Up until January, she had been told by the INS that she would be receiving her interview notice within six weeks. Unfortunately, six weeks became three years. Now, almost four years later, she has come to my office for assistance, wondering what she might have done to create this situation.  The fact is, like millions of others throughout the country, she is a victim of an agency that is in dire need of a change in the way it does business.  Millions of people are being prevented from participating in American civic life because of the inability of INS to process their naturalization applications in a timely fashion (e.g., they cannot vote, run for public office, assume certain government positions). U.S. citizens are unable to be reunited with their spouses and minor children because of the delays in INS processing.  And thousands of American businesses, such as high tech companies like Sun Microsystems and others, have been prevented from getting qualified workers because of the INS's inability to provide access to a critical portion of their workforce. Lengthy delays and inconsistencies in INS processing have taken a toll on company projects, planning and goals.  How does this legislation help Congress hold the INS accountable for the prompt delivery of services? If INS does not met the goals of set out in this legislation, it would have to explain to Congress why the backlogs persist and what the agency is doing to fix them. This legislation would also require the INS to describe the additional mechanisms and resources needed to meet Congress's mandate that backlogs be eliminated and that the processing of applications take place in an acceptable time frame.  While funds devoted to enforcing our immigration laws have rightfully been increased in recent years, until very recently, Congress had not provided increases in funding to the INS specifically to deal with the increased missions that Congress has imposed on it. Nor has Congress provided adequate funding to deal with the increased number of naturalization and other immigration benefits applications that have been submitted in recent years and continue to be submitted.  The business community, immigration community, and the Administration have indicated their support for mechanisms such as those included in my legislation. I wish to thank the following organizations whose valuable input and ideas helped shaped this important legislation:  American Business for Legal Immigration; American Council on International Personnel; American Immigration Lawyers Association; Hebrew Immigration Aid Society; Mexican American Legal Defense and Education Fund; National Association of Latino Elected Officials; National Asian Pacific American Legal Consortium; National Council of La Raza; United Jewish Communities; and United States Catholic Conference.  Mr. President, the ``Immigration Services and Infrastructure Improvement Act of 2000'' would provide direction and accountability on how the INS uses appropriated funds. Passage of this legislation would send a strong congressional directive to the INS that timely and efficient service is not merely goal, but a mandate.  I urge the Senate to act swiftly and pass this urgently needed legislation.                                 ______                                       By
