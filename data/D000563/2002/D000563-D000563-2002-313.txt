President, I rise tonight to introduce the Mental Health Patient Rights Act. This legislation will break down one of the barriers faced by thousands of Americans who face discrimination in the individual health insurance market because they have been treated at some time in their life for a mental condition. Senators Kennedy, Wellstone, and Corzine have joined me in this effort.  Each year some 18 million Americans suffer from depression, and fully a quarter of the country's adult population is faced with some form of mental illness. Many of them are not part of group coverage provided by employers and must rely on individual policies that they purchased themselves. Without coverage, many who are dealing with mental disease do not seek treatment. Indeed, repeated surveys have shown that concerns about the cost of mental care is one of the most common reasons that individuals decline to seek care. The Mental Health Patient Rights Act limits the ability of health care plans to redline individuals with a preexisting mental health condition.  I undertook this initiative when I read a letter from one of my Illinois constituents who was turned away from health care plans in the private nongroup market, due solely to a past history of treatment for a mental condition. This constituent, whom I will call Mary, suffered severe depression over 10 years ago and received treatment, which was successful. It allowed her to return to work.  At that time Mary had employer-sponsored health insurance through her husband's employment. But in the fall of 1998, Mary and her husband lost this employer-based insurance coverage when Mary's husband lost his job.  Mary applied for a comprehensive health insurance plan offered to individuals. Her application was declined because, as per the insurance company notice, due to her medical history of depression, she did not meet the company's underwriting requirements.  Mary wrote:       As I see it, we are being punished for accessing health      care. In 1987, when I became clinically depressed, I could      have chosen to avoid proper medical care, become unemployed      and received Social Security disability. I did not. I      obtained the help I needed and continued to support myself,      my family and contribute positively to society. Depression is      a treatable medical illness. Insurance companies must stop      their indiscriminate denial of coverage.  The Washington Post recently ran a column that documented a similar story about the discrimination that individuals with a history of mental illness face in our current health insurance market.  The column conveys the dilemma of Michelle Witte who was denied health insurance coverage because she was successfully treated for depression during her adolescence.  Unfortunately, Mary and Michelle are not alone. While the majority of Americans under age 65 have employer-sponsored group coverage, a significant minority, approximately 12.6 million individuals, rely on private, individual health insurance.  Underwriting in the individual health insurance market is fierce.  Just last week The Wall-Street Journal reported that a Wisconsin-based insurer, American Medical Security Group, Inc., is actually re-underwriting individual policies on an annual basis. At each annual renewal, this company reviews the individuals claims filed in the previous year and increases premiums to policyholders whose claims exceed the standard. Under the current system of care in the United States, individuals who are undergoing treatment or have a history of treatment for mental illness may find it particularly difficult to obtain private health insurance, especially if they must purchase it on their own and do not have an employer-sponsored group plan available to them.  That is why I have introduced this legislation. The Mental Health Patients' Rights Act closes this loophole by limiting any preexisting condition exclusion relating to a mental health condition to not more than 12 months and reducing this exclusion period by the total amount of previous continuous coverage.  It prohibits any health insurer that offers health coverage in the individual insurance market from imposing a preexisting condition exclusion relating to a mental health condition unless a diagnosis, medical advice or treatment was recommended or received within the 6 months prior to the enrollment date.  And it prohibits health plans in the individual market from charging higher premiums to individuals based solely on the determination that the individual has had a preexisting mental health condition.  These provisions apply to all health plans in the individual market, regardless of whether a state has enacted an alternative mechanism, such as high risk pool, to cover individuals with preexisting health conditions.  The Mental Health Patients' Rights Act complements ongoing efforts to enhance parity between mental health services and other health benefits.  This is because parity alone will not help individuals who do not have access to any affordable health insurance due to preexisting mental illness discrimination.  The Patients' Rights Act does not mandate that insurers provide mental health services if they are not already offering such coverage. It simply prohibits plans in the private non-group market from redlining individuals who apply for general health insurance based solely on a past history of treatment for a mental condition.  The legislation is backed by more than compelling anecdotal stories. I asked for a study from the GAO and last month they told me the new study documents that individuals with mental disorders, past or present, face restrictions in purchasing health insurance in the individual market that exceed restrictions for physical health preexisting conditions in the same cost category.  GAO interviewed insurance carriers that sell individual market insurance and sell insurance in most of the 34 states in which carriers are permitted to medically underwrite.  Collectively, these insurers cover more than one million individuals representing more than 10 percent of all individual market enrollees. Researchers found that carriers denied coverage for applicants with selected mental disorders more than half of the time, while denying coverage for applicants with other selected chronic conditions just 30 percent of the time.  Even in states which have established subsidized insurance options as a coverage option for applicants rejected in the individual insurance market, sometimes called high-risk pools, these options have higher premium rates.  High-risk pools also may include more restrictions on mental health benefits than other benefits and many have waiting lists due to budget constraints.  In the seven states without high-risk pools and without guaranteed issue requirements, applicants with a history of mental illness are likely to find themselves without any viable health insurance coverage option.  In other words, it is not about money. If the insurance company wants to ask you if you have a history in your family of cancer, heart disease, diabetes, things that might have some impact on the cost of health insurance, it is understood that is part of underwriting. But now they are including mental illness as part of this inquiry, and regardless of the fact that it doesn't seem to be, or prove out to be as expensive to the insurance companies, they are just discriminating against people who have this history of mental illness.  That is why I am introducing this legislation.  It does not make sense that a person is rendered uninsurable for all health needs simply because he or she seeks treatment for mental illness. Mental illness is a disease just as cancer or asthma or the flu is a disease.  Yet it is clear that when it comes to mental health millions of Americans must battle not only with their disease, but for their access to adequate insurance coverage.  I invite my colleagues to enlist in this important initiative to ensure that such individuals are not discriminated against when applying for health insurance coverage.  More than 80 organizations representing consumers, family members, health professionals and providers have endorsed the Mental Health Patient Rights Act. I urge you to do the same.  Some of us who saw the movie, ``A Beautiful Mind,'' are reminded that there are people who have suffered from mental illness who have recovered and made great contributions to America, as John Nash has at Princeton, and as those who have been involved in so many other walks of life. It is unfair in America for us to discriminate against a person because of a history of mental illness. Yet it is a fact of life.  I salute my colleagues, Senators Wellstone and Domenici, for their leadership on this issue. I join them in their effort and hope this bill will complement what they are doing to not only make mental illness subject to coverage by health insurance but also to end this discrimination against those who have a history of that illness. We should be working to break down the stigma of mental illness, not to maintain it.  I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be printed in the Record.  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the Record, as follows:                                S. 2393       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of      the United States of America in Congress assembled,     SECTION 1.
