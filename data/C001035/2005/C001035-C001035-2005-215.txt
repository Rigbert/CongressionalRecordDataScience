President, before the Senator from California leaves the floor, let me say I admire the Senator from California, who is one of the most careful, thorough Members of this body.  The point that I was trying to make, and perhaps not as artfully as I should have, is that the Homeland Security Committee has held extensive hearings on the Homeland Security Grant Program. I am not aware of other committees in the Senate having done that. We have held extensive hearings over 3 years. We drafted a bipartisan bill. We received input from a number of groups. We have had two different markups, and the bill was reported unanimously last year, with only Senator Lautenberg in dissent this year. So our bill has had a great deal of consideration. That was the only point I was trying to make.  As the Senator knows, I have a great deal of admiration for what a careful legislator she is.
