 President I will take 1 minute.  The President doesn't need any more time; he read it and negotiated it. I don't need any more time; I spent over 100 hours on that. It is my job on the committee of responsibility. The Senator presiding doesn't need more time; he spent hundreds of hours. The Senator from Oklahoma doesn't need more time because he spent hundreds of hours on it. I defy anyone to find five other Members of the Senate who have spent as much time.  Usually what happens is we take on the responsibility to inform our colleagues based on our committees because we have more expertise when assigned the job. When it is tax policy, I don't know what the Tax Code says on major changes, but I rely upon the committee headed on the Democratic side by my friend from New York to tell me what is in it from spending hundreds of hours going through the detail.  This is a different way to do business. I don't ever remember Members having voted on a treaty without there being a significant report from the relevant committees on the floor.  The President doesn't need any more time. I don't need any more time. Senator Byrd says he needs more time, and I don't know anybody more conscientious than Senator Byrd. But the reason for more time is there haven't been any hearings.  I yield the floor.
