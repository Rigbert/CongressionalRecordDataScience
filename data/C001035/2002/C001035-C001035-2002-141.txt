President, I am very pleased that legislation I authored has been included in the final version of the farm bill. The legislation, known as the Suburban and Community Forestry and Open Space Initiative Act, would help to combat the threat of suburban sprawl which has already consumed tens of thousands of acres of forest land in the southern part of my home State.  I very much appreciate the assistance of Senator Lugar and Senator Harkin, as well as Senators Jack Reed and Mike Crapo, who have worked with me to put together this initiative.  Sprawl occurs because the economic value of forest or farmland cannot compete with the value of developed land. In my home State, the problem is particularly acute in southern Maine where over a 100-percent increase in urbanized land over the past two decades has resulted in Greater Portland being labeled as the ``sprawl capital of the Northeast.''  I am alarmed by the amount of working forest land and open space that has given way to strip malls and cul-du-sacs. Our State is trying hard to respond to this challenge. The people of Maine have approved a bond issue to preserve land through the Land for Maine's Future board, and they continue to use scarce local funds and contribute their time and money to preserve special lands and to support our State's 88 land trusts.  Of course, the problem of sprawl is not limited just to Maine or to the Northeast. Rapid, unmanageable growth affects many States and poses a significant threat to forest land across the United States.  The effects of sprawl were highlighted by a study conducted by the U.S. Forest Service last year. It examined forests in 13 southern States and found that 12 million acres of southern forest land could be lost to sprawl by the year 2020.  In Maine and elsewhere, communities are working hard to come up with new strategies to protect our working forests and to safeguard our communities from the effects of sprawl. I think it is time for the Federal Government to lend a hand to these efforts.  My legislation, which was drafted with the advice of landowners, conservation groups, and forestry experts, would establish a $50 million grant program within the Forest Service to support locally driven projects that preserve working forests. State and local governments as well as nonprofit organizations could compete for funds to purchase land or conservation easements to keep forest lands in their traditional uses.  The $50 million that would be authorized by my legislation would help achieve a number of stewardship objectives. First, it would help prevent forest fragmentation and preserve working forests, helping to maintain the supply of timber that fuels Maine's most significant industries. Second, the resources made available would be a valuable tool for communities that are struggling to properly manage growth and prevent sprawl. Currently, if a community were to turn to the Federal Government for assistance, none would be found.  My bill will change that by making the Federal Government an active partner in preserving forest land and managing sprawl, while leaving decisionmaking to States and communities.  Mr. President, by enacting this legislation, Congress will provide a much needed boost to local conservation initiatives and will help sustain the vitality of our natural-resource-based communities.  I ask unanimous consent that letters of endorsement from the Maine Nature Conservancy, the Maine Audubon Society, and the National Association of State Foresters be printed in the Record.  There being no objection, the letters were ordered to be printed in the Record, as follows:                                              National Association                                           of State Foresters,                                 Washington, DC, December 5, 2002.     Hon. Susan M. Collins,     U.S. Senate,     Washington, DC.       Dear Senator Collins: On behalf of the National Association      of State Foresters, I would like to thank you for your      efforts to reduce the impacts of urban and suburban sprawl on      our nation's forest lands. Your proposed amendment, the      Suburban and Community Forestry and Open Space Initiative, to      Chairman Harkin's Farm Bill (S. 1731) demonstrates your      commitment to minimizing conversion of suburban forest lands      to non forest uses.       We support the overall concepts of the legislation. NASF      does not currently have a position on whether easements or      title to land purchased with federal funds should be expanded      from state to non-profit entities. However, maintaining      working forested lands in suburban environments is consistent      with NASF's goals.       As the Southern Forest Resource Assessment recently      released by the U.S. Forest Service clearly demonstrates, one      of the major threats to forest land is urban sprawl.     The provisions in the Forestry Title of S. 1731 provide      important tools to enable landowners to keep their land in      trees and sustain the public benefits their forests provide.      Your amendment is another tool to address this critical      concern.       Thank you for your commitment to sustainable forest      management and to reducing suburban sprawl.           Sincerely,                                                Larry A. Kotchman,     President.                                  ____                                        Maine Audubon Society,                                   Falmouth, ME, November 2, 2001.     Senator Susan Collins,     Russell Senate Office Building,     Washington, DC.       Dear Senator Collins: We are pleased to be able to offer      our support of your proposed Suburban and Community Forestry      and Open Space Initiative Act of 2001, which would expand      opportunities for conserving forestland under the Cooperative      Forestry Assistance program. This Act offers a new      opportunity to protect some of the remaining actively managed      forestlands that provide habitat for many of our native      species, and encourages those lands to be managed      sustainably, with input and use from the local community.      This Act comes at a time when pressure to develop small      woodlands in southern Maine is ever increasing, interest in      conserving those woodlands is also increasing, but funds for      forest conservation are still limited.       Southern and Coastal Maine has the highest level of woody      plant and wildlife species diversity in the state.      Unfortunately, this area is one of the most desirable for      development and increasing development pressures are creating      a checkerboard of non-contiguous habitat for wildlife.      Although the overall population is relatively stable in      southern Maine, residents of larger towns and cities are      moving to surrounding rural communities, with residential      development, both permanent and seasonal homes, spreading      into large expresses of formerly agricultural and forested      open space.       In its final report dated January 1996, the Maine      Environmental Priorities Project (MEPP) concluded that      ``patterns of development throughout southern and coastal      Maine and in riparian zones statewide seriously threatened      some species and some rare and critical habitats as well as      the overall productivity of Maine's terrestrial ecosystems.''      Protecting forest land throughout southern Maine wildlife.       During the past two years Maine Audubon, in concert with      several other state and federal agencies and nonprofit      conservation organizations, has been conducting outreach to      municipalities and land trusts to encourage the conservation      of forestland, including large blocks of underveloped and      unfragmented forestland that provide habitat for a wide      variety of Maine's native plants and animals. We are      providing local citizens with information about the high      value habitats in their community, and many of those we have      spoken with are intersted in acting to conserve forest land      but have few choices for funding land protection. If the bill      passes, we will be able to suggest a new source of funds for      their hard work.       Thank you for taking the initiative to help conserve      Maine's forest landscape and all the public benefits they      provide amidst the threat of sprawl. We look forward to      working with you on passage of the bill and on the subsequent      rule-making which will speak out just have the bill would be      implemented.           Sincerely,                                                  Sally Stockwell,     Director of Conservation.                                  ____                                    The Trust for Public Land,                                   Portland, ME, November 2, 2001.     Hon. Susan M. Collins,     U.S. Senate,     Washington, DC.       Dear Senator Collins: On behalf of the Trust for Public      Land, I am pleased to express our support for the Suburban      and Community Forestry and Open Space Initiative Act of 2001.      This proposal will provide a much-needed focus on working      forests that provide important resources in and around      Maine's towns and cities that are facing significant      development pressures. We applaud your foresight in      addressing this issue.       As the Trust for Public Land pursues its mission of      protecting land for people in Maine, we are acutely aware of      the difficult choices many landowners face as land values      rise and development pressures intensify. In addition, the      forest lands that lie in the path of development are      incredibly important to local residents for a variety of      resources, including recreation, wildlife habitat, water      quality and open space. Your legislation will allow these      critical lands to remain intact as community assets by      focusing federal assistance to landowners in areas affected      by suburban sprawl. This is a much-needed addition to the      resource conservation efforts that states, localities and      non-governmental partners are already undertaking and will      provide the extra funding leverage needed to successfully      meet the challenges of the future.       Our work with willing sellers across the state leads us to      believe that the Suburban and Community Forestry and Open      Space Initiative Act of 2001 will make a difference in many      Maine communities and will leave them in good shape for      future generations. Maine's forest resources are absolutely      critical to the quality of life that attracts residents and      visitors alike, and proposals like this one will ensure that      we address the conservation of those resources wisely.       Thank you for your leadership on this and many other issues      affecting Maine. We look forward to working with you.           Sincerely,                                                Jennifer Melville,     Maine Field Office.                                  ____                                       The Nature Conservancy,                                  Brunswick, ME, November 2, 2001.     Hon. Susan Collins,     U.S. Senate, Russell Senate Office Building, Washington, DC.       Dear Senator Collins: On behalf of the Trustees and 13,000      members of The Nature Conservancy of Maine, I am writing to      you in support of your recently filed Suburban and Community      Forestry and Open Space Initiative Act of 2001.       From the St. John project in Northern Maine to the Machias      River downeast to Mt. Agamenticus in the South, the Nature      Conservancy is working in partnership with local communities,      the state, and federal governments to protect the best      remaining natural place in our state. As population continues      to increase in southern Maine, it is becoming increasingly      clear that growth and development could overtake and destroy      some of southern Maine's most outstanding forests and natural      areas. Your legislation could play an important role in      forever protecting these places. Two key sites, in      particular, come to mind as projects that could benefit from      Suburban and Community Forestry and Open Space Initiative      funds:       Leavitt Plantation Project, Parsonsfield: Encompassing      8,600 contiguous acres, Leavitt Plantation represents the      largest remaining block of forestland in one ownership south      of Sebago Lake. Threatened by sprawl and development, this      forest includes identified deer wintering and waterfowl/     wading bird habitat, and populations of seventeen rare      plants. The Leavitt Plantation Forest was to be cut up into      as many as 13 parcels early last year. The land's fate as      wildlife habitat, hunting and fishing grounds, hiking and      snowmobiling destination, and as an economic resource for the      region hung in the balance. Today, thanks to the cooperative      approach of a forest investment company, a conservation      group, the State, a small Maine town, area citizens and more,      this land is slated to be protected forever. But additional      funds are needed to complete the conservation of this      project.       Mt. Agamenticus, York, South Berwick, Elliot, Wells,      Ogunquit: Mt. Agamenticus, located in rapidly developing York      County, is the largest block of unfragmented, undeveloped      land near the coast between Baltimore and Portland. This vast      area is rich in native plants and wildlife, and home to      important and rare species. The forest also provides an      economic boost to the region. Mt. Agamenticus is also one of      the largest remaining recreational open spaces in southern      coastal Maine, the area is popular with birders, hikers,      bikers, and hunters, and a ``Mecca'' for mountain biking in      New England and the area consistently draws visitors from all      over the country to experience the mountain. In this rapidly      growing area of southern Maine, large, vast areas of open      space are becoming very scarce. The remaining forested lands      of Mt. Agamenticus area are threatened by sprawl and      development. However, if funded, a plan is in place to      protect this area for the benefit of the citizens of Maine      and future generations.       The Nature Conservancy supports your efforts to bring      additional federal funds to projects like these in Southern      Maine and throughout the state. Conservation of these great      places requires a commitment from the private sector as well      as from government, we appreciate your willingness to provide      leadership on such a vital issue to the people of Maine.           Sincerely,                                                     Kent Wommack,     Executive Director/Vice President.                                  ____                                            Friends of Acadia,                                 Bar Harbor, ME, October 16, 2001.     Hon. Susan M. Collins,     U.S. Senator, Russell Senate Office Building, Washington, DC.       Dear Susan: Friends of Acadia offers its full support for      the anti-sprawl bill you have initiated. It will have utility      across Maine.       Your proposal is of special interest in our region. It      offers a real hope of dealing with the sprawl that is      consuming so much of the Route 3 gateway landscape on the      mainland just above Mount Desert Island and Acadia National      Park.       Please let me know how we can help you advance this      important legislation.       Thank you for your leadership.           Yours sincerely,                                                    W. Kent Olson,     President.                                  ____                                   Maine Coast Heritage Trust,                                     Topsham ME, October 26, 2001.     Re Suburban and Community Forestry and Open Space Initiative          Act of 2001.     Senator Susan M. Collins,     U.S. Senate, Russell Senate Office Building, Washington, DC.       Dear Senator Collins: It is with great enthusiasm that I      write to express Maine Coast Heritage Trust's support for      your far-sighted Suburban and Community Forestry and Open      Space Initiative.       Maine's rural and suburban lands are changing fast as more      people move into Maine or move out of Maine's urban areas     and into the rural countryside. This pattern of development      is altering the character of our state by diminishing both      its traditional villages and surrounding open farms and      forests. It also has a significant impact on local and state      budgets as expensive new schools and roads are built to      service these new neighborhoods.       Your initiative would provide important federal funds to be      matched by state and private dollars. As you know, Maine      voters showed their strong support for conserving open land      when they overwhelmingly endorsed the $50 million Land for      Maine's Future bond in 1999. Furthermore, the success of      Maine's 88 land trusts (perhaps the highest number of trusts      per capita in the nation) is a testament to Mainers'      commitment to maintaining the rural character of the state.      Your proposal would help leverage hard-won public and private      dollars.       I was particularly pleased to learn that your proposal      would complement the Forest Legacy Program. Forest Legacy has      been a critically important source of federal funds for      conserving large tracts of Maine's northwoods. Its      continuation is vital.       Thank you ever so much for your creative leadership and      hard work on behalf of land conservation efforts in Maine and      across America.           Sincerely,                                                    James J. Espy,                                                        President.
