 President, I ask unanimous consent that my name be added as a cosponsor of S. 2022, the Crime Identification Technology Act of 1998. Mr. President, inadvertently my name was left out and I was not included as a cosponsor on July 13, 1998, the day I spoke on the Senate floor urging the passage of this bill.
