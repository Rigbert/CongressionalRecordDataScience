 President, I thank Tim Rieser and Mark Lippert, a representative of Senator Leahy's staff, Jennifer Chartrand, and, of course, my longtime associate, Robin Cleveland, and Billy Piper as well, for their great work on this bill. I thank Senator Leahy. It was good to work with him again this year.  Having said that, I understand there are 5 minutes that Senator Stevens has reserved. I am told he is happy for me to yield that time back.
