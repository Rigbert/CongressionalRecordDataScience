President, this weekend, the Northwest Youth Corps celebrated its 30th year of providing young people with opportunities to learn and lead. For three decades, Northwest Youth Corps has educated youth and young adults and instilled in them a strong sense of leadership, community, and environmental stewardship.  Northwest Youth Corps, NYC, founder Art Pope created NYC in 1984. Mr. Pope's inspiration for the NYC stemmed from the 1930s-era Civilian Conservation Corps, CCC, which provided work to the unemployed during the Great Depression. Mr. Pope was inspired by the hands-on, education-based model of the CCC and wanted to extend the vision of hard work and service to modern youth. The NYC philosophy encourages youth to pursue individual achievement, develop a solid work ethic and leadership skills, all while benefitting their communities and the environment.  Thirty years ago, NYC extended this vision to its first class of 52 students. Today, NYC serves more than 1,000 teens per year across 5 States. NYC offers a wide variety of programs for youth and teens from 12 to 19 years old. Youth enrolled in NYC summer programs learn conservation values in a hands-on learning environment. Summer programs range from teaching youth how to build trails and enhance natural habitats to 6-week camping programs where teens learn reforestation techniques. At the summer program graduation last year, I saw firsthand the sense of accomplishment and pride NYC students feel upon completing 6 weeks of conservation efforts in our State's beautiful forests.  In 1997, NYC drew from the success of its summer programs and established a full-year high school. Over the past 17 years, the OutDoor High School has grown into a fully-accredited, tuition-free, private high school with a strong focus on applied learning and environmental stewardship.  NYC's hands-on conservation education programs have enriched the lives of more than 16,000 students over the past 30 years, and have touched countless communities and ecosystems across the west. It is my pleasure to recognize Northwest Youth Corps 30th anniversary. I look forward to NYC's continued contribution to the community for many, many more years.                          ____________________
