Speaker, too often today we call people ``heroes'' when in fact their actions do not rise to the level of the heroic. Tonight, however, I want to say a few words to honor the memory of a true hero, Prince George's County, Maryland, police officer Steven Francis Gaughan, who was killed in the line of duty on June 21 trying to protect the community that he loved.  Officer Gaughan was a 15-year veteran of the police force, and was a member of a special unit that tracks and arrests drug dealers and violent criminals. According to all who knew him, Steven was devoted to his work, his church, sports teams and family; his wife, Donna, his son, Daniel, and his daughter, Rachel. To Donna, his children and all his family and friends, I extend on behalf of all of us our deepest sympathies.  Let me close, Mr. Speaker, by quoting the Washington Post, which stated: ``Steven's exemplary courage, and his profound sacrifice, stand as painful reminders of how little is truly routine about police work, and of the debt of gratitude that officers are owed by society. His death is a blow to the community, but by his bravery he set an example and left a legacy that will not be soon forgotten.''  Mr. Speaker, Steven Gaughan was a hero, and he will be deeply missed. May God bless his soul and comfort his family.                          ____________________
