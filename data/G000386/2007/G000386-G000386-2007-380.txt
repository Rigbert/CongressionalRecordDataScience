 I emphasize that we are told by the chairman of the Budget Committee time after time that there is no tax increase in this budget. But if you do nothing--and doing nothing is not an excuse to have the biggest tax increase in the history of this country go in without even a vote of Congress. If you are going to raise taxes, you ought to at least vote them up, it seems to me, so you can be held responsible. It seems to me to be very irresponsible to say that you can have the biggest tax increase in the history of the country and not think you can do economic harm and strike a blow against economic freedom for individuals.
