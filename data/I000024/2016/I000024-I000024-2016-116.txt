I have 20 kids and grandkids. We used to compete with each other in exchanging pictures, one of the many things that we had in common.  I look forward to visiting. I look forward to making this a major accomplishment. It is so important to do it today because we have a recess coming up, the House has a recess coming up, and there are a lot of people and companies out there who are making decisions now as to what they are going to do, all predicated on their certainty that this bill is going to pass. So we will join together and just do the best we can to make that happen for the sake of a lot of jobs around the country.
