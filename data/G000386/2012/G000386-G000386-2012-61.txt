 President, when my colleagues come over to vote, I hope they will take note of a constituent of mine and wish him well.  Taylor Morris, a Navy wounded person from Afghanistan, who is an explosives expert, lost parts of four limbs. He is at the bottom of the escalator as you go to the subway. He is one of our wounded heroes, and I would like to have my colleagues recognize him.                       Aurora, Colorado Shootings
