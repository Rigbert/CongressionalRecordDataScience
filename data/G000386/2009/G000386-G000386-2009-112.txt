 President, I have here a letter dated September 23 of this year from Val Halamadaris, the president of the National Association for Home Health and Hospice. This organization represents home health agencies across the country.  Mr. President, Mr. Halamadaris wrote this letter in response to the $43 billion in home health cuts in the Finance Committee package, which presumes to be the same number that is used in the Reid bill. In this letter, he stated:       It is crucial to the survival of the home health services      delivery system that you work to reduce the $43 billion in      cuts currently contained in the Senate Finance Committee's      health reform package. Our analysis indicates that by 2016,      the proposed cuts in home health care services payment rates      will lead to nearly 70 percent of providers nationwide at      risk of closing because their costs will exceed Medicare      payments. If that occurs, President Obama's promise that      Medicare beneficiaries will not be adversely affected by      health care reform will be broken.  I have yet to hear from a home health care provider in Iowa that these permanent cuts will make it easier for them to care for their Medicare beneficiaries. Instead, I hear these cuts would reduce access to home health services.  The second letter I asked to have inserted in the Record is from the Iowa Alliance in Home Care, and they wrote:       Ensuring that Medicare home health payments are not reduced      further is essential to avoid the resulting limited or no      access to home health services for many Iowans who prefer to      receive services in their home.  Not only is the chief actuary saying it, as the chart reflects, but people who are connected with the business of home health care are saying it: These permanent cuts will in fact jeopardize access to home health services in Iowa. So if the home health cuts in the Reid bill are allowed to go into effect, thenIowa's seniors, who prefer to live full lives from their homes, will be forced to live in the more expensive settings of facilities such as nursing homes.  I believe many Members on both sides of the aisle share my concern about home health care cuts.  I have here a third letter, this one dated from July 27, 2007, and it is written to Senator Baucus and me.  Mr. President, I use this letter, even though it is 2 years old, because we were getting entreaties from 61 of our colleagues--of which 52 now still serve in the Senate--about a legislative proposal to cut Medicare home health payments in that year--2007--by $9.7 billion and hospice payments by more than $1.1 billion. They urged me and Senator Baucus, at that time, to ensure that home health and hospice providers receive full market basket inflation adjustments. They also urged us to oppose any cuts in payment rates through administrative actions.  In the letter, these Members stated that home health and hospice care ``have been demonstrated to be cost-effective alternatives to institutional care in both Medicare and Medicaid programs.'' They stated that ``reducing Medicare home health and hospice payments would place the quality of home health care and hospice and the home care delivery system at significant risk.''  Of these 61 Senators who signed this letter 2 years ago, 52 are currently here debating this bill in the Senate. Of those 52 Senators, 37 are from his side of the aisle who are now proposing $43 billion in cuts instead of $9.7 billion in home payment cuts and $1.1 billion in hospice payments cuts. I would think they would find these kinds of cuts three or four times--four times what we were talking about 2 years ago to be very unrealistic, and to keep home health as a viable organization going.  We also must look beyond health care when we look at the impact of these permanent cuts. I have also heard from providers in Iowa that permanent cuts such as these will make it even harder for them to keep their doors open. So around 3,500 Iowans who work at home health agencies are at risk of losing their jobs at a time when we have 10 percent unemployment, at a time when more of this country is concerned that Congress ought to be working on creating jobs, jobs, jobs as opposed to the health care issue and in some cases cutting jobs out. The Labor Department reported today that unemployment is 10 percent. Now is not the time to consider bills that increase unemployment rates.  About an hour ago, the Senator from Nebraska offered this motion I am speaking in favor of now, to send this bill to the Finance Committee with instructions to report a bill without these very enormous home health cuts that are in it. We should take this opportunity to fix the bill and then come back to the full Senate with a better bill. That is why I support the motion of the Senator from Nebraska to commit, and I urge my colleagues to do the same.  I yield the floor.                               Exhibit 1                                              National Association                                      for Home Care & Hospice,                               Washington, DC, September 23, 2009.     Re Medicare Home Health Services.     Hon. Charles E. Grassley,     U.S. Senate,     Washington, DC.       Dear Senator Grassley: I am writing to thank you for your      continued support of home care patients nationwide and to      enlist your help to ensure that access to home health      services remains a reality for more than 3 million senior and      disabled individuals that benefit from these important      services.       It is crucial to the survival of the home health services      delivery system that you work to reduce the $43 billion in      cuts currently contained in the Senate Finance Committee's      health reform package. Our analysis indicates that by 2016,      the proposed cuts in home health services payment rates will      lead to nearly 70% of providers nationwide at risk of closing      because their costs will exceed Medicare payments. If that      occurs, President Obama's promise that Medicare beneficiaries      will not be adversely affected by health care reform efforts      will be broken.       Invariably, providers of services facing rate cuts always      cry out that care will be lost. However, history tells us      that our warning should be heeded. The Balanced Budget Act of      1997 was expected to cut home health services spending by      $16.1 billion in five years. Instead, the rate changes cut      over $70 billion, leading to the loss of care to nearly 1.5      million Medicare beneficiaries. That change also led to      higher outlays under state Medicaid programs, as well as      greater use of nursing homes, hospitals, and other      institutional settings. Still today, about $17 billion is      spent on home health services, as compared with about $19      billion in home health outlays in 1997.       Several factors need to be understood about the current      Finance Committee proposal. First, the proposal is not      consistent with MedPAC advice. The proposal reduces rates to      a point where Medicare margins will average zero. MedPAC, in      its deliberations, clearly recognized the need for some level      of margin in order to stay in business. In fact, we      understand that MedPAC's executive director, Mark Miller,      informed House Ways and Means members that MedPAC did not      recommend a zero margin.       Second, there is a serious misunderstanding of Medicare      margins. MedPAC estimates margins for 2009 will be 12.2%.      However, this estimation does not include the impact of      nearly 7% in rate reductions planned by way of regulation by      2011. Further, it does not include nearly 1,700 important      providers of home health services, hospital-based agencies.      Also, it does not reveal that the ``average'' is made up of a      very wide range of individual agency margins with over 30%      below zero already. Finally, reliance on Medicare margins      does not convey that the total margin of agencies is      estimated at 2% with Medicaid and Medicare Advantage losses      driving the overall margin down.       Third, unlike other health care providers such as      hospitals, the expansion of health insurance will not bring      additional business of any material level. Home health      patients average nearly 80 years of age and are already      insured by Medicare or Medicaid. This means that the Medicare      cuts to home health agencies are not offset by new revenues      from newly insured patients. Instead, the proposed cuts of      over 13.5% of spending on home health services will be as      real as can be.       Fourth, the home health services community has put forward      a credible and substantive alternative set of proposals for      reforming the Medicare payment system. While the Chairman's      Mark incorporates many of these proposals, the level of cuts      is unsustainable. In fact, the level of cuts exceeds the $34      billion President Obama's budget recommended by nearly $10      billion. Still, the industry's proposal itself meets or      exceeds the Obama budget target.       Fifth, the home health services cuts are far      disproportionate to other provider sectors. The Chairman's      Mark seeks 9.4% of all the Medicare cuts from home health      care while home health makes up only 3% of the Medicare      program currently. That disproportionate impact is further      magnified by the fact that, unlike most other health care      providers and insurers, expanding health insurance will have      no meaningful increase in home health care business.       This is a historic time in this country, an opportunity to      secure health care for all as a fundamental right. However,      these reforms should not be done at the expense of our most      vulnerable senior citizens, the homebound and infirm. Your      leadership on this matter is greatly appreciated. Please let      us know what we can do to help you succeed.       You have my great respect and admiration, now and always.           Sincerely,                                              Val J. Halamandaris,                                                        President.                               Exhibit 2                                   Iowa Alliance in Home Care,                                 Des Moines, IA, December 4, 2009.     Hon. Charles Grassley,     Ranking Member, Committee On Finance, Dirksen Senate Office          Building, Washington, DC.       Senator Grassley: I'm contacting you today to urge your      assistance concerning an issue of great significance to      Iowa's dedicated home care nurses and other providers of      valuable and needed in-home health care services to Iowans.      The Iowa Alliance in Home Care respectfully requests your      support to have the Senate Finance committee report back to      the Senate, in response to a motion with instructions, a      modified H.R. 3590 bill that does not include cuts in      Medicare payments to home health agencies totaling $42.1      billion.       Your urgent action is critically important to ensure that      access to quality health care services delivered in the home      setting is not compromised. Proposed cuts in Medicare home      health reimbursement would be devastating as most of Iowa's      home care providers (i.e. public health departments, small      businesses) rely largely or exclusively on Medicare and      Medicaid payment to justify their operations which includes      employment for thousands of Iowans. Insufficient Medicaid      home health reimbursement, recently worsened by Governor      Culver's ATB state budget cuts, has been reduced by an      additional 5% effective 12/1/2009. In short, ensuring that      Medicare home health payments are not reduced further is      essential to avoid the resulting limited or no access to home      health services access for many Iowans who prefer to receive      services in their own home.       Senator, thank you for your past home health care support.      We would greatly appreciate your immediate attention to this      most critical of needs for our Iowa home health care      community.           Regards,                                                     Mark Wheeler,                                               Executive Director.                               Exhibit 3                                                  U.S. Senate,                                    Washington, DC, July 27, 2007.     Hon. Max Baucus, Chairman,     Hon. Charles Grassley, Ranking Member,     Senate Finance Committee,     Washington, DC.       Dear Chairman Baucus and Ranking Member Grassley: Home      health and hospice have become increasingly important parts      of our health care system. The kinds of highly skilled and      often technically complex services that our nation's home      health and hospice agencies provide have enabled millions of      our most frail and vulnerable seniors and disabled citizens      avoid hospitals and nursing homes. By preventing such      institutional care, home health and hospice services save      Medicare millions of dollars each year. Most importantly,      they enable individuals to stay just where they want to be--     in the comfort and security of their own homes. We therefore      urge you to ensure that Medicare beneficiaries continue to      have access to important home health and hospice services by      supporting full market basket inflation adjustments, as      provided under current law, and opposing any cuts in payment      rates through administrative actions.       The Administration's FY 2008 budget includes a legislative      proposal to cut Medicare home health payments by $9.7 billion      and hospice payments by more than $1.1 billion over five      years. It also includes additional administrative cuts in      payment rates. The Medicare home health benefit has already      taken a larger hit in spending reductions over the past ten      years than any other Medicare benefit. In fact, home health      as a share of Medicare spending has dropped from 8.7 percent      in 1997 to 3.2 percent today, and is projected to decline to      2.6 percent of Medicare spending by 2015. This downward      spiral in home health spending began with provisions in the      Balanced Budget Act of 1997 (BBA), which resulted in a 50      percent cut in Medicare home health spending by 2001--far      more than the Congress intended or the Congressional Budget      Office (CBO) projected.       We believe that further reductions in home health and      hospice payments would be counterproductive to controlling      overall health care costs. Home health and hospice care have      been demonstrated to be a cost-effective alternative to      institutional care in both the Medicare and Medicaid      programs. In fact, the Medicare Payment Advisory Commission      (MedPAC) has noted the results of a 2002 RAND study which      showed ``in terms of Part A costs, episodes in an inpatient      rehabilitation facility or skilled nursing facility are much      more costly for Medicare than episodes of care among patients      going home.'' (MedPAC's June 2005 Report to Congress).       Further reducing Medicare home health expenditures would      also be in direct conflict with the Administration's desire      to prioritize health care in the home as a cost-effective      alternative to institutional care. During the World Health      Congress in February of 2005, Secretary of Health and Human      Services Michael Leavitt said: ``Providing the care that lets      people live at home if they want is less expensive than      providing nursing home care. It frees up resources that can      help other people. And obviously, many people are happier      living at home.''       Reducing Medicare home health and hospice payments would      place the quality of home health care and hospice and the      home care delivery system at significant risk. Several      factors have contributed to the increased cost of providing      care in the home over the past few years, including:       The cost of travel by clinicians to patients' homes;       The use of technology, like telehealth monitors, which is      not covered by Medicare;       The need to pay significantly higher salaries for nurses,      therapists, and home health aides to attract these      individuals from the scarce supply of clinicians nationwide.       Many home health providers currently do not have a      sufficient number of clinical staff to accept patient      referrals from physicians and hospitals. As a consequence,      hospital discharge planners have reported that they are      finding it more difficult to refer patients for home health      care. Additional cuts to the home health benefit could leave      home health providers no alternative but to reduce the number      of visits and/or patient admissions, which would ultimately      affect access to care and clinical outcomes. In addition to      these costs, hospices are also experiencing rising costs for      pain management pharmaceuticals, and they are also finding      that patients with shorter lengths of stay are requiring more      intensive services.       In order to ensure that home health care and hospice remain      a viable option for Medicare patients, we urge you to support      full market basket updates for home health and hospice, as      provided under current law, and to oppose any cuts in payment      rates through administrative action. Thank you for your      consideration of this important matter.           Sincerely,         Susan M. Collins; Russ Feingold; Christopher S. Bond;            Jack Reed; Patrick J.
