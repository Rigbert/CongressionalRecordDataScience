He broke ranks with the Republicans and said: Enough is enough. I salute him for that.  This bill, which the Senator from Nevada appreciates, I am sure, as I and other Members do, is a life-and-death bill for a lot of people around the world. The Senator from Nevada earlier mentioned the AIDS victims in Africa where 25 million people are infected and there are 15 million AIDS orphans. There is money in this bill to help these children and to help these families try to cope with this health crisis. There is no doubt in my mind, the failure to send the money is going to lead to the loss of life.  When it comes to feeding programs for the Afghan refugees, there is $255 million. The failure of the United States to send the money President Bush has asked for to help these Afghan refugees will take lives. People will die because we do not move as fast as we should.  Does the Senator from Nevada have a suggestion from the Republican side that if we give them a certain number of judges, then they will be willing to give a certain amount of money to send to people who are starving to death around the world? Are they negotiating in those terms as to how many judges they will need before they can support their own President's foreign operations appropriations bill?
