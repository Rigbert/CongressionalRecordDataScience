Speaker, I thank the gentleman for yielding me time.  Mr. Speaker, I rise in strong opposition to this amendment to slice another part out of the precious heritage of our Constitution. This is in fact the fourth attempt by this Republican leadership in the 104th Congress to rip apart the Constitution of the United States, a document that has only been amended 17 times, excluding the Bill of Rights in our 207 year history as a nation.  Now they are trying to rid it of majority rule, enshrined in the Constitution since the beginning of this Republic. We are being asked to undermine the delicate checks and balances between the executive and legislative branches on the important issue of revenues. Other equally weighty issues, such as borrowing or coining money or even declaring war, itself could eventually become subject to the same supermajority threshold.  Reread article I, sections 5 and 7. It specifically defines how decisions are to be made between this legislative branch and the executive branch. It does provide for a two-thirds override in the event of a veto by the President, but majority rule is enshrined in this Chamber.  In 1779 the emerging republic that was to call itself the United States of America threw off the shackles of monarchy and gave voice to the people by vesting all their legislative powers in those they elected here, and they did it by majority rule, bound by the Constitution that has kept us free.  Frankly, this amendment is a cheap shot against a sacred document during a week that most Americans would like to forget: tax filing time. But this Member is one that is unwilling to unravel the Constitution and its environment of majority rule for the sake of a few well-timed press releases at tax time. For shame.
