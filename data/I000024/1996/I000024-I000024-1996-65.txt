President, a few years ago I became exposed to a problem that exists in the lives of thousands of Americans. It happened when one of my closet friends in Oklahoma, Buddy Martin; lost both of his legs.  He was one of the fortunate ones who had the resources to purchase artificial limbs, and is able to live today a much more normal life than one could imagine.  It is because of this exposure that I rise today to introduce a bill to provide relief to thousands of Americans. Everyday far too many Americans are unable to live full and productive lives like Buddy Martin because they cannot afford adequate prosthetic care. There are over 250,000 Americans who cannot afford adequate prosthetic care. While the government provides assistance through Medicare and other programs they can not meet all of the needs, and they don't have to. The private sectorstands ready to help, through nonprofit foundations, but they cannot because of our country's product liability laws. That is why I am introducing the Prosthetic Limb Access Act of 1996, I am joined by my colleagues Senators Faircloth, Grams, Abraham, and Helms.  In Oklahoma, a nonprofit foundation called Limbs for Life takes used artificial limbs, reconditions them, and provides them to needy people in third world countries, they do not give them to Americans. It is not because there is not the need, they do not provide them because of our country's laws regarding product liability. They would be unable to afford the necessary insurance to provide the limbs to needy Americans. One doctor in Oklahoma, Dr. John Sabolich, the Nation's foremost prosthesis expert, currently saws used devices in half before throwing them away, because of liability. He showed me a $50,000 prosthetic arm that was about to be destroyed; to make it reusable would only have required about 20 minutes of work. It is a disgrace that perfectly good artificial limbs have to be destroyed when there are thousands of Americans who could use them.  My bill would provide the necessary product liability relief, while still protecting the patients by providing relief for intentional wrongdoing. This would allow hundreds of Americans to care for themselves, work, and better enjoy a more full life.  There are over 3,000 new amputations each week, which amounts to 160,000 amputations each year, for a grand total of 3.8 million amputees in the United States. The number of new amputees has increased over the years because of the early detection of cancer, doctors are able to detect cancer earlier and it is better to sacrifice a limb to save a person. Therefore the demand for more limbs by needy people will only increase. I have been told that if this bill is enacted that at least 2,000 limbs per year could be made available for needy Americans. These are 2,000 people who otherwise would not have access to an artificial arm or leg. These are 2,000 people who are currently not living full and productive lives, who need assistance to care for themselves, sometimes to just accomplish tasks that we all take for granted such as eating, moving around, or even working.  I have met many of these people who would benefit from this legislation and have listened to their heartbreaking stories. And for everyone I've heard of there are hundreds more who go daily without a prosthetic device, depending on others.  There is Nestor, a man who is missing both arms. He states:       My prosthesis is broken and I am unable to eat or do any      activities of daily living such as personal care or cooking.      I live alone and have no friends to help, so I must do things      for myself.  There is Pearl, a 46-year-old woman with one leg missing, who lives in a nursing home. She said:       I slip and fall so often when my crutches slip away from      me--and it hurts a lot when my wrist or neck or other body      parts are throbbing with pain for weeks due to my falls--and      although I try to be careful and watchful, the crutches still      can slip away from me when encountering the mopped floors or      wet spots that are in a nursing home.  There is Dalia, she was fitted with her current prosthesis in 1983, but since then her body has changed and it no longer fits properly. She says:       When I changed prosthesis, my whole body changed, my      balance is off especially effecting my back. I have fallen      down, have worsening osteoporosis and am very frustrated      because I can't do the things I used to do.  Mr. President, I know these are sad stories, and I know we as Members run across sad stories every day. But here we can do something positive for them, which will solve their problems, at no cost to the taxpayers. We can provide them the same medical services we are now giving poor people in third world countries, and we can do this through the nonprofit sector. We have needy people and a willing organization ready to help. Mr. President, we should at least treat our own citizens as well as we treat those in other countries.  Mr. President, my legislation is supported not only by the Limbs for Life Foundation, but also: Goodwill Industries, National Amputee Fund, National Association for the Advancement of Orthotics and Prosthetics, American Academy of Physical Medicine and Rehabilitation, and the American Congress of Rehabilitation Medicine.  Mr. President, this is a simple bill which would create major relief for a number of needy people. It is not a broad product liability bill, so therefore it should not draw the opposition that other bills have received this Congress. It corrects a small problem that literally means the world for a large group of disabled Americans. I hope we can move this bill forward this year.                                 ______      By
