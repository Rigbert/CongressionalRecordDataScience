President, our Nation has a proud history as the leading advocate of human rights around the world. Throughout this history, we have committed ourselves to numerous international human rights treaties, including the Convention Against Torture and Other Cruel, Inhuman or Degrading Treatment or Punishment. The bill that I introduce today will reaffirm our obligations under this Convention and reassure the world that we are a nation committed to the rule of law. I want to thank my cosponsors, Senators Durbin, Kennedy, and Dodd, for working with me on this legislation, and for their leadership on these issues.  It has been nearly a year since the first horrific images from Abu Ghraib prison appeared in the media, shocking the world and shattering the image of the United States. As the Administration circled the wagons and claimed the abuses were committed by a ``few bad apples,'' new details about the widespread abuse of detainees continued to emerge. I have spoken many times about the need for a comprehensive, independent investigation into the abuse of detainees. I have no doubt that such an investigation would be painful, but it is also a necessary step to moving forward.  Prisoner abuse by U.S. personnel is deeply troubling, but it is only one aspect of a broader and serious problem. While we must ensure that prisoners are treated humanely by our own personnel, we must also prohibit the use of so-called ``extraordinary renditions'' to send people to other countries where they will be subject to torture. Article 3 of the Convention Against Torture states that ``no State Party shall expel, return or extradite a person to another State where there are substantial grounds for believing that he would be in danger of being subjected to torture.'' The bill I introduce today, the ``Convention Against Torture Implementation Act,'' will ensure that we honor this commitment.  We have addressed this issue before. Congress implemented Article 3 of the Convention Against Torture in the Foreign Affairs Reform and Restructuring Act of 1998, but this Administration has exploited loopholes in that law to transfer detainees to countries where they are subjected to torture. Attorney General Gonzales recently said that U.S. policy is not to send detainees ``to countries where we believe or we know that they're going to be tortured,'' but he acknowledged that we ``can't fully control'' what other nations do, and added that he does not know whether countries have always complied with their promises. In fact, they have not.  My proposed legislation does not broaden the obligations that we agreed to by ratifying the Convention Against Torture; it simply closes the loopholes in the 1998 law and ensures that we honor our commitment not to outsource torture to other countries.  The case of Maher Arar provides a chilling example of extraordinary rendition, and illustrates why this bill is necessary. Mr. Arar, a Canadian and Syrian citizen, was stopped by immigration officers at John F. Kennedy International Airport in September 2002 as he attempted to change planes on his way home to Canada from Tunisia. He claims that he was interrogated by an FBI agent and a New York City police officer, and that he was denied access to a lawyer. He further claims that he repeatedly told U.S. officials that he feared he would be tortured if deported to Syria. After being detained for nearly two weeks in a Federal detention center in New York, Mr. Arar was transferred by U.S. authorities to Syria and held at the Bush administration's request. Mr. Arar claims that he was physically tortured during the first two weeks of his detention in Syria, and that he was subjected to severe psychological abuse over the following 10 months, including being held in a grave-like cell and being forced to undergo interrogation while hearing the screams of other prisoners.  According to Administration officials, the CIA received diplomatic assurances from Syria that it would not torture Mr. Arar. But those assurances amounted to little more than a wink and a nod. Unnamed intelligence officials were later quoted in the press, saying that Arar confessed under torture in Syria that he had gone to Afghanistan for terrorist training. Syria has a well-documented history of state-sponsored torture. In fact, President Bush stated on November 7, 2003, that Syria has left ``a legacy of torture, oppression, misery, and ruin'' to its people.  Rather than rely on assurances that a country will not torture an individual, we must make our own unbiased determination. We already have the necessary information to do so. Each year, as required by law, the State Department publishes country reports on human rights practices. The most recent report on Syria states that its torture methods include ``administering electrical shocks; pulling out fingernails; forcing objects into the rectum; beating, sometimes while the victim was suspended from the ceiling; hyperextending the spine; bending the detainees into the frame of a wheel and whipping exposed body parts; and using a backward-bending chair to asphyxiate the victim or fracture the victim's spine.''  Some will argue that the post-9/11 world is different; that we must use any and all means available to extract information from suspected terrorists. Their argument might be more credible if every person who turned up on a terrorist watch list were, in fact, a terrorist. I cannot say whether Mr. Arar had ties to terrorist groups or not, but we do know that he was never charged with a crime. After enduring months of torture at the hands of the Syrians, he was released and sent back to Canada.  Nor was Mr. Arar's experience an isolated incident. A recent article in The New Yorker titled ``Outsourcing Torture'' provides disturbing details about how the administration embraced the use of rendition after the 9/11 attacks. Several press reports detail the CIA's use of its own Gulfstream V and Boeing 737 jets to secretly transfer detainees to countries around the world, where it is likely that they will be tortured.  The Convention Against Torture Implementation Act addresses the extraordinary rendition problem in a straightforward manner. It requires the State Department to produce annually a list of countries where torture is known to occur. The list would be based on information contained in the State Department's country reports on human rights practices. The bill prohibits the transfer of individuals to any country on this list or to any other country if there are substantial grounds for believing that the person would be tortured. It also provides reasonable exceptions to this prohibition to allow for legal extraditions and removals.  Most importantly, the bill closes the diplomatic assurances loophole. We would no longer accept assurances from governments that we know engage in torture. Our past reliance on diplomatic assurances is blatantly hypocritical. How can our State Department denounce countries for engaging in torture while the CIA secretly transfers detainees to the very same countries for interrogation? The President says he does not condone torture, but transferring detainees to other countries where they will be tortured does not absolve our government of responsibility. By outsourcing torture to these countries, we diminish our own values as a nation and lose our credibility as an advocate of human rights around the world.  Last June, in the aftermath of the Abu Ghraib scandal, the President was asked if he had authorized abusive interrogation techniques. He replied,``The authorization I issued was that anything we did would conform to U.S. law and would be consistent with international treaty obligations.'' The legislation I introduce today will help us fulfill the President's promise.  The Senate gave its advice and consent to the ratification of the Convention Against Torture more than a decade ago. It is time to honor our commitment and show the world that we will hold ourselves to the same standards that we demand of others.  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill and a section-by-section analysis be printed in the Record.  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in the Record, as follows:                                 S. 654       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of      the United States of America in Congress assembled,     SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.       This Act may be cited as the ``Convention Against Torture      Implementation Act of 2005''.     SEC. 2. PROHIBITION ON CERTAIN TRANSFERS OF PERSONS.       (a) Prohibition.--No person in the custody or control of a      department, agency, or official of the United States      Government, or of any contractor of any such department or      agency, shall be expelled, returned, or extradited to another      country, whether directly or indirectly, if--       (1) the country is included on the most recent list      submitted to Congress by the Secretary of State under section      3; or       (2) there are otherwise substantial grounds for believing      that the person would be in danger of being subjected to      torture.       (b) Exceptions.--       (1) Waivers.--       (A) Authority.--The Secretary of State may waive the      prohibition in subsection (a)(1) with respect to a country if      the Secretary certifies to the appropriate congressional      committees that--       (i) the acts of torture that were the basis for including      that country on the list have ended; and       (ii) there is in place a mechanism that assures the      Secretary in a verifiable manner that a person expelled,      returned, or extradited to that country will not be tortured      in that country, including, at a minimum, immediate,      unfettered, and continuing access, from the point of return,      to such person by an independent humanitarian organization.       (B) Reports on waivers.--       (i) Reports required.--For each person expelled, returned,      or extradited under a waiver provided under subparagraph (A),      the head of the appropriate government agency making such      transfer shall submit to the appropriate congressional      committees a report that includes the name and nationality of      the person transferred, the date of transfer, the reason for      such transfer, and the name of the receiving country.       (ii) Form.--Each report under this subparagraph shall be      submitted, to the extent practicable, in unclassified form,      but may include a classified annex as necessary to protect      the national security of the United States.       (2) Extradition or removal.--The prohibition in subsection      (a)(1) may not be construed to apply to the legal extradition      of a person under a bilateral or multilateral extradition      treaty or to the legal removal of a person under the      immigration laws of the United States if, before such      extradition or removal, the person has recourse to a United      States court of competent jurisdiction to challenge such      extradition or removal on the basis that there are      substantial grounds for believing that the person would be in      danger of being subjected to torture in the receiving      country.       (c) Assurances Insufficient.--Written or verbal assurances      made to the United States by the government of a country that      persons in its custody or control will not be tortured are      not sufficient for believing that a person is not in danger      of being subjected to torture for purposes of subsections      (a)(2) and (b)(2), or for meeting the requirement of      subsection (b)(1)(A)(ii).     SEC. 3. REPORTS ON COUNTRIES USING TORTURE.       Not later than 30 days after the effective date of this      Act, and annually thereafter, the Secretary of State shall      submit to the appropriate congressional committees a report      listing each country where torture is known to be used. The      list shall be compiled on the basis of the information      contained in the most recent annual report of the Secretary      of State submitted to the Speaker of the House of      Representatives and the Committee on Foreign Relations of the      Senate under section 116(d) of the Foreign Assistance Act of      1961 (22 U.S.C. 2151n(d)).     SEC. 4. REGULATIONS.       (a) Interim Regulations.--Not later than 60 days after the      effective date of this Act, the heads of the appropriate      government agencies shall prescribe interim regulations for      the purpose of carrying out this Act and implementing the      obligations of the United States under Article 3 of the      Convention Against Torture, subject to any reservations,      understandings, declarations, and provisos contained in the      Senate resolution advising and consenting to the ratification      of the Convention Against Torture, and consistent with the      provisions of this Act.       (b) Final Regulations.--Not later than 180 days after      interim regulations are prescribed under subsection (a), and      following a period of notice and opportunity for public      comment, the heads of the appropriate government agencies      shall prescribe final regulations for the purposes described      in subsection (a).     SEC. 5. SAVINGS CLAUSE.       Nothing in this Act shall be construed to eliminate, limit,      or constrain in any way the obligations of the United States      or the rights of any individual under the Convention Against      Torture or any other applicable law.     SEC. 6. REPEAL OF SUPERSEDED AUTHORITY.       Section 2242 of the Foreign Affairs Reform and      Restructuring Act of 1998 (Public Law 105-277; 8 U.S.C. 1231      note) is repealed. Regulations promulgated under such section      that are in effect on the date this Act becomes effective      shall remain in effect until the heads of the appropriate      government agencies issue interim regulations under section      4(a).     SEC. 7. DEFINITIONS.       (a) Defined Terms.--In this Act:       (1) Appropriate government agencies.--The term      ``appropriate government agencies'' means--       (A) the intelligence community (as defined in section 3(4)      of the National Security Act of 1947 (50 U.S.C. 401a(4)));      and       (B) elements of the Department of State, the Department of      Defense, the Department of Homeland Security, the Department      of Justice, the United States Secret Service, the United      States Marshals Service, and any other Federal law      enforcement, national security, intelligence, or homeland      security agency that takes or assumes custody or control of      persons or transports persons in its custody or control      outside the United States, other than those elements listed      or designated as elements of the intelligence community under      section 3(4) of the National Security Act of 1947 (50 U.S.C.      401a(4))).

SEC. 8. EFFECTIVE DATE.       This Act shall take effect on the date that is 30 days      after the date of the enactment of this Act.     SEC. 9. CLASSIFICATION IN UNITED STATES CODE.       This Act shall be classified to the United States Code as a      new chapter of title 50, United States Code.   Convention Against Torture Implementation Act of 2005 Section-by-                            Section Analysis       Sec. 1. Short Title. The Convention Against Torture      Implementation Act of 2005.       Sec. 2. Prohibition on Certain Transfers of Persons. This      section implements Article 3 of the Convention Against      Torture, which prohibits expelling, returning, or extraditing      persons to countries where they are in danger of being      subjected to torture. Subsection (a) prohibits the transfer      of a person in the custody or control of the United States      government to a country included on a list generated by the      State Department, as required by Section 3 of this Act, or to      countries where there are substantial grounds for believing      that the person would be in danger of being subjected to      torture. Subsection (b) allows exceptions to the prohibition      if the Secretary of State waives the prohibition or if the      transfer is done under an extradition treaty or as a legal      removal under United States immigration laws. Agencies that     transfer a detainee under the waiver exception must submit a      report of the transfer to appropriate congressional      committees. Subsection (c) states that assurances made to the      United States by another government that persons in its      custody will not be tortured are not sufficient for the      United States to conclude that a person will not be subjected      to torture.       Sec. 3. Reports on Countries Using Torture. This section      requires the Secretary of State, on an annual basis, to      compile a list of countries where torture is known to be      used. The United States is prohibited from transferring      persons to the countries on this list, except in accordance      with the exceptions contained in section 2. The list shall be      compiled based on information contained in the most recent      State Department country reports on human rights practices,      which the Department submits annually in accordance with      section 116(d) of the Foreign Assistance Act of 1961 (22      U.S.C. 2151n(d)).       Sec. 4. Regulations. This section requires appropriate      government agencies (as defined in section 7) to prescribe      regulations in accordance with this Act. Interim regulations      must be prescribed within 60 days of the effective date of      the Act. Final regulations must be prescribed, through notice      and comment rulemaking, not more than 180 days thereafter.       Sec. 5. Savings Clause. This section ensures that the Act      does not eliminate, limit, or constrain the obligations of      the United States or the rights of any individual under the      Convention Against Torture or any other applicable law.       Sec. 6. Repeal of Superseded Authority. This section      repeals section 2242 of the Foreign Affairs Reform and      Restructuring Act of 1998 (Public Law 105-277; 8 U.S.C. 1231      note). This law also implemented Article 3 of the Convention      Against Torture, but lacked specific guidance for agencies      and allowed the United States to rely on diplomatic      assurances that a government would not torture a person      transferred to its custody. This section also requires agency      regulations promulgated under section 2242 to remain in      effect until the appropriate government agencies issue new      regulations in accordance with section 4 of this Act.       Sec. 7. Definitions. This section defines ``Appropriate      Government Agencies,'' ``Appropriate Congressional      Committees,'' ``Expelled Person,'' ``Extradited Person,''      ``Returned Person,'' and ``Convention Against Torture.'' It      also states that terms used in the Act, unless otherwise      provided, have the meanings given to those terms in the      Convention Against Torture.       Sec. 8. Effective Date. Makes the Act effective 30 days      after its enactment.       Sec. 9. Classification in United States Code. This section      requires the Act to be classified as a new chapter of title      50 in the United States Code. The superseded authority was      classified as a note in title 8 in the United States Code.      Given the scope and applicability of the Act, it is more      accurate to classify it in the War and National Defense title      than in the Aliens and Nationality title.
