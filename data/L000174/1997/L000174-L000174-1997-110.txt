President, last week, President Clinton announced that the United States would not join nearly 100 nations, including most of our NATO allies, in a treaty to ban antipersonnel landmines.  I want to take a few minutes to respond to the President's decision. First, let me say that President Clinton and I have spoken many times about the landmine issue. I am convinced he wants to see these weapons banned from the face of the Earth. He and I have discussed the horrendous toll of innocent lives that landmines cause, and in speeches at the United Nations he has twice called for a worldwide ban.  President Clinton said, ``The United States will lead a global effort to eliminate these terrible weapons and stop the enormous loss of human life.'' Those were inspiring words. However, as convinced as I am of the President's desire for a ban, I am as convinced that a tremendous opportunity was lost last week. An opportunity that rarely comes in history.  As a USA Today editorial put it, ``having blown the best chance ever to negotiate an acceptable international ban on landmines, the Clinton administration now finds itself churning in the wake of world affairs. The United States has joined a few nations, including rogue states like Iran and Iraq, on the outside of a remarkable process.''  There are many losers in the administration's last-minute failed attempt to negotiate in Oslo. Unfortunately, the most notable losers were the innocent victims of landmines who the treaty aims to protect. Mr. President, the victims of landmines are almost invariably children and innocent civilians.  Because while the treaty is immensely important for establishing a new norm of conduct, until the United States signs it, there will never be a worldwide ban. There is simply no substitute for the credibility and influence of the United States to bring reluctant nations on board and make sure that violators of the treaty are caught and punished. There is no way to fully stigmatize these weapons and curtail the use, as has been done with poison gas, without U.S. leadership far stronger than we have seen today.  And the tragedy of our country's decision is that it was avoidable. Although the President said his administration had gone the extra mile to find an acceptable compromise in Oslo, I must respectfully and honestly disagree.  Two weeks ago I went to Oslo where I met with representatives of governments, including the United States, and nongovernmental organizations that were participating in the treaty negotiations.  The treaty they adopted was nothing short of a miracle. In less than a year, nations as diverse as our closest European allies who have been major producers of landmines, to Mozambique whose people have been killed and maimed by landmines, joined together in finalizing a treaty that does nothing less than ban the use, production, stockpiling, and transfer of a category of weapons that Civil War General William Tecumseh Sherman called ``a violation of civilized warfare'' over a century ago.  I call the Ottawa Treaty a miracle because it was only 11 months ago that Canadian Foreign Minister Lloyd Axworthy launched what is now called the ``Ottawa process.'' At the time, no one knew how many nations would take part or where it would lead, not even Minister Axworthy. It was a bold and courageous leap of faith, and thesame kind of leadership I and so many others hoped to see from the White House last week.  The Ottawa Treaty culminates two decades of failed attempts to deal effectively with the landmine problem. Two decades ago many of the same nations that gathered in Oslo met in Geneva to draft a treaty to address the growing concerns of the effects of landmines on civilian populations. Landmines had been widely used in Southeast Asia, and they were being sown like seed in Afghanistan and Central America and many African countries. Vast areas were being laid to waste with the innocents paying the horrifying price. I have seen victims, all over the world, of these indiscriminate weapons.  My wife is a registered nurse and has visited the hospitals where the amputations take place, where broken bodies are put back together as best can be done in countries where medical care is often rudimentary.  That treaty, however--the Conventional Weapons Convention--utterly failed to achieve its goal. It was doomed to fail because of the fact that landmines are inherently incapable of distinguishing between civilians and combatants, and that fact was never even acknowledged in Geneva, much less addressed. Instead, in diplomatic niceties, by people who would never have to face landmines themselves, they adopted vague limits of how mines could be used. Those limits were then routinely ignored. In the years since then, the devastation inflicted by landmines on innocent people, often the poorest people in the world, has increased dramatically. In fact, Mr. President, it was the widespread recognition of the failure of that treaty which led to the Conventional Weapons Review Conference 2 years ago. Finally, it seemed there could no longer be any excuse for doing whatever was necessary to stop the carnage wrought by landmines.  That was the hope. Unfortunately, the reality was a lot different. Rather than devise a roadmap for ridding the world of these weapons, governments, including our own, fought for the right to use them. The idea of a ban was barely mentioned. The amended protocol, while preferable to the original, did far more to reaffirm the legitimacy of landmines than to stop their use. Once again, governments had failed to act with anything like the decisiveness that was called for.  So it is important to remember that the Ottawa process evolved only after years of failed attempts by governments to solve this problem in the traditional way. There was no shortage of impassioned speeches about the harm landmines were causing the innocent. But the expressions of outrage were qualified with the assertion that the problem wasn't the mines themselves, but other people, always other people, who used them irresponsibly. You would think it was a tea party rather than arms control. And the carnage, of course, continued.  But we hear those same arguments today. The same failed arguments of a decade ago. Today when a Pentagon official was asked about the tens of thousands of American landmine casualties in Vietnam, he said that was no longer relevant because ``smart'' mines had ``solved their problem.''  Of course, they have not solved it. Almost no one besides the United States uses those mines. In Bosnia, more than 250 U.N. and NATO soldiers and thousands of civilians have been injured or killed today by the same types of mines used in Vietnam a generation ago.  As I have said so many times, an effective international agreement based on stigmatizing a weapon cannot have different standards for different nations. The importance of this principle cannot be overstated. It is what underlies any international agreement.  When the Princess of Wales spoke about the insidious toll of landmines, she said, ``Before I went to Angola, I knew the facts, but the reality was a shock.'' Unfortunately, the reality that Princess Diana saw was a reality which far too few government officials have experienced, including many people at the Pentagon. When people have gone with me and seen the carnage caused by landmines, they have a new understanding.  A year ago, after the President urged all nations to complete a ban treaty ``as soon as possible,'' it became clear that the administration was not willing to show the kind of leadership that was necessary to turn those words into reality.  Instead, other countries, led by Canada and hundreds of nongovernmental organizations, stepped into the void. In a matter of months we saw the number of nations participating in the Ottawa process exceed 100, including many nations that were producers and exporters and users of antipersonnel mines.  Those nations came together determined to overcome past failures because they knew about those failures. Many had suffered the effects of landmines because of those failures. They came together to do the only thing that could solve the landmine problem--ban the types of landmines that are triggered by an innocent footstep, ban them without exception, ban them without reservation. And they wanted the United States to be part of it. When I was in Oslo I found a genuine desire to try to accommodate the United States, if it could be done without weakening the treaty.  But the administration seriously underestimated the worldwide commitment for a ban. For months, the White House belittled the Ottawa process. Since it wasn't their idea, they refused to take it seriously. And rather than throw the weight of the United States behind Canada to help achieve something unprecedented in history, something that would have taken both courage and imagination, the administration tried to talk other governments out of taking part.  They wasted valuable time by pursuing negotiations in the U.N. Conference on Disarmament even when it was clear that avenue was blocked. They said the United States would only give up its mines if all nations did, knowing that, like the chemical weapons treaty, there is no chance of that happening for decades. And when they finally decided at the 11th hour to go to Oslo, they went with demands that had no chance of being accepted, and little flexibility to negotiate.  Any of the nations in Oslo that have pledged to sign the Ottawa treaty could make a stronger case to continue using these weapons than the world's only superpower. Basically, the United States went to Oslo and said: we are the most powerful Nation on earth, but we can't give up our anti-personnel mines because we have better technology, but you less powerful nations, you should give up your mines.  Well, Mr. President, the Pentagon is, understandably, deeply reluctant to give up a weapon that has some utility--and it does--even if doing so would pressure others to end the suffering of innocent people. Like any government department, the Pentagon's job is to protect its options. It has always resisted giving up weapons, from countermanding General Pershing in the 1920's at the first Geneva convention when he wanted to ban poison gas, to nuclear testing in the 1990's. If a Pentagon official is asked what he or she needs, the answer is always ``more.'' More firepower might mean fewer casualties, so the Pentagon has resisted the pressure to give up antipersonnel landmines.  The President is constantly faced with departments that do not want to cut their budget or eliminate programs. That is why he has the National Security bureaucracy, to make those hard decisions. In the case of weapons of mass destruction like nuclear and chemicals weapons, his advisers have found ways to work closely with the Pentagon to find creative solutions.  But when issue of landmines reached the surface a year and a half ago, nobody in the administration was willing to aggressively challenge and prod the Pentagon into finding a workable solution. Without that prodding, the Joint Chiefs put far more effort into blocking the U.S. from joining the ban than into planning how to live with it--even though there were those in the Pentagon who at least were honest enough to privately point out the fallacies in the assumptions underlying the Pentagon's own arguments.  As recently as a few weeks ago--and the Pentagon did not serve the White House well in this--White House officials were not even aware of the weaknesses in the Pentagon's doomsday predictions about the consequences of removing antipersonnel mines from Korea, or even aware of the fact that the Pentagon was, at least internally, divided over some of the same arguments they had made at the White House.  They did not even have a thorough grasp of the treaty's provisions. Right up until the end, there were those in the administration who were unaware that the treaty effectively grants a twelve-year grace period for removing existing minefields, such as in Korea. Last week, the Secretary of Defense wrote in the Washington Post that ``millions'' of lives could be lost if the U.S. signed the treaty because North Korea might interpret our signing as a loss of resolve and start a war because of it. Good Lord, Mr. President. This is as bad as ``the Russians are coming, the Russians are coming'' scenario we heard, even as the Russian army was collapsing internally. Not only is that about that as far-fetched as any dire Pentagon prediction I have heard yet--and that includes its assessment of the Red Army that was fit to conquer the world--it could not even conquer Chechnya--it ignores the conclusion of every serious Pentagon analyst that a North Korean invasion would be destroyed, with or without antipersonnel landmines, before it could traverse 50 miles down narrow, pre-targeted mountain passes to Seoul. If antipersonnel landmines are going to determine the fate of South Korea, South Korea ought to surrender. But the fact is, South Korea has a far better trained, better equipped army, is better motivated than North Korea, and is backed by the might of the most powerful Nation on earth. A North Korean invasion would be suicidal, and they know it and everyone knows it. A former commander of our forces in Korea says scattering landmines there would impede the mobility of our own forces, and inflict casualties on our own troops.  But it does not even matter, because the other countries in Oslo were prepared to try to accommodate U.S. concerns on Korea. Had the White House not waited until the last minute to get involved, a solution could have been found. In fact, many of us told them that months ago.  Over 60 Members of the U.S. Senate, Republicans and Democrats, including every veteran of combat in the Vietnam war, have signed onto legislation to ban antipersonnel landmines. In fact, Mr. President, the Leahy-Hagel bill would do no more than what Great Britain, Germany, South Africa, France, and a lot of other nations have already pledged to do, over the objections of some of their own armed forces. In fact, it does not go as far because it gives the President broad flexibility on Korea, which the Pentagon has called a unique situation--``the Cold War's last frontier.'' The Pentagon said they need time to take care of Korea. Our legislation gives them more time than they need.  I was encouraged by the President's statement last week that he wants to work with Congress. I welcome that, and I thank him for the kind words he spoke about my efforts. I really do believe that he wants to see a worldwide ban on landmines. I have always supported efforts to negotiate an international export ban in the U.N. Conference on Disarmament.  But, Mr. President, the clock is ticking, and there should be no mistake. The Ottawa treaty is the only hope for achieving a comprehensive worldwide ban on these weapons. There is no other treaty. If the United States does not sign in December, we have to find a way to sign at the earliest possible time.  That is not going to happen as long as the Pentagon pretends that a weapon it called an antipersonnel landmine a few months ago, and which the President pledged to ban a year ago, has suddenly, miraculously, overnight become no longer an antipersonnel mine if it's placed near an antitank mine. They tried that in Oslo; they tried to change the definition. It would have invited any nation in the world to use antipersonnel mines--dumb, smart, just average, or any type--indefinitely, as long as they were in the vicinity of an antitank mine. It was a terrible idea and literally a loophole big enough to fly a 747 through.  If the use of antipersonnel mines near antitank mines is what prevents the United States from signing the treaty, then solve it. We run a little Rover around on Mars. If we can do that, we can solve this problem. If the Pentagon had spent the past three years since the President first called for a worldwide ban really trying to solve that problem rather than to keep from having to solve it, the United States might have been able to show the leadership on this issue that the world needs and, frankly, the world wants.  This is not a public relations problem to be managed. This is not about trying to find some way to convince a focus group. It is not a question of valuing the lives of American soldiers more or less than the lives and limbs of innocent civilians. Both soldiers and civilians will benefit from a landmine ban. It is about the one nation on this planet, whose power and influence and moral authority are unmatched, the nation that I am proud to serve in the U.S. Senate. It is about this nation seizing the best opportunity there is ever going to be to deal with a problem that is needlessly plaguing so many countries.  Staying outside this treaty is not an option. We have to be part of it, if not now, then we need to do what needs to be done to become part of it.  I might note, Mr. President, that Japan, which like the U.S. also expressed concerns about the treaty in Oslo, is apparently reconsidering its position and may sign in Ottawa after all. I wrote to their foreign minister saying I hope they do this. It would be extremely significant, as many Asian nations look to Japan for leadership.  President Clinton also spoke of efforts the United States is making to help other nations get rid of landmines, and to aid the victims. I join him in that. But I remind the President and the Pentagon that each of these efforts was started by the Congress. They are vitally important, and I welcome the President's announcement that he wants to expand them. But even expanding something like the Leahy War Victims Fund is no substitute for putting an end to the use of these weapons.  I want the United States to show the kind of leadership that is expected of the world's leading democracy, the greatest democracy history has ever known. The United States was a founder of the League of Nations and the United Nations. We have been a leading force in every significant humanitarian law treaty and arms control treaty in history. Leadership by definition means taking risks. It means having the faith and courage to seize an opportunity that comes rarely in history and rejecting the conventional wisdom, and taking a dramatic step.  The chemical weapons treaty would not exist had it not been for the United States taking such a step. The nuclear test ban treaty would not exist without our leadership.  The United States showed its capacity for greatness with the Marshall Plan. We didn't say we would rebuild Europe ``except for this country or that country.'' We said all should benefit, including our former enemies. I am proud of what my country did then, and I want to see the same kind of leadership now.  The Ottawa treaty will be signed in December. There is still time for the White House to reconsider. Fourteen Nobel laureates sent a letter to President Clinton last week urging him to reconsider. There is still time to aggressively engage the Pentagon on the technical issues that have prevented the President from agreeing to sign. If we do not have a plan for solving them by December, then get busy and solve them. At least commit to signing it at a future date. That is what the world needs to hear. It is the least we can do.  Mr. President, the Ottawa treaty will set a moral standard for the next century that even those nations who do not sign will ignore at the risk of being condemned as international outlaws. It will be a tribute to those nations who recognize the urgency that this humanitarian crisis demands. The treaty ends the 20th century, the bloodiest in history, in a way in which the world can be justly proud. It is our gift to the next century. The United States should be part of it.  I said in Oslo that my wife and I look forward, with great pleasure, to the birth of our first grandchild at the beginning of next year and, God willing, that child will live most of his or her life in the next century. My prayer is that it will be a century where armies of humanity dig up and destroy landmines and no one puts new ones down.  I ask unanimous consent that the Nobel laureates' letter to the President be printed in the Record.  There being no objection, the letter was ordered to be printed in the Record, as follows:                                               September 18, 1997.       Dear President Clinton: We are writing to demonstrate our      support of the many other individuals and organizations      urging the United States government to sign a treaty for a      comprehensive ban on anti-personnel landmines along with 100      other nations scheduled to meet in Ottawa this December.       Mr. President, we ask you to reflect on repercussions of      your final decision on this matter. We are aware that you      plan to condition your approval of the ban on the inclusion      of certain exceptions considered vital to U.S. security      interests and in the best interest of military personnel.      Consider for a moment the dangerous precedent that would be      set if the United States asks for concessions. Indecision by      a world superpower is sure to undermine the long effort to      reach this ban, only leading to further delays.       It is clear that every additional week of delay will leave      hundreds of innocent men, women, and children dead or maimed      due to these devices whose military value is highly      questionable. The recently publicized 1972 US Army report      vividly describes the terrible toll US anti-personnel      landmines have taken on its own soldiers during the Korean      and Vietnam conflicts.       We, Nobel Peace Laureates, are joining the Albert      Schweitzer Institute for the Humanities, named after the      renowned humanist and Nobel Peace laureate Dr. Albert      Schweitzer, and the Connecticut Coalition to Abolish      Landmines in the international call to ban landmines. We add      our collective voice to that of many other individuals,      organizations and governments who strongly support this ban.       As the leader of a major world power, it is in your hands      to demonstrate courageous leadership and endorse the      comprehensive ban on landmines.         Donald S.
