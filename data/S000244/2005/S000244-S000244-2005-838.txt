Chairman, I yield myself such time as I may consume.  Mr. Chairman, I support this amendment, and just let me give a little bit of the history of this.  The gentleman from New York (Mr. Sweeney) is correct that the first responder grants were a part of the original PATRIOT Act. We did not know how to divide up the first responder grants properly, so we put a formula in. Well, it ended up that the formula had some anomalies, and it ended up being out of date.  As a result, in the last Congress the Committee on the Judiciary and the Select Committee on Homeland Security worked out an agreement where the formula would be modified, where there would be certain floors for States, a lot of the money would be threat-based and the types of grants were consolidated so that there would be a simpler application process. That bill was passed 409 to 10. There were just a few Members that voted against it. Then it went over to the other body and nothing happened to it.  We have attempted to redo the first responder grants again in this Congress, and there is no hope that the other body will take the stand-alone bill and enact it into law.  By adopting this amendment, we are going to be in a stronger position to actually make the needed changes in the formula law of the United States of America this year without further delay. That is why this amendment should be supported. I would hope that it would have an overwhelming vote.  Mr. Chairman, I yield back the balance of my time.
