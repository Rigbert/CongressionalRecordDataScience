But if you go with a worker that works in this plant to where they live, it is an abomination. The people who work in these plants do not earn sufficient wages to buy anything they make. Their streets are not good enough to drive cars, anyway. They are bused into these locations, largely women workers. Seventy to 75 percent of the people working in this plant are women workers who earn maybe $1, $1.20 an hour compared to what the workers in Buffalo used to make.  None of that production is used by the people of Mexico. It is sent back here on vehicles that are assembled down there. One of the largest components of the trade deficit are assembled vehicles now, cars and trucks that are coming back to the United States.  The last chart, and this is sort of the frosting on the cake, but it makes me so angry I sometimes cannot contain myself, this is the street sign next to that plant. It is called Calle Ohio, Calle Michigan. They have actually renamed the street. You feel like you are living in a surreal world of Hollywood, where they just move the street signs around. It is the intersection of Ohio and Michigan Avenues. The problem is it is a maquiladora in Mexico, and the workers there have none of the rights of the workers in Ohio and in Michigan to earn a decent living, to earn decent benefits.
