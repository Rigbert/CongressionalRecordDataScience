 In fact, the Senate confirmed a total of 10 circuit court nominees and 53 district court nominees during 1980, President Carter's last year in office. And 1980 was not an aberration. As Senator Leahy noted in 2000, the pattern continued in subsequent election years. Also in 2000, the year Senator Leahy called the Thurmond rule a ``myth'' when he was complaining about the pace of judicial confirmations, the Senate confirmed 8 circuit court nominees and 31 district court nominees.
