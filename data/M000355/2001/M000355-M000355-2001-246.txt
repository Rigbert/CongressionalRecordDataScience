 LOTT. I will be glad to yield.  Mr. McCONNELL. Mr. President, this is the first time, as the leader pointed out, during the long 8 days of this debate that the will of the Senate has not prevailed on an amendment. What is happening, of course, is those who were not successful on the Thompson amendment do not want to allow the Senate to adopt the amendment.  The negotiation that the majority leader is discussing presumably will occur now over the next couple of hours, but it is important to note that 54 Members of the Senate were prepared to adopt the Thompson amendment and that apparently is going to be prevented for the first time during the course of this debate.  I thank the leader.
