 President, I have just received a letter from the Commandant of the Marine Corps, Gen. C.C. Kruluk.  General Kruluk's letter concerns the Marine Corps' request for 12 additional general officers.  His letter responds to a letter which I sent to the House conferees on the fiscal year 1997 Defense authorization bill.  My letter urged the House conferees to hang tough and block the Senate proposal to give the Marine Corps 12 more generals.  The Senate approved the Marine Corps's request. But the House remains opposed to it.  So the request for 12 additional generals is a bone of contention in the conference.  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that my letter to the conferees and the Commandant's response to it be printed in the Record.  There being no objection, the letters were ordered to be printed in the Record, as follows:                                                    July 29, 1996.     Hon. Charles E. Grassley:     U.S. Senate, Washington, DC.       Dear Senator Grassley: I have been provided a copy of the      letter you sent to House Conferees concerning the proposal in      the Senate Authorization Bill that would give the Marine      Corps twelve additional general officers. While this responds      to the issues raised in your letter, it has been my desire to      meet with you in person to discuss this issue. I understand      our staffs have finally worked out a time to do so, and I      look forward to meeting with you on Wednesday.       Those familiar with the Corps know that we pride ourselves      in squeezing the most out of every dollar that you entrust to      your Marine Corps. The also know that we don't ask for      something unless it is truly needed.       The main thrust of your letter is that the number of      general officers should be reduced consistent with force      structure reductions. Reduction in end strength does not      necessarily have a one-to-one correlation with command billet      reduction. Permit me to explain. As you have correctly      stated, the Marine Corps in 1988 had a total active duty end      strength of approximately 198,000, with a general officer      population of 70. Today, we have an end strength of 174,000,      and a general officer population of 68. That said, please      note that the 82nd Congress mandated in Title X that our      Corps of Marines be ``so organized as to include not less      than three combat divisions and three air wings,''--as it was      in 1987, it is so organized today. This point is key: While      the Marine Corps has reduced its end strength by 24,000      personnel, its three division, three wing structure has      remained essentially unchanged. Those familiar with the      military know that the requirement for general/flag officers      is tied directly to the number of combat divisions and air      wings--and that number has not been reduced. Of the 70 Marine      general officers in 1987, 11 were assigned to joint/external      billets. Today, 16 of the 68 Marine general officers are      serving in joint/external billets. Today we have 52 general      officers manning essentially the same structure that was      manned by 59 general officers in 1988.       Throughout our history, we Marines have prided ourselves in      doing more with less. In the past, we have compensated for      our general officer shortfall by ``frocking'' officers      selected for the next higher grade to fill that position      without the pay. While that practice has its own drawbacks,      it did provide us with the requisite number of general      officers to fill critical shortfalls. Last year, the Senate      set increasingly strict limits on the number of general      officers that the Services may frock. And I understand their      rationale--the practice of frocking simply makes deficiencies      in Service grade/billet structure. These shortages are indeed      better addressed with permanent fixes rather than the stop-     gap measures such as frocking. This restriction on frocking,      however, has placed the Marine Corps in an untenable      position. Losing six of our nine frocking authorizations      means that we would now have 46 general officers manning      essentially the same structure that was manned by 60 general      officers in 1987. This makes it critical that we have      additional general officer allotments.       In response to your remark that we are ``simply trying to      keep up with the Joneses'' let me offer this: Other Service      ratios of general officer to end strength range from one      general/flag officer for 1,945 troops to one general/flag      officer to 1,435 troops. Excluding the Marine Corps, the      Service-wide nominal ratio of one general per 1,620 troops      would give the Marine Corps a minimum of 104 general      officers. The twelve additional officers that the SASC has      provided would give us a total of only 80--hardly keeping up      with the Joneses!       Finally, this is a matter of providing quality, experienced      leadership for our Marines. We are the nation's force in      readiness, standing by to go into harm's way to protect U.S.      interests globally. Providing these brave Americans with an      adequate number of commanders and representation in the joint      arena is not just prudent--it is the right thing to do.       Senator Grassley, I am convinced that these additional      general officer billets serve the best interest of our      Services and our national defense. I am also convinced that      the solution is not to bring the other Services down to our      untenable position, but rather to grant us the minimal      increase we need to properly perform those functions Congress      has mandated and our nation expects. Our meeting on Wednesday      afternoon should be productive--I am looking forward to an      honest and open dialogue. Semper Fidelis!           Very respectfully,                                                      C.C. Krulak,     Commandant of the Marine Corps.                                                                    ____                                                  U.S. Senate,                                    Washington, DC, July 24, 1996.       Dear House Conferee: I am writing to encourage you to hang      tough and do everything possible to block the Senate proposal      that would give the Marine Corps 12 additional general      officers.       The Senate argues that these additional Marine generals are      needed to two reasons: (1) to fill vacant warfighting      positions; and (2) to meet the requirements of the joint      warfighting area mandated by the Goldwater-Nichols Act.       These arguments are nothing but a smoke screen for getting      more generals to fill fat headquarters jobs.       In 1990, your Committee took a very straightforward, common      sense approach to the question of how many general officers      were really needed. Your Committee could see the handwriting      on the wall. The military was beginning to downsize in      earnest. As the force structure shrinks, your Committee said      the number of general and flag officers should be reduced.      New general officer active duty strength ceilings were      established. The total number authorized had been set at      1,073 since October 1, 1980. The FY 1991 legislation reduced      that number to 1,030 in 1991, including 68 for the Marine      Corps. However, based on the projected 25% reduction in the      force structure between 1991 and     1995, which in fact occurred, the number of general officers      authorized to be on active duty was lowered to 858 by October      1, 1995, including 61 for the Marine Corps.       This is how your Committee explained the decision to cut      the number of generals in 1990 (Report 101-665, page 268):       ``The Committee believes that the general and flag officer      authorized strengths should be reduced to a level consistent      with the active force structure reductions expected by fiscal      year 1995.''       The Senate Armed Services Committee report contained      identical language (Report 101-384, page 159). But the Senate      committee linked the need for fewer generals directly to a      projected 25% reduction in the force structure. In addition,      it provided a more detailed justification for the lower      ceilings as follows:       ``The committee believes that these ceilings should assist      the military services in making critical decisions regarding      the reduction, consolidation, and elimination of duplicative      headquarters. The ceilings should also assist the military      services in eliminating unnecessary layering in the staff      patterns of general and flag officer positions.''       In reviewing your Committee's justification for lowering      the general officer ceilings, there is no mention of the need      to fill vacant warfighting positions--even though the Gulf      War was looming on the horizon. And there was no mention of      the need to fill joint billets mandated by Goldwater-Nichols.       Your Committee gave only one reason--the right reason--for      reducing the number of general officers in 1990: The number      of general officers should be reduced consistent with      projected force structure reductions.       So what has changed since that legislation was adopted six      years ago? Why has the Marine Corps fabricated a new      rationale for more generals? Nothing has changed. DOD is      continuing to downsize, and according to recent testimony by      Secretary Perry, that process is expected to continue into      the future (refer to page 254 of his Annual Report to      Congress). Your guiding principle still applies: As the force      structure shrinks, we need fewer general officers. It was      valid then. It's still valid today.       So why is the Marine Corps trying to topsize when its      downsizing? There is no reasonable explanation for giving the      Marine Corps 12 extra generals. The extra 12 generals      requested this year comes on top of an extra 7 Marine      generals authorized just two years ago in special relief      legislation.       In my mind, the issue boils down to one indefensible point:      the Marine Corps is trying to keep up with the Joneses. This      is a war over stars. The Marine Corps wants to have as many      generals per capita as the other services. This is not the      right way to resolve the problem. There is a better way. You      should fix it in exactly the same way your Committee fixed it      in 1990. You should fix it by giving each service the right      number of generals--a number that matches the force      structure.       I hope that reason prevails on this issue. At a minimum, I      think the decision on the extra 12 Marine generals should be      delayed until the Inspector General has conducted an      independent review of all Department of Defense headquarters,      commands, and general officer billets and determined exactly      what is necessary based on real military requirements.           Sincerely,                                              Charles E. Grassley,                                                     U.S. Senator.
