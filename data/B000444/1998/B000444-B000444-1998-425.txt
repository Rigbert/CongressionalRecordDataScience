 We do have a formal estimate of the cost, and the chairman of the full committee was, I think, being his usual diplomatic self in saying that. Maybe it is best that we debate this in a coherent way and a very specific way. So that is why he asked the Senator to submit in writing, if I am not mistaken--Senator Warner submit in writing; I was not here at the time--his questions and the basis of his analysis of the cost and he would come back with a formal response.
