Speaker, I too rise on this occasion of Mother's Day weekend to pay tribute to those who bring to life and nurture and educate the children, the families of our communities and our world, and as my dear colleague, the gentlewoman from Ohio (Mrs. Jones) so eloquently stated in the prior Special Order, when we think about it, mothers have the most important role in the world because they create the love that holds, the center that holds their families together. I think that their idealism helps inspire the world every day, not in big measures always, but in smaller signs of love and affection.  There is no more important person in a child's life than the mother and father. But as this is Mother's Day weekend, I think it is important to point out that for children learning in schools, the most important factor in their success is their mother reading to them at home.                              {time}  1630  As we think about education, which is on the minds of all the people in our country, because education is so important to the preservation and the advancement of our democratic way of life, having an enlightened republic, it is important to think about the role of women and education and the role of this Federal Government in helping our families educate their children.  We have heard a lot from this administration about compassionate conservatism. I have really tried to understand what that term means. But in speaking about education, maybe it is important to put on the record, it is important to have individuals going to schools and reading to children. I do it myself. It is important to have mothers reading to children. It is the most important act that they can perform for that child in the home other than feeding them.  But if you look at this Federal Government and this particular Bush administration, though the compassionate side comes out when we see pictures in the paper of the President coming to Michigan, which he just did this week just north of where I live in Ohio, or wherever he might go, and then you look at the bills that come on this floor such as the Elementary and Secondary Education Act this year, it provides no additional assistance for education of our children around the country. In fact, the bill that passed here authorized an expenditure of over $24 billion for education at the elementary and secondary levels, but 2 weeks later when the President's budget arrived, it was $4 billion short. In other words, they might be compassionate, but the conservative side actually does not allow them to fulfill their promises.  Broken promises, that is what compassionate conservatism is all about. Frankly, it is all about nothing. Ask any of our college students across this country. They graduate on average today with a debt of nearly $17,000. Our physicians, when our medical school students graduate from college, on average we force them to have a debt load of over $100,000. How can a young physician going into practice manage to have a practice that is profitable while he or she has to pay that debt at the same time as they have to buy all this medical liability insurance, pay for the building, pay for all of their instruments and the medicines, and so forth. Think about the burden that we continue to place on the future of this country, on our young people.  So as a woman of our country, as a Congresswoman, as someone who I think has some mothering instincts of her own, let me just say probably the most important thing I can do is to support the future, and that is to support our young people at the elementary and secondary level and at the college level and to say to the Bush administration, compassion is not enough. Conservatism is not enough. You have to do something with the power you have to help nurture and grow the next generation. And burdening them with debt that they do not get out from under until they are 40 years old is not the way to build this country.  Frankly, we ought to have a program that allows any student, any young adult in this country that has that kind of debt to work it off through national service on the military side or the civilian side at a rate of $20,000 a year. We ought to get them out from under that debt and take care of some of the needs of this country, whether it is in our nursing homes, whether it is in our forests, whether it is in our inner city schools, whether it is in our medical clinics, wherever it might be, that we take this burden off the next generation so that they can move into this 21st century and new millennium in a way that helps advance America's cause.  Happy Mother's Day.                          ____________________
