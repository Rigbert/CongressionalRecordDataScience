 President, I rise today to honor the extraordinary life and career of Mr. Willard ``Bill'' Lowery, who passed away on December 20, 2010. He was 80 years old. As a beloved member of his community in Burnside, KY, Bill was a prime example of a man who poured his heart into serving and protecting his family, his community, and his country.  Born in Pulaski County, KY, Bill not only served his community selflessly, but touched the lives of all who had the pleasure of meeting him. He courageously served in the U.S. Army during the Korean War, and continued his public service as a Burnside police officer. It is no wonder that Bill's friendly demeanor and dedication earned him the position of chief of police, which he held for 6 years.  Bill continued to serve his community as an employee at the Pulaski County Detention Center, a member of Blue John Baptist Church, the American Legion Post 38, and, even more impressively, as a 50-year member of the Burnside Masonic Lodge. It is evident that the people in this close-knit community respected and valued Bill's tireless dedication, when more than 50 residents, including fellow police officers, lined the streets of Burnside following his funeral procession to pay their respects.  I could surely continue to praise the works and accomplishments of this hard-working and humble man, but I would simply ask that my colleagues join me in remembering this unsung hero, who showed incredible character and relentless dedication in service to his community, his country, and the Commonwealth. My thoughts go out to his beloved wife Wanda, his son Eugene, his two daughters, Alice and Penny Jo, 6 grandchildren, and 14 great-grandchildren, and many other beloved friends and family members.  The Commonwealth Journal in Somerset, KY, recently published a story about Bill Lowery. I ask unanimous consent that the article be printed in the Record.  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in the Record, as follows:         Citizens Honor Late Police Chief Lowery Along U.S. 27                           (By Chris Harris)       Anyone who saw dozens of individuals lining U.S. 27 last      Thursday and holding signs might have wondered what was going      on. If one looked at the signs closely enough, the answer      would be evident.       The life and career of Willard ``Bill'' Lowery, who passed      away Monday, Dec. 20 at the age of 80, was honored last week      by friends and Burnside neighbors.       It was a fitting way to begin the mayoral career of Ron      Jones as well. Jones, who was chosen as mayor of Burnside in      the November elections, played a role in making the tribute      reality, and his wife Emma Lou is credited with being one of      the primary organizers of it.       ``Ms. Emma Lou arranged for everybody to make signs,'' said      Penny Johnson, one of Lowery's daughters. Lowery had three      children--son Eugene and daughters Alice and Penny.       The funeral was held last Thursday at Lake Cumberland      Funeral Home. Two Burnside police cars followed the funeral      procession, led by Chief Craig Whitaker--one car in front,      one in the back--to the Blue John Cemetery, where Lowery was      buried. The Burnside police officers stopped at the      intersection of the Ky. 914 bypass and U.S. 27 and halted      traffic for a salute to Lowery.       Starting near Guthrie's River House restaurant in Burnside,      the highway was lined all the way into downtown Burnside with      individuals holding signs to remember Lowery. Johnson      estimated about 50 people took part in the tribute.       ``Lowery was a dedicated police officer for our community      for a long time,'' said Ron Jones. ``We felt like he should      be given some recognition, and recognition to his family.''       When Jones moved to Burnside in the mid-1970s, Lowery was      one of the first people Jones met. They maintained a      friendship throughout the years.       ``Back then, they were just a one-man team,'' said Jones of      the Burnside Police Force in Lowery's day. ``Things sure have      (changed). It's not such a sleepy little town anymore.''       Lowery was Chief of Police in Burnside from 1969 to 1975.      He was also retired from the Pulaski County Detention Center,      and was a 50-year member of the Burnside Masonic Lodge #634,      a member of the American Legion Post 38, a U.S. Army veteran      of the Korean War, and attended the Blue John Baptist Church.       ``It touched my heart,'' said Johnson of the tribute to her      father. ``I don't even know what the words are to say. It's      unbelievable what the community did for him so that his      legend lives on forever. It was just overwhelming.''                          ____________________
