Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of H. Res. 165, a resolution that calls for the rights of Greek Cypriots andTurkish Cypriots to be protected. Most importantly, the resolution urges that steps be taken to resolve the longest unresolved conflict in Europe--the division of Cyprus.  The Commission on Security and Cooperation in Europe, which I co-chair, has held several briefings over the last 18 months on the evolution of a hoped-for solution to the Cyprus impasse. The tone of these briefings varied from optimistic to skeptical. Those concerned about this problem were hopeful when United Nations Secretary General Koffi Annan put forth a proposed plan last November.  After further discussions, Mr. Annan adapted the plan to encompass the concerns voiced by both sides of the conflict. Unfortunately, Mr. Rauf Denktash, leader of the Turkish Cypriots, failed to accept either the comprehensive settlement or the proposed referendum advanced by the Secretary General. Denktash's inability to find common ground with his fellow Cypriots from the Greek side keeps Cyprus divided.  H. Res. 165 calls for the most logical resolution of the problem--let the people of Cyprus, whether they be Greek Cypriots or Turkish Cypriots, determine their own fate at the ballot box. Tens of thousands of Turkish Cypriots have demonstrated their support for this proposal in massive public marches. Many Turkish Cypriots are obtaining Republic of Cyprus passports in an attempt to move this process ahead.  Mr. Denktash must heed the call of these times. The time for a single man to stand in the way of progress for an entire people, for an entire country, is past. I call on you, Mr. Denktash, to allow the referendum to be held now or step aside in the interest of your people and the prospect of reconciliation on the divided island nation of Cyprus!                          ____________________
