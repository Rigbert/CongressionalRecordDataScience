 Because she has operated under such good faith, I will vote for this amendment if there is a vote. I want to make it clear it does not satisfy all of my concerns and objections, nor, I suspect, do the changes satisfy her.  There is an effective date in here that would make this, in effect, retroactive. I think that is bad public policy. I think it is also inconsistent with having a piece of legislation that will take effect as a whole upon passage but one section of it that looks back and is retroactive.  I also am still not satisfied, nor, I suspect, is the Senator from Texas satisfied, with the section allowing, in effect, an individual to be able to say, ``I acted in good faith,'' and not be subject to penalties or not be subject to civil or criminal penalties.  There are a few other things I still have problems with. If we ever get to the point where, in the substitute that the Senator from Ohio is going to offer to this legislation as a whole, I would attempt to put in the language more to the liking of the Senator from Delaware, were that ever to prevail.  Having said that, I sincerely thank the Senator from Texas. This is, from my perspective, a much improved version and meets the vast majority of my concerns that I had relative to the amendment. I yield the floor.
