Speaker, on this week of Veterans Day, I rise to pay tribute to two noble Americans and a great organization, Honor Flight. Earl Morse of Ohio and Jeff Miller of North Carolina are two of the founding members of the Honor Flight Network.  The Honor Flight Network philanthropy is dedicated to bringing World War II veterans to their memorial here in Washington, D.C., the National World War II Memorial. That memorial is now the most visited on our Nation's Mall with over 4 million visitors a year. Imagine if every World War II veteran who wanted to come could.  These brave men and women served our country during World War II during the 20th century's most profound struggle of liberty over tyranny. Their sacrifices, with over 400,000 lost in those horrendous conflicts, ensured that our generation and those to follow could enjoy our freedoms in the 20th century, the 21st, and beyond.  Earl Morse started the Honor Flight Network. He led the inaugural flights to the World War II memorial starting in 2005, not long after the memorial opened. Jeff Miller began to serve those from rural areas.  Mr. Speaker, let me say that these two men's ennobling work has now allowed over 100,000 Americans of the World War II generation who fought to come and visit the memorial.  Let me thank you, Mr. Speaker, and thank those veterans and Honor Flight and these men for what they are doing for our Nation.                          ____________________
