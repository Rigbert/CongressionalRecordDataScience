 President, I rise today to introduce the Older Americans Tax Fairness Act of 2003. My bill would completely eliminate the unjust taxation of Social Security benefits once and for all. The underlying premise of my legislation is simple: Social Security benefits were never intended to be taxed. At its inception and continuing on for the next fifty years, Social Security benefits were exempt from taxation. Budgetary shortfalls in 1984 and 1993, however, led to the taxation of these benefits.  Because of the rising cost of living, many of our seniors are forced to work past age 65. To these Americans, every penny counts in determining whether they are able to pay for food, heating, and healthcare. However, by taxing Social Security benefits, we make it increasingly impossible for millions of older Americans to make ends meet. In effect, then, taxation of Social Security benefits forces many Americans to endure stressful situations in what should be the golden years of their lives.  Taxation of Social Security benefits is also wrong because it changes the rules in the middle of the game. When seniors contributed to Social Security through the payment of payroll taxes, they did so with the understanding that they would one day receive those benefits tax-free. Unfortunately, because of runaway spending, many in the government have viewed Social Security taxation as a way to make up the shortfall between Federal spending and revenue. Such a decision was wrong then and it is even more wrong now as seniors face rising living costs.  In addition to being fundamentally unfair, I believe that taxing Social Security benefits once seniors pass certain income thresholds discourages them from working. I firmly believe that senior citizens add a wealth of knowledge and experience to the workplace. As such, we must make sure that our American workforce is not deprived of these valuable assets. Our laws should encourage older Americans with a desire to work to continue contributing to our society. Unfortunately, our laws do just the opposite.  Every year my office receives hundreds of letters and calls from older Americans throughout the country and Alabama describing the hardship that Social Security taxation has placed on their lives. The solution to this situation is simple--repeal the unfair taxation of these benefits. I therefore urge my colleagues to listen to their constituents and join me in support of my bill.                                 ______                                       By
