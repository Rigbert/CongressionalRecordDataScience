Then they came along with VORs, and I thought this has to be the end of it. Then they came along with RNAV. They could pick up a VR and move it over here. What more could they ever do than that? Then LORAN came along and then GPS. So I quit saying they can't get better because now there is hardly a runway in the world you can't shoot an instrument approach on using GPS. I flew an airplane around the world, all across Siberia--bad weather all the way--and I shot my approaches with GPS. You could train a chimpanzee to do it with a GPS.  I agree with my friend from Iowa. We are anxious for NextGen and these opportunities we have that are coming up to enhance the safety and abilities of general aviation along with commercial aviation.
