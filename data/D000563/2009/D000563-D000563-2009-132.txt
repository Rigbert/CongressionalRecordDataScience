President, H.R. 3288 is a consolidated appropriations bill which contains almost all of the remaining spending bills for the fiscal year 2010. This is a process we had not anticipated. We had hoped we could take each bill individually and consider them on the floor and bring them to conclusion. Unfortunately, we ran out of time.  We had over 90 different efforts made to stop debate on the Senate floor on a variety of measures. It took us literally 4 weeks to extend unemployment benefits. This is something usually done routinely on a bipartisan basis, but unfortunately, because of delays and threats of filibusters, it took us 4 weeks to finally come to a vote to extend unemployment benefits in the midst of the worst recession the United States has experienced in over 75 years. It is unthinkable, at a time people were sending us e-mails and letters saying: I can't believe the Senate won't provide a helping hand. It isn't as if the bill itself was controversial. When it finally came to a vote, it passed 97 to nothing.
