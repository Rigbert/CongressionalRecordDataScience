President, I thank my friend for introducing this amendment, which closes a troubling loophole in our military personnel system.  Currently, members of the National Guard called up under Federal title 32 status are not eligible for the protections of the Soldiers and Sailors Civil Relief Act. The act ensures that a servicemember can protect their house, life insurance, and health insurance while on active duty. It ensures a smooth transition back and forth between active service and civilian life, and it essentially underpins the entire military personnel system. We cannot defend the country without the National Guard, and we cannot attract qualified people to the Guard without the relief act.  The act has not applied to Guard members called up under title 32 status because most activations over the past fifty years have been under title 10, active military duty. However, September 11 tipped the balance in the other direction. Title 32 provides more flexibility to achieve missions in the United States and guarantees local control. As a result, thousands of Guard members have been called up across the country to secure our airports, railroads, bridges, and borders under this status.  This amendment extends the relief act to these proud citizen-soldiers. They must have these protections so they can focus on their mission. For them, I urge the adoption of the amendment.
