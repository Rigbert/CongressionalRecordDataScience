President, the reports recently released by the Mount Sinai Center did reveal disturbing news about the long-term health effects suffered by those working in recovery efforts after September 11. It is very disturbing because, clearly, we should make every effort to respond to and monitor the health problems of those who were at or near Ground Zero on that day--the heroes who risked their own lives and, apparently, their long-term health by rushing in to rescue others.  This amendment would direct the Secretary of HHS, acting through the Director of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, to award grants to entities to provide medical and mental health monitoring, tracking, and treatment to individuals whose health has been directly affected as a result of the attacks on New York City on September 11.  I do have some questions about the amendment, however. For one--and I see the sponsors otherwise engaged, but I am going to pose the question anyway. Again, I am very sympathetic. I think we have an obligation to those rescue workers, firefighters, emergency medical personnel, police officers, and others who risked their own lives and health to respond to the needs of others.  I am concerned that the amendment only applies to those first responders in New York City. There may well be health impacts that were suffered by the rescue workers, firefighters, police officers, and others who responded to the Pentagon. I am concerned that the Senator limits the nearly $2 billion in funding to only New York, and that doesn't seem fair to me. It seems to me that it should apply to both jurisdictions. I don't know whether there were similar problems in Pennsylvania, as well, but it seems to me it should be broader.
