 President, I wish to recognize a distinguished Kentuckian and honorable veteran of the Vietnam war, Don Parrish. More than four decades ago, Mr. Parrish and his hometown of Bardstown, KY, suffered great loss: In the summer of 1969, four Bardstown soldiers Mr. Parrish knew well were killed in service to our country. This loss was one of the worst suffered by any town in the war. As the years pass, Mr. Parrish finds himself more and more emotional regarding his time in uniform.  In October of 1968, Mr. Parrish was deployed to Vietnam with the C Battery of the Kentucky Army National Guard. Mr. Parrish and his fellow soldiers were reportedly the best firing battery in all of Southeast Asia. The battery consisted of childhood friends, brothers, and cousins. As boys who had grown up together to become men, they operated flawlessly as a unit.  The battery was ``infused'' with soldiers from New Hampshire, a precaution taken in an effort to prevent too many men from the same hometown from remaining a part of one unit in case of fatal attacks. Regrettably, that did not prevent an attack by the Viet Cong on Firebase Tomahawk, resulting in the tragic loss of four of Mr. Parrish's Bardstown comrades and fellow servicemen.  Mr. Parrish, a native of Bardstown, where he still lives today, worked for many years operating his family's business manufacturing concrete blocks. Eventually he and his wife Judy opened a bookstore together, which they ran for almost 20 years. Mr. Parrish is now a volunteer member of KET's Friends Board, which promotes KET in counties all over Kentucky.  I am tremendously proud to represent such a remarkable man and veteran here in the Senate, and I extend my thanks for Don Parrish's service. I am sure my colleagues join me in expressing gratitude for his service as well. He represents the finest of Kentucky.  A Kentucky publication, KET Visions, recently published an interview with Mr. Parrish about his experience in Vietnam. I ask unanimous consent that the article be printed in the Record.  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in the Record, as follows:                     [From KET Visions, Nov. 2016]       Hometown Hero Parrish Served, Suffered Loss in Vietnam War       Don Parrish has always been able to talk about his Vietnam      experiences. Not that it isn't difficult. His losses--and      they were great--affect him more and more as the years pass.      Emotions rise more readily to the surface.       ``As time moves on, my emotions get worse,'' said Parrish,      who deployed to Vietnam in October 1968 with ``C'' Battery of      the Kentucky Army National Guard, an artillery unit of men      from Bardstown and the surrounding area.       ``We went to Washington last fall to help our daughter and      her husband move into a new apartment. While we were there,      we went to the wall,'' he said, his voice breaking     as he remembered visiting the Vietnam Veterans Memorial.       ``It was tough. I've been there many times, and the crazy      thing about it is that it gets tougher every time.''       Parrish, a member of KET's Friends Board, a volunteer      organization which promotes KET in counties statewide, was      born and raised in Bardstown, where he still lives. He      operated his family business manufacturing concrete blocks      for many years, and later opened a bookstore he and his wife,      Judy, operated for nearly two decades.       Parrish's National Guard battery was ``infused'' with      soldiers from New Hampshire. Infusion was a military policy      designed to prevent too many men from the same hometown from      dying in a single incident from the same unit.       In Bardstown's case, however, the policy wasn't enough to      thwart fate.       During their training and tour, the soldiers from Nelson      County worked seamlessly as perhaps only men who had once      been boys together can. In fact, the unit not only contained      boyhood friends, but seven sets of brothers and many cousins      as well.       ``We were declared to be the top firing battery in all of      Southeast Asia because we were so effective and efficient,''      he said with pride. ``Why? Because we went to school together      and we knew each other. So when it came time to do our job,      we did it well.''       An attack by the Viet Cong on a rainy night at the      difficult-to-defend Firebase Tomahawk, however, was too much      for even the best of the best. In that summer of 1969, four      Bardstown boys were killed, plus another from ``A'' Battery      of nearby Carrollton.       The story of that loss, one of the worst suffered from any      town during the war, has brought news outlets, television      documentaries, and authors to Parrish's door, and he has been      interviewed by CNN, CBS Sunday Morning, and more about the      fatal attack. He also shared his experience with KET in      Kentucky Veterans of the Vietnam War: In Their Own Words.       ``There are a lot of guys who don't talk about it--except      to me,'' said Parrish, who returned to Vietnam and Firebase      Tomahawk in 1995, accompanied by other vets and WHAS-TV,      which produced a program on the trip.       ``War is really difficult to win when you are on the      enemy's turf. That war could have been won had restraints      been removed,'' he said.       ``In fact, it is said by many, and I agree with them, that      the war was won--because its purpose was to stop the spread      of Communism among the Far Eastern nations. And to that end,      we won the war.''       When Parrish talks about Vietnam, he also remembers the      good times, the camaraderie, and fond memories, like the two      guys from Bloomfield, Ky., who raced one another with 95-     pound Howitzer rounds in each hand.       He has photographs, now fading, of the people he met--like      the Catholic priest who still served at the same church when      Parrish returned in 1995. The stray dogs they adopted. The      bunkers where they slept at night. These memories became a      part of who he is.       ``I'm proud of my service,'' Parrish reflected. ``I think      we did well, and I'm sorry to lose friends, but that's a part      of war--a terrible part of war.''                          ____________________
