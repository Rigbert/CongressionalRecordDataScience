 Mr. McCARTHY. I know he likes to make long speeches before he gets to a question, and I know he likes to go back in decades for the decades that he has served, but I was only referring to this Congress. I was moving to the answer, but I was building and explaining why the answer is what it is.  He doesn't think the actions prior don't take place until now. We have sat in those rooms and we talked about border security. The interesting part, though, Mr. Speaker: The other side of the aisle that said they were for border security, they were going to perpetuate the problem we currently have because they did not want to end this catch and release. They are going to put families in harm's way.  They question whether you could actually have a border of a wall. That is really the philosophical debate that we are talking about.  Now, we will work through this bill. There are some other parts of the bill that we are working on this weekend. Any changes that come to a conclusion, of course, we will let you know.  But much of what this bill is is the same thing that we talked down at the White House about and we talked for those numbers of hours inside my office about.  But, Mr. Speaker, the gentleman on the other side said that he was never going to shut down the government, but he voted to do it this time. They said that they were concerned about CHIP, but they would vote against it when we bring it to the floor.  Do you know what we had to do? We had to carry it on our own.  And do you know what happened for the American children? The longest it has ever been renewed: 10 years.  So, yes, we want to work with them. But if the idea is to stop anything from happening for the American public, do not expect me to stop. It is too important. If we have to push through on our own, we will.  And my friend made a statement that this body is one-sided. Don't take my word for it. Let's go to Quorum, a company that only focuses on data, that only focuses on measurements. Do you know what they said about this Congress? Seventy percent of the bills signed into law this Congress have one Republican and one Democratic cosponsor, the highest rate in the past 20 years for bipartisanship.  The bills that we bring to the floor, despite the leadership's push, every week, Mr. Speaker, we can see the actions. What was the action that they held everybody until the last minute for those 23 people who wanted to vote for the appropriations bill? They had to wait until the Republicans carried it, then they released them to vote for it.  Or we talk about the farm bill.  Every day, Mr. Speaker, I come back here, I see the ranking member on the other side put a letter out to her Members to not vote for whatever comes.  And, yes, we on this side of the aisle want to solve DACA. But I know. I read your tweets just as well: Dreamers can still apply to renew DACA protections.  But, do you know what? In our bill, we deal with the DACA situation.  Do you know what else we also deal with? We deal with the border, and we deal with security, because we do not want to be back here in another 2 or 5 years with the same problem we have today.                              {time}  1230  Even if you won't work with us from the children's health insurance, from funding of government, from appropriations for our veterans, you want to hold those votes back, I don't think the public wants to hold those back.  And you know what? If we have to push forward, we will. And I will not apologize for it. This country is too important, the problems are too big.  And I can listen, Mr. Speaker, to every argument we make, but I will just think the American public can look at the data.  Do you know what today is, Mr. Speaker? The 6-month anniversary of the tax bill passing. You know what else it is? One million new jobs. You know what else it is? Unemployment below 4 percent. And in the last 49 years of this country, unemployment below 4 percent has only been 7 months in 49 years, but two of those 7 months were April and May of this year. Unemployment claims, 44-year low. And for the first time in the history of this Nation, there are more jobs being offered than there are people looking for them.  So all that rhetoric, all those arguments you made building up to that tax bill, the Armageddon, the crumbs, how terrible this is going to be, 6 months later, history proves different.  And you know what, Mr. Speaker? If we had waited and waited for the Democrats, there would not be a million new jobs, there would not be unemployment where it is, because, Mr. Speaker, there wasn't one Democrat to vote for it, even though a number of them privately told me on this floor they wanted to, but their leadership told them no.  So if we have to solve the economy and we have to solve immigration on our own, we will.
