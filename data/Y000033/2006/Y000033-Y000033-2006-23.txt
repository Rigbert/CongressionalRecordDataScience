Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.  Mr. Speaker, 4 years ago Congress passed the Pipeline Safety Improvement Act for 2002. The States and the pipeline community have praised that bill as an overwhelming success.  That is why H.R. 5782, the Pipeline Inspection Protection Enforcement and Safety Act of 2006, keeps us moving in the same positive direction as the 2002 pipeline bill.  I want to thank my ranking member, Democrat Member Mr. Oberstar, for working closely with me to develop this legislation. Also, Mr. DeFazio has worked very closely with us. We could not have accomplished this result without our subcommittee chairman, Tom Petri, and of course I just mentioned Mr. Peter DeFazio.  I want to also thank the chairman of the Energy and Commerce Committee, Joe Barton, and my very good friend and colleague, ranking Democrat, John Dingell for their excellent work to bring this bill to this point.  In September the Energy and Commerce Committee also ordered the bill reported with their amendment. We have worked with our friends on the Energy and Commerce Committee, as well as the other body, to come up with a bill that they will support also.  The bill we are considering here today has been negotiated with the Senate Commerce Committee, and the other body is expected to pass the bill later this week.  I have been very impressed with the work of the Pipeline and Hazardous Materials Safety Administration, which is often called PHMSA, and their administrator, Admiral Tom Barrett.  Their response to and oversight of pipeline spills on the North Slope in Alaska this past year have received widespread praise.  We were very careful in drafting this bill to avoid disrupting the hard work and remarkable progress that occurred at PHMSA over the past 4 years.  Like all legislation, this bill contains compromises. The policies in this bill are the result of compromise and hard work. However, the compromise that we have reached in this bill will not take away from the impact of this bill.  This is a good bill. It improves pipeline safety and the role of the administration regulating pipelines.  H.R. 5782 extends the pipeline safety program for another 4 years. To the fiscal year of 2010. These programs include operational funds for the Office of Pipeline Safety to carry out its regulatory and enforcement functions, and State pipeline safety grants that cover the cost of State expenses to carry out certified pipeline safety inspect activities.  The bill also funds emergency response grants, public education and one-call damage prevention programs and grants to provide technical assistance to local communities on pipeline safety issues.  The administration, the States, the pipeline safety advocates and the pipeline industry all support this bill.  I strongly support this legislation to protect public safety, and I encourage my colleagues to do the same.  Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.  Mr. DeFAZIO. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.  I rise in support of H.R. 5782, Pipeline Inspection Protection Enforcement Safety Act of 2006.  We have come a long way since the original legislation was passed in 2002. After the tragedies in Bellingham, Washington, in which committee Member Rick Larsen played a particularly key role in urging the committee forward, and Carlsbad, New Mexico, we had quite a contentious markup at that point in time, with a lot of resistance from what we saw as needed improvements in pipeline safety from the industry.  Not so this time around. In fact, there was broad consensus with the majority side, with the majority of the industry from the beginning, that we wanted to make some additional improvements in pipeline safety with this bill, but that a radical new approach was not warranted because we had already laid that groundwork with the 2002 bill.                              {time}  1715  The gentleman from the Energy and Commerce Committee will address in some detail the work done and improved upon in their committee relating to the pipeline, low-stress pipelines, which had been substantially exempt from regulation previously. Unfortunately, that led to some neglect on the part of BP in Alaska, and we had the largest North Slope oil spill because of a low pressure line which previously had been thought not to be of major concern, and in fact the company itself admitted they had been running the lines to failure.  Well, lines nowhere will be run to failure any more under this bill. We are going to have more pipeline inspectors, more enforcement. We are going to broaden the legislation to cover all pipelines and, you know, this will also have the Inspector General paying closer attention to some of the implementation of this legislation.  I want to thank my chairman, Mr. Petri, for his help in putting this together, Chairman Young, Ranking Member Oberstar and members of the committee.  Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.
