Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.  Mr. Speaker, I have listened intently to the words of the distinguished gentleman from Texas (Mr. Sam Johnson) on behalf of Mr. Spoon's nomination to the Smithsonian Board of Regents.  Mr. Spoon is indeed, as has been represented by the gentleman from Texas (Mr. Sam Johnson), an outstanding American, an outstanding member of this community, a distinguished business executive; and he will bring a wealth of knowledge, experience, and wisdom to serve on the Smithsonian Board of Regents.  I share the view of the gentleman from Texas (Mr. Sam Johnson) that he will be a very, very worthy addition to this Board and will serve the Smithsonian and the Nation well. I rise in support of this resolution.  Mr. Speaker, I have no further requests for time, and I yield back the balance of my time.
