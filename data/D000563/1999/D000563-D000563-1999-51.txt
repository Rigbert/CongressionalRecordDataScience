President, briefly, I ask my colleague, is it not true this appropriation for education was the last of the bills considered by the Appropriations Committee? Is it not true that we waited until the very last day to even bring up this issue of education, the highest priority for American families? Now we find ourselves trying to adjourn, stuck on an issue that could have been resolved months ago had we made education as high a priority on Capitol Hill as it is in family rooms across America.
