 President, I rise today to pay tribute to SPC Marcus Adams. Adams hails from Magoffin County, KY, and proudly served his country on a tour of duty in Iraq.  Adams graduated from Magoffin County High School, and after his freshman year in college he decided to enlist in the U.S. Army. Because of the strong military tradition in his family--his father, grandfather, and two uncles all served--he felt it was an easy decision to carry on that legacy.  After completing his basic training and advanced individual combat training, Adams was assigned to the 555th Engineer Brigade. In September of 2008, he and his brigade were sent to Balad, Iraq, where they would remain for the duration of their yearlong tour of duty.  In Iraq, Adams was responsible for all of his brigade's technology. Managing the computer networks, servers, and radios were tasks that all fell under his purview.  Adams is now happily back in his old Kentucky home with his wife Ash'leigh and his son Alistair and will soon be joined by his first daughter Hermione.  For his honorable service to this country, he is well deserving of praise from this body. Therefore, I ask that my U.S. Senate colleagues join me in honoring SPC Marcus Adams.  The Salyersville Independent recently published an article detailing Adams' service in Iraq. I ask unanimous consent that the full article be printed in the Record.  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in the Record, as follows:           [From the Salyersville Independent, July 3, 2014]                      Quick Decision Leads to Iraq                           (By Heather Oney)       One ``drop of the hat'' decision took Marcus Adams all the      way to Iraq.       Adams, a graduate of Magoffin County High School, was 19      years old and had completed one year of college when he came      in one afternoon in February 2007 and told his wife,      Ash'leigh Nicole Prince Adams, he had joined the Army.       ``There were no objections,'' Adams laughed. ``She stayed      in college at Morehead and I went to basic training.''       Adams said given his family's history, with his dad,      grandfather and two uncles serving in the military, it was a      no-brainer.       ``With 9/11, I felt because everyone else in my family had      served, I felt the responsibility to at least do a minimum      tour,'' Adams said. ``I didn't feel productive in college and      the Army could give me steady employment and healthcare.''       Adams finished his basic training at Fort Jackson, South      Carolina, then his Advanced Individual Training (AIT) at Fort      Gordon, Georgia. He was then assigned to the 555th Engineer      Brigade, based out of Fort Lewis, Washington.       His primary job with the brigade, which he stayed in all      through his enlistment, was to be the computer guy, Adams      said. He was responsible for the computer networks, servers,      radios--any technology--the engineers needed.       In September 2008, only seven years after 9/11, Adams and      his brigade were sent to Balad, Iraq, where the team would      stay a year.       ``The War in the Middle East we have been engaged in for      the past 10-plus years is open-ended by its very nature,''      Adams said. ``In Vietnam, we had an actual bad guy, in      uniform and everything. In Iraq and Afghanistan, when the      enemy is terror, who is that? There's no way to define      victory.''       Despite recent developments in Iraq, Adams said, ``I'm      proud of the work we did. Less than 1 percent of U.S.      Americans ever serve in any capacity. The importance of      serving and the things I got from it turned me into the      person I am.''       Adams said the majority of the time he remained on base,      which was a former Iraqi Army base where temperatures got up      to 130 degrees in the day.       ``It's hard to express how hot that is,'' Adams remembered.       He had one mission off-base, where he said he saw how big      the gap was between the poor and the rich in Iraq.       ``Here, the poorest people get food stamps and aid,'' Adams      said. ``I've seen Iraqi men walking around bare naked,      picking up garbage, and the guys working with us are wearing      suits and eating lobster. We saw people working at a dump in      a junk-yard, building shelters out of it.''       While their truck was armored with additional plates, he      said a man threw a Russian RKG-3 anti-tank grenade between      the truck and the plate, causing damage to the truck, but no      one was hurt.       At one point Adams and a few other men received four-day      passes and they went to Doha, Qatar, to unwind. Located on      the Persian Gulf, Qatar is more of a tourist country, with      only 30 percent of the people in the country at any given      time actually being residents. Since they were there during      Ramadan, when it is illegal to be caught eating or drinking      during the daylight hours, Adams said they had to be careful      to stay hydrated. They would pull the curtains on the bus      they were traveling on and drank anyway in order to not      dehydrate in the well over 100-degree temperatures.       In September 2009, he came back to the states, getting to      travel all around the country. He worked in Fort Irwin,      California, twice, Fort Campbell, Kentucky and Yakima      Training Center, Washington.       The hardest part, he said, was reintegrating with his wife.       ``It's weird when you leave that long when you've been the      head of the household,'' Adams said. ``You have to leave and      hand it all over to her--the bills and all the decisions--and      when you come back, you try to come back in the same role,      but she's like, I've got this.''       Adams said for the first month back, all the soldiers had      to report for a daily briefing set up to help them with the      reintegration process, but he saw many dealing with      infidelity issues when they returned, as well as Post-     Traumatic Stress Disorder.       ``People can get really messed up and they used to just      tell us, Suck it up and deal with it,' but I think they are      seeing now that's not the best policy.''       Thankfully, for him, he said they never had to deal with      either issue.       He could have gone to Afghanistan for another tour,      however, his contract would have had to be extended past the      usual six years. Since he was now the father of one, he took      the Army's offer for an early honorable discharge, leaving      three months early to be with his son. He was ranked as a      Specialist, under the E4 pay grade.       Marcus and Ash'leigh Adams have one son, Alistair Dean      Adams, who is three years old, and one daughter on the way      (at press time), Hermione Sue Adams.                          ____________________
