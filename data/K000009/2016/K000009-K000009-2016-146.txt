Speaker, I want to welcome the Congressman and doctor, Dan Benishek, from Michigan's First District, which encompasses Marquette and Mackinac Island and Traverse City, to name a few famous towns and island. I welcome him to participate this evening as well as our other colleagues from the Great Lakes.  I rise tonight to mark the occasion of World Water Day. As such, I would like to discuss the Great Lakes, an American freshwater treasure, irreplaceable on our globe. Actually, it is the largest source of freshwater in the United States and represents about 20 percent of the world's freshwater supply.  The district that I represent, which is a little south of Michigan, down in Ohio, sits nestled across Lake Erie's entire south coast, extending from Cleveland all the way west to Toledo and encompasses all of Ohio's ports but for one.  There should be a sign, actually, on the Ohio Turnpike nearby that marks our shoreline as the step-off point, since Lake Erie is the most southern of all the lakes, as the largest body of freshwater on the face of the Earth.  I see our dear colleague, the co-chair of the Great Lakes Task Force with me, Congressman Mike Kelly of Erie, Pennsylvania, who has joined us. It is also a great port city, nestled along these Great Lakes.  Let me begin by saying, since the passage of the Clean Water Act in 1972, Lake Erie itself has been on a path to recovery. It got very sick back in the 20th century.  Point sources of pollution, such as inadequate wastewater treatment facilities and infrastructure and industrial outfalls have been slowly coming. Since back then and the passage of the Clean Water Act and the establishment of Earth Day, they have been coming into EPA compliance.  One needs no further proof in tracking the rebirth of America's symbol, the bald eagle, than to really track Lake Erie's health. Lake Erie is the shallowest of the lakes; and, therefore, it is kind of the canary in the coal mine. What happens there will happen in the other lakes subsequently.  The bald eagle had actually become an endangered species by the time of the 1970s, and only two eagles were left on our great lake, Lake Erie. There were no eaglets being born.  Due to the Clean Water Act's passage and literally the banning of DDT and the repair of many of the industrial outfalls, which we are still working on, and the combined sewer overflows, what happened, as we moved into the 21st century, was human progress.  Today hundreds of baby eaglets are being born across Lake Erie, and they are flying other places around the country. Amazingly, the bald eagle has been taken off the endangered species list. So progress is possible. Humans can really repair the environment if they are dedicated to us.  For those of us who live in Lake Erie's western basin, which is the far western part of the State, the health of our lake is a living reality and access to freshwater has become the background noise of our daily lives, becoming more pronounced when tragedy strikes, as it did most recently in Flint, Michigan, and Sebring, Ohio, with lead in freshwater.                              {time}  1645  Our region works and plays with a new normal that includes very frequent water quality reports now, updates on beach postings--whether you can swim or not--water utility fee increases, and a general concern about a troubling set of scientific questions that still go unanswered.  Unfortunately, this administration has not recognized these concerns and seeks to cut Federal support to Great Lakes States by $148 million for next year. Some would call that an oxymoron; it makes no sense in view of what is happening across our region, but it is happening.  This evening--and I am going to yield to my colleagues before I get into these topics--I would like to address the water infrastructure needs of the Great Lakes, harmful algal blooms, which literally shut down the city of Toledo's water system a year-and-a-half ago, denying fresh water for 3 days to citizens, to businesses, and to institutions in that region because of something called microcystin, which is the toxic part of certain types of algal blooms which we are trying to address. So harmful algal blooms will be one of my topics.  Another topic will be the Great Lakes Restoration Initiative, which is so important to all of us in helping to improve our Great Lakes.  Stopping the Asian carp is another topic.  The next topic will be the Great Lakes navigation system itself, an antiquated system that has to be updated for this 21st century.  Finally, I will discuss the harbor maintenance fund. These are all major issues across the Great Lakes region, which we would like to place on the Record this evening.  I would like to ask my colleagues to join me. Congressman Benishek, I thank you again so very much for being a leader for the Great Lakes and for coming down this evening.  I now yield to the gentleman from Michigan (Mr. Benishek).
