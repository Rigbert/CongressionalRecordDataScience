Speaker, I would like to ask this of the Chair then; it is my understanding that the Chair has the right under the rules to make a unanimous-consent request that an individual be allowed to proceed after his words have been stricken, but in this case I wonder if it is the prerogative of the Chair to make such a motion, or whether it should have been made by a Member of the body?
