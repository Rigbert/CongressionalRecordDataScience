 President, now that this bill has finally passed the Senate, I take the opportunity to thank several people.  First and foremost, I thank Senator Baucus. I am very certain we would not be here without his good work and his cooperation. In fact, as I have said so many times in speeches, this whole effort started when Senator Baucus was chairman of the committee in the last Congress. He held hearings and started this process going. He has not only cooperated and put in good work during this Congress, but it all started under his leadership.  I also need to thank all the other members of the Finance Committee for their time and energy in making this bill a reality. I thank my staff on the Finance Committee: Mark Prater, chief tax counsel, and the other tax counsels, Ed McClellan, Elizabeth Paris, Dean Zerbe, Christy Mistr, and John O'Neill as well as John's predecessor, Diann Howland. These individuals, along with Adam Freed, the staff assistant for the tax team, have been real workhorses for the committee, keeping the lights burning long into the night to make this bill possible.  For the record, as evidence of the work effort, this bill was introduced on the day Hurricane Isabel blew into town. Because of hard work, the markup of the bill occurred in a calm environment.  I also thank the trade staff, particularly Everett Eissenstat, chief Trade Counsel, and his team of David Johanson, Stephen Schaefer, Daniel Shepherdson, and Zach Paulsen. I also thank Carrie Clark who recently left our trade staff. Thanks also needs to be paid to our administrative staff, including Carla Martin, Amber Williams, Geoff Burrell, and Mark Blair. From my personal staff, I thank Sherry Kuntz and Leah Shimp. Also helpful were our Finance Committee press team of Jill Kozeny and Jill Gerber, known around the committee as the ``Jills.'' Lastly, on my side, I thank Kolan Davis and Ted Totman, the Committee's staff director and deputy staff director for riding herd on all this work.  In addition, this bipartisan bill would not have been possible without close work and cooperation at the staff level. I appreciate and thank the minority staff for their good work. I particularly note Russ Sullivan, Democratic Staff Director, as well as Pat Heck, Democratic Chief Tax Counsel, Matt Stokes, Matt Jones, Matt Genasci, Judy Miller, Jon Selib, Liz Leibschutz, Matt Stanton, Dawn Levy, and Anita Horn Rizek. In addition, I thank Tim Punke and his trade team, along with John Angell, Bill Dauster, and Mike Evans, former Deputy Staff Director, for their time and energy.  I extend my thanks also to George Yin and his staff at the Joint Committee on Taxation for providing their extensive knowledge and guidance to this effort. I particularly point out the good work of Ray Beeman, David Noren, and Brian Meighan. Brian recently left Joint Tax for the private sector.  I also thank Acting Assistant Secretary for Tax Policy, Gregory Jenner, and his staff for their assistance on the so-called SILOs tax shelter provision of this bill.  I thank the majority leader, Senator Bill Frist, and his leadership staff for all their assistance. The majority leader backed me and Senator Baucus all the way on this bill. We would not have the result today but for the majority leader's patience, determination, and dedication. It was tough going at times, but he and I knew we would get the right result. From Senator Frist's staff, I thank Lee Rawls, Eric Ueland, Rohit Kumar, and Libby Jarvis.  I also thank our Senate leadership team and their staffs, especially our able whip, Senator McConnell.  Finally, my thanks go to Jim Fransen, Mark Mathiesen, Mark McGunagle, and their capable staff at Legislative Counsel for taking our ideas and drafting them into statutory language.  I would like to tell them all to go home and get a good night's rest because the bill has been a very long time working its way through the Senate.  Now, I urge our friends in the other body to pass a companion bill. Hopefully, when that bill passes the House, our friends in the Senate Democratic leadership will not resist our efforts to go to conference. Every month of delay is another month where the Euro tax ratchets up another percentage point on our products going to Europe.  I thank everyone for their cooperation in allowing us to get to this point this evening. This, of course, is not the final step in the process. The House hasnot passed their version of the FSC legislation. I anticipate the House will send a bill to the Senate at some point. When that happens, I hope we will be able to proceed to conference so that we are able to get a final product.  I appreciate the assistance of Senator Baucus throughout this process and hope we will be able to send a bill to committee.                           Order Of Procedure  Mr. President, following Senator Baucus's remarks, I ask unanimous consent that the Senate proceed to a period of morning business, with Senators permitted to speak for up to 10 minutes each.
