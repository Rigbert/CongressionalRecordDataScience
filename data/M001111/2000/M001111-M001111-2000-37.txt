 President, I want to join with my colleagues in expressing my deep sorrow at the loss of our friend and colleague, Paul Coverdell. During this difficult time, I want to extend my thoughts and prayers to Nancy and all of his family.  Paul and I both came to Washington, D.C. in January of 1993. In the years that I've know Paul, I've always been impressed by his thoughtfulness and his work ethic.  I always had the upmost respect for him because of his quiet demeanor. He did not seek headlines, and he did not seek credit. Whether it was fighting illegal drugs or working on education or tax policy, he simply did his work with a quiet determination, an open heart,and a kind word for anyone who crossed his path.  My predecessor in the Senate, Warren Magnuson, had a phrase for someone like that-- ``a workhorse not a showhorse.''  Paul Coverdell was a workhorse in the finest sense.  Paul earned the respect of everyone here because he treated everyone else with respect and dignity.  Paul's work here in the United States Senate was really just an extension of a lifetime of service. Whether it was serving his country in the U.S. Army, serving the people of Georgia as a state senator, or helping people around the world through his work as director of the United States Peace Corps, Paul brought his generous spirit and his determination to everything he undertook.  Mr. President, the people of Georgia are fortunate to have been served by a person of Paul's character and skills.  Those of us who worked with him here in the U.S. Senate were fortunate to have him as a friend and colleague. His passing is a loss to our Senate, to Georgia and to the Nation. I will miss him as a friend and colleague.
