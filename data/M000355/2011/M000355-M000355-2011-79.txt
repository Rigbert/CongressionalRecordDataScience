 SESSIONS. I would yield.  Mr. McCONNELL. I have heard it argued on the floor here in connection with this issue that somehow because the Christmas Day bomber pleaded guilty in an article III court, that was an argument for putting him in the article III court. As a distinguished former prosecutor, I wonder if my friend from Alabama could address the issue of whether because somebody happened to end up in an article III court and happened to plead guilty, how that was an argument for his placement there in the first place.
