Speaker, I regret that I do insist on the point of order.  In my opinion, the pending amendment violates clause 7 of rule XVI of the rules of the House which requires that an amendment be germane to the matter it is amending. It is not germane to the bill because section 3 imposes a mandate on State insurance commissioners, and section 4 amends the Public Health Service Act which is, in fact, beyond the scope of the base text.
