 President, yesterday, the top Republican and the top Democrat from the Agriculture Committee came to the floor to talk about the compromise bill that would protect middle-class families from unnecessary and unfair higher food prices while also ensuring access to more information about the food they purchase.  Chairman Roberts said this bipartisan bill will benefit consumers ``by greatly increasing the amount of food information at their fingertips'' while avoiding ``devastating increases in the price of food.''  Ranking Member Stabenow noted that it will ``prevent a confusing patchwork of 50 different labeling requirements in 50 different States,'' and it ``recognize[s] the scientific consensus that biotechnology is safe.''  It is the result of bipartisan work to address an issue that could negatively harm consumers and producers. We could actually pass it today.                          ____________________
