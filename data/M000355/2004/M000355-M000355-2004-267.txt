 President, let me just indicate for all of our Members that we are going to the Foreign Operations bill after this. We believe we are down to just a couple of amendments, and we are working on making them go away. Our goal is to pass it tonight. If we have the kind of cooperation we anticipate having, that will be possible. If not, we will have to stack the amendments and vote in the morning.  But I urge everyone to cooperate, and let's try to finish this up tonight. That is what the majority leader would like to do. That is where we will go next.  I yield the floor.
