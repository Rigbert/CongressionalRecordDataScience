Brendan F. Boyle of Pennsylvania also for coming to the floor this evening. If there is any remaining time, I would just like to read a couple of the sentences of Congressman Boyle's remarks because they are so incredible.  He talks about Deborah Lipstadt, an American historian and author of influential books such as ``Denying the Holocaust,'' who wrote an important article in The Atlantic, entitled, ``The Trump Administration's Flirtation With Holocaust Denial.''  He talks about ``'hardcore Holocaust denial.' In this type of rhetoric, anti-Semites argue that the Holocaust simply did not occur; that there was no systematic plan to destroy the Jewish people based solely on their religion.  ``This type of hate speech has unfortunately been espoused by those who seek to delegitimize the suffering of the Jewish people since the Holocaust began.''  But he talks about a more insidious form of denial in rhetoric that has begun to creep into our national discussion. Lipstadt terms this ``'softcore Holocaust denial.' This form of denial, argues Lipstadt, uses different tactics but has the same end-goal. . . . It does not deny the facts, but it minimizes them, arguing that Jews use the Holocaust to draw attention away from criticism of Israel. . . .  ``Softcore denial also includes Holocaust minimization, as when someone suggests it was not so bad. Softcore denial, then, is potentially more insidious than our traditional form of denial, by minimizing the suffering of the Jewish people and suggesting that while the Holocaust may have occurred, it was not just about the Jews per se.''  I appreciate those listening this evening and am very grateful to have this privilege of entering into the Record materials we believe important not only to our Republic, but to free people everywhere.  Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.
