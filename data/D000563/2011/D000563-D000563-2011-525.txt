President, very briefly, I have come to know Senator Rubio. We have early morning seminars, and we have come to know one another a little better. I hope that continues. But at this point, I especially thank him for that speech because it was clearly a speech with a lot of personal reflection on one's own life and on the life of America. What he said will endure. There are things in there that we all should remember about this Nation and about our responsibility as Senators.  I thank the Senator for that fine speech, and I am glad that I was here to be a witness to it.
