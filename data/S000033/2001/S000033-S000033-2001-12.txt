 Chairman, this is a very simple amendment to lower the cost of prescription drugs in this country. It is tripartisan and is cosponsored by the gentleman from California (Mr. Rohrabacher), the gentlewoman from Ohio (Ms. Kaptur), the gentleman from Texas (Mr. Paul) and the gentlewoman from New York (Mrs. Maloney).  When I first introduced a version of this amendment in 1996, it received 180 votes. Last year, however, it passed 313-109. There is a lot of support for this amendment in this body. I offer it tonight again in the hope that the Senate will agree favorably to it and begin to lower the price of prescription drugs developed with the taxpayers' money through the National Institutes of Health. This amendment is supported by organizations representing millions of American citizens, including Families USA, the Alliance for Retired Americans, the National Committee to Preserve Social Security and Medicare, and Public Citizen.  Mr. Chairman, over the years, the taxpayers of this country have contributed billions of dollars to the National Institutes of Health for research into new and important drugs, and that research money has paid off. It has worked. Between 1955 and 1992, 92 percent of drugs approved by the FDA to treat cancer were researched and developed by the NIH. Today, many of the most widely used drugs in this country dealing with a variety of illnesses were developed through NIH research, and that is very good news for all of us.
