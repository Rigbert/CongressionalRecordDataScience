 I also thank the Chair.  I must say, I came to this floor to speak for the fifth time about methamphetamine this morning. However, I happened to hear the preceding speakers, and I really want to identify myself with the comments just made by the Senator from North Dakota.  Even on this side of the aisle, there is legitimate difference about how much should be in the defense budget. I, for one, voted for more than the President put forward in his budget. I think that is legitimate, but I also think we should talk about it, and I think we should debate it.  However, it is clear to all of us, I think, that we are engaged in a military operation. Therefore, the lives of our pilots, of our men and women in the Armed Forces, and of innocent civilians are at risk.  I think during a military operation, an attack on the President, on the very policy that is determining that operation is, frankly, ill-advised, I think it is highly partisan, I think it could put American and other lives at risk, and, frankly, I think it is just plain tacky.  So I want to say that. I would be hopeful that during a time of some national emergency--and I think this operation does qualify--we can come together as Republicans and as Democrats to support the Commander in Chief of the United States of America, who happens to be the President, whether that President is Democratic or whether that President is Republican. I pledge as a Democrat that should the President be a Republican, I would do the same, because I think it is important.                          ____________________
