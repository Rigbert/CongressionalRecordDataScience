President, at the heart of most arguments against the funding structure provided under the FAIR Act are allegations that predictions about the number of claims expected to come to the fund have been underestimated. Over the past 5 years, the Judiciary Committee received extensive testimony from a variety of auditing companies, economic analysts and existing asbestos trusts about claims projections. Three years ago, a leading actuary with Tillinghast-Towers Perrin testified that ``$108 billion appears to be more than adequate'' while other firms estimated that $130 billion would be sufficient to cover the trust fund expenses.  It is not surprising that projections about future behavior vary from firm to firm because the assumptions are different. Some professional analysts have estimated that we will experience significantly less than $140 billion in claims and others have estimated that we will experience more.  Last week's document produced by some staff on the Budget Committee assumes that $160 billion will be paid out in claims based on a worst case scenario of one projection of claims activity.  The minority staff document circulated last week adopted claims projections plainly at odds with the experience of the Manville trust and without consideration for the medical criteria in S. 852. The overwhelming majority of nonmalignant claims paid by the Manville trust go to unimpaired claimants. The fund created by the FAIR Act would not compensate these claims, so this significant disparity must be taken into account.  The minority staff document also fails to account for the different medical criteria for malignant claims paid by the Manville trust. Thankfully, the CBO's estimate takes the FAIR Act's specific medical criteria into account when it considered its claims projections.  The CBO considered all relevant estimates and met with scores of stake-holders, financial experts, economists and auditors in determining whether the compensation provided for victims under S. 852 would be adequate. After years of analysis, they found that while victim compensation could range from $120 to $150 billion, its middle range estimate using its chosen claims projections would yield approximately $130 billion in claimant compensation, and that $140 billion, plus investment income, would be sufficient to cover all claims payments, administrative costs, and borrowing costs.  Of course opponents can seize upon worst case scenarios in an 11th hour attempt to scuttle this bipartisan legislation, but $130 billion in expected claims is the CBO's middle range and is provided for under our legislation.  Finally, opponents of this legislation contend that the fund will not actually receive $140 billion from the private companies obligated to contribute based on their previous asbestos expenditures. In his testimony before the Senate Judiciary Committee last Fall, then-CBO Director Douglas Holtz-Eakin clearly stated that: ``CBO projects that total receipts to the fund over its lifetime would amount to about $140 billion, including a small amount of interest earnings on its balances.''  The FAIR Act contains several provisions to ensure that the contributions will be collected through numerous enforcement provisions which provide the administrator with subpoena power and the ability to pursue punitive damages for nonpayment. In addition, our legislation contains a funding guarantee so that other companies will make up the difference if some companies are unable to pay their own contribution.  Even if the fund sunsets and victims are allowed to return to the tort system, the private companies are nonetheless required to continue to pay into the fund until all of the fund's obligations from borrowing costs and resolving victim claims are satisfied.  I understand that some of my colleagues have raised this budget point of order to sink the FAIR Act, but I urge them to consider the purpose of such budgetary mechanisms in light of the simple fact that we have created a privately financed structure that the Congressional Budget Office has estimated will not add to the Federal debt.  This point of order is a procedural mechanism intended to promote fiscal discipline. In light of CBO's explicit statement that ``CBO concludes that the legislation would be deficit-neutral over the life of the fund,'' no point of order should prevent such important, completely privately funded legislation as the FAIR Act.  This latest analysis from CBO reinforces the fact that the asbestos trust fund legislation would not add to the Government's Federal debt. The bottom line from CBO is that this bill is ``deficit-neutral.'' There is no reason to sustain the budget point of order. The FAIR Act is the right solution for victims and businesses. This bipartisan bill offers fair and efficient relief to long-suffering victims of asbestos exposure while providing business with financial certainty and an alternative to bankruptcy.  I recently received a letter from the International Association of Heat and Frost Insulators and Asbestos Workers. The workers represented by this union know first hand the devastation caused by asbestos, and I know they would hate to see the unique opportunity we have before us be destroyed by a technicality.  They wrote:       We believe S. 852 offers the best hope of providing fair      and equitable compensation on a national basis for those who      have suffered or will suffer from the devastating effects of      asbestos exposure in decades to come.       For these reasons, we urge you to reject the budget point      of order, which holds the potential to kill this legislation      that is so important to our members.  Let us not let down the very people we are seeking to help. I ask unanimous consent that the letter from the International Association of Heat and Frost Insulators and Asbestos Workers of February 13, 2006 be printed in the Record.  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in the Record, as follows:         International Association of Heat & Frost Insulators &            Asbestos Workers,                                    Lanham, MD, February 13, 2006.       Dear Senator: We write you to express our concern regarding      the budget point of order that is currently being considered      with respect to the Fairness in Asbestos Injury Resolution      (FAIR) Act, S. 852. It is frankly very troubling to see      critical legislation that impacts our members be imperiled by      a mere technical procedural motion.       The Fund at the heart of S. 852 is financed by private      dollars and it does not make sense to us that the legislation      could have any real impact in the U.S. budget. We urge you to      support waiving this false point of order so the Senate can      work on this important legislation.       We represent tens of thousands of members and retirees who      have been exposed to asbestos in the workplace.       We believe the current system is broken and must be fixed      for the current victims and the victims of the future. More      than seventy-five companies have gone into bankruptcy. What      is most disturbing to us is the fact that only 42 cents of      every do1lar spent goes to the victims, their widows, and      children.       We believe S. 852 offers the best hope of providing fair      and equitable compensation on a national basis for those who      have suffered or will suffer from the devastating effects of      asbestos exposure in decades to come.       We strongly support the FAIR Act. For these reasons, we      urge you to reject the budget point of order, which holds the      potential to kill this legislation that is so important to      our members. We believe to kill the FAIR Act on a      disingenuous technicality would be wrong and, as appalling as      the current system itself. Our members and their families      know the horrors of asbestos-induced disease and the      heartache associated with it. We also know that the problem      is not going away soon.       Senators Specter and Leahy along with many others have      worked extremely hard over the past three years to address      what almost everyone concedes is a national crisis.       Senators who oppose this Bill may vote against it in the      end, but the members of our Union (International Association      of Heat and Frost Insulators and Asbestos Workers Union)      deserve to see this bill put to a final vote.           Sincerely,     James A. Grogan,                                                General President.     James P. McCourt,                                      General Secretary-Treasurer.
