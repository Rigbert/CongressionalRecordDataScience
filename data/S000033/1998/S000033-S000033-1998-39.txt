 Chairman, I want to thank the gentleman from California for his support and for his eloquent remarks. I would just mention, Mr. Chairman, that in terms of the offset that we are talking about, fossil energy programs have received over $15 billion in 1995 dollars in Federal funding since 1974.  Maybe it is about time we pay attention to the counties and the small towns in California and Vermont.
