 President, today I am proud to recognize a remarkable woman who has been a constant presence in Hardin County for many years. Barbara Proffitt has meant so much to this community, and as she begins her long-awaited retirement, I would like to thank her for her decades of care and support.  For 30 years, Barbara represented Hardin Memorial Hospital as its community/guest relations coordinator. In her own description, she helps ``get the word out about the hospital,'' but for someone like Barbara, that meant a lot more than sitting behind a desk sending emails. Throughout Elizabethtown and the surrounding area, Barbara seemed to be everywhere, attending community meetings, special functions, and even driving the health group's car during parades.  Beyond her work at the hospital, Barbara supported her community and her neighbors in so many ways. Although she hasn't had a child attending North Hardin High School since the late 1970s, Barbara proudly continues to be the ``team mom'' of the boys' basketball team. Usually carrying bags of candy to share, she rarely misses a game and always seems to have a hug ready for every player, manager, and coach.  The close proximity between Barbara's home in Vine Grove to the U.S. Army installation at Fort Knox inspired another form of community work. Crediting her father's service in World War I and the service of her brother and husband in Korea, Barbara has made it her personal mission to support our Nation's men and women in uniform stationed at Fort Knox. She packs boxes of food for soldiers deployed overseas who are serving in Fort Knox's 1st Theater Sustainment Command. Barbara also bakes pecan pies for those at the installation, earning her the nickname she treasures: ``Pie Lady.'' Having tasted one of her pies myself, I can confirm just how delicious they are. Because of her longstanding generosity to those at the installation, Fort Knox awarded Barbara and her family with its Gold Neighbor Award. In her retirement, she has chosen to join a new mission called ``No Vet Dies Alone,'' providing comfort to our Nation's heroes in their final hours.  Barbara has also passed on her love of community service to her children,Rhonda and Blake. As the current mayor of Vine Grove, Blake credits his mom's passion for others as what helped inspire his decision to enter public service.  After her last day at Hardin Memorial Hospital, Barbara began a well-deserved vacation. When she returns, however, no one expects her to slow down too much. As a local columnist wrote when he heard about her retirement, ``For Barbara the word retire is a word, that's it. I am certain we still will see her around, everywhere we seem to go.'' I certainly hope we will. Today I am proud to join with the people of Hardin County in thanking Barbara Proffitt for taking care of so many in her community throughout the years. I ask my Senate colleagues to help me wish her a wonderful retirement.  Mr. President, the News-Enterprise in Elizabethtown recently published an article on Barbara's legacy of service to her community. I ask unanimous consent that a copy of the article be printed in the Record.  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in the Record, as follows:                [From the News-Enterprise, May 6, 2018]           Barbara Proffitt: One of Hardin County's True Gems                          (By Jeff D'Alessio)       The first time I saw Barbara Proffitt I was standing in a      hallway outside of the boys' basketball coaches office at      North Hardin High School after a game in 1988.       I stood there, probably with a notebook and pen in hand.      She stood there with candy bags in her hands--Tootsie Roll      Pops and gum.       She saw me and scooted closer and said, ``Are you the new      guy?'' I told her I was and best I can recall, now 30 years      later, she told me to be nice to her boys and to Ronnie--the      now legendary coach Ron Bevars.       And then she asked me if I wanted a Tootsie Pop and some      gum.       Then I would see her at road games and tournaments, candy      bags in tow, without fail, as was a hug for each player--star      player or bench warmer--plus the managers and coaches.       I wondered what the deal was with this woman showing up at      all these games with candy. The deal was this: That's who she      is--kind to the core.       She would cheer, and boo occasionally, at games and she      also was there to encourage and comfort. That's one of my      Barbara Proffitt stories.       Here's another one or two. Those who know her, have many.       If she likes a column I write, she calls me. If she      disagrees, she calls, I think she has once.       When our third granddaughter was born on New Year's Day      2017, she sat in the waiting room with my wife and me for a      few minutes wanting to know how everything was going.       She parted with a hug, as she so often does.       The next day, she was there with gifts when McKenna was the      first baby born for the year. Again, more hugs.       You see Barbara everywhere--dinners and parades, meetings      and announcements.       She has plenty of energy for someone of any age, and for      someone who gives and is on the go so much.       She has lived life at a quick pace and now it's time for      her to slow down as she ``retires'' from Hardin Memorial      Hospital after 30 years. For Barbara the word retire is a      word, that's it. I am certain we still will see her around,      everywhere we seem to go.       It is who she is. She's a doer, not someone who stands on      the sideline waiting for others to pitch in. I don't think      she could stand to be sitting there watching others do what      she is capable of doing.       When you talk about community gems in the people that make      Hardin County what it is, Barbara is near the top of the      list.       I remember Bevars telling me once she was as much apart of      his highly successful program as anyone he could think of.      She was there for her genuine love and concern for kids and      coaches.       When I heard Barbara was retiring, I have to admit, I      chuckled. I'm not sure how that word really applies to the      most involved person I know.       Whatever it will mean to her, I hope it starts with years      of good health and life fulfillment.       Aside from the Tootsie Pops, gum and hugs, there is much      more to learn from Barbara: Being nice and genuinely kind-     hearted are character traits that are hard to beat.       And you won't find many people, no matter where you go,      nicer than Barbara.                          ____________________
