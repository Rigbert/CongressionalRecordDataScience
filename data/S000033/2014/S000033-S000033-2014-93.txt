 I think his remarks were right on in terms of describing what is in this legislation. I support his appeal.  Look, everybody has an issue. Every time a bill comes up, I have my pet concerns that I could bring forth amendments on, Senator McCain has his. But what we are appealing to right now is if you have a way to improve this bill for our veterans, bring forth that amendment. But please, please, do not bring forward extraneous amendments. Let's focus on the needs of veterans. Let's not make them political footballs. I hope very much we can proceed in that direction.
