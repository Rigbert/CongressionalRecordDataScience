 President, today the Senate completed action on S. 949, the Revenue Reconciliation Act of 1997, legislation implementing the tax relief provisions from the historic bipartisan balanced budget agreement. I support this legislation because it does provide real tax relief and adheres to the balanced budget agreement, which we worked hard to achieve. American families need this tax relief and they need our continued commitment to a balanced budget.  I have listened to the concerns of many of my colleagues regarding this legislation and the benefits for working families. There is no disputing the fact that this legislation does benefit upper income families, but it also benefits working families and the tax cuts are not at the expense of vital, investment programs. I have heard a great deal about the inequities in this legislation and I supported the Daschle substitute which would have eliminated many of these inequities. But, I do think it is unfair to make the criticism without examining the entire balanced budget agreement and the tax relief adopted in 1993 for struggling, working families. The bottom line is that working families will benefit from estate tax relief, capital gains tax reductions, education investment tax credits, a per child tax credit and expanded IRAs.  Beyond taxes, my colleagues must remember that the balanced budget agreement was not only about tax relief, but it was also about helping working families by allocating additional resources for health care, education, environmental protection, and nutritional assistance. It also protected Social Security and Medicare for our Nation's senior citizens. Before weighing any inequities, let's make sure we examine the complete picture.  The balanced budget agreement, which this body adopted on June 5, 1997, calls for a significant investment in education. The agreement assumes additional Federal funding for important programs aimed at improving access to quality education for our children. I can assure my colleagues that working families will benefit from improved educational opportunities for their children. Quality education is one of the major priorities for many of the constituents that I talk to in Washington State. And again, there are education tax incentives which will help middle class working families who are facing escalating tuition and higher education costs. The Hope tax credits and the permanent extension of section 127 employer-provided educational assistance tax exemption are the kind of tax relief that my constituents have endorsed.  There is no doubt that this legislation can and should be perfected. We can work to target more relief to the middle class and I will be seeking these changes in conference. I am also hopeful we guarantee that these tax cuts do not result in an explosion in the deficit. I will not sit by and watch our deficit run out of control. When I first came to the Senate in 1993, the deficit was close to $300 billion annually. For 1997, the Congressional Budget Office has estimated that our deficit could be as low as $70 billion. This was not done without some pain and sacrifice. It is imperative that we stay the course and maintain a balanced budget well after 2002.  Now that the Senate has completed action on part II of the budget agreement, I sincerely hope that every effort will be made to correct the problems with S. 947, the spending reconciliation legislation. The Medicare provisions added by the Senate Finance Committee go well beyond protecting Medicare and will jeopardize access to health care for millions of low income senior citizens. I supported a balanced budget agreement that included constraints on spending and tax relief. It is imperative that we enact both parts of the bi-partisan balanced budget agreement, and I will be making every effort to improve S. 947 in conference and I will continue to oppose efforts that seek to undermine the historic, bipartisan balanced budget agreement.                          ____________________
