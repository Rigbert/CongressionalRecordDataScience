  What this amendment would do is essentially prohibit the Secretary of the Interior from expending appropriated funds to restrict, reduce or reallocate water supplies from the Central Valley Project and the California State Water Project. In essence, South Carolina is telling California how to handle its water issues.  To handcuff the Secretary of the Interior will essentially prohibit transfers between the State and the Federal water projects, which transfers are being done to facilitate additional water to go to a very needy farm belt in the great Central Valley of California. To put a prohibition on the Secretary to use any of the funds in this budget to reallocate or transfer this water is a mistake.  I urge a ``no'' vote, and I move to table.
