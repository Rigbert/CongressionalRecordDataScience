President, I rise today to introduce the Upper Connecticut River Partnership Act that will help bring recognition to New England's largest river ecosystem and help the communities along the river protect and enhance their natural, cultural and recreational resources. I am pleased to add Senators Jeffords and Gregg as original cosponsors of this bill.  For years, our offices and our States have worked together to help communities on both sides of the river develop local partnerships to protect the Connecticut River valley of Vermont and New Hampshire. This valley is a scenic region of historic villages located in a working landscape of farms and forests.  Citizens on both sides of the river know just how special this region is and have worked side by side for years to protect it. The two States came together to create the Connecticut River Joint Commissions, which help coordinate the efforts of towns, watersheds and other local groups to implement the Connecticut River Corridor Management Plan. This Plan has become the blueprint for how communities along the river can work together, with the States of Vermont and New Hampshire and with the Federal Government to protect the river's resources.  The Upper Connecticut River Partnership Act would help carry out the recommendations of the Connecticut River Corridor Management Plan and help communities along the river protect their cultural, natural and recreational resources. This Act would provide the Secretary of Interior with the ability to assist the States of New Hampshire and Vermont with technical and financial aid for the Upper Connecticut River through the Connecticut River Joint Commissions. The people living in the Upper Connecticut Watershed region would be able to learn about the river and be given knowledge on how to protect it. Also, the Act would assist local community efforts to continue cultural heritage outreach and education programs while enriching the recreational activities already active in the Connecticut River Watersheds of Vermont and New Hampshire.  The bill also will require that the Secretary of Interior establish a Connecticut River Grants and Technical Assistance Program to help local community groups develop new projects and build on existing ones to enhance the river basin. Over the next few years, I hope this bill will help bring new recognition to the Connecticut River as one of our Nation's great water resources.                                 ______                                       By
