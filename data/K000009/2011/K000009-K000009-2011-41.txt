Speaker, I rise to reluctantly support the Fiscal Year 2012 Appropriations Minibus.  Given current budgetary constraints primarily caused by unnecessary tax cuts for the rich, this bill generally reduces spending but provides additional resources for certain programs that will help create jobs.  For example, the Federal Highway Administration estimates that a $1 Billion expenditure on highway construction supports 30,000 jobs. The underlying bill provides nearly $40 Billion for highway construction.  However, the legislation also includes unnecessary riders that will allow corporate packers and processors to continue to manipulate the livestock market to the detriment of our farmers and ranchers.  Funding is withheld from USDA in this bill from implementing a set of Rules that would restore balance and fairness to the livestock marketplace.  Is it fair that the average chicken grower makes 34 cents per bird while the processing corporation makes $3.23 per bird and this Congress prevents the agency tasked with protecting farmers from doing its job?  It is my sincere hope that USDA implements what remains of the fairness Rule as soon as possible and enforces existing laws to protect farmers and ranchers from corporate abuses.  I urge my colleagues to support the Appropriations Minibus.
