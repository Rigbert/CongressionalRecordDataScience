 President, this amendment reinstates the President's international affairs budget to the number he called for, No. 1. No. 2, it has 34 cosponsors, evenly divided, Republicans and Democrats. Everyone from Senator Lugar to Senator Vitter and everyone in between has cosponsored this amendment.  No. 3, the point I would like to make is, Defense Secretary Gates, as well as 50 flag officers, represented by General Zinni and Admiral Smith, as well as our commanders in the field, all recognize we are spending $19 to $1--19 military dollars to every one civilian dollar we spend--to deal with international affairs. I will conclude by saying, when I was in Afghanistan last week, the commanding general made the comment the Taliban begins where the road ends.  I say to my colleagues this is critically important to our physical security to fund the international function because it is redevelopment money to go to Afghanistan.
