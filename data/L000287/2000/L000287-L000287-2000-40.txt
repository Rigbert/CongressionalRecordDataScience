Mr. Speaker, I rise today in opposition to the rule and permanent normal trade relations for China. We must stand up for human rights and democracy throughout the world. Where is the freedom of speech? Where is the freedom of assembly? Where is the freedom to organize? Where is the freedom to protest? Where is the freedom to pray? It is not in China. The people of China want to practice their own religion. They want to speak their mind. They want to live in a free, open, and democratic society. If we stand for civil rights and human rights in America and other places around the world, we must stand up for human rights in China and speak for those who are not able to speak for themselves.  Today with our vote we have an opportunity to speak for the dignity of man and the destiny of democracy. I urge all of my colleagues to oppose the rule and PNTR for China. It is not the right thing to do. It is not the right way to go. We are sending the wrong message. Let us stand up for human rights today.
