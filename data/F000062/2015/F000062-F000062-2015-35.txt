 President.  I wish to begin by thanking the chairman for his work on the bill.  For me, this has been a 6-year effort. It hasn't been easy. It hasn't been easy because we have tried to strike a balance and make the bill understandable so that there would be a cooperative effort to share between companies and the government.  Last Thursday the Senate showed its support for moving forward with two strong votes. We had a vote of 83 to 14 to invoke cloture on the substitute amendment, showing that there is, in fact, deep bipartisan support for moving significant legislation to the President's desk.  To that end, I ask unanimous consent that editorials from the two major U.S. newspapers be printed in the Record.  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in the Record, as follows:               [From the Washington Post, Oct. 22, 2015]      The Senate Should Take a Crucial First Step on Cybersecurity                          (By Editorial Board)       After years of failure to find a consensus on      cybersecurity, the Senate is expected to vote early next week      on a bill that would enable the government and the private      sector to share information about malicious threats and      respond to them more quickly. The legislation is not going to      completely end the tidal wave of cyberattacks against the      government and corporations, but passing it is better than      doing nothing--and that is where Congress has left the matter      in recent years.       The legislation, approved by the Senate Select Committee on      Intelligence on a bipartisan 14-to-1 vote in March, is      intended to iron out legal and procedural hurdles to sharing      information on cyberthreats between companies and the      government. Private-sector networks have been extremely      vulnerable, while the government possesses sophisticated      tools that might be valuable in defending those networks. If      threats are shared in real time, they could be blunted. The      legislation is not a magic wand. Hackers innovate destructive      and intrusive attacks even faster than they can be detected.      The information sharing would be voluntary. But the bill is      at least a first step for Congress after several years of      inconclusive debate over how to respond to attacks that have      infiltrated networks ranging from those of Home Depot to the      Joint Chiefs of Staff.       The biggest complaint about the bill is from privacy      advocates, including Sen. Ron Wyden (D-Ore.), who cast the      sole dissenting vote on the intelligence committee. His      concerns have been amplified recently by several tech giants.      Apple told The Post this week that it opposes the legislation      because of privacy concerns. In a statement, the company      said, ``The trust of our customers means everything to us and      we don't believe security should come at the expense of their      privacy.'' Some other large technology firms are also      opposing the bill through a trade association. Separately,      alarmist claims have been made by privacy advocates who      describe it as a ``surveillance'' bill.       The notion that there is a binary choice between privacy      and security is false. We need both privacy protection and      cybersecurity, and the Senate legislation is one step toward      breaking the logjam on security. Sponsors have added privacy      protections that would scrub out personal information before      it is shared. They have made the legislation voluntary, so if      companies are really concerned, they can stay away. Abroad      coalition of business groups, including the U.S. Chamber of      Commerce, has backed the legislation, saying that cybertheft      and disruption are ``advancing in scope and complexity.''       The status quo is intolerable: Adversaries of the United      States are invading computer networks and hauling away      sensitive information and intellectual property by the      gigabyte. A much stronger response is called for in all      directions, both to defend U.S. networks and to punish those,      such as China, doing the stealing and spying. This      legislation is a needed defensive step from a Congress that      has so far not acted on a vital national concern.                                  ____             [From the Wall Street Journal, Oct. 26, 2015]                     A Cyber Defense Bill, at Last         Data sharing can improve security and consumer privacy       By now everyone knows the threat from cyber attacks on      American individuals and business, and Congress finally seems      poised to do something about it. As early as Tuesday the      Senate may vote on a bill that would let businesses and the      government cooperate to shore up U.S. cyber defenses.       This should have been done long ago, but Democrats blocked      a bipartisan bill while they controlled the Senate and      President Obama insisted on imposing costly new cyber-     security mandates on business. The GOP Senate takeover in      2014 has broken the logjam, helped by high-profile attacks      against the likes of Sony, Home Depot, Ashley Madison and the      federal Office of Personnel Management.       Special thanks to WikiLeaks, the anti-American operation      that last week announced that its latest public offering      would be information hacked from the private email account of      CIA chief John Brennan. We assume Mr. Brennan's government      email is better protected, but then this is the same      government that let Hillary Clinton send top-secret      communications on her private email server.       Democrats have decided it's now bad politics to keep      resisting a compromise, and last week the Cybersecurity      Information Sharing Act co-sponsored by North Carolina      Republican Richard Burr and California Democrat Dianne      Feinstein passed the filibuster hurdle. A similar bill passed      the House in April 307-106.       The idea behind the legislation is simple: Let private      businesses share information with each other, and with the      government, to better fight an escalating and constantly      evolving cyber threat. This shared data might be the      footprint of hackers that the government has seen but private      companies haven't. Or it might include more advanced      technology that private companies have developed as a      defense.       Since hackers can strike fast, real-time cooperation is      essential. A crucial provision would shield companies from      private lawsuits and antitrust laws if they seek help or      cooperate with one another. Democrats had long resisted this      legal safe harbor at the behest of plaintiffs lawyers who      view corporate victims of cyber attack as another source of      plunder.       The plaintiffs bar aside, the bill's main opponents now are      big tech companies that are still traumatized by the fallout      from the Edward Snowden data theft. Apple, Dropbox and      Twitter, among others, say the bill doesn't do enough to      protect individual privacy and might even allow government      snooping.       Everyone knows government makes mistakes, but the far      larger threat to privacy is from criminal or foreign-     government hackers who aren't burdened by U.S. due-process      protections. Cooperation is voluntary, and the bill includes      penalties if government misuses the information. Before      either side can share data, personal information that might      jeopardize customer privacy must be scrubbed.       The tech giants are the outliers in this debate, while      nearly all of the rest of American business supports the      bill. The White House has said Mr. Obama will sign the      legislation, which would make it a rare example of bipartisan      cooperation. The security-privacy debate is often portrayed      as a zero-sum trade-off, but this bill looks like a win for      both: Helping companies better protect their data from cyber      thieves will enhance American privacy.
