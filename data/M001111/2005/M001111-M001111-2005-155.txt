 President, I thank the chairman for offering this amendment. The Kelo v. New London decision by the Supreme Court came as a great shock to many. The amendment being offered seeks to impose some meaningful limitations on the potential use of eminent domain with the funds provided in this act. I emphasize this provision is limited to the funds in this act and does not seek to overturn the Kelo decision. It merely ensures that funds appropriated for 2006 for the Department of Transportation and Housing are not to use eminent domain for projects that primarily benefit private interests.  I urge my colleagues to support this amendment. I thank the chairman of the committee for offering this critical amendment at this time.  I yield the floor.
