 President. I am sounding too much like a lawyer now. From a constitutional standpoint, whether they are asked or not is irrelevant. The only relevant constitutional point--and this is getting us off the point here, but the only relevant constitutional point is whether or not the Congress granted authority, asked for or not. That is the only relevant constitutional point.  With the Senator's permission, I would like to ask unanimous consentto print in the Record a legal brief which I have written on this point relative to the war powers clause and whether or not it is required and on the issue of whether or not there is the equivalency of a declaration of war by the consent of the Congress for the action specified.
