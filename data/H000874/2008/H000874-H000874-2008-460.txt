. ``Bud'' Doggett, Jr. Bud died last month, while Congress was out of session, but I want to take this moment to note how dearly he will be missed, and how many will miss him.  Bud was one of Washington's most successful businessmen, who turned a small parking company founded by his parents into a local business powerhouse. But he was far from content to simply enjoy his success; instead, he made himself into a vital civic leader, contributing immeasurably to Washington's development into a world-class city. Bud was born here in the District, and he always said he never crossed ``the Potomac Ocean'' unless absolutely necessary. Everyone who lives here is a beneficiary of his dedication to his hometown.  But to Bud, leadership meant service as much as it meant power. He learned the spirit of service in the European Theater of World War II, and he put it to work back home. Perhaps his most lasting accomplishment was the foundation of Heroes Inc., a charity that for the last 45 years has provided for the families of police officers and firefighters killed in the line of duty. As his wife, Cherrie Wanner Doggett, said at his funeral: ``What he most loved was watching his friends and the people he loved being happy. His pleasure in life was doing for others--especially when he knew he was helping someone who could never give him anything in return.''  Our community was blessed to have a servant-leader like Bud Doggett, for so long. He will be dearly missed.                          ____________________
