President, I appreciate the hard work of my colleagues in coming to agreement to proceed to final passage of this important legislation.  This bill has been a top priority of the Federal judiciary. I introduce it back in January, and it proceeded through regular order. We held a hearing, issued a committee report, considered floor amendments, and debated the measure.  Now it is time to vote for its passage. We can and we must provide for increased security for our Federal judges.  Physical attacks on our judges threaten not only the dedicated public servants who serve in these roles but also the institution. Our Nation's Founders knew that without an independent judiciary to protect individual rights from the political branches of Government, those rights and privileges would not be preserved. Our Federal courts are the ultimate check and balance in our system of government.  We owe it to our judges to better protect them and their families from violence to ensure that they have the peace of mind to do their vital and difficult jobs.
