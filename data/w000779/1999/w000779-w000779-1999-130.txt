I have felt that he has really gone to great lengths to try to ensure that this could be supported by every Member of the Senate.  Frankly, I feel about his proposal much like I do about the gag clause discussion. I think he and I have talked about this. I am probably a lot of things, but one of the last things I guess I would qualify as is an HMO basher. We have a lot of good managed care in my part of the United States. My hometown of Portland has the highest concentration of folks in HMOs in the United States. About 60 percent of the older people are part of a managed care program.  The distinguished Presiding Officer, Senator Smith, and I have worked together on a lot of these issues. Frankly, one of our big concerns is, we do offer a lot of good managed care. We end up getting the short end of the stick in terms of reimbursement. I think what the Senator is talking about with an ombudsman, much like gag clauses where people, of course, ought to be entitled to all of the information about their options, the ombudsman concept is much the same kind of approach to good government.  The Senator from Rhode Island has written this now so as to ensure it cannot result in litigation, that this specifically is designed to help consumers at the front end and bars litigation. I don't think the majority of the Senate is aware of that. The Senator from Rhode Island has indicated to this Senator and the Senator from Maine, Ms. Collins, who has been very interested in this issue over the years, who has done good work, that he wants to make sure we don't duplicate existing services.  I am happy to yield to the Senator.
