 President, today, Senator Lugar and I are introducing the Naval Vessel Transfer Act of 2007, a bill to permit the transfer of certain U.S. Navy vessels to particular foreign countries. All of the proposed ship transfer authorizations have been requested by the U.S. Navy, with the approval of the Office of Management and Budget.  Pursuant to section 824(b) of the National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 1994, as amended, 10 U.S.C. 7307(a), a naval vessel that is in excess of 3,000 tons or that is less than 20 years of age may not be disposed of to another nation unless the disposition of that vessel is approved by law enacted after August 5, 1974. The bill we are introducing today would provide that required approval for eight transfers: two guided missile frigates and two minehunter coastal ships for Turkey; two minehunter coastal ships for Lithuania; and two minehunter coastal ships for Taiwan.  The bill also contains provisions that are traditionally included in ship transfer bills, relating to transfer costs and repair and refurbishment of the ships, and exempting the value of a vessel transferred on a grant basis from the aggregate value of excess defense articles in a given fiscal year.  The authority provided by this bill would expire 2 years after the date of enactment of the bill.  Similar legislation was passed by the Senate last year, but was objected to in the House of Representatives because of concern regarding the proposal to transfer minehunter coastal ships. That issue was also raised by Members of the Senate Armed Services Committee, but members of that committee were persuaded by the Executive branch that the transfers would not degrade U.S. Navy capabilities. We invite interested colleagues to let us know if there is any residual concern among Members of the Senate, so that we can arrange for the Executive branch to brief members and determine if there is any objection to expeditious passage of this bill.  Finally, the Department of Defense has provided the following information on this bill:       This bill would authorize the President to grant transfer      five excess naval vessels to Turkey and Lithuania and to sell      three excess naval vessels to Taiwan and Turkey.       These proposed transfers would improve the United States'      political and military relationships with close allies. They      would support strategic engagement goals and regional      security cooperation objectives. Active use of former naval      vessels by coalition forces in support of regional priorities      is more advantageous than retaining vessels in the Navy's      inactive fleet and disposing of them by scrapping or another      method.       The United States would incur no costs in transferring      these naval vessels. The recipients would be responsible for      all costs associated with the transfers, including      maintenance, repairs, training, and fleet turnover costs.       This bill does not alter the effect of the Toxic Substances      Control Act, or any other law, with regard to their      applicability to the transfer of ships by the United States      to foreign countries for military or humanitarian use. The      laws and regulations that apply today would apply in the same      manner if this bill were enacted.       The Department of Defense estimates that the sale of these      vessels may net the United States $52.7 million in fiscal      year 2008.  I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be printed in the Record.  There being no ojection, the text of the bill was ordered to be printed in the Record, as follows:                                S. 1565       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of      the United States of America in Congress assembled,     SECTION 1.
