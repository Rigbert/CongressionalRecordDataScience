 I thank the Majority Leader for filing cloture on her nomination. She should have been confirmed several months ago but Republicans refused to consent to a vote on her nomination for no good reason.  Lydia was nominated on April 10 of this year. She had a hearing on June 4 and was reported out of committee by a unanimous voice vote on June 12. She is completely noncontroversial and exceptionally well qualified to serve on this court.  It should not have taken 6 days, let alone 6 months, for the Senate to approve her nomination. Despite this unnecessary delay, I am pleased that we finally ended the filibuster and will confirm her today.  Lydia has served on my Judiciary Committee staff since 2006 and currently serves as my chief counsel for Privacy and Information Policy. In this position, she has worked across the aisle on important legislation topromote accountability and transparency. Before coming to the Judiciary Committee she served on the Senate Ethics Committee.  I recommended Lydia to the President for this position because I know her intellect and good judgment will make her a fine judge. Before Lydia came to work in the Senate, she served in the Justice Department and tried several matters before the Court of Federal Claims. When she is confirmed, it will most certainly be the court's gain and the Judiciary Committee's loss.  I will miss her wise counsel and I wish her all the best.  Madam President, I yield back all time.
