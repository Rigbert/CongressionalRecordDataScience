 We did have a hearing on this and similar issues, and I did find common ground with folks on the other side of the aisle.  We had a vigorous debate over fuel reduction 13 years ago, which ultimately resulted in a law called HFRA,and I participated in writing that law here on the House side, very much a bipartisan law with myself and Mr. Miller on the Democratic side and Scott McInnis, John Shadegg, and Greg Walden on the other. And we gave this tool to the Forest Service, and they pretty much haven't used it. They've used it in very minor ways.  And at the hearing, I asked the Deputy Chief, What about HFRA? Do we really need to change the laws further or prevent--do these radical things like preventing appeals and litigation?  And he said, Well, no. We're moving ahead with a major, major landscape-scale collaborative process in the Black Hills.  I said, Well, that's great, Mr. Deputy. I said, How about all the rest of the intermountain West? How about central Oregon and other places where we need these sort of landscape-scale projects that can't be nitpicked, you know, acre by acre, but they are developed collaboratively and we move forward? And as I mentioned earlier, we can do them under stewardship contracts, which will attract investors who will utilize the biomass and lower the cost to the Forest Service.  There is a way to better do this. We need to push the Forest Service on these issues. If there are minor changes that need to be made in HFRA, they should let us know.  I believe one is that it doesn't allow for them to go into areas of bug kill, and that is something that should be fixed and was fixed in a bipartisan bill in the Senate, which we recommended, in part, in a Democratic alternative here which was offered in committee but not allowed on the floor because of scoring issues.  So I believe there is a way to move forward here and solve some of these problems, but this is not the proper way.  With that, I yield back the balance of my time.  The Acting CHAIR.
