President, I urge all Members to keep in mind the necessity to have a strong sense of history in whatever position they take on this matter. It is not something that is done for a 30-second spot on an ad, nor is it something that is done to determine the fate of any one of us in an election whether this year or subsequent years. Whatever we do affects the history and the course of the greatest democracy history has ever known.  In that regard, I believe Members will be wise to take the time to read an op-ed piece written by former President Gerald Ford from the New York Times on Sunday, October 4. After reading it, I was impressed enough to pick up the phone and call President Ford and speak to him at some length.  I had the privilege, when I was first a Member of the Senate, of serving with President Ford. I got to know him then. On many occasions in the 20 or so years since, I have been able to be with him or talk with him or seek his advice. I think what he says here is, again, very worthwhile. It may not be something that each Member would agree with. I find a great deal of merit in it. Again, President Ford speaks not only of the history involved, but of the country and of his own long experiences as a Member of the House. I commend every one of us to read President Ford's op-ed piece.  I ask unanimous consent that article be printed in the Record.  There being no objection, the article was ordered to be printed in the Record, as follows:                [From the New York Times, Oct. 4, 1998]                        The Path Back to Dignity                          (By Gerald R. Ford)       Grand Rapids, Mich.--Almost exactly 25 years have passed      since Richard Nixon nominated me to replace the disgraced      Spiro Agnew as Vice President. In the contentious days of      autumn 1973, my confirmation was by no means assured. Indeed,      a small group of House Democrats, led by Bella Abzug, risked      a constitutional crisis in order to pursue their own agenda.      ``We can get control and keep control,'' Ms. Abzug told the      Speaker of the House, Carl Albert. The group hoped,      eventually, to replace Nixon himself with Mr. Albert.       The Speaker, true to form, refused to have anything to do      with the scheme. And so on Dec. 6, 1973, the House voted 387      to 35 to confirm my nomination in accordance with the 25th      Amendment to the Constitution.       When I succeeded to the Presidency, in August 1974, my      immediate and overriding priority was to draw off the poison      that had seeped into the nation's bloodstream during two      years of scandal and sometimes ugly partisanship. Some      Americans have yet to forgive me for pardoning my      predecessor. In the days leading up to the hugely      controversial action, I didn't take a poll for guidance, but      I did say more than a few prayers. In the end I listened to      only one voice, that of my conscience. I didn't issue the      pardon for Nixon's sake, but for the country's.       A generation later, Americans once again confront the      specter of impeachment. From the day, last January, when the      Monica Lewinsky story first came to light, I have refrained      publicly from making any substantive comments. I have done so      because I haven't known enough of the facts--and because I      know all too well that a President's responsibilities are, at      the best of times, onerous. In common with the other former      Presidents, I have had no wish to increase those burdens.      Moreover, I resolved to say nothing unless my words added      constructively to the national discussion.       This much now seems clear: whether or not President Clinton      has broken any laws, he has broken faith with those who      elected him. A leader of rare gifts, one who set out to      change history by convincing the electorate that he and his      party wore the mantle of individual responsibility and      personal accountability, the President has since been forced      to take refuge in legalistic evasions, while his defenders      resort to the insulting mantra that ``everybody does it.''       The best evidence that everybody doesn't do it is the      genuine outrage occasioned by the President's conduct and by      the efforts of some White House surrogates to minimize its      significance or savage his critics.       The question confronting us, then, is not whether the      President has done wrong, but rather, what is an appropriate      form of punishment for his wrongdoing. A simple apology is      inadequate, and a fine would trivialize his misconduct by      treating it as a more question of monetary restitution.       At the same time, the President is not the only one who      stands before the bar of judgment. It has been said that      Washington is a town of marble and mud. Often in these past      few months it has seemed that we were all in danger of      sinking into the mire.       Twenty-five years after leaving it, I still consider myself      a man of the House. I never forget that my elevation to the      Presidency came about through Congressional as well as      constitutional mandate. My years in the White House were      devoted to restoring public confidence in institutions of      popular governance. Now as then, I care more about preserving      respect for those institutions than I do about the fate of      any individual temporarily entrusted with office.       This is why I think the time has come to pause and consider      the long-term consequences of removing this President from      office based on the evidence at hand. The President's      harisplitting legialisms, objectionable as they may be, are      but the foretaste of a protracted and increasingly divisive      debate over those deliberately imprecise words ``high crimes      and misdemeanors.'' The Framers, after all, dealt in eternal      truths, not glossy, deceit.       Moving with dispatch, the House Judiciary Committee should      be able to conclude a preliminary inquiry into possible      grounds for impeachment before the end of the year. Once that      process is completed, and barring unexpected new revelations,      the full House might then consider the following resolution      to the crisis.       Each year it is customary for a President to journey down      Pennsylvania Avenue and appear before a joint session of      Congress to deliver his State of the Union address. One of      the binding rituals of our democracy, it takes on added      grandeur from its surroundings--there, in that chamber where      so much of the American story has been written, and where the      ghosts of Woodrow Wilson, Franklin Roosevelt and Dwight      Eisenhower call succeeding generations to account.       Imagine a very different kind of Presidential appearance in      the closing days of this year, not at the rostrum familiar to      viewers from moments of triumph, but in the well of the      House. Imagine a President receiving not an ovation from the      people's representatives, but a harshly worded rebuke as      rendered by members of both parties. I emphasize: this would      be a rebuke, not a rebutal by the President.       On the contrary, by his appearance the President would      accept full responsibility for his actions, as well as for      his subsequent efforts to delay or impede the investigation      of them. No spinning, no semantics, no evasiveness or blaming      others for his plight.       Let all this be done without partisan exploitation or mean-     spiritedness. Let it be dignified, honest and, above all,      cleansing. The result, I believe, would be the first moment      of majesty in an otherwise squalid year.       Anyone who confuses this scenario with a slap on the wrist,      or a censure written in disappearing ink, underestimates the      historic impact of such a pronouncement. Nor should anyone      forget the power of television to foster indelible images in      the national memory--not unlike what happened on the solemn      August noontime in 1974 when I stood in the East-Room and      declared our long national nightmare to be over.       At 85, I have no personal or political agenda, nor do I      have any interest in ``rescuing'' Bill Clinton. But I do      care, passionately, about rescuing the country I love from      further turmoil or uncertainty.       More than a way out of the current mess, most. Americans      want a way up to something better. In the midst of a far      graver national crisis, Lincoln observed, ``The occasion is      piled high with difficulty, and we must rise with the      occasion.'' We should remember those words in the days ahead.      Better yet, we should be guided by them.
