Mr. Speaker, today, I am introducing comprehensive legislation--The Lyme Disease Initiative of 1998--to jump start a world-class, coordinated campaign to fight Lyme Disease. This $100 million federal initiative will, for the first time, establish a prominent, coordinated federal role in Lyme Disease research, treatment, and education. Various agencies within the federal government have done some good work in the Lyme issue, but these short term efforts have been hampered by a lack of interagency coordination, inconsistent funding and limited agency staff attention. The Lyme Disease Initiative changes all that.  Five year plan of action.--First, my bill calls for a 5 year plan to be established by the Secretary of Health and Human Services in coordination with the Secretary of Defense and outside experts to advance the treatment of and a cure for Lyme Disease. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, the National Institutes of Health, various agencies within the Defense Department have all worked on Lyme disease. Too often, however, the left hand does not know what the right hand has discovered and true advancement is hampered.  For example, in 1994 I pushed through a provision directing the DOD to conduct $850,000 in Lyme Disease research. Tick borne diseases remains a continuing concern for DOD, particularly with many of our soldiers at risk of tick bites. Regrettably, much of DOD's valuable research under this study never made its way to our other health experts at the Department of Health and Human Services. My new legislation will correct this problem.  Four public health goals.--Sadly much of our Lyme research has been hit and miss with no clear cut goals and no specific purpose for federal expertise and resources. My bill sets out four critical public health goals that will advance the Lyme research efforts:  Goal #1: Develop an objective detection test for Lyme that can determine whether an individual bitten by a tick has Lyme Disease. Designates a reliable detection test as the single most important public health goal.  Goal #2: A review of CDC's reporting and surveillance systems. Among the changes to be considered are (1) a more uniform system of reporting and (2) collecting and analyzing Lyme case data that does not currently meet CDC's strict surveillance criteria.  Goal #3: More accurate and timely Lyme diagnosis. A study shall be initiated to examine patterns of diagnosis and treatment of patients.  Goal #4: Physician Education. A full-scale effort shall be taken to educate treating physicians on how to properly diagnose and treat Lyme Disease.  Other major provisions in the bill include:  Section 4. Establishing a Lyme Disease Taskforce to provide advice and expertise to Congress and federal agencies on all areas of Lyme Disease policy.  Section 5. Requiring Annual Reports be submitted to Congress on the progress of NIH, CDC, and DOD with respect to the goals and programs funded and specified in this bill.  Section 7. $100 Million Over Five Years. An authorization of $100 million over five years is needed to ensure sufficient resources for consistent, critical scientific, medical research. The bill authorizes: $45 million in additional authorization for the National Institutes of Health, $40 million in additional authorization for the Centers for Disease Control, and $15 million in additional authorization for the Department of Defense.  Section 8. Lyme Disease Vaccines. The bill urges the Food and Drug Administration to conduct a rapid and thorough review of new Lyme Disease vaccine applications so that people who are already suffering are given new hope.  I am joined today by Rep. Jim Maloney (CT), Rep. Mike Pappas, Rep. Jim Saxton, and Rep. Sam Gejdenson in urging the relevant Committees to give this bipartisan legislation its due consideration. On the Senate side, I am pleased that Sen. Chris Dodd will be introducing the companion legislation to my bill.  For too long, Lyme patients have suffered and languished under a medical system that cannot meet their needs because of unreliable diagnostic tests and incomplete physician understanding of this emerging infectious disease. My legislation will turn the tide and enable people to fully enjoy the outdoors once again without the fear of contracting a very serious disease.                          ____________________
