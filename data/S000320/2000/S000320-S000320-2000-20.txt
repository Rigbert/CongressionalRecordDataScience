 President, I want to take a minute or two and talk about my colleague from Nevada, Senator Bryan. He is going to be leaving the Senate soon. As the vice chairman of the committee--a long-term and long-time member of the Senate Intelligence Committee--he has been a delight to work with most of the time. Seriously. He puts a lot of effort into what we do on the Senate Intelligence Committee.  I would be remiss if I did not bring that up as we pass this bill tonight. We have a conference to go to. We will be spending a lot of time together in the waning days of this Congress. Dick Bryan served this country well, first as a State legislator, as the attorney general of his State, as the Governor of his State, and in two terms in the U.S. Senate. I have worked with him on a lot of issues, and I can say this: He is a hard worker, he is smart, he is going to be prepared, he is going to be tough, and he is going to put the Nation first.
