A dedicated and selfless individual, Don has enthusiastically served the public for the past 33 years.  Don's career has served as an example of the definition of ``public servant'' and could be added to any dictionary listing.  Don has served Michigan citizens in a wide variety of significant roles, including 11 terms as a member of the Michigan House of Representatives, 3 of which he served as the chairman of the Appropriations Committee. Don has also served on the Kalamazoo County Board of Commissioners, as Michigan's lottery commissioner, as Governor John Engler's budget director, and most recently, as Kalamazoo County's Administrator. His services to Kalamazoo County and to the State of Michigan are truly commendable.  As my good friend retires, he closes one chapter of his inspiring career and embarks on a new phase of his life. I am confident that this retirement is far from the end of Don's public service and that he will remain committed to the citizens of our great State and community. Don's humor and kind heart will be greatly missed by his colleagues. I wish Don all the best in retirement.                          ____________________
