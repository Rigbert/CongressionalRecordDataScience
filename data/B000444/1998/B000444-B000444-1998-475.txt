 President, I want to take a few minutes this afternoon to address the urgent need for IMF funds, to restore confidence to a fragile international financial system and to maintain a leadership role in the world economy.  I am pleased to see that the Appropriations Committee has moved quickly this week to provide funding for continued U.S. participation in the IMF--both for the new arrangements to borrow that represent the emergency reserves of the fund, and for the quota increase to restore the IMF's ability to meet potential new demands on its resources.  The current news from Asia--declining U.S. exports, the threat of increased imports, a more fragile international banking system--has brought home to us the importance of international cooperation to prevent the outbreak and spread of financial crises. It also reinforces the need to move quickly to restore the IMF's ability to contain the current crisis and to maintain the IMF's ability to respond to future problems.  That is why I am concerned about some of the conditions put on the IMF funds in the Appropriations Committee on Tuesday. Treasury Secretary Rubin, who, along with Federal Reserve Chairman Greenspan has repeatedly reminded Senators of the need for quick action on these funds, has called those conditions--and I quote: ``Impractical to the point of being unworkable.''  This is no way to treat funds that are needed to restore the equilibrium of the international financial system, and to no way maintain the leadership of the United States in the world economy.  The International Monetary Fund was created by us at the end of World War II to maintain the stability of the international financial system. Today, its task as the lender of last resort in the kinds of meltdowns we have seen in Asia is by no means simple.  With the rise of market economies among the developing nations of the world, and with the expansion of the international financial system--both developments that promote the long-term interests of the United States--the task of the IMF has become increasingly difficult.  I am not here today, Mr. President, to argue that the IMF is a perfect institution; in fact, our own Treasury, under the leadership of Secretary Rubin, has used its substantial influence to push for important reforms, to open the IMF to greater public understanding and trust. Secretary Rubin is also working with his counterparts around the world to reform the workings of the international banking system to reduce the risk of crises such as one we watch today in Asia with great concern.  As the leader in the world's economy--indeed as the model economy which the rest of the world aspires to emulate--we in the United States have a special role to play in helping to sustain the health of the international economy. By maintaining our position in the IMF--by paying our dues and maintaining our dominant position there--we will remove lingering doubts in financial markets that make recovery and reform in Asia harder to achieve.  And, as the most open economy in the world, we have the greatest stake in maintaining the stability of international trade and finance. The longer we leave the issue of our IMF commitment in doubt, the more our own farmers, workers, and manufacturers will lose overseas sales.  I want to remind my colleagues that our contributions to the IMF don't cost American taxpayers a dime. Like deposits in a credit union of our own making, our contributions are matched by interest-bearing assets, and we cancall for the return of those contributions if we choose. For those reasons, those contributions have no impact on our Federal deficit--or the surplus we now enjoy.  With the outcome of the Asian crisis still to be determined, with the world looking to us for the leadership that will restore confidence to private sector investors, we must act quickly and decisively to maintain the strength of the IMF--and to maintain our own dominant voice within the IMF. We should not make demands of the IMF that could delay indefinitely the day when private financial markets regain the confidence that will mark the turning point in the current financial crisis.  That is why I am pleased that my friend and colleague on the Foreign Relations Committee--chairman of the International Economic Policy Subcommittee--Senator Hagel, has taken the lead in introducing legislation authorizing funds for the IMF with workable, sensible reforms. Together with Senator Grams on our committee, and Senators Roberts, Chafee, and Domenici, Senator Hagel has provided us with an important point of reference when we consider IMF funding here on the Senate floor.  And I hope that will happen soon. Right now, there is no guarantee that we will take up the urgent issue of IMF funding at any time this year. Failure to act, and to act soon, would be irresponsible. It would expose the United States as vacillating, indecisive, and unable to lead in a time when what is needed most is leadership and commitment to restore confidence and stability to a shaken financial system.  Similarly, it would be irresponsible to add unrelated, highly charged issues to the consideration of what are clearly urgently needed funds for the IMF.  Mr. President, I am confident that in the end, the United States Senate will respond to the current challenge with both the decisiveness and good judgment that must characterize the actions of a great Nation in time of crisis.  I look forward to working with all of my colleagues to make that faith a reality.                          ____________________
