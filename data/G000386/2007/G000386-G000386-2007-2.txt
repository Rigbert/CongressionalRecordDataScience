 President, I yield myself such time as I may consume. I haven't had a request on this side for many people to speak. I think I will speak for 9 or 10 minutes on my side. If people want time, I will be glad to yield time.  When we were debating the Tax Relief Act of 2005, the other side forced a series of debates on the same subject matter. We had the same debate three times, and it culminated on Groundhog Day, February 2, 2006. Despite numerous votes and debates in each round, we went through essentially the same debate and vote not once or twice but three times.  I have two charts that will remind folks of that exercise.  My first chart depicts a groundhog. For those of you who see the groundhog, you will recall that the centerpiece of that debate involved the alternative minimum tax patch. During the first groundhog debate, the bipartisan majority had to prove that we meant business on the cornerstone of that bill, which was the last AMT patch that was enacted. I am referring to the AMT patch that protected then about 15 million families, and now we are talking about protecting about 23 million families.  The bipartisan majority, I am pleased to remind everybody, stuck to our guns in conference on that bill. We made sure the AMT patch was one of the cornerstones of the conference agreement. So despite the extended debate, what we said would happen did happen.  Now, the next Groundhog Day is February 2, 2008. That is just 45 days from now. That may seem like a long time, but given recent history, I am worried. Here is why.  About 47 days ago, the two tax-writing committee chairmen, Congressman Rangel and Senator Baucus, and the ranking members, Congressman McCrery, and this Senator, wrote Secretary Paulson and acting IRS Commissioner Stiff and pledged to get an AMT patch bill to the President before the end of the year. We wrote the letter for a couple of reasons. The first reason is to spare 23 million middle-income families from an average tax increase of $2,000 per family. As everyone now agrees, this monster tax was not meant to hit 23 million middle-income families. The second reason was to assure the Secretary of the Treasury and the IRS Commissioner that we would do everything possible to minimize delays in refunds for another 27 million families and individuals, on top of the 23 million who would be hit for the first time.  After pledging to get mutually agreeable AMT patch legislation to the President in a form he could sign--that is what the letter was about--we are instead now engaged in this Groundhog Day type of exercise. We are essentially having the same debate, and we will go through the same votes the Senate went through just a couple of weeks ago. In other words, the floor debate tonight illustrates my worry that we are repeating the Groundhog Day exercise.  I ask unanimous consent to have printed in the Record a copy of that letter by the two chairmen and ranking members.  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in the Record, as follows:                                Congress of the United States,                                 Washington, DC, October 30, 2007.     Ms. Linda E. Stiff,     Acting Commissioner, Internal Revenue Service, Washington,          DC.       Dear Acting Commissioner Stiff: Under present law, more      than 23 million taxpayers will be subject to higher taxes in      2007 unless legislation is enacted to limit the reach of the      Alternative Minimum Tax (AMT). We realize that this fact is      causing concern for many taxpayers and is creating      administrative difficulties for the IRS as the agency      prepares for the upcoming filing season.       As the leaders of the Congressional tax-writing committees,      we want to assure you that legislative relief is forthcoming      so that no new taxpayers will be subject to the AMT for      taxable year 2007. To accomplish this, we are committed to      extending and indexing the 2006 AMT patch with the goal of      ensuring that not one additional taxpayer faces higher taxes      in 2007 due to the onerous AMT. In addition to allowing the      personal credits against the AMT, the exemption amount for      2007 will be set at $44,350 for individuals and $66,250 for      married taxpayers filing jointly.       We plan to do everything possible to enact AMT relief      legislation in a form mutually agreeable to the Congress and      the President before the end of the year. We urge the      Internal Revenue Service to take all steps necessary to plan      for changes that would be made by the legislation.       Thank you for your immediate attention to this matter.           Sincerely yours,     Max Baucus,       Chairman, Committee on Finance.     Charles E. Grassley,       Ranking Member, Committee on Finance.     Charles B. Rangel,       Chairman, Committee on Ways and Means.     Jim McCrery,       Ranking Member, Committee on Ways and Means.
