 President, reserving the right to object to the Senator's request, families should have access to simple, straightforward information so they can make the food choices that are right for them.  I was very glad to see that after 7 years of delays and foot-dragging, 7 years of objections from Republicans who didn't want to allow this commonsense law to be fully implemented, in May of this year, we finally saw this law implemented--by a Republican administration, no less. Yet, today, before us now is a proposal--however well intended it may be--that would take us backward.  This bill would undermine nutrition labeling. It would punish businesses along the way that have already fully implemented the law and would carve out an entire category of businesses from providing labeling in their stores. It would bar the FDA from conducting the oversight we all count on it to do. It would weaken consumer protectionsas well as protections for States and localities.  Frankly, why? This is a solution in search of a problem. Restaurants across this country are already providing labeling, and the FDA has made it clear that it intends to work with, not against, businesses in implementing the law. Furthermore, many States and localities have required caloric labeling for years, and not one restaurant chain has been sued.  So I am going to keep advocating for families being able to have access to clear, transparent nutrition information.  I object.
