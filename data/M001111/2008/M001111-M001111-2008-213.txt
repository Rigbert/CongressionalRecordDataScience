 President, last Friday I stood on the floor of the 767 line with workers in Everett, WA, who have put their hearts and their souls into making Boeing airplanes. I was there as those workers learned that after 50 years--five decades--the Air Force no longer wants them to build its refueling tankers. I saw the dismay in their eyes when they learned their Government is going to outsource one of the largest defense contracts in history to the French company Airbus. It was devastating news for Boeing, for American workers, and for America's men and women in uniform.  Today, those workers are frustrated, and they are angry, not only because the tanker contract would mean 44,000 new American jobs in 40 States, including 9,000 in my home State of Washington; they are frustrated and angry because their Government let them down.
