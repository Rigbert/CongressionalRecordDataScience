President, last Thursday, after Senators had been informed that there would be no more votes that day and after I had already headed for home to Vermont, Republicans came to the floor to propose a narrow procedural device in connection with the Republican juvenile crime bill, S.10.  No one had advised me that the Senate Republican leadership planned to proceed to S.10 on Thursday. After a year of inaction on this bill--which was voted on by the Judiciary Committee in July 1997--the Republicans did not even seek a response to their proposal. Instead, they rushed to the floor in ambush fashion.  The failure of this Congress to take up and pass responsible juvenile crime legislation does not rest with the Democrats, and no procedural floor gimmick by the Republican majority can change that fact.  Over the past year, I have spoken on the floor of the Senate and at hearings on several occasions about my concerns with this legislation. At the same time, I have expressed my willingness to work with the Chairman in a bipartisan manner to improve this juvenile crime bill.  I am not alone in my criticisms and in wanting to see changes in this bill. It has been blasted by virtually every major newspaper in the United States. The Philadelphia Inquirer concluded that the bill ``is fatally flawed and should be rejected.'' The Los Angeles Times described the bill as ``peppered with ridiculous poses and penalties'' and as taking a ``rigid, counterproductive approach'' to juvenile crime prevention. The St. Petersburg Times called the bill ``an amalgam of bad and dangerous ideas.''  The bill has also been criticized by national leaders ranging from Chief Justice Rehnquist to Marian Wright Edelman, President of the Children's Defense Fund.  In May, the Chief Justice criticized S.10 because it would ``eviscerate this traditional deference to state prosecutions, thereby increasing substantially the potential workload of the federal judiciary.'' Earlier in the year, the Chief Justice raised concerns about ``federalizing'' certain juvenile crimes, noting that ``federal prosecutions should be limited to those offenses that cannot and should not be prosecuted in the state courts.''  The National District Attorneys Association (NDAA) and other law enforcement agencies have also written me with their concerns about this bill. In May, William Murphy, President of the NDAA, expressed NDAA's serious concerns about parts of S.10, including the fact that ``S.10 goes too far'' in changing the ``core mandates'' which have kept juveniles safer and away from adults while in jail for over 25 years. Mr. Murphy also criticized S.10's new juvenile record keeping requirements as ``burdensome and contrary to most state laws.'' He further noted that S.10 failed to provide ``any lee way to give juveniles a second chance by providing for the option to seal or expunge records.''  I have also heard from numerous State and local officials across the U.S., including the National Governors' Association, the Council of State Governments (Eastern Regional Conference), the U.S. Conference of Mayors, the National Association of Counties and the National Conference of State Legislatures. All of them have expressed concerns about the restrictions this bill would place on their ability to combat and prevent juvenile crime effectively. Last June, the President of the National Conference of State Legislatures cautioned that the new mandates placed on the States by S.10 could ``imbalance the constitutionally designed relationship between the federal government and the states.''  He further noted that ``[s]tates handle crime in a more flexible and more responsive manner than the federal government'' and urged the Senate not to impose a single ``federal `fix' upon all fifty states and the territories.''  In short, S.10 as reported by the Judiciary Committee is a bill laden with problems--so much so that, at last count, the bill has lost a quarter of its Republican cosponsors since introduction.  The unanimous consent agreement proposed by the Republicans would limit debate of juvenile justice and other crime matters. Ironically, it would permit the Republicans to offer a substitute to their own bill, but not allow Democrats the same opportunity. The only additional amendments in order under their plan would be five on each side.  When the Judiciary Committee Chairman indicated on the floor that the minority has had the text of the proposed Hatch-Sessions substitute for ``well over a month,'' he was incorrect. In fact, we only got a copy of the substitute on the same day that the Republicans proposed their unanimousconsent agreement and had not had an opportunity to review it.  While I appreciate that we are short of time in this Congress and that, consequently, the Republican leadership would like to limit the number of amendments the Democrats may offer, I must point out that the Hatch-Sessions substitute alone contains substantial changes to over 160 separate paragraphs of this reported bill.  While I do not believe that Democrats will have close to 160 additional amendments to the bill, I believe that we will want to offer more than five.  We are continuing to pare down the amendments that Democrats plan to offer to S.10 to address the substantial criticisms leveled at this bill. We are continuing to negotiate in good faith on a unanimous consent agreement to ensure that Senate consideration of this legislation is fair, full and productive. The attempted ambush at the outset of this process, however, suggests that the Republican leadership is more interested in placing blame for its inaction than in actually moving to consideration of the bill.                          ____________________
