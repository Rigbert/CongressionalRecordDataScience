 President, I yield myself 1 minute. I appreciate the commitment of the Senator from Utah to extending the research and experimentation credit. There is no question the issue of research and experimentation has no greater supporter than the Senator from Utah and all the people involved with it ought to appreciate his interest in it.  I know the R credit has strong bipartisan support and that it was included in the President's request.  I ask the Senator give us the time to work with him on the amendment today and see what we can do to make sure it becomes something we can work with and deal with in conference.  I yield the floor.
