 President, the horror of September 11, 2001, is still very fresh in our minds. This day will always be a sad one for Americans.  It also has become a day of solemn pride as we remember the tremendous heroism and self-sacrifice of so many in New York, at the Pentagon, and on a plane over Shanksville, PA.  Later this morning, the Senate will take time to remember, and it is fitting that we do so. It is fitting that we should pause as a body and as a nation to remember the victims and their families, as well as the heroes, and to remind ourselves of the dangers we still face.  Mr. President, I yield the floor.                          ____________________
