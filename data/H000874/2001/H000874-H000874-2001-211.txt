Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.  Mr. Speaker, I have one additional speaker, the distinguished representative from Texas who has the distinct honor of succeeding Barbara Jordan and Mickey Leland in representing their district of Texas.  Barbara Jordan was one of the most compelling and articulate voices on behalf of the Constitution of the United States and the principles that it set forth.  Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the gentlewoman from Texas (Ms. Jackson-Lee).
