 President, for the information of all Senators, tomorrow the Senate will be in a period of morning business, and when the reconciliation bill is received from the Finance Committee, the Senate will proceed to its consideration. Amendments are expected to be offered to the bill, and a late night is expected. Senators who wish to engage in the debate or to offer an amendment to the bill are encouraged to work with the bill managers so we can move forward in an orderly and efficient manner.  For the remainder of the week, the Senate will complete action on the jobs/growth bill, and also consider both the bipartisan global HIV/AIDS bill and the debt limit legislation. In order for the Senate to complete action on these measures, late nights and rollcall votes should be expected throughout the entire week. I therefore advise my colleagues to make the necessary scheduling arrangements.
