 President, on another matter, the new Republican Senate has been working hard to get Congress back to work over the past year. We have obviously had a lot of success. As I noted yesterday, the new Republican Senate will soon pass two very significant bipartisan bills for a second and final time: the bipartisan multiyear highway bill and the bipartisan replacement for No Child Left Behind. We will send them to the President for his signature.  These are the latest examples of a new Congress that is back to work on behalf of the American people. They are hardly the only examples we will be talking about. Take another important issue that languished for too long but passed the new Senate: cyber security. By a vote of 74 to 21, we ended years of Senate inaction on this issue by passing an important bipartisan cyber security bill that even the White House has endorsed. That bill was the product of a lot of hard work by the top Republican and the top Democrat on the Intelligence Committee. I am glad that the new, more open, and more inclusive Republican Senate made their cooperation possible because even though the old forces of gridlock tried to trip that bill up several times along the way, we kept moving forward, and we always knew we were doing the right thing for the American people.  My hope is that we can ultimately get this bill into conference and send it to the President closer to its current form because the challenges posed by cyber attacks are real and they are growing. A cyber attack can be a deeply invasive attack on personal privacy. The voluntary information sharing provisions in the bill we passed are key to defeating cyber attacks and protecting the personal information of the people we represent.                          ____________________
