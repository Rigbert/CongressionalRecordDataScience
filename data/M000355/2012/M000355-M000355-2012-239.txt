 President, I rise today to pay tribute to the dedication and devotion shown by a group of men and women to their local community. The longstanding services of the Bush Volunteer Fire Department in Laurel County, KY, has been on the cutting edge of rural and volunteer fire departments in the State of Kentucky since the department's beginnings in 1975.  What is so inspiring about the individuals in the Bush VFD is that despite the obstacles placed before them, they have always persevered and prevailed. While the men and women of the department have experienced many successes and accomplishments, I think it is safe to say that these individuals feel that their biggest achievement is the opportunity to serve and protect their fellow citizens in the face of danger.  The Bush Volunteer Fire Department was conceived of by a group of 13 local men who saw a flaw within their community. At the time, the Laurel County Fire Department presided over the Bush community, but the LCFD was over half-an-hour away. The 13 men in Bush decided that the LCFD was just too far away, and for the safety of their citizens, it was time to assemble a firefighting unit closer to home. The LCFD donated a 1947 K-model International fire truck, and just like that, the Bush Volunteer Fire Department was born.  Since the beginning of the department, the men and women at BVFD have sought to become the best that they could possibly be, by implementing new and innovative practices at each and every turn in the road. In less than a year since their start in 1975, the department had secured funds to develop a fire station to house its truck and equipment. Bush VFD was also the third rural volunteer department in the Commonwealth of Kentucky to receive a Class 7 rating from ISO.  In 2011, the department began a junior firefighter program to enlist the help of eager youth in the community in a safe and beneficial way. In 2011, BVFD also enlisted its first female member, Whitney Minton, who joined in alongside her father Rick. These changes, and others, have assisted the Bush Volunteer Fire Department in attaining much of the success it knows today.  I am encouraged by the passion for service of the men and women firefighters and EMTs of the Bush Volunteer Fire Department. Former Bush Chief Ernest Rudder has had the pleasure of following in his father's footsteps, Birchell L. Rudder, in working in the fire house. Ernest's son Marc joined the ranks once he had reached the proper age, and now his son Noah is anxious to be the fourth generation of Rudders to enter firefighting. The Bush Fire Department is truly a family affair for families like the Rudders.  I wonder if those 13 men who took it upon themselves in 1975 to enact change in their community ever thought their dream of a volunteer fire department would become such a huge success. Although this story is common in our country, let us not go without recognizing those who set themselves apart in pursuit of a better future, like those in the Bush community.  Mr. President, at this time I would like to ask my colleagues in the United States Senate to join me in paying tribute to the outstanding service of the many volunteers over the course of the lifetime of the Bush Volunteer Fire Department.  There was recently an article published in the Sentinel-Echo: Silver Edition, an eastern Kentucky local periodical magazine, highlighting the many years of service given by the Bush Volunteer Fire Department. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that said article be printed in the Record.  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in the Record as follows:                [From the Sentinel-Echo: Silver Edition]                          They Answer the Call                            (By Sue Minton)       Imagine waking in the middle of the night with your home      engulfed in a sea of black smoke, or out for an afternoon      drive when you spot a cloud of smoke billowing from a distant      hillside. The first call you make is to the county dispatch.      Pagers buzz in pockets and on tables of volunteer      firefighters, summoning them to their stations. And they      always come.       Members of the Bush Volunteer Fire Department have been      answering these calls for almost 37 years.       In April 1975, 13 men from the Bush community met at      Providence Baptist Church for the purpose of organizing a      fire department to protect the lives and property within      their community.       The reason for starting the department, according to Dennis      Minton, charter and current board of trustees member, was--     ``The Laurel County Fire Department was responding to calls      in the county. It could be as long as 30 minutes from the      time they received the call until they arrived at the scene      (in the old Bush community). By this time, in most cases, the      structure was on the ground or fully involved. The residents      needed and deserved better protection within their      community.''       A fire department was organized and they received their      first truck before they found a home.       ``The Laurel County Fire Department donated the department      a used 1947 K-model International,'' said Ernest Rudder,      charter member and captain. ``Because we didn't have a      building, the truck was parked at different firemen's      homes.''       With fundraising and donations, in less than a year a two-     story building was constructed off east Ky. 80 on Ky. 1803      adjacent to the ``old'' Bush School. To repay a proposed      loan, in May of 1976 the fire department proposed a tax rate      of .08 cents per $100 on real-estate property. Today, that      tax rate has been lowered to .0570 cents. The primary purpose      of the loan was to pay for fire hydrants and dry hydrants,      which were installed throughout the district.       This move paved the way for the district to receive a Class      7 rating from ISO. ``We were the third rural volunteer      department in the Commonwealth of Kentucky to be granted this      rating,'' Rudder said. ``This move also substantially lowered      insurance rates for some homeowners.''       Under the leadership of its first chief, Kenneth Smith      (1975 to 1984), the department grew in manpower and      equipment. But, at 3:43 a.m. on June 20, 1984, members of the      fire department responded to a blaze at the last place they      would have expected their own station.       Daybreak found the firefighters still on the scene, and the      realization was sinking in they had lost their building and      all their equipment.       The loss of the building was a major blow for the firemen      and the community, but the Bush residents were never without      fire protection. Other departments in and outside the county      volunteered their service and equipment.       ``One of the trucks brought to the fire by Laurel County      Fire Department stayed until we got a new truck,'' Rudder      said. ``Bell County Fire Department also sent a tanker for us      to use.''       In January 1985, the community and county were invited to a      dedication and open house for the newly rebuilt fire station.       The new station grew both in size and membership from 13      charter members without a fire truck or station into a roster      of 42 active volunteers, seven of whom are EMTs; three Class      A pumpers; and two tankers.       Bush Fire Department proudly protects more than 10,000      people living in an area of 35 square miles and operates out      of two stations--Fire Station No.2, opened in 1993, is      located on east Ky. 80 in the Lick Fork community.      ``Congressman Hal Rogers gave the dedication address,''      Rudder said.       Six chiefs were elected to command the department over the      years; the current is Phillip Williams, and the longest      serving chief was Don Minton (1999 to 2010).       The fire chiefs, along with their men, have one thing in      mind: ``to serve and protect the Bush community.'' And this      they are doing by continuing their training and recruiting      new members.       In 2011, the department initiated a junior firefighter      program.       Also in 2011, Whitney Minton became the first female member      of the department, joining her father, Rick, a sergeant.       In volunteer fire departments, and for many in close-knit      rural communities, it is natural that one generation would      follow the next on the department roll.       And it was a given that Marc Rudder would follow in the      footsteps of his father, Ernest Rudder.       Marc Rudder knew that he would grow up to become a      firefighter. ``Being able to watch the firefighters help the      people of the community in their time of need played a major      role in the factor of me wanting to be a fireman,'' Marc      Rudder said.       ``I feel that the fire department is something that I have      always known,'' he added. ``I always played `fireman' as a      child. I did not know childhood without the fire department.      I got to play with small toy fire trucks and big real fire      trucks.''       ``Yes, he has been interested in all things fire or EMS      since he was just a small child,'' Ernest Rudder added.      ``Like he said, his first toys were fire trucks, ambulances      and police cars. It is just natural that he would want to be      a firefighter.''       ``Marc was with me at the fire department meetings from the      time he was a small boy.'' he added. ``He was around the      volunteers and he learned as we did.''       At that time, the fire department didn't have a junior      firefighter program, so Marc could not join the department.      But by the time he was 16 years old, he was taking classes      with the other firemen. ``When he could `officially' be on      the roster, he was ready to be certified with his required      150 hours of training,'' his father said.       ``One of my first jobs was as an EMT with Ambulance Inc. of      Laurel County,'' Marc Rudder said. ``And I feel this was due      to the influence the fire department had on me.''       His exposure to the volunteers at Bush Fire Department has,      in a round-about way, given him that experience that is now      his life's career.       Rudder, who is the State Fire Rescue Training Area 13      Coordinator with the Kentucky Fire Commission, said the      knowledge he learned at the Bush Fire Department has helped      him each day in his job.       ``I feel that coming from a volunteer department serving a      rural community has a great benefit over many other people      that I work with across the country.''       He coordinates an office that provides training and      assistance to 67 fire departments in eight counties in      southeastern Kentucky. His office is also an assisting agency      to the fire departments in the area for any information that      they might need to better serve their communities. Rudder has      studied at the National Fire Academy in Maryland and also      serves on committees across the region, state, nation, and      world.       The fourth generation of the Rudder family, Noah, can't      wait to follow in the footsteps of his great-grandfather,      grandfather and father.       His great-grandfather, Birchell L. Rudder, was an original      member of the board of trustees, being elected in 1975,      elected chairman of the board of trustees in 1979, and served      as chairman until 1996, but remained on the board until his      death in 2002.       Noah Rudder, a seventh-grader at North Laurel Middle      School, has been coming to the Monday night meetings like his      father, Marc, for a long time. He is just waiting until he is      old enough to become a junior firefighter.       ``I like to go to the fire department because I know all      the people and they are like family to me. And I enjoy      learning about firefighting and seeing the equipment,'' he      said.       ``Incidentally, Noah is an authority on all things having      to do with 9/11,'' his grandfather added.       Also, Noah's aunt, Dawn, and her husband, Frank Kilby, are      members of the Laurel County Volunteer Fire Department.       ``The department is comprised of members from all walks of      life and everyone brings something to the table,'' Ernest      Rudder said. ``During an emergency, we are all business. We      are a department of friends and neighbors. But we are always      willing to welcome another member.''       ``We like what we do. We volunteer our time to help people      when they need it. It's giving back to the community. And the      department has an excellent relationship with the community.      They visit schools to present fire-safety programs, allow      children to climb onto their fire trucks, and participate in      local parades and other civic functions.''       From its earliest beginnings, the Bush Volunteer Fire      Department has realized the importance of training for this      most hazardous job. Proper training ensures that the best      interests of the citizens are being served and they are able      to return to the station without the life of a firefighter      being harmed or lost.       Requirements for being a certified firefighter in Kentucky      are the same, but Bush requires each member to obtain at      least 20 additional hours of training a year.       ``Many of the members are certified or currently obtaining      emergency medical technician training, which requires more      training every two years,'' Marc Rudder said.       ``This training will enable the EMTs to provide medical      care to the community and assist the EMS agency.''       Because of the extensive training Bush Fire Department      members receive, they hold the honor of being five-time      Kentucky Firefighter Olympic Champions, having won the title      in 1989, 1990, 1991, 1992, and 1993. The team retired      undefeated.       ``Firefighters have become more aware of the dangers of      being firefighters, EMS workers and police officers since 9/     11,'' he continued. ``Many new training requirements have      come about since Sept. 11, 2011, and I believe the people who      want to be firefighters realize the dangers and the great      responsibility that being a firefighter entails. I imagine      all the     fire departments have gotten better and train harder because      of 9/11.''       Every firefighter is by law a ``peace officer'' and duty-     bound to report anything unseemly they come across.       In the post-9/11 world we live in today, firefighters are      expected to do even more to safeguard the lives of residents      in their districts. They must be able to address all hazards,      not just fires.       As ``first responders,'' firefighters can provide      information to emergency-response agencies that have not yet      arrived on the scene. They can determine the situation and      decide what resources are required, whether it be an      ambulance, law enforcement, hazmat team, or an arson      investigator.       House fires kill and injure thousands yearly, and cost many      more their valued possessions and memories.       ``The activity report for 2011 has Bush Volunteer Fire      Department responding to 102 calls,'' Ernest Rudder said.      ``Thankfully, only nine were structure fires. We had several      grass fires and about five or six vehicle fires. The vast      majority of our calls these days are to assist Ambulance Inc.      of Laurel County with automobile accidents or to answer and      investigate residential smoke or fire alarms.''       Rudder said it would be hard to designate the most      dangerous fire the department had responded to over the      years. ``But the Blackwater Church fire was really big with a      roof collapse. The big fires in the city of London that we've      assisted with and the fires at Chaney Lumber were big and      dangerous. We've never had anyone seriously hurt, but      recently, on a mutual-aid fire with Laurel County, two of our      men were knocked down when the garage doors and ceiling fell      on them. Luckily, there were several other firemen there who      pulled them to safety.''                          ____________________
