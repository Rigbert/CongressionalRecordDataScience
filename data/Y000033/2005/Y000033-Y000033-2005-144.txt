Mr. Speaker, if the gentleman will yield, it is my understanding this is a simple extension of 2 days until midnight, Thursday coming, and that, in fact, there will be monies to run the Department; and it is also my understanding that there will be some monies, 2 days' worth, disbursed to the States. This is not our idea; this was at the Senate's insistence. This is an attempt, for those who may be just now listening, to finalize the TEA-LU bill, the transportation bill.  The agony that the gentleman and I have gone through in the last 34 days is something that I do not want to write about. Maybe we should have been stationed at Guantanamo; it would have made it a lot easier. But we are very close now to a solution, and this is an attempt again to keep the pressure on and make sure we do finalize thisThursday night so we can have a transportation bill that will do a partial job for the Nation, better than what we have, but not nearly as good as we need. Maybe in the future we will get everything we want.
