President, I have heard from schoolteachers and I have had heard from parents and doctors and day care providers and advocates for children around the Nation. Many of them have called me because, during the past 20 years as chairman of the Senate Committee on Agriculture, Nutrition, and Forestry, I have been intimately involved with almost all nutrition legislation in this country.  Certainly, during the last dozen years, there has not been any piece of nutrition legislation that has passed the Congress and has been signed into law by the President that has not either been authored by me or cosponsored by me.  I have heard from many Vermonters, from dietitians, dairy farmers, the Governor of Vermont, and volunteers of Vermont food shelves. They feel worried and betrayed. They want welfare reform; they want able-bodied adults to work, as do I. But they do not want to see hunger return in this country with a vengeance.  They do not want to see a country, blessed as no other nation on Earth has ever been blessed with its ability to produce food, have millions of hungry Americans. And they do not want the Contract With America. They believe the Contract With America is antichild and antifamily, and so do I.  The Contract With America is good for big corporations, for huge tax cuts for the rich, and for special interests. I thought we ought to see who are the top 10 winners under the Contract With America. So I put together a chart that explains the top 10 winners.  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that two lists of winners and losers, under the Contract With America, be printed in the Record.        Top 10 Winners During the First 100 Days of the Contract       10. The Coca-Cola Company and the Pepsi Cola Company--soft      drinks instead of milk could be served with school lunches.      Children and dairy farmers, in contrast, are very big losers.       Pepsi is a big winner since its Taco Bell and Pizza Hut      subsidiaries could take over school lunch programs, and other      fast food companies are not far behind.       9. Pesticide manufacturers--the chemical giants stand to      make millions of dollars with planned cuts in federal      regulations that protect the environment. I hope families      that drink water in rural areas like the taste of alachlor,      atrazine, and cyanazine.       8. Criminals--Republicans plan to stop the President's      efforts to put 100,000 new police officers on the streets.      All communities who would have gotten those new officers will      be big losers.       In Houston, violent crimes have been reduced by 17 percent      because of cops on the beat; in New York City, community      policing has cut violent street crimes by 7 percent.       7. Four drug giants--the House bill could transfer up to      $1.1 billion to infant formula manufacturers by eliminating      the requirement that infant formula be bought at the best      price for the WIC program.       Current competitive bidding procedures keep 1.5 million      pregnant women, infants and children on WIC at no additional      cost to taxpayers. Those up to 1.5 million infants, women and      children are losers under the House bill.       6. Locksmiths--funding for child day care is slashed, which      means that low-income mothers who want to work may have to      let tens of thousands of kids stay home by themselves.       5. Water and air polluters, unwholesome meat and poultry      packers--House Republicans plan to cut regulations that      protect the environment, air quality, water quality and food      safety.       Families that breath air, drink water and eat food are the      big losers.       4. Large corporations--corporations will enjoy huge tax      loopholes (such as eliminating the alternative minimum tax      which will give corporations $35 billion over 10 years),      defense conglomerates will make large profits, and meat and      poultry plants will not have to worry about selling      contaminated meats since that will be allowed.       3. The wealthiest 12 percent of Americans--over half the      benefits of the tax breaks in the Contract With America go to      the wealthiest 12 percent of Americans, those earning over      $100,000 a year.       In contrast, children do not vote and have been targeted      for the worst cuts by the Contract With America. Included in      the list of Federal funding slashed or totally eliminated is      funding for: disabled children, food for homeless children      living in emergency shelters, day care for the children of      low-income parents who want to work, food for children in      over 150,000 day care homes, summer jobs and food service      programs, PBS children's programs, and other programs for      children.       2. Lawyers--lawyers will make a fortune exploiting all the      environmental, tax, and worker protection loopholes in the      Contract.       The Republicans create 101 new ways for lawyers to delay      environmental, health and food safety regulations.       1. Anyone making over $349,000 a year--the House Republican      proposals give the wealthy an average tax break of $20,362      through huge capital gains tax cuts, estate tax breaks for      the wealthy, and corporate tax loopholes. In addition, U.S.      billionaires who renounce U.S. citizenship will be given huge      tax writeoffs--$3.9 billion worth over the next 10 years.       These tax entitlements for the rich, and for corporations,      are provided while cutting aid to children, to low-income      students who want to stay in college, and to the national      service program that provides college scholarships.                                                                    ____        Top 10 Losers During the First 100 Days of the Contract       10. Newborn children--the Contract throws up to 1.5 million      pregnant women, infants and children off the WIC program,      threatens to make millions go hungry, and provides for major      funding cuts for programs that help disabled children,      children in child care and homeless children.       9. Children who drink tap water--the House delays      regulations that protect drinking water from being      contaminated with dangerous chemicals.       8. Children who breathe--the House bill hampers clean air      protections which will especially hurt more vulnerable      populations such as children.       7. Children who need child care--child care food program      funding is cut in half which will likely throw over 150,000      day care homes off the program.       6. Children with mothers who work--the Contract slashes      funding for child care for low-income parents who are trying      to stay off welfare, get off welfare, or find a job.       5. Children with fathers who work--the Contract eliminates      the safety net for families when they most need help during a      recession. Benefits to millions of children could be      significantly cut during hard times.       4. Children who go to school--funding for educational      programs for grade school and secondary schools, funding for      the Learn and Serve Program, and funding for AmeriCorps      college scholarships is slashed.       3. Children who eat hamburgers--The House bill delays rules      on food safety for at least one year. These rules are      designed to prevent foodborne illness outbreaks like the one      that killed several children in Western states in 1991.       2. Children who are not rich--House tax cuts for wealthy      Americans and corporations will make it more difficult to      balance the budget, our children will have to pay the bill      [[Page S5169]] later, and low-income children will lose      benefits immediately.       1. Children who eat--The House welfare bill will take food      away from hundreds of thousands of infants, homeless children      and school children. It says to them ``have a hungry day,''      especially during recessions.
