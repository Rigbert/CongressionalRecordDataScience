 President, I am compelled to address the Senate this evening because one of our country's most dynamic, innovative, and successful companies, Microsoft, has been the subject of an unfair and prejudicial target by anonymous sources in the Department of Justice.  I am concerned that every time I pick up a newspaper I am informed of new information about the ongoing, supposedly confidential proceedings involving Microsoft and the Department of Justice. I ask only for fairness and that whatever verdict is derived, is argued through proper judicial channels and not played out through our nation's media.  Some of you in this Chamber may say that Microsoft can speak for itself, that is has a voice loud enough to be heard. To that, I answer that no single voice is ever enough to speak over the Department of Justice and those anonymous few employees who are seemingly abusing its formidable power. When the integrity of such a profound legal proceeding is in jeopardy, however, no one should remain silent.  In the Antitrust Division's extended, intense scrutiny of Microsoft, the company has faithfully worked to comply with each of the Division's request. Microsoft has fully cooperated with the seemingly endless requests for documents and depositions of top executives. Microsoft has operated under the assumption that if it works with the Justice Department in a fair manner and complies with its requests, then the Justice Department will proceed with its investigation fairly. But, I question whether the Justice Department is indeed playing fair.  Over the past several months, the Antitrust Division appears to have repeatedly and continually disclosed to the media information uncovered during its investigation, and floated anonymous opinions regarding the likelihood of a new government antitrust case against the company.  To me, putting America's technological leader on trial in the press--before the prosecutor even decides if a trial in our court system should proceed--is wholly unfair.  The Justice Department's own ethics manual says that, I quote: ``It is the policy of the DOJ and the Antitrust Division that public out-of-court statements regarding investigations, indictment, ongoing litigation, and other activities should be minimal, consistent with the Department's responsibility to keep the public informed. Because charges that result in an indictment or a civil action should be argued and proved in court, and not in a newspaper or broadcast, public comment on such charges should be limited out of fairness to the rights of individuals and corporations and to minimize the possibility of prejudicial pre-trial publicity.''  Based on their comments to the media, however, attorneys at the Justice Department apparently disagree with their own ethics manual. For example in a February 9, 1998 New York Times article entitled ``Microsoft Case May Be Prelude to Wider Antitrust Battle'' a ``senior Justice Department official'' who ``spoke on condition that he not be identified'' said, ``licensing arrangements and the pricing of deals that Microsoft strikes . . . for placement on the front screen of its Windows operating system or its Internet Explorer browser'' are an ``area of antitrust concern'' for the Antitrust Division.  The Wall Street Journal has apparently been given similar exclusive insight into a possible case. On April 6, 1998, the Wall Street Journal published an article entitled ``U.S. Closes in on Microsoft; Officials Think Evidence Supports a Broad Charge on Extending Monopoly.'' In it, the author quotes ``people close to the probe'' who stated that ``investigators believe they have enough evidence to bring a new antitrust case against Microsoft.'' Those sources are so familiar with the investigation that they told the reporter that an antitrust complaint would ``repeat an existing charge that Microsoft violated a 1995 antitrust settlement . . . extending to Windows 98 last fall's charge that Microsoft uses Windows as a weapon against business rivals.''  I regret to say this, and sincerely hope I turn out to be wrong, but I expect that the Justice Department will deny that one of its own lawyers is the source ``close to the probe.'' I say ``expect'' because Attorney General Reno does not appear to be looking into this matter, nor has she informed me that the matter has been resolved. In fact, the Practicing Law Institute has advertised that a senior Justice Department counsel would speak about ``[the Antitrust Division position . . . on the ongoing Microsoft matter'' at an upcoming Intellectual Property Antitrust conference currently scheduled for July 22-23, 1998.  Mr. President, how does this public speaking engagement by a DOJ attorney square with the Department of Justice's own ethics manual, which states, and I quote again, ``public out-of-court statements regarding investigations, indictments, ongoing litigation, and other activities should be minimal?'' How does it square with the ethics policy that says, ``public comment on . . . charges should be limited out of fairness to the rights of individuals and corporations and to minimize the possibility of prejudicial pre-trial publicity.'' I sincerely hope that DOJ staff has been advised against this by Attorney General Reno, but I cannot be sure.  Just yesterday, I learned that on May 8th, Business Week plans to publish on its website an article with the quote, ``sources familiar with the Justice Department case have laid out a detailed plan of attack against [Microsoft].'' Who would be able to lay out such a detailed plan about the Department's expected action in the case other than the DOJ itself?  It is of utmost importance that the Justice Department end this media trial of Microsoft, and restore a thorough and fair process. Today, I have again asked the Attorney General to explain her failure to resolve this matter.  Microsoft's innovations benefit thousands of companies, employees, shareholders and millions of consumers. With so much innovation and economic growth, and with so many jobs lying in the balance, the least the Department of Justice can do if it proceeds with its investigation is to do so in a fair, professional and ethical manner.  Mr. President, I yield the floor.                          ____________________
