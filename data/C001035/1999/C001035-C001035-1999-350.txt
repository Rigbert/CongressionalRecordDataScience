Res. 167       Whereas the unusual underwater topography and tidal      activity of Georges Bank create an almost self-contained      ecosystem, unique within the ocean that surrounds it;       Whereas Georges Bank is one of the most productive      fisheries in the world;       Whereas people of both Canada and the United States harvest      cod, haddock, yellowtail flounder, scallops, lobsters,      swordfish, and herring from Georges Bank;       Whereas significant economic sacrifices have been made by      fishermen from both Canada and the United States to work      toward sustainable and healthy fish stocks;       Whereas hundreds of small communities in New England and      the maritime provinces of Canada depend on fish from Georges      Bank for economic support and their maritime-based way of      life;       Whereas an oil spill on Georges Bank would have      catastrophic effects on the Georges Bank ecosystem and the      economies of the coastal communities of New England and the      maritime provinces of Canada;       Whereas Georges Bank experiences some of the most severe      weather in the world, and the frequent storms, strong      currents, and high winds would cripple any post-spill cleanup      effort;       Whereas many scientists, fishermen, and other persons      concerned with and knowledgeable about the unique ecosystem      of Georges Bank have urged the Government of Canada to extend      the moratorium on oil and gas activity;       Whereas the Georges Bank Review Panel issued a report      recommending an extension of the moratorium on oil and gas      activity; and       Whereas the Government of the United States has established      a moratorium on oil and gas activity in Georges Bank until      the year 2012: Now, therefore, be it       Resolved, That the Senate--       (1) commends the Georges Bank Review Panel on the recent      report recommending extension of the moratorium on oil and      gas exploration on Georges Bank;       (2) commends the Government of Canada for extending the      moratorium on oil and gas activity on Georges Bank through      1999; and       (3) urges the Government of Canada to extend the moratorium      until the year 2012.
