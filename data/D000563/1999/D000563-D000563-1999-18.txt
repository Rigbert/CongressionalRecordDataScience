It is outrageous. In Illinois, of course, we are faced with similar demands. If you want to buy television time, you have to raise money. If you can't write a personal check for it, you have to go out and beg for it.  Members of the Senate and House of Representatives who spend their time on the telephone begging for money from individuals and special interest groups are not using their time to represent people in Congress. They are, frankly, unfortunately bringing an element into this political process that is not positive. And the voters know this.  Interestingly enough, since 1960, we have seen a dramatic increase in spending on Presidential election campaigns, for example. And we have seen a dramatic decline in voter turnout and the number of people who participate. Voters have decided to vote with their feet and stay home. They are sick of the negative advertising. They are sick of the special interest groups. They are sick of the fundraising involved in this. And they are sick of the process. In a democracy, you can't stand that very long because if democracy is going to work, people have to be involved in it. And that means cleaning up our acts. When Senators Feingold and McCain came forward with campaign finance reform, 55 Senators--45 Democrats, 10 Republicans--said we agree, at least with respect to eliminating soft money. We should go forward with reform.  The Senator from Nevada, though, points to another problem: Even eliminating soft money will not eliminate the expense of campaigns, until we find a way to put legitimate candidates on the television without the extreme costs they run into now.
