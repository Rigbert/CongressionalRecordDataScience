 Take the most conservative cost for California, $7 billion; 7-year bill, $1 billion a year, most of it coming from Los Angeles County, let us say $500 million a year. California is a proposition 13 State. This all has to come from general assistance. General assistance is locally funded. Los Angeles cannot raise its property tax rate under proposition 13.  How does the county fund it? The county cannot fund it. This will force, if the county is to fund it--this will force the reduction of other county programs. It could be the sheriff, it could be the jail. There is no way around it. The dollars are too big.  The distinguished chairman of the committee indicated that the savings, by taking all legal immigrants off of all benefits, is $18 billion. What we are telling you is we know 52 percent of this comes from California. Therefore, if California is a prop 13 State and it presses the local jurisdictions and they are funded by property taxes and they cannot raise their property taxes and they cannot say ``legal immigrants, leave the country and go home,'' it is a real catch-22 for the local government.  If I might, just quickly, ask unanimous consent to have printed in the Record a letter dated July 17 from the Democratic floor leader of the California Assembly and President pro tempore of the California Senate; and a memorandum from the California State Association of Counties.  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in the Record as follows:                                           California Legislature,                                                State Capitol,                                    Sacramento, CA, July 17, 1996.     Hon. Dianne Feinstein,     U.S. Senator, Hart Senate Office Building,     Washington, DC.       Dear Senator Feinstein: We write to convey major concerns      raised by the most recent proposed welfare reform legislation      currently being considered by Congress.            services for aged and disabled legal immigrants       Denying federal benefits to legal immigrants      disproportionately harms California communities. Over 230,000      non-citizen legal immigrants currently receive SSI in      California, excluding refugees. This aid is provided to the      aged, blind and disabled, who could not support themselves by      going to work if their SSI benefits ended. Under HR 3507, SSI      and Food Stamps would be denied to non-citizens already      legally residing in California as well as to new legal      entrants unlike the immigration reform legislation currently      under consideration in Congress, which permits continued      benefits for existing legal residents.       The proposed bar on SSI and Food Stamps for all legal      immigrants, and the denial of other federal means-tested      programs to new legal entrants for their first five years in      the country would have a devastating effect on California's      counties, which are obligated to be the providers of last      resort. It is estimated that these proposed changes would      result in costs of $9 billion to California's counties over a      seven-year period. At a minimum, the very elderly, those too      disabled to become citizens and those who become disabled      after they arrive in this country should be exempted from the      prohibition on SSI--if for no other reason than to lessen to      counties the indefensible cost of shifting care from the      federal government to local taxpayers for a needy population      admitted under U.S. immigration laws.                        protection for children       While we agree that welfare dependence should not be      encouraged as a way of life, it is essential in setting time      limits on aid that adequate protections be provided for      children once parents hit these time limits. Some provision      must be made for vouchers or some other mechanism by which      the essential survival needs of children such as food can be      met. The Administration has suggested this sort of approach      as a means of ensuring adequate protection for children whose      parents hit time limits on aid.       California's child poverty rate was 27 percent for 1992      through 1994, substantially above the national rate of 21      percent. HR 4, which was vetoed by the President, would have      caused an additional 1.5 million children to become poor.      Though estimates have not been produced for HR 3507, it is      likely that it also would result in a significant additional      number of children falling below the poverty level.                    adequate funding for child care       Funds provided for child care are essential to meet the      needs of parents entering the work force while on aid and      leaving aid as their earnings increase. For California to      meet required participation rates, about 400,000 parents      would have to enter the work force and an additional 100,000      would have to increase their hours of work. Even if only 15      percent of these parents need a paid, formal child care      arrangement, California will need nearly $300 million per      year in new child care funds.       Thank you for your consideration of these concerns. If your      staff have any questions about these issues, they can contact      Tim Gage, at (916) 324-0341.           Sincerely,     Bill Lockyer,       President pro tempore, California Senate.     Richard Katz,       Democratic Floor Leader, California Assembly.                                                                    ____                                      California State Association                                                  of Counties,                                    Sacramento, CA, July 15, 1996.     To: California Congressional Delegation.     From: Mike Nevin, CSAC President.     Re Welfare reform legislation.       I am writing once again to bring to your attention a very      important issue involving the impact of the welfare reform      bill on local government. As I understand it, the Congress      plans to submit a new welfare reform bill to the President      that does not contain Medicaid reform. However, the bill will      still contain measures which pose serious and substantial      cost shifts to local government including drastic health care      costs.       The measures, H.R. 3507 and S. 1795, propose to eliminate      SSI and food stamps to legal immigrants including those      already legally residing in California. In addition, it would      eliminate future immigrants from eligibility for 50 to 80      federal programs for five years and disqualifies those same      immigrants from these programs until citizenship. The fiscal      effect of these provisions would be to drain $23 billion of      federal money nationwide from major welfare programs over      seven years. California, which is home to the largest number      of noncitizen legal immigrants in the country would lose at      least $9 billion over seven years.       Once legal immigrants are no longer eligible for federal      social service programs, California's 58 counties will still      be responsible for providing social services and medical care      to them. A recent study issued by the University of      California at Los Angeles indicates that an estimated 830,000      immigrants would converge onto county health programs if      changes are made at the federal level to exclude them from      health coverage. The counties in California are legally and      fiscally responsible under state law to provide a ``safety      net'' to indigent persons in the form of cash aid and health      care. Currently, local governments are bursting at the seams      from the impact of these programs.       Changes of this magnitude at the federal level could cause      many counties to meet the same fate as Orange County did two      years ago when it declared bankruptcy. Counties are already      struggling financially as year after year they have been      forced to absorb reductions in payments because of local,      state and federal budget difficulties. We cannot now absorb      these costs as well. We strongly urge you to consider your      vote on these very important pieces of legislation and the      long-range impact they will have on local government once the      publicity is over. We would request that you do not support      these measures should they contain these faulty policies      which would merely shift the cost and responsibility to the      counties.       There are additional concerns that we have with the      proposal and Margaret Pena of my staff is available to      discuss them with you. She can be reached at (916) 327-7523.      Thank you for your consideration.                                                                    ____                                     New California Coalition,                                 San Francisco, CA, July 17, 1996.     To: Kathleen Reich, Office of Senator Feinstein.     From: Tanya Broder.     Re Welfare bills pending before the House and Senate floor--         the California impact of the immigrant provisions.       Attached, as you requested are:       1. A letter from the California State Association of      Counties on this issue.       2. A one-pager prepared by the National Immigration Law      Center on the current welfare bills.       3. A 2-pager on the California impact. I put this together,      based largely on materials prepared by NILC. It is being      refined--let me know if anything is unclear.       Please do not hesitate to call me at 243-8215, extension      319, if you have any questions or need additional      information. Please inform us of the Senator's position on      any or all of these issues as soon as you can. Thank you for      your interest.
