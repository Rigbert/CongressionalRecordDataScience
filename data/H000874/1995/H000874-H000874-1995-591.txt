Speaker, I am appalled by the devastating cuts in children's programs which the Republicans are pushing through the House.  There are many cuts to choose from--but none is more galling than the attack on child nutrition.  Over the next 5 years, the proposed Republican block grants will cut more than $2.3 billion from school breakfast and lunch.  And, as if that were not enough, the block grant increases the proportion of Federal school food funding that can be used from State administrative costs.  How can a hungry child hear a teacher over the growling of an empty stomach?  How can a malnourished child keep healthy enough to stay in school?  Republicans have been telling us that these cuts are necessary to reduce our deficit. Yesterday evening the Committee on Appropriations voted on cutting taxes and reducing the deficit. Democrats voted yes in every instance. Republicans voted no in every instance.                          ____________________
