Mr. Speaker, I rise today in recognition of an Alaskan Pioneer--a woman who helped shape our great State and a dear friend of mine--Mary Binkley. From her humble beginnings with Jim on the Chena and Tanana Rivers to her dedication to public service, Mary has been a solid foundation to her family, Fairbanks and the state of Alaska.   Mary arrived to Alaska in 1944. As the matriarch of the Binkley family, Mary was crucial to the growth of their family business--from the Godspeed, a 25-passenger vessel, to what would become the Binkley enterprise. She has been the backbone of the Discover Riverboat Touring Company since its founding in 1950; a business which still operates today. When her husband, Jim, entered the Alaska State Legislature, Mary stepped up to successfully manage the family business. The company played a vital role in helping grow and modernize the entire region. When I traveled in Fairbanks, I traveled on the Riverboats Discovery.   Mary has been a leading Alaskan woman her entire life. She has always had a big heart and deep respect for the rich history and culture of the Alaska Native people. She consistently went out of her way to hire Alaska Natives, learning everything she could about their culture and graciously sharing hers in return. Those relationships echo her tireless efforts to build community.   Her dedication to improving the economy and her resilience to the unforgiving Alaskan frontier make her the definition of determination. I will always consider Mary a dear friend and pivotal stalwart in moving Alaska into the future. I could not be more honored to recognize her lifelong efforts as an Alaskan and one who sets the standard for others to follow.                          ____________________
