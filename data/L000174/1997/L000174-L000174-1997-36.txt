President, I remain frustrated by the Republican leadership's unwillingness to consider and approve the President's nomination of Ray Fisher to the third-highest ranking position at the U.S. Department of Justice. Mr. Fisher has been stalled on the Senate Calendar for a month since being reported unanimously by the Judiciary Committee on October 9.  Ray Fisher is an outstanding lawyer and public servant. His record is exemplary.  Is this another example of a secret hold? There has been no explanation of justification for this delay and lack of action.  I recall when the Senate Republican leadership delayed the vote on the nomination of Eric Holder to the Deputy Attorney General position that we were told there were Senators with problems. I also remember that when I insisted on a rollcall vote on that nomination, after it had been stalled on the Senate Calendar for more than 3 weeks, the problems had all been resolved and the Senate confirmed Mr. Holder unanimously. One hundred Senators voted for that nomination.  I urge the Republican leadership to allow the Senate to confirm Ray Fisher to be Associate Attorney General of the United States.                          ____________________
