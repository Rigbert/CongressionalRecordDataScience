  Mr. DeFAZIO. Mr. Speaker, today the House will vote on an amendment to the Constitution, and for the first time ever probably vote a change in the Bill of Rights.  Now, changing the Bill of Rights is of such importance that surely this will take place with due deliberation. Well, actually not. It will be a closed rule, no amendments, no substitutes, and precious little debate. One hour for the first change ever to the Bill of Rights in over 200 years.  Is this any way to treat the Constitution and the Bill of Rights? This is not the first instance of disrespect for the Constitution and the Bill of Rights under the Republican majority. We had the infamous H.R. 666, a direct attack on the fourth amendment by authorizing warrantless searches.  Mr. Speaker, now, at the end of all this the flag might fly on high, but the Constitution and the Bill of Rights will lie torn and tattered at our feet.                          ____________________
