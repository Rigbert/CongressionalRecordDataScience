 We heard discussion about the Ninth Circuit. There was a suggestion that it is reversed all the time.  In the year ending March 31, 1997, they decided 8,701 matters; the year ending March 31, 1996, 7,813 matters; in 1995, 7,955 matters. Well, 99.7 percent of those matters were not overturned.  I ask unanimous consent that an article by Judge Jerome Farris of the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit be printed in the Record.  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in the Record, as follows:   The Ninth Circuit--Most Maligned Circuit in the Country--Fact or                                 Fiction?                        (By Hon. Jerome Farris*)     *Footnotes at end of article.       The Honorable Jerome Farris argues that the reason the      Supreme Court overturns such a high percentage of Ninth      Circuit cases accepted for review is not because the Circuit      is ``too liberal.'' Rather, Judge Farris emphasizes the high      volume of cases heard by the Ninth Circuit and its      willingness to take on controversial issues. He suggests that      any objective observer would conclude that the Ninth Circuit      is functioning well and that the system is working precisely      as the Framers of the United States Constitution intended.       The shell game has survived over the centuries because      there are always those who are not merely willing, but      delighted, to be deceived. If the game is played often enough      and mindlessly enough, one can come very close to fooling      ``all of the people all of the time.''       The Ninth Circuit--most maligned circuit in the country--     fact or fiction? It is absolutely true that the United States      Supreme Court accepted twenty-nine cases from the Ninth      Circuit for review in 1997 and reversed twenty-eight of those      decisions, affirming only one. The prior year, the Supreme      Court reviewed twelve Ninth Circuit cases and reversed ten.      In 1995, the Supreme Court reviewed fourteen Ninth Circuit      decisions and reversed ten. During that period, no other      circuit had so many decisions reversed or so high a      percentage of reversals of cases accepted for review.\1\       According to these statistics, the Supreme Court reversed      ninety-six percent of the Ninth Circuit cases it reviewed in      1997, an all time high.\2\       In the year ending March 31, 1997, the Ninth Circuit      decided 8701 matters. In the same period ending in 1996, the      Ninth Circuit decided 7813 matters. In 1995, the Ninth      Circuit decided 7955 matters. If one considers the number of      Ninth Circuit decisions reversed by the Supreme Court against      the total number of cases decided by the Ninth Circuit, an      entirely different picture emerges. Under this analysis, the      Supreme Court let stand as final 99.7 percent of the Ninth      Circuit's 1996 cases. No circuit in history has decided so      many cases, and no circuit in history has had so low a      percentage of cases reversed.       The point is not that one statistic is right and that the      other statistic is wrong, but that statistics can be      deceiving and can be used to paint almost any picture one      wants. Courts issue ``opinions''; they do not decide right      and wrong in an absolute sense. Courts cannot determine right      and wrong in an absolute sense because the law is not      absolute. Deciding a legal rule is not like figuring out an      immutable law of physics--a court always strives for ``the      right answer,'' but because the law has a life of its own,      time determines what is correct. Courts on occasion reverse      themselves for just that reason.       Any Ninth Circuit judge worthy of the title would want to      revisit the decisions that were taken for review to determine      whether in any single instance Supreme Court precedent was      ignored. One cannot expect newspaper reporters to make that      kind of review. News articles report the facts and others      analyze the facts. It is my view that no responsible      ``expert'' would comment before making such a review. What      the review would reveal is no mystery because all decisions      are in the domain of the public.       In 1997, the Supreme Court unanimously reversed twenty-one      cases (eight of those decisions were per curiam). In the one      Ninth Circuit case that the Supreme Court affirmed (the vote      was eight to one), the majority held that the opinion      properly followed Supreme Court precedent.\3\ In one case      that the Supreme Court unanimously reversed, the Ninth      Circuit followed a Tenth Circuit decision. The Eighth      Circuit, however, decided the issue a different way and the      Supreme Court resolved the split.\4\       In Saratoga Fishing Co. v. J.M. Martinac & Co., \5\ a six      to three reversal, Justice Scalia, joined by Justice Thomas,      noted in dissent that ``an impressive line of lower court      decisions applying both federal and state law'' \6\ has, like      the Ninth Circuit, precluded liability in analogous      situations. \7\       In eight of the reversed Ninth Circuit cases, the Supreme      Court resolved conflicts between the circuits: Old Chief v.      United States; \8\ California Division of Labor Standards      Enforcement v. Dillingham Construction; \9\ United States v.      Brockamp; \10\ Regents of the University of California v.      Doe; \11\ Inter-Modal Rail Employees Ass'n v. Atchison,      Topeka, & Santa Fe Railway; \12\ United States v. Hyde; \13\      Glickman v. Wileman Bros. & Elliott; \14\ Quality King      Distributors, Inc. v. L'anza Research International, Inc.      \15\ Thus, in many of the cases that were reversed, the Ninth      Circuit was not alone in concluding a different result than      the result the Supreme Court reached. Make no mistake,      however, the Supreme Court did critcize the Ninth Circuit in      some of its reversals. In one reversal, the Supreme Court      stated that the Ninth Circuit failed to follow Supreme Court      precedent. \16\       Courts are bound to follow Supreme Court precedent.      However, what we write are opinions. The sin is not being      wrong, but being wrong when the guidance was clear and when      there was a deliberate failure to follow the guidance.       Two cases illustrate the dilemma of circuit courts:      Washington v. Glucksberg, \17\ regarding physician-assisted      suicide, and Printz v. United States, \18\ regarding the      Brady Handgun Violence Prevention Act. \19\ The Supreme Court      reversed both of these Ninth Circuit decisions.       The Brady Act was widely discussed publicly and received      much political interest. At issue in Printz v. United States      was whether the Brady Handgun Act violated Article I, Sec. 8      and the Tenth Amendment of the United States Constitution by      commanding chief law enforcement officers to conduct      background checks of handgun purchasers. In a two to one      decision, the Ninth Circuit found no constitutional      violation. The Supreme Court, by a vote of five to four,      reversed. Justice Scalia delivered the opinion of the Court      in which Rehnquist, O'Connor, Kennedy, and Thomas joined;      O'Connor filed a concurring opinion; Thomas filed a      concurring opinion; Stevens filed a dissenting opinion, in      which Souter, Ginsburg, and Breyer joined; Souter filed a      separate dissenting opinion; and Breyer filed a dissenting      opinion, in which Stevens joined. One might reasonably      conclude that the solution was less than obvious.       Physician-assisted suicide has also been soundly debated in      both public and political arenas. The question for decision      in Glucksberg was whether a Washington statue that imposes a      criminal penalty on anyone who ``aids another person to      attempt suicide'' denies the Fourteenth Amendment's Due      Process Clause liberty interest of mentally competent,      terminally ill adults to choose their time and manner of      death. The Ninth Circuit, in an eight to three en banc panel      decision, found a liberty interest in the right to die and      then weighed the individual's compelling liberty interest      against the state's interest. The Ninth Circuit found the      statute unconstitutional. The Supreme Court unanimously      reversed the Ninth Circuit decision with five separate      concurring opinions.       Was the Ninth Circuit ``wrong'' in either of these cases?      The Circuit would have been, in my opinion, if it had not      resolved each of the complex issues and given them full,      careful, and decisive consideration. The Supreme Court      reversed these decisions, but who would say that the system      is not functioning as it was intended to function? Everyone      is entitled to their own views, but the conclusion, in my      view, is that the system envisioned by the Framers of the      Constitution continues to function properly.       The decisions of the Supreme Court become the law of the      land because our system of government requires settled law.      It is therefore necessary that one court make a final      decision, and, right or wrong, that decision governs our      society.       That the Supreme Court can be ``wrong'' is evident to any      student of American law, history, politics, or society. This      county's jurisprudential history is filled with famous cases,      affecting our entire society, in which the Supreme Court      decided that it had previously reached an erroneous result:      Brown v. Board of Education of Topeka; \20\ Bunting v.      Oregon; \21\ Garcia v. San Antonio Metropolitan Transit      Authority; \22\ and twice reversing itself on death penalty      cases in the 1970s, to name a few.       The Supreme Court also reverses itself in many less well-     known cases. This term it reversed a decision regarding      public school teachers in parochial schools. \23\ The term      before that it reversed itself in Seminole Tribe of Florida      v. Florida, \24\ and the year before that in Hubbard v.      United States. \25\ Justice Brandeis's dissent in the 1932      case, Burnet v. Coronado Oil & Gas Co., \26\ argued that the      Supreme Court should overrule an earlier decision \27\ and      cites thirty-five cases in which the Supreme Court overruled      or qualified its earlier decisions.       This list of Supreme Court reversals--in no way meant to be      comprehensive--actually constitutes a high reversal rate      considering that the Supreme Court currently averages about      eighty to ninety decisions a year, or one percent of the      number of cases that the Ninth Circuit hears. This comparison      suggests that the Supreme Court would have to reverse one      hundred Ninth Circuit cases a year in order to reverse the      Ninth Circuit at as high a rate as the Supreme Court reverses      itself (which it does about once a year).       In other instances, Congress has decided that the Supreme      Court had the wrong answer and enacted legislation to      effectively overrule the decision, such as the Religious      Freedom Restoration Act of 1993 (RFRA) \28\ and the 1982      Voting Rights Act Amendments.\29\ The Supreme Court upheld      the constitutionality of the 1982 Voting Rights Act      Amendments \30\ and it found RFRA unconstitutional.\31\       Do these results prove that Congress was right and that the      Supreme Court was wrong? Or do these results prove that the      Supreme Court was right and that Congress was wrong? Of      course not. Rather, the results provide examples of the      checks and balances designed in the Constitution to make our      government run properly. Similarly, when the Supreme Court      reverses an appellate court decision, it does not mean that      the decision was wrong in an absolute sense, and more      importantly, it does not mean that the appellate court was      not functioning properly in its role in the judiciary and in      the United States government.       Part of the cause of the misperception about right and      wrong is created in the training of lawyers at law school.      Most law schools begin teaching law in a formalistic manner:      the student learns the law, and there is only one correct      law. This formalism gets carried on as law students enter the      legal profession. Lawyers often argue before     me that there is only one possible result (``The law dictates      this result!''). This is rarely true, and is never true in      complicated cases. There are always some arguments for each      side, otherwise the case would be frivolous. The bottom line      is that reasonable minds can differ and can each still be      reasonable.       The Ninth Circuit deals with more cases than any other      circuit. It is not surprising, then, that the Ninth Circuit      would deal with more complicated and important issues than      any other circuit. Both of these factors contribute to the      Supreme Court's review and reversal of more Ninth Circuit      cases than cases from other circuits.       Some observers contend that the Ninth Circuit is reversed      so often because it is the most liberal circuit in the      country and because the Supreme Court is currently      conservative. This hypothesis also provides ammunition to      those now arguing that the Ninth Circuit should be split (a      topic for another article).\32\ However, these observers have      failed to review the facts. Of the opinions signed by Ninth      Circuit judges that were reversed this year by the Supreme      Court, eleven were authored by Democratic presidential      appointees, and nine were authored by Republican presidential      appointees. Apparently the Supreme Court is an equal      opportunity reverser.       To function properly, each court must do its duty to the      best of its ability. Parties must be able to rely on the full      resolution of cutting edge issues in each court to which the      issues are submitted. There is always the risk of reversal,      but that risk should not--cannot--drive the system. The      Supreme Court was better able to treat the question of      physician-assisted suicide and the issue of the Brady Act      because it had decisive opinions to review. One could assume      that these issues are closed, and they certainly may be for      the immediate future. History reminds us, though, that      serious controversial issues are revisited from time to time.      This comment is written by a circuit judge whose life would      certainly have been different had the Dred Scott \33\      decision not been revisited.       I make no prediction for the future of any of the Ninth      Circuit reversals, but one commentator was not so cautious.      Writing while Glucksberg \34\ was pending before the Supreme      Court, Roger S. Magnusson \35\ in the Pacific Rim Law and      Policy Journal, predicted:       Although an adverse Supreme Court opinion could potentially      retard the process of pro-euthanasia law reform, this would      be a temporary delay only which could not survive      generational change. In the United States and beyond, the      development of a legal right to die with medical assistance,      appears inevitable.\36\       What is important to remember is that opinions, unlike      arithmetic solutions, may vary. Our system under the      Constitution is designed to put an end to variations because      the Supreme Court makes the final decision. The danger is not      that an appellate court gets reversed, but that a court might      let possible reversal deter decisive, full, and reasoned      consideration of important issues. An even greater danger is      that the high regard in which all courts must be held if our      system is to be a rule of law, not of judges, is threatened      if those who are personally ambitious can dismiss a reasoned      decision of any court with the throwaway phrase--``Oh well,      that decision is just the irresponsible act of a coterie of      liberal judges.'' All tyrants first seek to malign the rule      of law.                               footnotes     *Judge, United States Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit.     \1\ The Supreme Court decided a total of ninety-one cases in      the 1996 term, reversing sixty-five, affirming twenty-three,      and otherwise disposing of three. See Thomas C. Goldstein,      Statistics for the Supreme Court's October Term 1996, 66      U.S.L.W. 3068 (U.S. July 15, 1997).     \2\ All other circuits outside of the Ninth Circuit suffered      a combined reversal rate of sixty-one percent. See Bill      Kusliak, Reversal Rate Keeps Getting Uglier, San Francisco      Recorder, July 2, 1997, at 1.     \3\ See Babbitt v. Youpee, 117 S. Ct. 727, 732 (1997). In      Babbitt, the Supreme Court affirmed the Ninth Circuit's      holding that a provision of the Indian Land Consolidation Act      worked an unconstitutional taking by requiring escheat to the      tribe of certain fractional interests in allotment upon the      owner's death. See id.     \4\ See California Div. of Labor Standards Enforcement v.      Dillingham Constr., 117 S. Ct. 832 (1997). The Ninth Circuit      held that a California prevailing wage law governing wages of      apprentices was preempted by ERISA. See Dillingham Constr. v.      County of Sonoma, 57 F.3d 712, 722 (9th Cir. 1995). In      reversing, the Supreme Court found that the law at issue      neither referred to nor was connected with ERISA. See      Dillingham Constr., 117 S. Ct. at 834. Thus, the Court held      that the law did not ``relate to'' an ERISA plan for purposes      of preemption. See id.     \5\ 117 S. Ct. 1783 (1997).     \6\ Saratoga Fishing, 117 S. Ct. at 1791.     \7\ The Ninth Circuit decision employed the East River      doctrine, see East River S.S. Corp. v. Transamerica Delaval,      Inc., 476 U.S. 858, 870 (1986), to preclude liability for      property damage sustained on a vessel. See Saratoga Fishing      Co. v. Marco Seattle, Inc., 69 F.3d 1432, 1446 (9th Cir.      1995). The Ninth Circuit found that equipment added to a      vessel after purchase was part of the ``product itself.'' See      id. In reversing, the Supreme Court concluded that the after-     acquired equipment constituted ``other property,'' and was      not a part of the ``product itself.'' See Saratoga Fishing,      117 S. Ct. at 1784.     \8\ 117 S. Ct. 644 (1997). In United States v. Old Chief, the      Ninth Circuit found that, despite a defendant's offer to      stipulate, the government was entitled to present evidence of      a prior felony to prove the current charge of felon in      possession of a firearm. See No. 94-30277, 1995 WL 325745      (9th Cir. Apr. 14, 1995) (basing the decision on 18 U.S.C.      Sec. 922(g)(1)). The Supreme Court disagreed, finding that      the rejection of a defendant's offer to stipulate to a felony      conviction constituted an abuse of discretion where the name      or nature of the underlying conviction raised the risk of      tainting the jury's verdict. See Old Chief, 117 S. Ct. at      645.     \9\ 117 S. Ct. 832 (1997). See supra note 4 and accompanying      text.     \10\ 117 S. Ct. 849 (1997). In Brockamp, the Supreme Court      reversed the Ninth Circuit holding which allowed equitable      tolling of the statutory limitations period for tax refund      claims. The Supreme Court concluded that the strong language      of the statute precluded the Ninth Circuit's application of      the presumption favoring equitable tolling. See id. at 851.     \11\ 117 S. Ct. 900 (1997). In Doe v. Lawrence Livermore      National Laboratory, 65 F.3d 771, 776 (9th Cir. 1995), the      Ninth Circuit held that the University of California's right      to indemnification from the federal government divested the      university of Eleventh Amendment immunity. The Supreme Court      reversed, holding that a state entity's potential legal      liability, rather than financial responsibility for      judgments, triggered the application of the Eleventh      Amendment. See Regents of the Univ. of Cal., 117 S. Ct. at      904.     \12\ 117 S. Ct. 1513 (1997). In this action, the Supreme      Court held that an ERISA provision prohibiting interference      with protected rights applied to welfare plans. See id. at      1515. The Ninth Circuit found that the provision applied only      to interference with the attainment of rights capable of      vesting. See Inter-Modal Rail Employees Ass'n v. Atchison,      Topeka, & Santa Fe Ry. Co., 80 F 3d 348, 351 (9th Cir. 1996).     \13\ 117 S. Ct. 1630 (1997). In Hyde, a criminal defendant      attempted to withdraw his guilty plea after the plea was      accepted, but prior to acceptance of the plea agreement. The      Ninth Circuit reversed the district court's refusal to allow      withdrawal without a showing by defendant of a ``fair and      just reason.'' See Hyde v. United States, 92 F.3d 779, 781      (9th Cir. 1996). The Supreme Court held that a showing of      ``fair and just reason'' by defendant was necessary. See      Hyde, 117 S. Ct. at 1631.     \14\ 117 S. Ct. 2130 (1997). In Clickman, the Court reversed      the Ninth Circuit determination that mandatory assessments on      growers, handlers, and processors of California tree fruits      to pay for generic advertising violated the First Amendment.      See id. at 2142. The Supreme Court rejected the use of a      heightened First Amendment scrutiny and the Ninth Circuit's      finding that the law compelled financial support of others'      speech, See id. at 2138-39.     \15\ 117 S.
