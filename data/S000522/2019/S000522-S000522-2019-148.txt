Madam Chair, for over 25 years, I have made multiple oral and written requests to federal contracting authorities including the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers to explain why our labor unions have been systematically excluded from contract awards--especially at military installations like the Joint Base in New Jersey.  Over the years, everyone we've met in meeting after meeting on the federal side have always been polite and courteous, but the bottom line--the highly trained unionized women and men don't get the jobs.  Most recently, I brought labor leaders including Mike Maloney--Business Manager for the Plumbers and Pipefitters Local 9, Mike Ricca--Business Agent of IBEW Local 400, and others to meet with the Corps of Engineers regarding contracting processes that make it near impossible for union members to get work on the base.  I--we--raised deep concerns that nonunion contractors may purposely be misclassifying workers in order to low bid, which if true could be a serious violation of federal law and contrary to Davis Bacon.  We are concerned that irresponsible contractors and subcontractors may be engaging in two different types of misclassification: craft misclassification and independent contractor misclassification. Craft misclassification occurs when dishonest contractors misclassify high-skilled workers as general laborers or lower wage classifications in order to avoid paying the higher prevailing wage rate applicable to the high-skilled work actually performed. Independent contractor misclassification occurs when contractors misclassify employees as independent contractors to avoid paying prevailing wages in order to reduce labor costs and avoid state and federal taxes.  Today, I am offering an amendment, joined by my good friend and colleague Donald Norcross, to task the U.S. Government Accountability Office (GAO) to investigate the contracting practices of the Corps of Engineers, with a specific focus on how the Corps complies with and enforces the requirement to pay prevailing wages on federally financed construction jobs, and its probe will include:  Any programs or protocols the Corps of Engineers has in place for the purpose of carrying out its Davis-Bacon Act enforcement obligations as set forth in the Federal Acquisition Regulation.  Any programs or protocols the Corps of Engineers has in place for the purpose of identifying and addressing independent contractor misclassification on projects subject to the Davis-Bacon Act.  The frequency with which the Corps of Engineers conducts site visits on each covered project to monitor Davis-Bacon Act compliance.  The frequency with which the Corps of Engineers monitors certified payroll reports submitted by contractors and subcontractors on each covered project.  Whether the Corps of Engineers accepts and investigates complaints of Davis-Bacon Act violations submitted by third parties, such as contractors and workers' rights organizations.  Whether the Corps of Engineers maintains a database listing all contractors and subcontractors who have, in one way or another, violated the Davis-Bacon Act and whether the Corps consults this database as part of its contract award process.  The frequency, over the last five years, with which the Corps of Engineers penalized, disqualified, terminated, or moved for debarment of a contractor for Davis-Bacon violations.  How the Corps of Engineers verifies that the contractors it hires for its projects are properly licensed.  This amendment will require the Comptroller General of the United States to submit a report to Congress summarizing the results of their findings, in addition to any recommendations for legislative or regulatory action that would improve the efforts of enforcing the requirement to pay prevailing wages on federally financed construction jobs.  Our military installations deserve quality workmanship, not substandard facilities that could create potential hazards and diminish readiness.  The bill, to which I am adding this amendment, authorizes $11.5 billion for military construction projects for fiscal year 2020. Madam Chair, we need to ensure that taxpayer dollars--and critical investment in military infrastructure--are being spent in accordance with the law, including Davis Bacon.                          ____________________
