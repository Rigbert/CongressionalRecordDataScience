 We would go into session at 9 o'clock in the morning; is that correct?  After consultation with the leader, the thought was that we would come in at 9:15 and resume debate on the Hagel amendment, with the remainder of the time on each side reserved for the morning. Is my friend from Arizona comfortable with that arrangement?  Mr. McCAIN. Yes. I thank the Senator.  Mr. McCONNELL. Mr. President, for the purposes of withdrawing his amendment, I yield the floor. I see the Senator from Illinois is here.
