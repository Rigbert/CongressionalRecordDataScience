President, I am delighted that the Majority Leader has chosen to proceed to consideration of the nomination of Justice Susan Graber to the Ninth Circuit. Justice Graber currently serves on the Oregon Supreme Court. She was reported unanimously by the Judiciary Committee earlier this month. She has the support of both Oregon Senators and received the American Bar Association's highest rating.  At her confirmation hearing, she was interrogated about two briefs that she had filed a number of years ago, in 1982 and 1984, in connection with cases being pursued by the ACLU. She was asked whether she is now or ever has been a member of the ACLU. She was asked whether she personally agreed with a number of positions taken recently by the ACLU. I objected to this line of questioning at the hearing and caution the Senate that we are headed down a road toward an ideological litmus test that does not well serve the Senate, the courts or the American people.  I hope that Justice Graber's confirmation will signal a change of direction and a willingness of the Senate to confirm qualified judicial nominees. I was encouraged when Senator Sessions voted to report this nomination favorably and said: ``I think she is a very talented nominee, has been an activist in some ways in her past, but has many good recommendations, and I think would have the capability of making an outstanding judge. I would support her nomination, although had I been making the nomination, I may not have nominated her.'' I trust that is the standard that will be applied to other qualified nominees, as well.  I remain concerned, as I look at the Senate Executive Calendar, that we are again passing over other highly-qualified nominees, nominees who will be confirmed by the Senate if they are ever allowed to be considered. In particular, I see G. Patrick Murphy, the nominee to the District Court for the Southern District of Illinois, and Judge Michael P. McCuskey, the nominee to the District Court for the Central District of Illinois. I spoke of these longstanding nominations yesterday, as well. I know that Senator Durbin is doing everything he can to try to have them considered by the Senate because they have been on the Senate calendar since last November, over 5 months; they are desperately needed in their districts; and they are so well qualified.  I see Edward F. Shea, a nominee to the District Court for the Eastern District of Washington, and Margaret McKeown, the Washington State nominee to the Ninth Circuit. Mr. Shea was reported at the same time as two other District Court nominees who have been considered and confirmed and should likewise be considered and confirmed without further, unnecessary delay. Margaret McKeown was reported before the Justice Graber but has been skipped over, as well. Her nomination is fast approaching its two-year anniversary. She was reported by the Judiciary Committee on a vote of 16 to 2 and she has the support of Chairman Hatch and a number of Republican Senators. Why these outstanding nominees are being skipped is a mystery to me.  Finally, we have reported to the Senate the nomination of Judge Sotomayor to the United States Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit. Her nomination was received back in June 1997. She, too, was favorably reported by a Committee vote of 16 to 2, once we finally considered her nomination. She is strongly supported by both New York Senators, yet the nomination continues to languish without consideration. This would fill one of the four vacancies that currently plague that Court. A fifth vacancy on this 13-judge court will arise before the end of this month.  The confirmation of Susan Graber will mark the twelfth judge confirmed by the Senate this year. While we are still behind the pace the Senate established in the last nine weeks of last year, we can make a step in the right direction by proceeding to consider and confirm the five additional judicial nominees who remain on the Senate calendar and are ready for our consideration and favorable action.  When the Chief Justice of the United States Supreme Court wrote in his 1997 Year End Report that ``some current nominees have been waiting a considerable time for a . . . final floor vote'' he could have been referring to Patrick Murphy, Judge Michael McCuskey, Margaret McKeown and Judge Sonia Sotomayor.  Nine months should be more than a sufficient time for the Senate to complete its review of these nominees. During the four years of the Bush Administration, only three confirmations took as long as nine months. Last year, 10 of the 36 judges confirmed took nine months or more and many took as long as a year and one-half. So far this year, Judge Ann Aiken, Judge Margaret Morrow, and Judge Hilda Tagle have taken 21 months, 26 months and 31months respectively. The average number of days to consider nominees used to be between 50 and 90, it rose last year to over 200 and this year stands at over 300 days from nomination to confirmation. That is too long and does a disservice to our Federal Courts. I urge the Republican leadership to proceed to consideration of each of the judicial nominees pending on the Senate calendar without further delay.                          ____________________
