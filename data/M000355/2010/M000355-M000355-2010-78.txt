 President, first, I had an opportunity to hear the remarks of Dr. Barrasso, the Senator from Wyoming, about health care, and I wish to thank him for the ongoing contribution he has made in this very important debate. This is an issue that is not over and we will keep on revisiting the flaws in the coming years. So I thank the Senator from Wyoming for his important contribution.  I also thank the other Senator from Wyoming who is sitting to my left, who is the author of this measure we will be voting on--a necessary step. I thank the Senator from Wyoming for his important contribution as well.                           Voices Grow Louder  Mr. President, for the past year and a half, Americans have witnessed something truly remarkable here in Washington. They have watched a governing party that was more or less completely uninterested in what the governed had to say about the direction of the country. In a nation where the government's power is derived from the consent of the governed, that is a pretty risky governing philosophy. That is why the voices of the American people have grown louder and louder.  Republicans have listened to those voices. We heard the concerns Americans had with the stimulus bill that was based on the discredited premise that having bureaucrats and Democratic lawmakers spend $1 trillion on their favorite programs would revive the economy, and we opposed it. We heard the concerns Americans had about a health spending bill that was built on the discredited premise that spending more money and growing the Federal bureaucracy would make health care less expensive, and we opposed it. We heard the concerns Americans had about a financial regulatory bill that was built on the discredited premise that hiring more of the same kind of bureaucrats who missed the last crisis was a good formula for preventing the next one, and we opposed it.  Again and again, Democrats were faced with a problem, and their solution was to ram through some costly, big government solution Americans did not want, but that they are now expected to pay for. And they are still not finished.  In order to fund even more programs, more government, our friends on the other side now want to raise taxes. Nearly 15 million Americans are looking for work and can't find it. Another 11 million are underemployed, meaning they have settled for part-time work instead of a full-time job. Household income is down for the second year in a row, and Democrats want to take more money out of people's pockets.  Just yesterday, the nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office said these tax hikes will hurt the economy and slow the recovery. So what did we do here over the past week in the Senate? An ill-conceived bill the chairman of the Finance Committee said would put U.S. companies at a competitive disadvantage, and a campaign finance bill, the entire goal of which was to give Democrats an electoral advantage in the upcoming elections by muzzling their opponents.  If Americans need any further proof that Democrats haven't been listening to them, this past week has provided all the evidence they need. Americans want us to focus on jobs, and our friends on the other side focused on preserving their own jobs and spending more taxpayer dollars.  It has to stop.  That is why earlier this month I proposed a bill that would prevent a massive tax hike from going into effect on anyone at the end of the year, and that is why Republicans put forward an appropriations cap that would cut $300 billion from the President's budget, even as our friends on the other side neglected to bring a single appropriations bill to the floor.  Sometime today or tomorrow, we will be leaving Washington to head back to our States and when we do, Democrats will have a lot of explaining to do about how they have spent their time here in the last year and a half. As for Republicans, we will be able to say we listened.                          Tribute to Larry Cox  Mr. President, in the reception area of my office in the Russell Building, there is a framed copy of a page from my hometown newspaper hanging on the wall. It is from section B, the front page, and the date reads January 21, 1985, just days after I was first sworn in as Kentucky's newest Senator.  There is a picture of me sitting in my new Senate office, talking on the phone, with quite the head of dark hair. Behind me you can see a man in a sport coat lifting some boxes. And he looks like he can lift them quite easily, too. The caption under that photo reads:  ``McConnell made a few telephone calls while aide Larry Cox moved boxes in on the first day.''  The first day.  Now, in too many ways, it feels like an era has reached its final days. Because after more than 25 years of Senate service, and nearly 30 years of setting his own ego aside to help me and my career, on September 2 of this year, Larry Cox retired.  No other single person worked as hard or did as much for Team McConnell as Larry has. And because Larry was there from the beginning--when on any given day, he could serve as driver, security detail, advance man, political operative, caseworker, legislative advisor, and my eyes and ears all at once--no other single person probably ever will.  We have heard the phrase ``jack of all trades,'' but Larry is a master of all trades--not only because of the many roles he filled in my office, but for the fullness of his life outside the office as well.  As the State director in my office beginning in 1985, Larry was my chief representative in Kentucky. He oversaw an 18-member field staff, spread out amongst six offices in the State, and led my efforts in constituent casework, project development, and outreach.  Beyond that, however, Larry was the picture of the perfect Senate staffer. Content to stay in the background, for years he happily worked without seeking credit. He is a man of fairly strong opinions, and was somewhat our resident keeper of the ideological flame--but he would never force his opinion on you if you didn't ask for it.  Most of all, for the hundreds of staffers that have been through my offices, he served as a role model, an example of good character, and a true friend.  Larry and I have more in common than just our Senate service. We were both born in Alabama, just a year apart, and after a little traveling, we both ended up about as Bluegrass as one can get. Additionally, both Larry's father and mine served in World War II.  After the war, Larry's father, Lawrence E. Cox, Jr., worked for Gulf Oil, and that job took him and his family all across the southern United States. Larry spent time growing up in Louisiana, Arkansas, and Tennessee.  He attended George Peabody College of Vanderbilt University, and earned his master's at the University of Tennessee. A city planner by trade, he finally moved home--that is to say, to Louisville--in 1972.  My friendship with Larry began in 1981, when Larry began working for county government as the deputy secretary for community development. I was the county judge/executive, and I successfully lured Larry away from his old job. By 1984, he was with me as I made by first run for the Senate.  I can't talk much longer about Larry without mentioning his lovely wife Joanie. Larry came to start working for me just 3 months after he and Joanie got married. It is lucky for me it wasn't 3 months before. Joanie didn't know just how much I would take her husband away from her over the years.  Elaine and I have to thank Joanie for sharing Larry with us, because as we all know, sometimes Larry's work obligations have gotten the lion's share.  Sometimes Larry served as a one-man security detail. It was like being staffed by Clint Eastwood. You could call him ``Dirty Larry,'' and he wasjust waiting for someone to make his day.  Larry is not a guy you want to make mad, even though those of us who know him know that under that tough exterior is a very kind and caring man. I am probably going to get in trouble with him for saying that out loud.  In the old days, Larry and I crisscrossed every county in the State, in a car that Larry faithfully had service every 3,000 miles. Every event, he had planned precisely down to the minute. Executing Larry's plans was like executing a military maneuver.  This was also when I first learned about Larry's honest-to-gosh superpower. He is a walking, talking human GPS. Ask him how to get anywhere, and he can give you landmarks, travel time, distance and cardinal direction.  Naturally, a fellow like that became one of my very first Senate staffers after we were victorious in the 1984 election. And he was the perfect choice to be my State director.  In that job, he has been to every town parade and county festival. I believe he could name the sitting judge/executive in all 120 Kentucky counties, or tell you which counties towns like Eighty Eight or Grab are in. Since 1985, there have been 14 commanding generals at the Fort Knox Armor Center, and he has known and worked with every one of them.  And in the hundreds of thousands of hours I have spent with Larry, if he ever had a bad day, he did it pretty well.  Maybe that is because Larry never got bored. I have already described how he did everything in my office, no job too big or too small. And the rich and complete life he leads has given him plenty else to do as well.  Larry knows a lot about a lot of things. If you are on the road with him, and you point out a nice looking Corvette, he will be able to tell you it's a ZR1 with 638 horsepower and over 600 pounds of torque that can pull one `G' in a turn and goes zero to 60 in 3.5 seconds.  Larry once stopped me from boarding a plan because he could smell that it had been filled with the wrong kind of fuel. Despite the so-called experts telling him otherwise, he insisted they double check. Turned out he was right. Larry's nose saved some lives that day.  Larry's favored method of transportation, however, is not by air, but by land--specifically, by motorcycle. You can catch him driving across Kentucky on his Suzuki Bandit 1250, and he is usually with friends. In fact, Larry's got so many friends in the biker community that I have benefited from having a fleet of motorcycles roll in to many of my events. Larry's also a strong supporter of the second amendment. He believes in gun control--gun control being a firm hand and a steady grip.  I don't know how many guns Larry has, he may not even know, but I believe the number is somewhere north of 50. Years ago, Larry used to shoot skeet competitively.  You could even say Larry is one of those ``bitter'' people, the type who clings to his guns and his religion. He is a devout Christian who has been attending St. Matthew's United Methodist Church in Louisville since 1978.  He has faithfully volunteered countless hours over the years, including time spent at Susannah House, a daycare center run by the church. He has held every church leadership position, including serving on the board of trustees.  In what is becoming a recurring theme for Larry, he is always willing to do whatever is asked, and whatever it takes. On top of his church, he gives his time generously to the Kiwanis, and to the State Republican Party.  Larry is a great lover of the outdoors. He and Joanie have a farm in Hart County, KY, that is just shy of 100 acres. Now that Larry is leaving us I know he will be spending a lot more time there.  Larry generously opens up his farm to the McConnell Scholars, students at the University of Louisville who are part of a scholarship program for kids that I helped establish in 1991. He has held retreats for them there, mentored the students, and helped bring in speakers for other McConnell Center events. His contribution is so great that Dr. Gary Gregg, the center's director, puts it this way: ``Simply put . . . we would be impoverished without Larry.''  Dr. Gregg has a 15-year-old son, and Larry has helped encourage his interest in deer hunting, by letting him use his farm and his fields and educating him about shooting and gun safety. Whenever he has a chance to share his love of nature and the outdoors, Larry shines.  Anyone who thinks Republicans can't be conservationists, I want them to meet Larry and go visit his farm. The Green River runs through it, and Larry participates in the CREP program--a Kentucky conservationist effort to preserve and protect the river.  A third of the farm is planted with warm-season native grasses, to prevent soil erosion into the river and enhance the local wildlife. A third of the property is in timber, and a third in hayfields. You may have noticed what's missing on this farm--Larry has to abide by Joanie's rule, ``No crops, no critters.''  Larry is so well known throughout the State for his conservation efforts, he was honored this year as the Kentucky Association of Conservation Districts Person of the Year. He is also the first person to receive the Award for Distinguished Service from the Natural Resources Conservation Service.  My wife Elaine is also close to Larry and Joanie, and I know she is going to miss them a lot. Larry was one of the first Kentuckians she met when she came to the State, and he was so knowledgeable and friendly he made her feel just at home. She liked going to Larry and Joanie's home, where she knew she would always find good food and good company.  During my 1996 campaign, Elaine's sister Angela came to Louisville to volunteer, and Larry and Joanie generously put her up in their home. They have done that many times for other volunteers and staffers through the years. The McConnell Team has always been grateful to stay at their home.  I have wondered often over the years how a man as unique and special as Larry Cox came to be, and how I was lucky enough to find him.  To the second question, I can only credit providence. But the first question, that I can take a stab at answering.  I know Larry learned a lot about living from his mother. So did I. So did everyone lucky to know her. Beryl O. Cox was a spirited, adventuresome woman--in other words, she was a lot like Larry.  She raised three boys, and she was like one of the boys. She knew her priorities: She loved her family, her church, her motorcycles, and her bourbon--not necessarily in that order.  She and Larry would go riding together. She had her own motorcycle, a Honda Valkyrie. She didn't drive it--Larry would drive, and she would sit on the back.  Beryl was a delightful woman--``a real kick,'' according to Joanie. And may I say she was a close friend of mine as well. I remember how much she volunteered on many of my campaigns.  She was about the same age as my own mother. She lived a full and robust life, until her passing at the age of 95 in 2007.  A full and robust life, well lived. Larry obviously learned that from his mother as well. And just like her, he has made countless friends along the way.  Those friends will get to see a lot more of Larry now. So will his family. Whether it is time spent on the farm or on the back seat of his motorcycle, if it is time spent with Larry, I am sure they are grateful.  The Cox family includes Larry's wife Joanie; his daughter and son-in-law Lisa C. and Steve Pieragowski; his son and daughter-in-law J. Randall and Kristen A. Cox; his grandchildren Alexa Brooke Pieragowski, Erin Phoebe Pieragowski, Hayden Lawrence Cox, and Hadley Marie Cox; his brother and sister-in-law Alvin J. and Cammie Cox; his brother and sister-in-law Davis S. and Lynn C. Cox; his nieces and nephews Christopher L. Cox, Carter Cox, Lindsay F. Cox, and Stephen Cox; and many more beloved friends and family members.  Larry, your family's gain will certainly be our loss. It is a loss for my office, and a loss for the entire State of Kentucky that you have faithfully served for so many years.  As for me, I am going to miss my old friend.  After 30 years, there is too much to be said, so I simply say, thank you, Larry. For your dedication, your service, and your friendship, I don't think you can ever be thanked enough.  Mr. President, I yield the floor.
