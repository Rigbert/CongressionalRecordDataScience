The year long celebration began in October of 2009 with a Season of Preparation and now moves into its Season of Celebration. The Centenary concludes with a Season of Recommitment beginning October 8, 2010 through April 15, 2011.  The Toledo Roman Catholic Diocese was established by order of Pope Pius X on April 15, 1910. Its first bishop, the Most Reverend Joseph Schrembs was installed on October 4, 1911. The Diocese covers nineteen counties in Northwest Ohio including Allen, Crawford, Defiance, Erie, Fulton, Hancock, Henry, Huron, Lucas, Ottawa, Paulding, Putnam, Richland, Sandusky, Seneca, Van Wert, Williams, Wood and Wyandot. The region is urban, rural, suburban and every variety of ethnicity.  A century after its founding, the diocese serves 321,516 Catholics in 128 Parishes. Its services have grown to meet the needs of 21st Century Catholic life while adhering to traditional Catholic teaching. Today's faithful can look to a spirit of ecumenism, both lay and religious pastoral care, and ministries focused on youth, families, those who are aging and those who are alone.  Pope Paul VI said, ``Liturgy is like a strong tree whose beauty is derived from the continuous renewal of its leaves, but whose strength comes from the old trunk, with solid roots in the ground.'' As the Toledo Catholic Diocese has travelled through a century of steadfast faith, challenge and opportunity, it has always been the bedrock for the faithful of our region. Even as we celebrate the milestone marker of 100 years in Christ's service, we look forward to the coming 100 years with renewed hope and faith.                          ____________________
