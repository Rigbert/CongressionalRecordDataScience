However, in November, as the gentleman probably knows, Veterans Day falls exactly in the middle of the week on a Wednesday. We are now talking about what that means in terms of schedule because obviously all the Members want to be home with their various organizations, municipalities, counties and communities to honor our veterans on that day and honor the service of those who have kept this country free.  As a result, we are trying to figure out whether or not it makes any sense to either schedule a Monday and Tuesday or a Thursday and Friday and have Members come back and forth for that. We have not made that decision, but it is, in terms of the weeks that we are looking at over the next 10 weeks, a week that may not be one in which we will meet. We will try to make that determination very soon, within the next couple of weeks, part of which will be dictated by the schedule, what is moving, how much time we need available.  In addition to that, we will not be meeting Thanksgiving week. I say that pretty definitively. Obviously, if we could finish the Monday or Tuesday of Thanksgiving work, finish in terms of adjournment sine die for this session, then I think that might change that. But other than that, my expectation is we would not be meeting Thanksgiving week if we need to meet longer than Thanksgiving week.  Mr. McCARTHY of California. I thank the gentleman.  Currently, you have scheduled out between now and October 30. Do you see any of those Mondays or Fridays that maybe we would not be in session, having done our work during the week, knowing that the debate is going on still within health care and others that people can be back in their district? And I yield.
