 President, I intend to object to consideration of the nomination of Lourdes Castro Ramirez to be the Assistant Secretary of the Department of Housing and Urban Development, HUD, for the Office of Public and Indian Housing.  Over the last 4 years, I have been raising concerns about serious problems at public housing authorities and HUD's failure to address them. The Office of Public and Indian Housing is responsible for overseeing the public housing authority program.  I recently learned that HUD is negotiating new, 10-year contracts with the 39 housing authorities participating in the Moving to Work, MTW, demonstration program. The Office of Public and Indian Housing is also responsible for administering this program but has failed to conduct proper oversight for years.  The current contracts don't expire until 2018 so there is no need to rush into signing new contracts. Instead, I recommend HUD takes serious steps to address the program deficiencies and determine if this demonstration should continue.  A group of housing advocacy organizations sent a letter to HUD on November 7, 2014, raising concerns about the lack of transparency in the MTW contract negotiations. I am requesting that a copy of this letter be included with my statement in the Record. These organizations represent the people directly impacted by HUD decisions. They are asking questions that would strengthen the program and protect funding from abuse. But HUD is blocking them from participating in the process. Only the MTW agencies are allowed to review the contracts and comment on the proposed changes.  According to HUD briefing materials, the MTW housing authorities operate about 14 percent of the Nation's housing stock and receive over $3 billion in funding per year, equal to about 20 percent of total program funding. Yet HUD has failed to require any meaningful accountability or transparency.  This has led to financial abuses at the Chicago Housing Authority and other MTW housing authorities. On October 23, I sent a letter to HUD about the Chicago Housing Authority (CHA), a Moving to Work participant. CHA has diverted approximately $432 million in Federal funding into a reserve fund instead of issuing over 13,500 vouchers to Chicago families who need affordable housing assistance.  For example, the Atlanta Housing Authority has at least 20 employees receiving annual compensation ranging between $150,000 and $300,000 per year. The executive director explained that these high salaries are necessary ``to both `attract and retain' competent staff.''  The executive director of the Philadelphia Housing Authority also received a high salary over $300,000 per year. He also threw lavish parties, provided patronage to friends and supporters, and secretly paid sexual harassment claims.  Instead of providing safe, affordable housing for those in need, housing authority officials are using Federalfunding to feather their own nests. HUD tells me these problems are anomalies, which lead me to believe the Department may be turning a blind eye to program failures no matter what the costs.  Both the HUD inspector general and the Government Accountability Office, or GAO, audited the MTW program. Both determined that little program oversight is actually being done. HUD has no procedures to verify agency self-reported performance data and HUD officials weren't even aware that they were required to perform annual risk assessments. HUD also has no program-wide performance indicators that would help determine if this program is a success or failure.  Worse yet, HUD never performed mandatory program evaluations to determine if the agencies complied with their MTW agreements or whether they should still be in the program. Department officials said they lack the funding to performing the evaluations. Under the current budget climate, additional funding may not be available anytime soon. In other words, HUD can't tell me if the Moving to Work program actually works or if it will work in the future.  GAO officials informed me that the agency may be close to closing three recommendations. For the other five recommendations, they are waiting for HUD to provide additional documentation about what steps are being taken or what is needed to close each of them. Instead of taking steps to improve program performance and provide more effective oversight, the Agency is, instead, rushing to extend contracts for an additional ten years.  I expect a lot more answers and accountability before there is a vote on Ms. Castro Ramirez's nomination. HUD must also refrain from adding new housing authorities to the MTW program until the agency provides GAO with the requested information and a definitive timeline for closing the outstanding recommendations.  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in the Record, as follows:                                                 November 7, 2014.     Hon. Julian Castro,     Secretary, U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development,          Washington, DC.       Dear Secretary Castro: We represent housing advocates who      work with clients and community members in the jurisdictions      of public housing agencies (PHAs) that have Moving to Work      (MTW) status. We look forward to working with you to further      HUD's mission to create strong, sustainable, inclusive      communities and quality affordable homes for all.       We are writing to ask HUD to take immediate action to      create a more open, inclusive, and transparent process as HUD      negotiates the terms for any potential extensions to Moving      to Work Agreements past their current 2018 expiration.      Consistent with the statutory language creating the MTW      program, we specifically request that HUD consult with      advocates during the contract negotiations. Indeed, Congress      was clear that ''in making assessments throughout the      demonstration, the Secretary shall consult with      representatives of public housing agencies and residents.''      As a first step, we urge HUD to make the baseline language it      is crafting for MTW extension contracts available for public      comment and discussion, and solicit and consider input from      resident and community advocates on the conditions for      extensions and the terms of the extension agreements.       As you undoubtedly know, HUD's MTW demonstration is steeped      in controversy. In addition to receiving criticism from      advocacy agencies providing services to PHA residents in      deregulated jurisdictions, HUD's own Office of the Inspector      General and the U.S. Government Accountability Office have      released studies critical of the MTW program's underlying      structure and HUD's implementation and oversight of the      program, including the GAO's 2012 Evaluation and the HUD IG's      2013 Study. These studies indicate that the Moving to Work      program lacks performance standards and evaluation, and HUD      has not provided critical oversight to agencies participating      in the MTW program to evaluate agencies' compliance with      statutory requirements or verify agencies' self-reported      performance data.       Based on these pervasive critiques, we believe that any      extension of the MTW demonstration must be done with      thoughtfulness, diligence, and open discussion of the lessons      learned from HUD's previous experiments in deregulation,      which simply have not demonstrated any of the programmatic      results this venture was designed to achieve.       The current MTW Agreements do not expire until 2018. We      understand that HUD's stated goal for beginning MTW extension      discussions in 2014 has been to develop better tools and      standards to enable more effective regulation and oversight      of MTW Agencies moving forward. We support any process that      will ensure that new language in MTW contracts will provide      clear metrics for performance, clear processes for      evaluation, and clear protocols for HUD to monitor and      enforce Agencies' compliance with statutory requirements and      standards, even amidst the flexibility the MTW program      intentionally allows.       We strongly support some goals HUD has put forward for the      extensions, including establishing requirements that agencies      use the bulk of their voucher funds for vouchers, higher      baselines to determine if agencies are assisting      ``substantially the same'' number of families, and more      rigorous evaluation of policies that pose risks to      participants. Effective requirements in these areas would      have major benefits for low-income families. Without more      information on the details, however, it is impossible for us      to assess whether the changes HUD plans will bring about      meaningful improvements.       As advocacy organizations who work with tenants who are the      ``end-users'' of HUD's programs in regions de-regulated under      the MTW program, we believe we have experiences and      observations that can help contribute to HUD's success in      amending the program.       We have documented concerns with the current MTW Agreements      that are not adequately addressed by the limited information      HUD has released about the planned extensions. These concerns      include but are not limited to:       How new MTW Agreements will prevent de-regulated PHAs from      diverting significant resources out of their housing programs      into unrestricted cash reserves or towards other questionable      uses such as excessive executive compensation. These actions      clearly contradict MTW's statutory goal to, ``reduce cost and      achieve greater cost effectiveness.'' The agreements should,      for example, include clear limits on reserve levels and      specific sanctions for agencies that exceed those limits.       How HUD will evaluate the real effects of proposed or      existing major policy changes allowed under MTW, such as time      limits, work requirements, and major rent changes, to assess      whether these changes are achieving the program's statutory      goals of helping families achieve economic self-sufficiency      and increasing housing choice, or instead just creating a      revolving door of homelessness and hardship. HUD has      indicated that it will require more rigorous evaluation of      some new policies, but it should also seek to evaluate      policies already in place and should make clear that it will      prohibit agencies from adopting risky measures like time      limits and work requirements unless funding for a rigorous      evaluation is available.       How HUD will define, monitor, and enforce, the new standard      of 90% voucher utilization, both before and after new MTW      agreements go into effect. This standard will be far more      effective if HUD uses the voucher funding formula to enforce      it, and if it prohibits agencies from counting funds spent      for purposes other than rental assistance toward voucher      utilization.       How HUD will define and enforce the requirement to assist      substantially the same number of families. HUD has indicated      that it will adjust the baseline number of families agencies      must assist upward, but unless HUD also defines ``assisted      families'' to include only families receiving substantial      rental assistance this requirement will have little meaning.       How HUD will ensure appropriate hardship exemptions are in      place.       How HUD will ensure MTWA jurisdictions increase housing      choices and mobility to opportunity communities among program      participants.       Thank you for considering this request.       Through a collaborative, thoughtful, transparent and      inclusive approach, we are confident that we can work with      HUD and participating public housing agencies to create      targeted revisions to the MTW program which clarify      performance metrics, and create clear processes for      evaluation and oversight. Our goal is to create a structure      that provides both flexibility and discipline--A well-     considered framework for any continuation of the program will      better ensure we realize the original goals of the MTW      program, which were to expand housing choice, increase cost      effectiveness, and help families achieve self-sufficiency.       Congratulations on your confirmation as HUD Secretary.
