 President, today the Budget Committee is scheduled to report out the budget reconciliation spending bill. Unfortunately, I was unable to be present for the final vote, but had I been here I would have voted ``aye.''  Several months ago I made a commitment to the graduating class at North Seattle Community College that I would be honored to be their 1997 commencement speaker. This commitment was extremely important to me and the graduating class, I simply could not back out at the last minute. Today's Budget Committee mark up was not finalized until last night.  I am extremely troubled by some of the provisions within the reconciliation package as I believe that they violate the bipartisan balanced budget agreement that was recently adopted. I am also disappointed that the committee will not have final legislative language and final CBO numbers on parts of the Finance Committee sections. It is difficult to understand why the leadership is in such a rush to complete action on major changes to Medicare and Medicaid. This rush to bring this bill to the floor does jeopardize our efforts to enact a balanced budget.  As we all know the Budget Committee cannot amend the reconciliation legislation. This will be done on the floor next week. At that time I will be supporting amendments that ensure this package is in compliance with the agreement and that it does not violate our commitment to our Nation's senior citizens and our children. We must seize on this unique opportunity to balance the budget, reform Medicare and expand health benefits for children. Unfortunately, as it stands now it does not appear that the current reconciliation language will achieve these goals.  Today's action by the Budget Committee is an important step in the process which is why I would have voted to report the measure to the full Senate. This does not mean that the package is one I will support when it reaches the floor. I am simply acting to move us closer to achieving a balanced budget.  I am disappointed that this legislation does violate the agreement that we worked so hard to achieve. But, I am hopeful that significant improvements will be made on the floor and that we can sent to the President a bill that he can sign.                          ____________________
