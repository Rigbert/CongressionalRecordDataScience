Chairman, I yield myself such time as I may consume. I would say to the gentleman from Connecticut, as he knows, I have been in favor of this concept since I first came to Congress almost 6 years ago. I am happy to hear that he raises 99 percent of his campaign contributions within his congressional district. I would daresay that there are some folks here that raise 99 percent of their campaign contributions outside of their congressional district. And so at what level is a fair and reasonable amount to raise within your own congressional district?  I would think that most Americans, and I have seen polling documents as all of us have, that most Americans believe that you should raise at least half of your campaign contributions within your congressional district. The argument that folks in poorer districts would not be able to raise funds, all I would say is that all people who would run in that seat are playing under the same limitations, so that the playing field is leveled.  I think it is important that people back home realize that the people who are elected to Congress at least represent them, if money is important and the reason we are here tonight on campaign finance reform is that we are going back and building the base within our own congressional districts and raising money back home. I think in years past, that was the case. We have gotten away from that. I think that this amendment will go a long ways to bringing back confidence within the system. I would urge my colleagues to support this amendment.  Mr. Chairman, I reserve the balance of my time.
