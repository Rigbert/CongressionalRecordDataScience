Speaker, today I urge all Members to join in commending William J. ``Bill'' Boarman, who honorably and skillfully led the Government Printing Office, GPO, as the 26th Public Printer from January 3, 2011, to January 3, 2012.  Bill slashed agency spending dramatically by eliminating nonessential hires, cutting needless travel, restricting use of overtime and reducing the GPO's annual spending plan for 2011 by 15 percent. He held the line on salary increases consistently with the President's government-wide pay freeze. Bill created a specialized task force to collect funds owed to GPO and within months collected over a third of the money due, some outstanding for seven years.  To avoid potential lay-offs in the future, Bill authorized a buyout of up to 15 percent of his workforce, but excluding from eligibility employees in mission-critical positions. Together with his restrictions on new hires, the buyout plan achieved 94 percent of its goal and reduced the GPO's staffing to its lowest level in a century. This achievement will save GPO and taxpayers tens of millions of dollars in future years.  Bill also worked with the two appropriations committees to provide GPO with funding 15 percent below the prior year but which nonetheless assures GPO's ability to perform its essential functions. To address questions about the work GPO performs for Congress, Bill provided persuasive testimony on the value of the printing services that the GPO performs while at the same time ordering the first-ever survey of Congress's printing requirements. This precedent-setting work, which was commended by the House Appropriations Committee, resulted in the largest single-year percentage reduction in the number of printed Congressional Records delivered to Congress since the GPO began to transition to online versions in 1994.  As a result of these and other efforts, Bill's annual report to Congress reported that the GPO ended the year with a net income of $5.6 million, a positive result validated by an external auditor. Yet Bill's leadership at the GPO was about more than cutting costs and improving financial returns. He made customer service GPO's primary strategic goal, a direction that earned the agency applause in a government-wide agency survey. He put GPO on Facebook and ordered the development and release of the GPO's first mobile Web application. While continuing the development of GPO's online Federal Digital System and the GPO's plan for a new automated composition system, he emphasized efficiency and agency control over the GPO's digital systems rather than ceding operations to contractors. He devised and won approval for a new annual investment and spending plan for the GPO that is 6 percent less than his previous year's plan, and which puts the GPO on a path finally to begin retiring several presses that are more than 30 years old.  In other areas of the GPO, Bill's achievements were equally impressive. For example, he pushed forward with aggressive plans to make more GPO space available for lease to other agencies, and at the end of the year the GPO was in active negotiations with several organizations. As a former proofreader at the GPO, his return to the agency restored confidence and bolstered employee morale. Under his watch the GPO observed its 150th anniversary, opening an exhibit of its history to the public and issuing a new book on its past, Keeping America Informed. Last month Bill made GPO history by appointing a highly qualified senior manager, Ms. Davita Vance-Cooks, as Deputy Public Printer, the first woman ever to hold that post, and with Bill's departure, she is today the first woman ever to head the agency.  Mr. Speaker, Bill Boarman's tenure as Public Printer set a new standard of achievement for his successors to emulate. In my judgment, the actions of a handful of Senators to block an up-or-down vote on the President's nomination of Bill Boarman deprived Congress, Federal agencies, and the American public of his faithful service during this time of difficult transition when most needed.  Regardless what may come next, Bill Boarman can leave the Government Printing Office confident that GPO is better than when he found it, and that he has left it in good and capable hands. Please join me in offering the thanks of a grateful Nation to a dedicated public servant. We wish Bill only the best.                          ____________________
