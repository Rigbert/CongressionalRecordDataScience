President, when George Voinovich came to the Senate in 1998, he brought with him a wealth of experience as a State legislator, county commissioner, mayor, and Governor. More important, he brought an independent mind, common sense, and a commitment to results.  Through more than four decades of public service, he has always been guided by the principle that a fundamental obligation of government is to honor its responsibilities to citizens. His goal has always been to ensure that those in public office ``work harder and smarter, and do more with less.''  But Senator Voinovich is revered here and at home for deeds, not words. As mayor, he brought Cleveland back from bankruptcy and led its transformation into a three-time All-America City. As Governor, he steered Ohio through the recession of the early 1990s, turned a State budget in the red back to black, and helped rebuild Ohio's industry and infrastructure for the 21st century.  From his executive background in local and State government, Senator Voinovich knew that any government is only as good as the people working for it. He has been a strong advocate for improved government management, and for recruiting, retaining, rewarding, and recognizing the best government workforce.  It has been my privilege to work closely with Senator Voinovich on the Homeland Security and Governmental Affairs Committee. He is devoted to protecting our Nation and our people.  Our committee's work was aided greatly by his leadership of the Subcommittee on Oversight and Government Management, and his conviction that government works only when it ensures that the right people have the right resources to get the job done. He has been instrumental in virtually every major civil service issue for more than a decade and has championed 17 pieces of legislation to transform and improve our Federal workforce.  Since coming to Washington, the ``Workforce Senator'' has been a watchdog for the interests of the taxpayers and of government employees. Early in his service, the Senior Executive Service Performance Improvement Act and the Chief Human Capital Officers Act recognized that the Federal Government must compete if it is to attract the best. In this Congress, the Federal Hiring Process Improvement Act addressed the need to streamline recruiting so that the right person can be hired at the right time.  And his efforts have been successful. A recent Federal employee survey on the best places to work found that the top three agencies--the Nuclear Regulatory Commission, GAO, and NASA--are the agencies with the personnel flexibilities Senator Voinovich worked to achieve.  I know how deeply George Voinovich cares about the men and women who serve as Federal employees because on many issues we have fought together. In particular, I want to recognize his role in pressing for pay for performance reforms in our Federal workforce. If we want an effective government, we must encourage excellence in our workforce, as Senator Voinovich clearly understands.  He has been an effective voice for fiscal discipline, for comprehensive tax and entitlement reform, and for enhancing America's competitiveness in a global economy. All of these issues and so many more demonstrate his commitment to honoring responsibilities and achieving results.  When Senator Voinovich announced early last year that he would not seek reelection, the outpouring of tributes was heartfelt and bipartisan. As one Ohio newspaper wrote, ``Once he latches on to an issue, he doesn't let go until he is satisfied with the outcome.''  Senator Voinovich's determination, combined with wisdom, experience, and decency, made him an outstanding U.S. Senator and public servant. I thank George Voinovich for his years of service and for his friendship, and wish him and Janet all the best in the years to come.                             Russ Feingold
