 President, I have joined Senators Boxer and Durbin in introducing legislation that would rename the federal courthouse in Sacramento, CA, in honor of recently deceased U.S. Representative Robert T. Matsui. This represents a fitting tribute to a great man and a dedicated public servant.  On January 1, 2005, the people of the Sacramento area, the State of California, and the Nation suffered a great loss when Bob Matsui passed away. For 26 years in Congress and 7 years before that as a member of the Sacramento City Council, Bob was a reasoned and dependable voice. A problem solver, Bob was a thoughtful and constructive leader who brought people together to find solutions to public policy issues.  I had the distinct pleasure of working with Bob on a number of issues relating to our home State of California. I will remember him as a great human being, as a trusted colleague, as a fine public servant, and someone in whom I was proud to place friendship, respect, and collegiality.  Proud of his ideals, Bob never let disagreement lead to rancor. The sheer number of tributes paid from both sides of the aisle clearly demonstrates the enormous respect he inspired among his colleagues. Likewise, the tremendous outpouring of support shown at services held in his honor reminds us just how endeared he had become to those he represented over the years.  Bob's path to public service was greatly fueled by experiences in his youth, especially his internment along with thousands of other Japanese Americans during World War II.  When he was just six months old, Bob and his family were sent to an internment camp in Northern California, leaving behind their home and their livelihood. Bob would spend the first four years of his life there.  I think this experience had a very sobering impact on his life. But rather than let it lead to resentment and hatred, I think it had an impact on his knowing what he wanted to do with his life, and that was public service.  In fact, one of Bob's most significant legacies will be the work he did to help the Government make amends with the Japanese Americans who were interned like himself.  As a member of Congress, Bob was successful in passing legislation that offered a formal apology from the Government for the internment program and provided compensation to victims. This is a great legacy and it will be remembered well.  Bob also excelled in his knowledge and expertise of Social Security as well as tax and trade policy. He had an influential place on the House Ways and Means Committee, which will miss his leadership.  The Sacramento area, where Bob was born and which he represented for over three decades in public office, shows numerous examples of Bob's achievements. From the light-rail train system to comprehensive flood protection, Bob's mark is everywhere.  The renaming of this particular courthouse in Bob's honor is especially fitting. During his career in Congress, Bob was instrumental in obtaining more than $142 million in federal funding for the courthouse.  Bob did what he did extraordinarily well. Throughout his career he showed that he was a skilled politician as well as a great policymaker. His constituents considered themselves lucky to have his representation, and I consider myself lucky to have known him.  Through his many accomplishments, Bob Matsui secured his legacy of devoted public service. I offer my gratitude for his service and support this legislation in his honor.                          ____________________
