President, I join as a sponsor in this amendment to the budget resolution. Last year I offered a similar amendment that was adopted by the Senate. Unfortunately, Congress did not follow through on our commitment. Last year the budget for fighting crime was never finalized. It was only recently that we arrived at a budget resolution for a fiscal year now more than half over. This had a devastating impact on anticrime grant programs and should not be repeated.  I am glad to join with Senator Biden in this resolution to preserve the violent crime reduction trust fund. Our purpose is to reaffirm our commitment and appreciation for Federal, State, and local law enforcement and the outstanding job that they do under the most difficult and dangerous circumstances, and to reject the House's attempts drastically to cut our financial support for their efforts.  Over the last few years there has been a lot of public debate and comment about the activities of law enforcement and the rhetoric that has been used to disparage and malign these dedicated public servants and the law enforcement agencies in which they serve. I submit that law enforcement deserves better. We owe these men and women our respect, appreciation and public, moral and financial support.  The gruesome fact is that there are increasing threats against the safety and lives of law enforcement officers--the bombing of offices in Texas only yesterday, the Oklahoma City bombing, reports of attacks against park rangers, Forest Service employees, Treasury employees and others. The dedicated men and women in Federal, State, and local government and law enforcement work long hours for limited financial reward in order to serve the public, protect us and preserve our freedom.  It is in this context that I am concerned that the House of Representatives has again voted to cut law enforcement resources. The House voted on May 16 to cut $300 million from the President's request for the violent crime reduction trust fund for fiscal year 1997. Last year the House voted to offset certain tax reduction proposals by cutting $5 billion from the violent crime reduction trust fund. Invading the violent crime reduction trust fund makes it impossible to pay for the law enforcement and crime prevention programs of the Violent Crime Control Act of 1994. This is bad policy and willlead to weakened law enforcement. I hope and trust that our Senate colleagues will reject this cut in funding to Federal law enforcement and Federal assistance to State and local efforts.  When we passed the Violet Crime Control and Law Enforcement Act in 1994, we paid for its programs. A trust fund was established from the downsizing of the Federal Government by some 250,000 jobs. The violent crime reduction trust fund contains funds dedicated to law enforcement and crime prevention programs, and is intended in large part to provide Federal financial assistance to critical Federal, State and local needs. Since passage of the Violent Crime Control Act, the U.S. Department of Justice has been doing a tremendous job getting these resources to the field. I commend the Associate Attorney General John Schmidt and Chief Joe Brann, who direct the community policing programs, for their quick work. I know that funding to assist local law enforcement to hire additional officers went out almost immediately based on a simple, one-page application. Vermont received commitments of over $3 million toward 64 new officers in 34 jurisdictions, for example.  The House would have us turn our backs on law enforcement and prevention programs and the commitments we made in the Violent Crime Control Act. Law enforcement and community-based programs cannot be kept on a string like a yo-yo if they are to plan and implement crime control and prevention programs. Funding for important programs implementing the Violence Against Women Act and our rural crime initiatives should not be delayed or cut again. What we need to do is to follow through on our commitments, not to breach them and violate our pledge to law enforcement, State and local government and the American people. Invading trust funds dedicated to crime control purposes is no way to proceed and no way to restore people's trust and respect for government and the commitments that it makes.  I will continue to work with the Attorney General and my Senate colleagues to reject the ill-advised House action. I will work to preserve the violent crime reduction trust fund so that we can fulfil the promise of the Violent Crime Control and Law Enforcement Act and our commitment to do all that we can to reduce violent crime in our local communities. This is not the time to undercut our support for Federal law enforcement or the assistance provided State and local law enforcement. We offer this amendment as an embodiment of the Senate's resolve against the House-passed cuts to the violent crime reduction trust fund and reductions in funding of Federal, State, and local law enforcement. The House-passed cuts to law enforcement funding are not the way to show our support for those women and men whom we ask to protect public safety and preserve our precious freedoms.  THE PRESIDING OFFICER. The question is on agreeing to the amendment.  The amendment (No. 4037) was agreed to.                Amendment No. 4027 to amendment No. 4012
