 It will create thousands of jobs and put in place the infrastructure for us to make sure we are competitive in the future.  It is disheartening to me that this bill has now been hijacked by a political debate, an amendment to repeal health care reform. Not every bill has to become political. Unfortunately, that is what we have today because we have an offer of an amendment to repeal health care reform. Let me speak to that amendment.  Last year, I watched as President Obama signed health care reform into law with a young man by the name of Marcelas Owens. He stood just a few feet away from the President. I met Marcelas a few months earlier at a rally in Seattle, and he told me a story that stayed with me throughout the health care debate. I want to mention it again.  Marcelas, a little boy, came up to me at this health care rally. He leaned in close to me and he said he wanted to tell me about his mom named Tifanny. She was a single mom, working hard. She got sick and lost her job. Because she lost her job, she lost her health care. Because she lost her health care, she lost her life. Little Marcelas looked up at me and said: Please don't let this happen to any other little boy. Please pass health care.  I was proud when that health care reform law was passed and is now working to make sure Marcelas and thousands of other little kids do not get into that terrible situation through which he has lived.  He was not alone. I heard from thousands of people from my home State of Washington who were demanding reform to the system we have. I heard from small business owners who wanted to cover their employees but they could not continue to do it because of the skyrocketing premiums. I heard from moms and dads who wanted to cover their children but they were getting rejected because their son or daughter had a preexisting condition. I heard from seniors who were desperate because they had fallen into the doughnut hole.
