. 1628, and I ask unanimous consent that it be printed in the Record. The motion is supported by Senators Blumenthal, Coons, and Carper.  For years, Republicans painted a drastic, dire picture of the Affordable Care Act. Just this week, President Trump talked about the so-called forgotten victims of the ACA.  The ACA isn't perfect--no law is--but to say it hasn't been a landmark achievement for our Nation and for my State would be absolutely wrong.  Our country's uninsured rate is at the lowest level in our Nation's history. In Illinois, our uninsured rate has been cut in half. These insurance gains are thanks to the Affordable Care Act.  Insurance companies can no longer deny someone coverage or charge them sky-high premiums because of a preexisting condition, benefitting roughly 5 million Illinoisans.  Insurance companies can no longer charge women more than men, drop someone from coverage when they get sick, charge seniors exorbitantly more than younger people for insurance, or refuse to cover important and essential health benefits.  I think these consumer protections represent a step forward in healthcare for people nationwide, and I don't believe we should get rid of them.  So my motion would instruct the Finance Committee to report out a bill--within 3 days--that would let any State keep the ACA if they want.-  These Republican repeal proposals are cruel and dangerous. States ought to be able to keep the ACA if they want, including all the record coverage gains, consumer protections and benefits, and Federal funding for the Medicaid expansion and tax credits.  If Senator Cruz wants to rip away health insurance ``root and branch'' from his constituents, that is fine.  But this motion protects any State who thinks we have made too much progress to turn back.  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in the Record, as follows:                   Motion to Commit With Instructions       Mr. Durbin moves to commit the bill H.R. 1628 to the      Committee on Health, Education, Labor, and Pension with      instructions to report the same back to the Senate in 3 days,      not counting any day on which the Senate is not in session,      with changes that--       (1) are within the jurisdiction of such Committee; and       (2) permit a State to continue to implement the provisions      of the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act (Public Law      111-148), as in effect on the date of enactment of this Act,      if the Governor of that State elects to continue such      implementation, including provisions relating to health      insurance coverage gains, consumer protections and benefits      (including protections related to coverage of pre-existing      conditions, essential health benefits, and the premium levels      that older enrollees may be charged relative to younger      enrollees), and Federal funding provided under that Act      (including levels of Medicaid funding for the Medicaid      expansion population, Federal funding for tax credits, and      cost sharing reduction subsidies).
