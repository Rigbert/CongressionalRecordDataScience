Chairman, I yield myself such time as I may consume.  As we close this evening, I just want to say that the gentlewoman from South Dakota (Ms. Herseth) and I intend to offer a biofuels amendment tomorrow to the bill with great hope that we can help push America into a new energy age, a new renewable energy age, starting right in rural America; and I wanted to acknowledge that while she is still on the floor with us tonight.  I did also want to, for the record, thank deeply Roger Szemraj of our own staff for the tremendous work that he does and for the time he takes away from his own family to be with us even tonight on this floor as we move this important bill for fiscal year 2005 agriculture appropriations.  Mr. Chairman, I have no further requests for time, and I yield back the balance of my time.
