President, I would like to take a moment to bid a fondfarewell to one of our most senior senators, Senator Wendell Ford, who, despite my objections, is leaving the Senate this year. I think that all members will agree that his departure will be a loss for the Senate and nation, as we are losing one of our most respected and well-liked Senators.  Senator Ford and I began our careers in the United States Senate together--24 years ago. It seeks like just yesterday we were the new kids on the block, trying to get the hang of the Senate. A lot has changed from those early days, as Senator Ford has proudly served the people of Kentucky while serving on the Committees on Rules and Administration (where he is ranking member), Commerce, Science, and Transportation, Energy and Natural Resources, and the Joint Committee on Printing (where he was formerly Chairman).  Hailing from Thurston, Kentucky, Senator Ford has brought to the Senate a long and distinguished career as well as the down-home common sense for which he is known. A graduate of the University of Kentucky, Wendell went on to serve in the United States Army in 1944-1946 and in the Kentucky Army National Guard for 13 years. Senator Ford has long been associated with public service, as he served as a Kentucky state senator, lieutenant governor and as Kentucky's 49th Governor.  Senator Ford has come a long way from being a new kid on the U.S. Senate block in 1974 to becoming the longest serving Senator from Kentucky today. And, I might add, he is now one of the most senior members of the entire Senate and one who follows the old traditions of the Senate as one who always keeps his word.  Throughout his tenure in the U.S. Senate, Wendell has been recognized as a national leader in campaign-finance reform, energy issues, and, of course, looking out for our nation's tobacco farmers. That has never been as much as an issue as it has this past year, with Congress' attempts at passing tobacco legislation.  A friend to the environment, Senator Ford was the first to introduce and pass a program instructing the federal government to be a model for the country and use recycled printed paper. This program is now the rule rather than the exception in the federal government, as well as schools and businesses throughout the United States.  It is with much regret that I say goodbye to Senator Ford. He has been a great friend all of these years in the Senate, and I will miss him greatly. I hope that retirement brings him plenty of time to spend with his wife, Jean, and their five grandchildren. Knowing Wendell, however, I have no doubt that retirement will be neither quiet nor slow him down.                          ____________________
