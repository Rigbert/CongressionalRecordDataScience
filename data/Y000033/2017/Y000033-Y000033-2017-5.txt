Mr. Chairman, I have an amendment that was successfully included in the House fiscal year 2017, which prohibits funds in this act being used to implement the Obama administration National Park Service rule that interferes with the State's wildlife management authority on national preserved lands of Alaska.  Mr. Chairman, when we became a State, we were guaranteed to have management of all Federal lands and State lands on fish and wildlife management. Under the Obama administration, they tried to do differently on the wildlife lands, and now they are trying to do it on the BLM lands and the park preserves, not the parks themselves.  I suggest, respectfully, if you want to follow the law, you adopt this amendment, as it should be, as is proposed, and we will be able to manage lands we were guaranteed by this Congress to the State of Alaska.  Mr. Chairman, I reserve the balance of my time.
