Speaker, I rise today at the request of the Auxiliary of the Joseph W. Diehn American Legion Post in Toledo, Oh. The auxiliary has asked that its 2000 Annual Americanism Program be officially recognized, and I am pleased to submit the auxiliary's report for the record. The American Legion Auxiliary continues to play a vital role in holding dear the flame of freedom and imbuing its spirit in generations of young people through its annual Americanism program. Further, the program benefits the young participants directly by awarding academic scholarships to winners.  The Joseph W. Diehn American Legion Post Auxiliary's Legislative Chair, Jane Ann Rhoades submits:  ``On February 20, 2000, J.W. Diehn held its annual Americanism program. The program was opened by Sylvania's Town Crier. Colors were posted by the newly formed Post Color Guard. The program was attended by local dignitaries including Sylvania's Mayor, Craig Stough, and Lucas County Commissioner Harry Barlos.  ``The Sylvania Southview band played the `Star Spangled Banner' and several patriotic hymns, including those of each branch of the armed services.  ``The Americanism and Government test winners were presented with scholarships. This year's topic was `Voting and the Importance of One Vote.' The winners were Chung Van Koh of Southview, Karen Wabeke of Northview, and Mike Samples of Northview. The government test winners were Rustam Salari of Southview, Jeff Allota of Northview, and Alexi Osborne of Southview.  ``Miss Poppy, Cortney Furguson, read the `Poppy Story.' The program concluded with the singing of ``God Bless the USA.'''                          ____________________
