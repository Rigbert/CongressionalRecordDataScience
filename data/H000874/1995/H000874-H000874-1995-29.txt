Speaker, I say to my friend, the gentleman from Michigan [Mr. Smith], you had an opportunity to do that yesterday. The gentleman from Texas [Mr. Stenholm], who has been the most outspoken advocate of a balanced budget on this floor in either party, I suggest to you, and in fact it was the Stenholm constitutional amendment that passed this House this year, as the gentleman knows who got up on the floor yesterday and said, ``Let us defeat the previous question, put the coalition budget on the floor with an open rule.''  The coalition budget, as you know, cuts more money than the Republican budget that we passed. It has less of a deficit. Next year, the year after, as a matter of fact, as you know, your budget has a very substantial deficit in the first 2 years. It does not cut taxes. It preserves, as the President has indicated, Medicare and Medicaid at numbers that the President, I believe, could sign. It is a cut, as you know, substantial, more than some on my side could support, but the fact of the matter is every Republican Member voted against allowing that on this floor.
