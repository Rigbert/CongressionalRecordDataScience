 President, as I have indicated, gosh, at least for 6 weeks now, we are going to deal with the Lynch nomination right after we finish trafficking.  I am optimistic that we will be able to do trafficking in 1 day. There is not a huge demand for amendments. As I have assured my friend the Democratic leader and our colleagues, then we will move forward on the nominee for Attorney General.  Therefore, I object to the modification.
