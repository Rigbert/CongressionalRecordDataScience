President, I am honored today to congratulate 19 girls from Oklahoma for receiving the highest youth award in Girl Scouting, the Gold Award. I would like to honor Jamie Andrews, Tiffany Marie Cathey, Anna Elizabeth Davis, Alonna Marie Dray, Bridget Gibbons, Ashley Goodman, Justinn N. Hamby, Molly Elizabeth Henry, Laura Hopkins, Beth Johnson, Grace E. Lewis, Pammy Mackiewicz, Sarah Pierce, Alexanne E. Schallner, Haley Taylor, Joy-Lee Stowe, Kimberly L. Watson, Kaitlyn Willit, and Alicia Koch.  Girl Scouts of the USA, an organization serving more than 2.5 million girls, has awarded more than 25,000 Girl Scout Gold Awards to Senior Girl Scouts since the beginning of the program in 1980. To receive the award, a Girl Scout must fulfill four requirements: earn the Girl Scout Gold Leadership Award, earn the Girl Scout Gold Career Award, earn the Girl Scout Gold Become, Belong, Believe, Build Award, and design and implement a Girl Scout Gold Award Project. They also have to complete a plan for fulfilling the requirements of the award and follow through with close cooperation between a community consultant and an adult Girl Scout volunteer.  The Gold Award symbolizes outstanding accomplishments in the areas of leadership, community service, career planning, and personal development. In achieving this prestigious award these young women show their dedication and commitment to their families, community, the Girl Scouts, and their country. I am honored to congratulate these recipients of this award from the State of Oklahoma.                          ____________________
