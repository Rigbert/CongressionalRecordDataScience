 President, I rise to pay tribute to my good friend and an extraordinary leader of my hometown of Louisville, KY: Dr. James Ramsey, the president of the University of Louisville. President Ramsey celebrated a milestone for the University of Louisville recently when it was announced that UofL was unanimously welcomed into the Atlantic Coast Conference.  The ACC has a great history, a proud athletic tradition, and is home to some truly astonishing academic schools. Thanks to Jim's work as president over the last decade, the University of Louisville is able to stand toe to toe with any of them, in any of those categories.  Dr. Ramsey is the 17th president of the university, and has held that post since 2002. In his 10 years at the helm, he has worked every day to make UofL one of the very best metropolitan research universities in the country. It is safe to say, he is succeeding.  Since 2002, the quality of UofL's freshman class has improved every year, with the average incoming freshman ACT score rising from 23.2 in 2002 to 24.7 in 2011. The graduation rate has increased nearly 60 percent, and the number of doctoral degrees awarded by the school has more than doubled since 2002.  UofL students are also winning national acclaim and prestigious academic honors. In 2009, UofL produced its fourth Rhodes Scholar, who was also the first woman from UofL to win the award.  In 2010 and 2011, 14 UofL students won coveted Fulbright scholarships, placing UofL among the nation's top 20 Fulbright-producing institutions each year. Since 2003, 68 UofL students have received Fulbright scholarships, which is more than all other Kentucky schools combined.  President Ramsey has created a university culture that is focused on research and innovation. This approach has already led to major milestones in health care, business, and the environment. The Chronicle of Higher Education lists the University of Louisville as the fourth fastest growing research university in the country.  UofL's research funding has doubled from a decade ago, and UofL is one of the country's fastest growing research universities in National Institutes of Health funding.  UofL has also strengthened its ties with the city of Louisville in such a way that this school is an invaluable asset, not just to its students, faculty, and alumni, but to all members of the community. UofL has been a major player in the award-winning Partnership for a Green City with Jefferson County Public Schools and Louisville Metro government.  It has also launched a Signature Partnership Initiative to improve education, health care, social services, and economic opportunity in the city. The school is also reaching out to men and women in the Armed Forces, signing education, training, and research agreements with Fort Knox and the Kentucky National Guard.  All of these accomplishments in the last decade have transformed the University of Louisville from a fine local institution to a superb global one--one able to compete with any school in the quality of its students and the caliber of its research. Exciting things are happening at the university, and we have Jim Ramsey to thank.  I want to salute Dr. Ramsey and congratulate him on his superb leadership of the school I am proud to call my alma mater. He and his wife Jane are fixtures of the community, and Elaine and I are honored to call them friends.  I certainly hope Jim will be at the helm of UofL for a long time to come. I will always look forward to working with him on ways to better the school and the city that we both love.                          ____________________
