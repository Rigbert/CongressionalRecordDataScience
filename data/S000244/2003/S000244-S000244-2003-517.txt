Speaker, I rise today in support of recognizing Pancreatic Cancer Awareness Month. This resolution comes at a fitting time for me and other Members and staff in the House. I recently lost a good friend and former aide, Barry Beringer, to pancreatic cancer.  Barry was a remarkable man, a warm friend and a consummate counsel. His love of history permeated his work as a Committee General Counsel. His warmth and gently inclusive approach to difficult negotiations and situations made him a friend to all, even to those who may have disagreed with him. His pure motives earned him universal respect and admiration from his friends and colleagues.  Barry served as my General Counsel during my tenure as Chairman of the House Science Committee. His sage advice, thoughtful perspective, and his respect for the history of the institution guided many a decision. His counsel was invaluable and will be missed greatly not only by me but by all who worked with him and around him. His warm humor and collegial approach to everything is unique in this institution . . . and will be missed.  In addition to being a loving husband and father, Barry was a loving human being who left us all richer for having known and worked with him.  Congressman Platts introduced this important resolution to raise awareness of pancreatic cancer. Unfortunately, no one knows the exact causes of pancreatic cancer. Doctors are rarely able to explain why one person gets pancreatic cancer and another does not. I am pleased that the House is acknowledging this deadly disease and raising awareness of pancreatic cancer so others may not suffer the same fate as my friend Barry.                          ____________________
