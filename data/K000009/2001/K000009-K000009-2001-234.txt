Speaker, I am pleased to recognize an outstanding man in my district, Gunvantray B. Mehta, MD. Dr. Mehta was awarded the Key to the Golden Door Award by Toledo's International Institute on March 31, 2001. This award is given to a naturalized citizen who has made a significant contribution to the betterment of people. I join with people from throughout my community in congratulating Dr. Mehta on his receipt of this award.  Born in Gujarat, India, Dr. Mehta first traveled to New York in 1972 for advanced medical study in Radiology at the Nassau County Medical Center. He arrived in Toledo later in that decade, where he joined X-Ray Associates in 1978. Initially drawn to Toledo to be nearer family, Dr. Mehta was soon immersed in its vibrant and active Indian community. As a strong leader in that community, Dr. Mehta has long been involved in its signature events including productions of Ramayan and shakunthla. He organized a memorable seven day celebration culminating in the 1989 opening of Toledo's Hindu Temple and served as its first president. Dr. Mehta is also a leader in the medical community, and is an active participant in several local, state, and national professional organizations. He is currently the president of X-Ray Associates. Married to I'la, the couple has two children, daughter Dr. Minal and son Sandip.  The International Institute's tribute notes, ``When asked who was the one person who made the greatest impact on his life, Dr. Mehta quickly answers his mother. From her, he learned that helping people should become second nature, and without having to think about it, a way of life. She motivated him to strive for excellence.'' I have known Dr. Mehta for many years. He is a caring, generous, and deeply committed man. While putting the American Dream into action, he never lost touch with his ancestry, his faith, or his country of origin. He is an ambassador in the truest sense of the word. How fortunate our community has been to have the Mehta family a part of us.                          ____________________
