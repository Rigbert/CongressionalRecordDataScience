If the gentleman will yield, I accept that invitation as well as you have been so generously accepting my invitation to travel to the great State of Alaska and participate in the cuisine as provided by our great blue waters. If I go to Cape Cod, I hope I have the added attraction of having that which can be provided by your ocean to my palate regardless of what contract I will be working under for the last hundred days.
