Speaker, I rise today to introduce H.R. 1648, the Emergency Ambulance Services Access Act of 2001. This legislation will ensure payment for emergency hospital services and emergency ambulance services under a ``prudent layperson'' test under group health plans and health insurance coverage. I am pleased to be joined by my colleague Ed Towns in introducing this legislation, which we hope will be included in any patient protection legislation that moves through the House in this Congress.  Individuals suffering from what they have every reason to believe to be life threatening conditions should not have to call their insurance plan before they call for an ambulance. And patients and ambulance services should not be stuck with the bill should the condition turn out to be less than life-threatening once the patient is diagnosed in the emergency room.  Some people assume that because a patient protection bill which includes a prudent layperson standard for emergency room services also covers emergency ambulance services. But that wasn't the case at all before we introduced this legislation in the last Congress at the start of the debate over patient protection. Most of the bills amended the Emergency Medical Treatment and Active Labor Act. That Act covers only what happens after you enter the emergency room. It does not include ambulance services. As the debate progressed, most of the bills and amendments that received active consideration in the House and Senate were amended or redrafted to apply the prudent layperson standard specifically to emergency ambulance services.  I urge my colleagues to join me and Ed Towns in cosponsoring this legislation. You will be demonstrating your support for ensuring that emergency ambulance services are included in the more comprehensive patient protection legislation that will be considered in the House. To become a cosponsor or obtain further information, please call us or Jane Williams of my staff, who may be reached at 5-3761.                          ____________________
