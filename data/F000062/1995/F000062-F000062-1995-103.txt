 President, I introduce legislation that would overturn a 1990 U.S. Supreme Court decision in Adams Fruit Co. versus Barrett and restore workers' compensation as the exclusive remedy for loss under the Migrant and Seasonal Agricultural Worker Protection Act where a State workers' compensation law is applicable and coverage is provided.  This legislation embodies an agreement worked out by the National Council of Agricultural Employers and the Farmworkers Justice Fund and other farm worker advocacy groups. In the House this compromise will be offered as a substitute amendment to H.R. 1715, sponsored by Congressmen Goodling, Fazio and others.  By way of background, in 1985, 19 migrant farmworkers employed by the Adams Fruit Co. suffered injuries in an accident while they traveled to work in an Adams Fruit van. The company was found liable and the injured farmworkers were awarded damages to the fullest extent under Florida's workers' compensation system. In addition, 10 of the workers filed suit against Adams Fruit for motor safety violations under the Migrant and Seasonal Agricultural Worker Protection Act.  In the Adams Fruit decision, the U.S. Supreme Court held that the injured farmworkers could bring an action for damages under the Migrant and Seasonal Agricultural Worker Protection Act even though they were covered under State workers' compensation for the same injuries. In so ruling, the court disregarded one of the basic concepts of workers' compensation, the assurance of a prompt remedy in exchange for limited liability on the part of the employer. As a result, agricultural employers who pay the cost of workers' compensation for farmworkers are not receiving the protection from lawsuits that all other employers providing workers' compensation receive.  The legislation I am introducing today would reverse the effects of the Adams Fruit decision and restore the exclusivity of workers' compensation. Specifically, the bill:  Amends the Migrant and Seasonal Agricultural Worker Protection Act to provide that where workers' compensation coverage is provided under a State workers' compensation law for a migrant or seasonal agricultural worker, workers' compensation will be the farmworker's exclusive remedy and the employer's sole liability under the act for bodily injury or death;  Provides for increased statutory damages under the Migrant and Seasonal Agricultural Worker Protection Act in cases where actual damages are precluded because the worker's injury is covered under a State workers' compensation law and the court finds the defendant's actions meet certain criteria set forth in the legislation, such as the defendant knowingly permitting a driver to drive farmworkers while under the influence of alcohol;  Provides for tolling of the statute of limitations on actions brought under the Migrant and Seasonal Agricultural Worker Protection Act during the period of time a claim under a State workers' compensation law is pending;  Requires disclosure of information regarding workers' compensation coverage to migrant farmworkers and upon request to seasonal farmworkers, helping ensure that farmworkers have adequate information to file timely claims for workers' compensation; and  Allows the Secretary of Labor to determine the appropriate level of liability insurance required by employers engaged in transporting farmworkers, helping increase the ability of persons to obtain insurance.  Mr. President, the appropriate relationship between workers' compensation benefits and benefits available under the Migrant and Seasonal Agricultural Worker Protection Act has been debated at great length since the Adams Fruit decision. Many have tried to reconcile the legitimate interests of both agricultural employers and farmworkers in this issue. In the 102d Congress I sponsored legislation, and I worked very hard, meeting with representatives of agriculture from around the Nation, with representatives of farmworkers, with Congressman Fazio, with Congressman Berman and others, in an effort to achieve consensus. I am pleased to say that there is now agreement. I hope the Senate will be able to move quickly to approve this agreement and pass this legislation.                                 ______      By Mr. McCAIN (for himself and Mr. Kyl):  S. 1327. A bill to provide for the transfer of certain lands to the Salt River Pima-Maricopa Indian Community and the city of Scottsdale, AZ, and for other purposes; to the Committee on Banking, Housing, and Urban Affairs.         the saddleback mountain-arizona settlement act of 1995 Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, I am pleased to join with my colleague, Senator Kyl, in introducing legislation to approve an agreement to settle a longstanding dispute over 701 acres of unique and valuable land within the city of Scottsdale, AZ, currently held by the Resolution Trust Corporation [RTC]. The agreement, which was negotiated by representatives of the Salt River Pima-Maricopa Indian Community, the city of Scottsdale, and the RTC, provides for the RTC to sell part of the property to the community and the remainder to the city.  The property is located in the eastern-most part of Scottsdale, abuts 1.7 miles of the northern boundary of the community's reservation, and is undeveloped. Its most distinctive feature is Saddleback Mountain, a striking landmark that rises abruptly from the desert floor to a height of some 900 feet. Due to its location, high conservation value and other special features, the property's use and disposition are of major importance both to the community and the city.  A dispute arose after the RTC, in its capacity as receiver for the Sun State Savings & Loan Association, acquired the Saddleback property in 1989 and subsequently noticed it for sale. The community submitted the highest cash bid for the property, conditioned upon being allowed to develop the flat portion of the property. The city, concerned about the direction that the development might follow, sued the RTC to acquire the property by eminent domain. The RTC then rejected all auction sale bids and determined to transfer the property to Scottsdale through the eminent domain litigation. The community thereupon sued the city and the RTC, seeking damages.  Rather than pursue the litigation, the city, the community, and the RTC sought to resolve their dispute through negotiation. The result of their efforts is a settlement agreement that will allow all parties to realize their respective goals for the Saddleback property. Under the agreement, the RTC will sell the property to Scottsdale and the community for a total of $6.5 million. The city will pay $636,000 to acquire approximately 125 acres, located north and south of Shea Boulevard, for preservation and future road expansion. The community will pay $5,864,000 to acquire 576 acres adjoining their reservation. The two lawsuits, which are pending in U.S. District Court in Phoenix, will be dismissed.  The agreement further provides that 365 acres of the property to be acquired by the community, including Saddleback Mountain, will be forever preserved in its natural State for use only as a public park and recreation area. Except for a limited number of sites that are of particular historical and cultural significance to the community, the public will have free access to this area. Together with the preservation property to be acquired by the city, it will be jointly managed by the city and the community. The remaining 211 acres to be acquired by the community will be subject to a detailed development agreement with the city, as well as the limitations and restrictions of current community zoning.  Mr. President, the bill that Senator Kyl and I are introducing today has two primary objectives. First, it will approve and ratify the settlement agreement and ensure that its terms will be fully enforceable. Second, it provides that the property purchased by the community will be held in trust by the United States and become part of its reservation. Enactment of this legislation is a necessary step for the settlement's provisions to become effective.  Achievement of the Saddleback settlement agreement demonstrates once again the value and benefit of seeking to settle disputes through negotiation rather than litigation. The Salt River Pima-Maricopa Indian Community, its president and council, and the mayor and council of the city of Scottsdale, along with their representatives and those of the Resolution Trust Corporation who cooperated to make a settlement possible, deserve great credit for their leadership and hard work to resolve their differences amicably.  I believe the legislation to approve the Saddleback settlement agreement is noncontroversial and clearly in the public interest, and I note with satisfaction that no expenditure of funds from the U.S. Treasury will be necessary for its implementation. Accordingly, I am hopeful that the Congress will consider and approve this legislation in an expeditious manner.  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be printed in the Record.  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the Record, as follows:                                S. 1327       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of      the United States of America in Congress assembled,     SECTION 1.
