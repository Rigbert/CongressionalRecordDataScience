 President, I would like to congratulate the Southgate Volunteer Fire Department for celebrating its centennial this October. Over the past century, the Southgate Volunteer Fire Department has been comprised of numerous men and women who have dedicated their lives to serving their community.  The record of excellence at Southgate Volunteer Fire Department has made all the difference in reaching this glorious milestone in its history. This year the department won its fourth State Fire Olympics; the State Fire Olympics hosts five different events that test the skills of firefighters and explorer teams. The extensive 3,000 hours spent per year on training has no doubt aided in the achievements made by the department. The Southgate Volunteer Fire Department became one of the first in Campbell County to develop life squads, and it has also been recognized as one of the first in Kentucky to carry semiautomatic external defibrillators.  The strength and dedication of the department was tested at the Beverly Hills Supper Club Fire in May of 1977, surely the most difficult day in its 100-year history. The Southgate Volunteer Fire Department was at the forefront of that firefighting effort and was aided by another 500 firefighters from throughout Kentucky, Indiana, and Ohio. There were 3,800 people rescued from the fire that night, all because of the valor and dedication shown by these heroes.  The department's current chief, John Beatsch, manages 75 members of the Southgate Volunteer Fire Department, and in 2004 and 2005 the Southgate Volunteer Fire Department boasted the induction of two previous chiefs into the Firefighters Hall of Fame. Early in 2000, with aid from the State, the department received a new administration office, sleeping quarters, new dress and work uniforms, and two new semiautomatic external defibrillators.  The foundation of excellence that began 100 years ago still stands as the volunteers of this brave department have dedicated their lives to protecting their community. I am confident that tradition will continue on for the next 100 years as the Southgate Volunteer Fire Department continues to keep the people of Kentucky safe. I know all of my colleagues join me in congratulating the men and women of the Southgate Volunteer Fire Department for their service and their heroism.                          ____________________
