 First, I would say, there is nothing to disagree with in what the gentleman has said. We do want to focus on jobs. We do want to focus on creating jobs. We do want to focus on growing the economy. The gentleman is absolutely correct. As a matter of fact, as the gentleman knows, he and I have discussed the agenda that Democrats have been talking about for 2\1/2\ years, and it is called Make It In America.  That Make It In America agenda focuses on manufacturing and growing opportunities in this country for good jobs for skilled workers and unskilled workers, frankly, but mainly skilled workers in the new manufacturing environment in which we find ourselves. That ought to be our long-term objective.  I would say very candidly, Mr. Speaker, we ought not in the short term forget those who have been deeply damaged by the economic dislocation that has occurred in our society, in our country, and frankly globally over the past 5 years, or actually starting in December of '07. We ought not to forget those people, because while a future investment is very interesting to them, and I am sure important to them, their critical interest is in putting food on their table today, tomorrow, and the next day. I think the richest country on the face of the Earth could do both, I tell the gentleman. And I think that we ought to do both, and we have done both in the past.  We had some job figures that were out today, apparently 87,000 jobs in the private sector. That's not enough. We lost 13,000 in the public sector apparently for a net of 74,000 appreciation of jobs. That's not nearly enough. The gentleman would agree, I know, to solve the problem that we have.  The gentleman talked about the SKILLS Act. That bill would freeze the Workforce Investment Act program funding for fiscal years 2014 to 2020. We would make no more investment in doing what the gentleman has said we want to do. It has already been cut by half since 2001 and would also consolidate or eliminate 35 programs, most of them the Workforce Incentive Act programs, into State block grants that they could spend on things of their choice.  I am not saying that some States wouldn't make good choices. I think they would. Other States would make different choices, and we may or may not agree with those. But I certainly tell the gentleman, and he and I have had the opportunity talking together, the Make It In America agenda, or a jobs agenda, or whatever that agenda is called, is certainly something we ought to pursue.  Let me transition, if I might, Mr. Leader, to talk about another issue which analysis of almost every economist and the Congressional Budget Office say will help grow the economy, and that is comprehensive immigration reform. We continue to believe that that is one of the most important issues that this Congress in this second session of the Congress ought to deal with. Can the gentleman indicate whether there is any possibility of either, as I said in weeks past, bringing the four bills that came out of the Judiciary Committee or the border security bill that came out of the Homeland Security Committee, I might say, unanimously? None of those five bills have been brought to the floor.  The Speaker said just the other day, I am trying to find some way to get this thing done. ``Thing'' being immigration reform. He said, It is, as you know, not easy. Not going to be an easy path forward, but I made it clear since the day after the election, it is time to get this done.  The Speaker said that November 13, 2013, a couple months ago. We are very, very hopeful that the Speaker will pursue that, the House will pursue that, and the majority leader will put on the floor legislation on which we can act. We may or may not agree with the legislation brought to the floor, but we think it needs to be given attention, consistent with Speaker Boehner's observation, and CBO's assertion, that that would have a substantially positive effect on growing the economy and creating jobs.  I yield to my friend.
