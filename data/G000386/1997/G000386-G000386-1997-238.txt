 President, on behalf of the leader, for the information for all Senators, tomorrow there will be a period of morning business to allow a number of Senators time to speak. Therefore, no rollcall votes will be conducted during Friday's session of the Senate.  On Monday, we hope to begin consideration of the first concurrent budget resolution by possibly beginning debate. If any votes are ordered on the resolution, votes would be postponed to occur not before 5 p.m. on Monday.  In addition, early next week the Senate could return to the consideration of H.R. 1122, the partial-birth abortion bill, or S. 4, the Family Friendly Workplace Act. As always, Senators will be notified as soon as any agreements are reached.                          ____________________
