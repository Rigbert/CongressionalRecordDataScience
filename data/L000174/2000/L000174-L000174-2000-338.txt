President, I am pleased today to introduce the Financial Information Privacy Protection Act of 2000, which was crafted by President Clinton and Vice President Gore. I am delighted to be joined by Senator Sarbanes, the Ranking Member of the Senate Banking Committee, who is a real leader in the Senate on protecting personal financial information. I am also pleased that Senators Robb, Dodd, Kerry, Bryan, Edwards, Durbin, Harkin and Feinstein are original cosponsors of this legislation to protect the financial privacy of all Americans.  Last November, President Clinton signed into law the landmark Financial Modernization Act of 1999, which updates our financial laws and opens up the financial services industry to become more competitive, both at home and abroad. Many of my colleagues and I supported that legislation because we believe it will benefit businesses and consumers. It will make it easier for banking, securities, and insurance firms to consolidate their services, cut expenses and offer more products at a lower cost to all. But it also raises new concerns about our financial privacy.  New conglomerates in the financial services industry may now offer a widening variety of services, each of which may require a customer to provide financial, medical or other personal information. Nothing in the new law prevents these new subsidiaries or affiliates of financial conglomerates from sharing this information for uses beyond those the customer thought he or she was providing it. For example, the new law has no requirement for the consumer to control whether these new financial subsidiaries or affiliates sell, share, or publish information on savings account balances, certificates of deposit maturity dates and balances, stock and mutual fund purchases and sales, life insurance payouts or health insurance claims. That is wrong.  When President Clinton signed the financial modernization bill last year, he directed the National Economic Council to work with the Treasury Department and Office of Management and Budget to craft a legislative proposal to protect financial privacy in the new financial services marketplace. The result of that process is the bill we are introducing today.  I believe the Financial Information Privacy Protection Act of 2000 should serve as the foundation for model financial privacy legislation that Congress enacts into law this year. This bill is a common sense approach that can attract both consumers and the industry. It sands off the extremes at both ends of the issue. We need a catalyst to bring both sides together, and this bill can do it.  Privacy is one of our most vulnerable rights in the information age. Digitalization of information offers tremendous benefits but also new threats. Some in Congress are content to punt the privacy issue down the field for another year. The public disagrees. People know that the longer we dawdle, the harder it will be to halt the erosion of privacy. A year is an eternity in the digital age.  The right of privacy is a personal and fundamental right protected by the Constitution of the United States. But today, the American people are growing more and more concerned over encroachments on their personal privacy. To return personal financial privacy to the control of the consumer, the Administration's financial privacy legislation would create the following enforceable rights in Federal law.  New Right To Opt-out of Information Sharing By Affiliates. The new financial modernization law permits consumers to say no to information sharing, selling or publishing among third parties in many cases, but not among affiliated firms. The Financial Information Privacy Protection Act of 2000 would require financial conglomerates, which will only grow under the new modernization law, to expand this protection to give consumers the right to notify it (opt-out) to stop all information sharing, selling or publishing of personal financial information among all third parties and affiliates.  New Right For Consumers To Opt-In For Sharing of Medical Information and Personal Spending Habits. The Financial Information Privacy Protection Act of 2000 would require financial firms to get the affirmative consent (opt-in) of consumers before a firm could gain access to medical information within a financial conglomerate or share detailed information about a consumer's personal spending habits.  New Right To Access and Correct Financial Information. The Financial Information Privacy Protection Act of 2000 would give consumers the right to review and correct their financial records, just like consumers today may review and correct their credit reports.  New Right To Privacy Policy Up Front. The Financial Information Privacy Protection Act of 2000 would require financial firms to provide their privacy policies to consumers before committing to a customer relationship, not after. In addition, the bill's new rights would be enforced by federal banking regulators, the Federal Trade Commission and state attorney generals.  As President Clinton warned all Americans: ``Although consumers put a great value on privacy of their financial records, our laws have not caught up to technological developments that make it possible and potentially profitable for companies to share financial data in new ways. Consumers who undergo physical exams to obtain insurance, for example, should not have to fear the information will be used to lower their credit card limits or deny them mortgages.'' I strongly agree.  Unfortunately, if you have a checking account, you may have a financial privacy problem. Your bank may sell or share with business allies information about who you are writing checks to, when, and for how much. And even if you tell your bank to stop, it can ignore you under current law. This legislation returns to consumers the power to stop the selling or sharing of personal financial information.  Americans ought to be able to enjoy the exciting innovations of this burgeoning information era without losing control over the use of their financial information. The Financial Information Privacy Protection Act of 2000 updates United States privacy laws to provide these fundamental protections of personal financial information in the evolving financial services industry. I urge my colleagues to support it.  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the full text of the Financial Information Privacy Protection Act of 2000 and a section-by-section analysis of the bill be printed in the Record.  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in the Record, as follows:                                S. 2513       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of      the United States of America in Congress assembled,     SECTION 1.

(b) Coordination, Consistency, and Comparability.--The      regulations issued under subsection (a) shall be issued in      accordance with the requirements of section 504(a) of the      Gramm-Leach-Bliley Act (15 U.S.C. 6804(a)), except that the      deadline in section 504(a)(3) shall not apply.     SEC. 13. FTC RULEMAKING AUTHORITY UNDER THE FAIR CREDIT                    REPORTING ACT.       Section 621(e) of the Fair Credit Reporting Act (15 U.S.C.      1681s(e)) is amended by adding at the end the following new      paragraph:       ``(3) Regulations.--The Federal Trade Commission shall      prescribe such regulations as necessary to carry out the      provisions of this title with respect to any persons      identified under paragraph (1) of subsection (a). Prior to      prescribing such regulations, the Federal Trade Commission      shall consult with the Federal banking agencies referred to      in paragraph (1) of this subsection in order to ensure, to      the extent possible, comparability and consistency with the      regulations issued by the Federal banking agencies under that      paragraph.''.                                  ____   Financial Information Privacy Protection Act--Section-by-Section                                 Analysis     Section 1: Short Title; table of Contents     Section 101: Opt-out Requirement for Disclosure to Affiliates          and Nonaffiliated Third Parties       The Gramm-Leach-Bliley Act (GLBA) requires a financial      institution to give consumers notice of, and an opportunity      to prevent (opt out of), sharing of their nonpublic personal      information with companies that are not affiliated with the      financial institution (nonaffiliated third parties). Section      101 of the bill strengthens consumers' control over their      personal financial information by expanding this opt-out      right to cover information sharing between financial      institutions and their affiliates.       Section 101 also requires that when a financial institution      notifies a consumer of its intent to share the consumer's      information and gives the consumer the opportunity to opt-     out, the consumer must be able to exercise the opt-out choice      through the same method of communication by which the      financial institution communicated the opt-out notice to the      consumer, or by another method at least as convenient to the      consumer. For example, if a financial institution gives a      consumer an opt-out notice by electronic mail, the consumer      would have to be able to exercise the opt-out by a method at      least as convenient, such as by electronic mail or by      telephone, but could not be required to opt-out via an      individual letter.       The GLBA currently includes general exceptions to the      notice and opt-out requirement--for example, to allow      processing a consumer's transaction, to prevent fraud, or to      control institutional risk. The bill would also apply these      exceptions to information sharing with affiliates.     Section 102: Limitation on Transfer of Information About          Personal Spending Habits       Section 102 of the bill strengthens consumers' control over      the detailed information that financial firms can learn about      their personal spending habits and sources of income. In the      course of providing a payment mechanism for consumers,      financial institutions such as credit card companies, banks      and brokers--when they provide checking or money market      accounts--learn to whom a consumer makes payments, from whom      the consumer receives payments, and what the payments are      for.       The bill recognizes the special sensitivity of this      information. It requires that where a financial institution      is providing payment services for a consumer, the institution      cannot disclose the consumer's spending habits--whether in      the form of a list of the consumer's transactions or as a      description of the consumer's interests, preferences, or      other characteristics derived from payment information--     unless the institution clearly and conspicuously requests      permission from the consumer, and the consumer affirmatively      consents (opts in). This applies for transfers to both      nonaffiliated third parties and affiliates.       Section 102 includes the exceptions for transaction      processing, servicing of customer accounts, and other      necessary activities such as law enforcement.     Section 103: Restricting the Use of Health Information in          Making Credit and Other Financial Decisions       Limitation on Receipt of Consumer Health Information from            Affiliates       Section 103(a) of the bill prevents financial institutions      from using a consumer's health information held at an      affiliate in order to discriminate in the provision of credit      and financial services. Section 103(a) provides that in      deciding whether, and on what terms, to offer, provide, or      continue to provide a particular financial product or service      to a consumer, a financial institution may not obtain,      receive, evaluate, or otherwise consider individually      identifiable health information about the consumer from an      affiliate unless the financial institution: (1) clearly and      conspicuously requests permission from the consumer; (2)      obtains the consumer's affirmative consent; and (3) requires      the same information about all consumers as a condition for      receiving the financial product or service.       Relation to the Health Insurance Portability and            Accountability Act       Section 103(b) of the bill clarifies that the provisions of      subtitle A of title V of the GLBA, which create protections      for the privacy of consumers' financial information, do not      in any way modify or override the requirements of the      regulations issued by the Secretary of Health and Human      Services implementing the privacy and security protections      for consumers' individually identifiable health information      under the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act      of 1996 (HIPAA). Nor do the requirements of the GLBA      governing protection of consumers' financial information      authorize any use of individually identifiable health      information that would be inconsistent with other laws that      apply to such information. Section 103(c) makes clear that      for purposes of this provision, the term ``individually      identifiable health information'' has the same meaning as      under the HIPAA.     Section 104: Limits on Redisclosure and Reuse of Information       The GLBA imposes certain limits on a nonaffiliated third      party's ability to redisclose nonpublic personal information      received from a financial institution. The GLBA does not      prohibit a third party from redisclosing this information to      its own affiliates or to affiliates of the financial      institution from whom it received the information. In      addition, the third party may disclose the information to      another company if that disclosure would be lawful if made      directly by the financial institution.       Section 104 of the bill tightens the limits on redisclosure      and extends them to a financial institution's affiliates, in      order to parallel the new opt-out requirement for disclosure      of information to affiliates. Under section 104, when a      financial institution discloses nonpublic personal      information to either an affiliate or a nonaffiliated      third party, the recipient of the information may not      redisclose the information to any other person unless that      disclosure would be lawful if made directly by the      financial institution.       Section 104 also clarifies how the limits on redisclosure      apply when a financial institution discloses a consumer's      nonpublic personal information to another company pursuant to      one of the general exceptions to the opt-out requirement.      Section 104 provides that an affiliate or a nonaffiliated      third party that receives nonpublic personal information from      a financial institution under one of the general exceptions      may use or disclose that information only: (1) as permitted      under that general exception; or (2) under another general      exception, if necessary to carry out the purpose for which      the information was originally disclosed under a general      exception.       Since the opt-in requirement for the disclosure of personal      spending information by payment service providers is subject      to some, but not all, of the general exceptions, only a      subset of the general exceptions apply to reuse and      redisclosure by recipients of such information.     Section 105: Consumer Rights to Access and Correct          Information       Section 105 of the bill gives consumers the right to access      and to correct information about them that is under the      control of, and reasonably available to a financial      institution. A financial institution would not, however, be      required to give consumers access to confidential commercial      information, to make disclosures that would interfere with      law enforcement, or to create new records in order to comply      with a consumer's request for information.       Section 105 also requires financial institutions to give      consumers the opportunity to dispute the accuracy of      information disclosed to the consumer and to present evidence      of any inaccuracy. The financial institution must correct or      delete material information identified by the consumer that      is materially incomplete or inaccurate. In addition, a      financial institution may impose a reasonable fee for making      information available to consumers, as long as consumers      receive prior notice of the fee.       In promulgating regulations to implement the new access and      correction requirements, federal regulators must consult and      coordinate with one another in order to ensure that the      regulations: (1) impose consistent requirements across      financial institutions; (2) take into account conditions      under which the financial institutions do business in the      U.S. and abroad; and (3) are technology neutral.     Section 106: Improved Enforcement Authority       Compliance with Privacy Policy       The GLBA does not clearly explain whether a financial      institution is legally required     to abide by commitments it makes to consumers in its privacy      policy if those commitments are not required by law. Section      106(a) of the bill clarifies that a financial institution's      failure to comply with any of the privacy policies or      practices disclosed to a consumer constitutes a violation      of law.       Clarification of Federal Trade Commission (FTC) Enforcement            Authority       Section 106(b) of the bill makes clear that if a financial      institution or other person under the FTC's enforcement      jurisdiction under subtitle A of title V of the GLBA engages      in an activity that violates subtitle A, that activity      constitutes an unfair and deceptive trade practice under the      Federal Trade Commission Act. Consequently, in addressing      such a violation, the FTC could use all the enforcement tools      it has with respect to unfair or deceptive acts or practices      under the FTC Act.       State Enforcement Authority Concurrent with FTC       Section 106(c) of the bill gives States concurrent      authority with the FTC to enforce the GLBA's privacy      requirements with respect to FTC-regulated entities. Section      106(d) gives the States concurrent authority with the FTC to      enforce the GLBA's prohibitions on ``pretext calling,'' which      involves obtaining customer information from a financial      institution under false pretenses. Enforcement with regard to      banking institutions would continue to be done solely by the      federal banking agencies.     Section 107: Enhanced Disclosure of Privacy Policies       Timing of Disclosure of Privacy Policy       The GLBA requires financial institutions to provide their      privacy policies to consumers at the time of establishing a      customer relationship and at least annually during the      continuation of the relationship. The phrase ``at time of      establishing a customer relationship'' does not provide clear      guidance regarding when a financial institution must provide      its privacy policy to those individuals seeking to become its      customers. Section 107(a) of the bill is intended to clarify      the timing of notice delivery, and to ensure that individuals      are able to receive copies of financial institutions' privacy      policies before they commit time and resources to dealing      with any one financial institution. The bill specifically      clarifies that financial institutions must provide their      privacy policies to individuals upon request and as part of      an application for a financial product or service. Thus,      consumers will be empowered to comparison shop based on      privacy practices.       Content of Privacy Policy--Disclosure of Rights to Access            and Correct Information       Section 107(b) requires a financial institution's privacy      policy to include a statement of the consumer's rights to      access and correct information held by the financial      institution (see discussion of section 105 regarding      consumers' rights to access and correct information).     Section 108: Prohibition on Sharing of Account Numbers       The GLBA prohibits financial institutions from disclosing      consumers' account numbers or access codes to nonaffiliated      third parties (other than consumer reporting agencies) for      marketing purposes. Section 108 of the bill extends this      prohibition to disclosures to affiliates.     Section 109: Exceptions to the Opt-out and Opt-in          Requirements       Agency and Joint Marketing Exception       Section 502(c) of the GLBA creates an exception to the opt-     out requirement where a financial institution discloses a      consumer's nonpublic personal information to a nonaffiliated      third party that is acting as the financial institution's      agent. This exception permits a financial institution to      disclose consumers' nonpublic personal information to third      parties in connection with outsourcing certain functions,      such as back-office operations or direct mailings to market      the financial institution's own products, without giving      consumers the option to prevent disclosure. The financial      institution is, however, required to give consumers notice of      such disclosures and to enter into agreements with the third      parties to maintain the confidentiality of the consumers'      information.       Among the services and functions covered by the principal-     agent exception are certain joint marketing arrangements,      where a third party markets financial products or services      pursuant to a joint agreement between two or more financial      institutions. The joint marketing agreement exception was      enacted to allow financial institutions without affiliates,      particularly small institutions, to be able to jointly market      their products under the same rules that affiliates may do      so--that is, free from any opt-out requirement.       As noted in the discussion of sections 101 and 102 above,      the bill imposes the same restrictions on information sharing      between affiliates that now apply to information sharing      between financial institutions and nonaffiliated third      parties. Therefore, because coverage of information sharing      among affiliates and with third parties would be equivalent,      the joint marketing exception is rendered unnecessary, and is      eliminated. The bill also moves the remaining principal-agent      exception from section 502(c) of the GLBA to the list of      general exceptions in 502(e), which is redesignated as      502(f).       Customer Service and Consolidated Statements       Among the general exceptions to the notice and opt-out      requirements in the GLBA are disclosures for servicing      customer accounts and resolving customer disputes or      inquires. These exceptions are intended to permit financial      institutions to share information in response to customer      service needs. Section 109(7) of the bill expands the general      exceptions to include disclosures necessary to facilitate      customer service such as maintenance and operation of      consolidated customer call centers and the use of      consolidated customer account statements.       Technical Amendments       Section 109 of the bill makes technical amendments to the      list of general exceptions in section 502(e) of the GLBA, by      splitting an existing exception that deals with disclosures      to rating agencies and attorneys, and by adding a conforming      statutory reference.     Section 110: Definitions       ``Financial Institution''       The financial privacy requirements of subtitle A of title V      of the GLBA apply to ``financial institutions,'' which are      defined as institutions the business of which is engaging in      activities that have been specified as ``financial      activities'' under certain statutes and regulations. The      GLBA, however, specifically excludes three types of entities      from the definition of ``financial institution.'' They are:      (1) any person or entity to the extent engaged in a financial      activity that is subject to the jurisdiction of the Commodity      Futures Trading Commission; (2) the institutions of the Farm      Credit System; and 3) institutions chartered by Congress to      engage in certain securitization or secondary market sale      transactions, as long as such institutions do not sell or      transfer nonpublic personal information to nonaffiliated      third parties. Section 109(1) of the bill eliminates these      exclusions in order to ensure consistency in the protection      of consumers' nonpublic personal information under the GLBA.      The bill preserves the existing general exception for      disclosures in connection with securitization or secondary      market sales transactions.       ``Nonpublic Personal Information''       Section 110(2) of the bill revises the definition of      ``nonpublic personal information'' in order to clarify that      the term includes a consumer's Social Security number. This      provision also clarifies that publicly available information      about consumers also would be covered whether or not that      information is disclosed as part of a larger list of      consumers or as it pertains to an individual consumer. Under      current law, this type of information is covered only if it      is part of a list of more than one consumer.       ``Consumer''       Under the GLBA, the term ``consumer'' is defined as an      individual who obtains a financial product or service from a      financial institution for personal, family, or household      purposes, or such person's legal representative. Section      109(3) of the bill amends the definition of ``consumer'' to      clarify that the term includes an individual who applies for,      but does not necessarily obtain, such products or services      from a financial institution.     Section 111: Implementing Regulations       Section 110(a) of the bill authorizes the federal      regulators who have rulemaking authority under subtitle A of      title V of the GLBA to issue regulations implementing the      amendments made by the bill. The bill requires these agencies      to include in their regulations requirements they determine      are appropriate to prevent circumvention or evasion of any of      the bill's requirements. Section 110(b) provides that in      issuing their regulations, the agencies must follow the      procedures and requirements set forth in section 504(a) of      the GLBA that currently apply to their rulemaking authority.      Specifically, the agencies must consult with each other and      with representatives of state insurance authorities, and must      issue consistent and comparable rules, to the extent      possible. The statutory deadline in section 504(a)(3), which      is set in relation to the date of the enactment of the GLBA,      is obsolete for purposes of the regulations implementing this      bill, and therefore does not apply.     Section 112: FTC Rulemaking Authority Under the Fair Credit          Reporting Act (FCRA)       Section 112 of the bill amends section 621(e) of FCRA by      establishing rulemaking authority for the Federal Trade      Commission. This amendment creates parity with the federal      banking agencies and the National Credit Union      Administration, which each obtained rulemaking authority      under the FCRA for their respective regulated entities      pursuant to section 506 of the GLBA. Extending this authority      to the FTC fills a gap in administrative enforcement under      the FCRA.
