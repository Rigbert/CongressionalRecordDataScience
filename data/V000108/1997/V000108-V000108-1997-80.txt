Speaker, tomorrow, April 25, 1997, the officers and delegates of the Northwest Indiana Federation of Labor, AFL-CIO, will hold their 23d Annual Labor Awards and Community Service Banquet at the Knights of Columbus Hall in East Chicago, IN. This event honors those individuals who have provided outstanding service to labor and the community. It also serves as the Federation's ``Workers Memorial'', activity recognizing those who have been seriously injured or killed in the workplace. This event is northwest Indiana's largest labor celebration of the year, involving 45,000 member unionists and their friends. Participants will gather together to celebrate an evening of labor solidarity.  The Federation's highest honor, the 16th Annual President's Award, will be bestowed upon the Honorable Robert A. Pastrick, mayor of the city of East Chicago. This honor is awarded to an individual enhancing the well being of workers throughout northwest Indiana by countless contributions which have furthered the philosophy of the labor movement. In addition, Mr. John Buncich, Lake County sheriff, will be this year's recipient of the annual Service to Labor Award. This award is presented in honor of an individual's dedicated service and support to the labor movement. The Federation's Community Services Award will be presented to Mr. Ed Hiatt for offering both organized labor and the people of northwest Indiana dedicated leadership, compassion and service. Mr. Hiatt assisted with various Federation of Labor projects, including union counseling and the AFL-CIO Christmas Drive.  In addition, two members of the Steelworkers Organization of Active Retirees [SOAR], Mr. John Mayerik, age 89, and Mr. Walter Mackerel, age 96, will be honored with the ``Old Warrior'' Award. This award is presented in recognition of the recipients' lifelong commitment to the labor movement and the principles which it embodies. Specifically, Mr. Mayerik served as president of Local Union 1014 and staff representative of the United Steelworkers of America. Presently, he is serving as trustee of SOAR Chapter 7-31-14. Mr. Mackerel actively served Local Union 1066, and he was instrumental in establishing and leading the retiree organization in District 7 of the United Steelworkers of America. Both gentlemen have unselfishly devoted their time and effort to assisting both individuals and the communities in which they live for a number of years.  Also, the Federation's Union Label Award will be presented to the United Steelworkers of America, District 7. District 7 will be awarded this honor for demonstrating the true meaning of labor ``solidarity'' during the Bridgestone Firestone labor struggle. USWA, District 7 has been attributed with providing the leadership and commitment needed to win this fight for labor, as well as revitalizing the entire labor movement in northwest Indiana.  Each year, the Lake and Porter County area United Ways join with the Northwest Indiana Federation of Labor, AFL-CIO, to conduct an 8-week basic union counselor training course. Upon completion of this program, those participating will be qualified to provide the labor community with invaluable information concerning available health and human services assistance.
