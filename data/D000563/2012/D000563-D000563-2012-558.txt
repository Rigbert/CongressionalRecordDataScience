 Mr. Marchionne, the CEO of Chrysler, said this morning: We are where we are today because our UAW workers--union workers--sat down at the table and said, we have to agree on a future together or we are sunk. They agreed on that future, and he said: Now my workforce is excited and productive.  The Senator just made the point--more businesses are coming back from overseas. It is a great success story.
