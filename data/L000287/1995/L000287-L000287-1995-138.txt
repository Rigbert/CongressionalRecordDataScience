Mr. Speaker, ``I understand you want to write a book. I own a publishing company you know.'' Could these words have been uttered in the Rayburn Room just off the House floor?  Mr. Speaker, the more we know, the more we have to wonder, what went on in the backrooms of the Capitol. Only a full airing of the facts will determine whether something illicit took place. Only an outside, independent, counsel can tell us for sure.  What was said? What was promised? What is the deal? What is in the contract? It is time that an independent counsel expose the truth.  Mr. Speaker, do the Republicans have a contract with America or a contract with Rupert Murdoch?  No one serves two masters, Mr. Speaker. No one serves two masters.                          ____________________
