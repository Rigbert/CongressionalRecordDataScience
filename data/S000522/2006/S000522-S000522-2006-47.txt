Mr. Speaker, I move to suspend the rules and agree to the resolution (H. Res. 723) calling on the President to take immediate steps to help improve the security situation in Darfur, Sudan, with a specific emphasis on civilian protection, as amended.  The Clerk read as follows:                              H. Res. 723       Whereas the United States Congress and the President are on      record as declaring that the atrocities being committed in      Darfur, Sudan are genocide;       Whereas the United States has demonstrated leadership on      the Sudan issue for years, including by mediating Sudan's      North-South Peace Agreement, by declaring genocide in Darfur,      by providing nearly $1 billion in humanitarian assistance      over time, and by having United States Permanent      Representative to the United Nations John Bolton, in his      first action as President of the United Nations Security      Council, request in February 2006 that United Nations      Secretary-General Kofi Annan initiate contingency planning      for a transition from the African Union Mission in Sudan      (AMIS) to a United Nations peacekeeping force;       Whereas the African Union deployed AMIS to Darfur to      monitor the violence and, in spite of attacks on AMIS      observers and the fact that the recently improved AMIS      mandate still does not provide sufficiently for proactive      protection of civilians, AMIS has been successful in creating      pockets of security for displaced persons simply through its      presence;       Whereas the N'Djamena Ceasefire Agreement of April 8, 2004,      the Abuja Protocols of November 9, 2004, and the Darfur Peace      Agreement of May 5, 2006, have not resulted in a cessation of      hostilities in Darfur;       Whereas the Government of Sudan and its armed militia      groups continue to commit crimes against humanity and engage      in genocidal acts in Darfur, in spite of the presence of AMIS      forces, and, in early September 2006, launched a major      offensive in Darfur, in direct violation of the Darfur Peace      Agreement;       Whereas United Nations Secretary-General Annan has      indicated that, ``People in many parts of Darfur continue to      be killed, raped, and driven from their homes by the      thousands.'';       Whereas it has been reported that an estimated 300,000 to      400,000 people have died in the conflict-affected area of      Darfur and eastern Chad, and due to the number of areas that      cannot be accounted for, the total number of deaths may be      higher;       Whereas the ongoing assault against civilians by Sudanese      Government forces, Janjaweed militias, and rebels      necessitates the deployment of a larger, more capable      international peacekeeping force with a strong mandate to      protect civilians in Darfur;       Whereas, although the United Nations Security Council      approved Security Council Resolution 1706 (August 31, 2006)      which provides for the deployment of a United Nations      peacekeeping mission in Darfur to include up to 22,500      personnel, the Government of Sudan has rejected the terms of      such Resolution and alternatively issued an ultimatum to AMIS      to extend its current mission beyond September 2006 without      transitioning to a United Nations peacekeeping force; and       Whereas on the same day on which the Government of Sudan      issued its ultimatum, the African Union stated that it would      quit the war-ravaged Darfur region if the Government of Sudan      did not allow a United Nations peacekeeping force to take      over AMIS: Now, therefore, be it       Resolved, That the House of Representatives--       (1) commends the African Union Mission in Sudan (AMIS) for      its actions in monitoring the N'Djamena Ceasefire Agreement      in Darfur and its role in diminishing some acts of violence;       (2) strongly condemns the continued genocide and violence      directed against civilians in Darfur by the Government of      Sudan and government-sponsored militias, as well as attacks      perpetrated against civilians by rebels in Darfur;       (3) calls upon all parties to the N'Djamena Ceasefire      Agreement--       (A) to abide by the terms of the N'Djamena Ceasefire      Agreement and the Darfur Peace Agreement; and       (B) to engage in good-faith negotiations to end the      conflict in Darfur;       (4) calls upon the Government of Sudan immediately--       (A) to comply with United Nations Security Council      Resolution 1706 (August 31, 2006), support the transition of      AMIS to a United Nations peacekeeping mission, and facilitate      the deployment of United Nations peacekeepers throughout      Sudan toward that end;       (B) to withdraw all offensive military aircraft and      personnel from the region;       (C) to cease all support for Janjaweed militias and rebels      from Chad; and       (D) to disarm all Janjaweed militias;       (5) calls upon the international community to provide      sufficient funding to support the AMIS mission as it      transitions to a United Nations peacekeeping mission;       (6) calls on the African Union to work closely with the      United Nations and the North Atlantic Treaty Organization      (NATO) to strengthen its capacity to deter violence and      instability until a United Nations peacekeeping force is      fully deployed in Darfur;       (7) calls on NATO to extend its current mission of advisors      to the African Union, as requested by the leadership of the      African Union;       (8) urges the President to take steps immediately to help      improve the security situation in Darfur, including by      proposing that NATO support an interim civilian protection      force with sufficient ground and air assets under centralized      planning, direction, and control, to protect civilians and      facilitate the deployment of United Nations peacekeepers in      Darfur;       (9) calls upon NATO allies to support such a NATO mission;       (10) calls upon NATO headquarters staff to begin prudent      planning in advance of such a NATO mission; and       (11) urges the President to take immediate steps to work      through diplomatic channels to obtain the support of the      People's Republic of China, the Russian Federation, and      United States allies in the Arab League to secure the      compliance of the Government of Sudan with United Nations      Security Council Resolution 1706 and support full funding for      the United Nations peacekeeping force in Sudan.
