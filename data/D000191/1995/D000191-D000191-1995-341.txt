. Government, went to help defray our own deficit here in the United States? Would it not be refreshing if for once the American taxpayers did not just extend guarantees and send taxpayers' dollars but in effect they were getting a return?  I know that is not the case. The 40 percent interest is going to private investors, the largest banks in the country who are now desperately knocking at the doors; actually they are inside. We are not allowed in, but they are inside saying we would like another $10 billion for Mexico. Please send it now because we are worried out our investments and our payments. They are not worried about the American taxpayers.
