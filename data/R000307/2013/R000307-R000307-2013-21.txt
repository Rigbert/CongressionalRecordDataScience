Together, we are making patients safer and ensuring that they can better trust the drugs that they take.  This took a significant amount of time and effort. I especially thank Chairman Harkin, Ranking Member Alexander, Senators Burr, Bennett, and Franken for sticking with it. This is a true bipartisan effort. Personally, I thank my staffer Jennifer Boyer for her determined dedication and the many hours of work to get this job done.  In September, with the leadership of Mr. Upton and Mr. Waxman in the other body, this legislation was passed by the House by a voice vote. I am hoping we can see a similar outcome in the Senate. I urge my colleagues to support this legislation and encourage its swift passage and the signature by the President of the United States.  I yield the floor.
