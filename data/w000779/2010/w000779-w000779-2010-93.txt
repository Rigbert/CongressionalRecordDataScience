President, it is obvious that in no other part of the American economy do we have people betting against their own product while selling it to the American people. You do not see Apple creating the iPod in the hope that sales will be far below expectations and then going out and betting some of its own money on the failure. No industry--none--thinks of betting against their own product while selling it to the American people. I do not even think that owners of racehorses bet against their own ponies.  The kind of disclosure that Senator Brown and I have called for is fundamental for investment confidence in the integrity of the U.S. financial system. If financial firms can market products they are betting will fail without disclosing that to their clients, the conditions that caused the current financial crisis, in my view, will be recreated with Wall Street firms packaging up toxic assets and marketing them as securities to unsuspecting buyers. ``Buyer beware'' will again become ``taxpayer beware.'' That should not be acceptable to any Senator.  I know colleagues are waiting to speak. I repeat, amendment No. 3982, authored by Senator Brown of Massachusetts and myself, will fill a loophole in this bill that is going to be passed tonight that, in my view, is a glaring omission that does not meet the test of the consumer protection the American people deserve.  This bill is clearing the Senate tonight without even minimal consumer protection, without even disclosure of financial institutions betting against products they are going to sell. That is not right. I hope we will return to this subject as soon as possible.  I see Chairman Dodd on the floor. I thank him for the time he has given me in the course of this legislation. I commend him for all his efforts on this bill.  I also thank Senator Shelby and his very able staff director, Mr. Duhnke, whom we know from our Intelligence work, for their support in putting together this amendment. I surely hope it will come out of conference because the American people deserve this kind of consumer protection and this kind of disclosure.  I yield the floor.
