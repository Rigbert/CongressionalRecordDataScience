Speaker, It is a great pleasure to congratulate Central Baptist Church in Hobart, Indiana, as it celebrates its 90th anniversary as a parish this Sunday, September 19, 1999. I would also like to take this opportunity to congratulate Reverend Webb, senior pastor, on this glorious occasion.  A church of humble beginnings, Central Baptist Church was established as First Baptist Church in 1909, and celebrated its first service on January 20, 1909, in the home of Mrs. Harriet Cathcart. The parish's first pastor, Reverend George Griffin, having caught a vision while visiting Mrs. Cathcart, helped in the organization of the church. During his six months of service with the church, Reverend Griffin was influential in the purchase of three lots for $950, which provided a suitable site for the church. After Pastor Griffin left in June 1909, the Indiana State Board (Northern Baptist) sent Reverend J.E. Smith to serve the congregation. The Women's Missionary Board of Indiana lent the church $5,000 to start constructing a building for the new church. Many parishioners contributed time, talent, money, and raw materials to help construct the First Baptist Church. With the help of the parishioners, the first service was held in the new auditorium, which was a basement with dirt floors on December 9, 1909. The furnace was a coke salamander with no stack which regularly filled the room with smoke. In addition to this, the roof leaked when it rained and when the Aetna Powder Company blew up, there were no windows left. Conditions were bleak, but the ministry had survived its first year. Pastor Smith left in June of 1910. Several months passed without a pastor. The church, then made up of 50 members, decided to discontinue services until the Mission Board could send them a new shepherd.  On January 1, 1912, Reverend Wilson was sent to help revitalize the church. With the help of Reverend Wilson the attendance rose from 13 to 128 during the first year of his ministry. Because of the large number of Baptist families arriving to the area, a new building was started in August of 1912 and dedicated in September 23, 1913.  By 1920, the membership had grown to 350 parishioners under the direction of Pastor O.B. Sarber. The church was without a pastor for exactly one year when Pastor William Ayer came to Central Baptist Church in 1927. During Pastor Ayer's tenure with the church, he started a radio ministry and ``The Little Brown Church'' was mounted on a Ford and used for street meetings throughout Gary. In 1932, Pastor Ayer left a thriving church with more than 700 members.  Over the years, the church moved from Gary to Portage township due to a shift in population and was led by a variety of pastors. In spite of its many changes, the loyal parishioners continued to grow and prosper. The present facility, including the Sanctuary, was erected in stages. The first stage which included the gym, kitchen, and several classrooms was completed in May 1974 and phase two was completed in October of the same year. Ground was broken in April 1987 and the Hines Sanctuary was dedicated on January 9, 1983.  Mr. Speaker, I ask you and my other distinguished colleagues to join me in congratulating the parish family of Central Baptist Church, under the guidance of Reverend David Webb, as they prepare to celebrate their 90th anniversary. All past and present parishioners and pastors should be proud of the numerous contributions they have made out of the love and devotion they have displayed for their church throughout the past 90 years.                          ____________________
