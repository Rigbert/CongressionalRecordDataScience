We know the vote will not come today, but I urge Members for him and against him to come and speak. I say that because there are very few decisions we face here in the Senate that are as consequential or as enduring as the one we face today. Few in our Nation's history have served as Chief Justice of the United States. It is a unique and significant position. Once one assumes it, he or she holds it for life. To put that in perspective, we have had 43 Presidents. We have only had 16 Chief Justices of the United States.  I explained last week why I was supporting John Roberts's nomination to be Chief Justice. It was neither an easy decision nor was it a hurried decision. But it was a decision that my conscience led me toward.  I thank Senators Reid, Kennedy, Kerry, Bingaman, Boxer, Pryor, Obama, Nelson of Nebraska, and others for their thoughtful remarks these past few days. I commend to the Senate each of the statements on both sides made in the Judiciary Committee meeting on Thursday.  I must say, as the Democratic leader of that committee, I believe the Democratic Senators distinguished themselves by the thoughtful manner in which they proceeded.
