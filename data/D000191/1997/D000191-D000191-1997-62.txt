Chairman, reserving the right to object, I am not a member of the committee. I wish to speak on this. How can I be assured, since I am not a member of the committee, and I do not know how many members of the committee are going to rise, that I will be allocated any time during that hour? There are many other members on both sides of the issue who wish to speak.
