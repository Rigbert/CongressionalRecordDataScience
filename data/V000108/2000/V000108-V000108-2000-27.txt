Speaker, I rise today to condemn the actions of the Iranian government against 13 members of that Nation's Jewish community. The citizens arrested over a year ago have been accused of spying for Israel. Ten of the 13 have been in prison since their arrest last year. All have been brought before a court with no jury, in which the judge also serves as the prosecutor, to face accusations that they have not heard, without the assistance of a lawyer or any contact with their families or friends.  This would, unfortunately, not be the first time a show trial in Iran resulted in the deaths of members of the Jewish community. Since the Islamic revolution in 1979, 17 Jews have been executed in Iran. I say it is time for this to stop.  I call on those in Iran who represent reason and reform to intervene and prevent a brutal outcome to this trial.                          ____________________
