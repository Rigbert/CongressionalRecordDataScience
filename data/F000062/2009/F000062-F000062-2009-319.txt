 President, I wish to honor the life of Sal Guarriello, a decorated veteran and an incredible public servant.  Mr. Guarriello was a beloved citizen of West Hollywood, serving for 19 years on its city council and for three terms as its mayor. During his nearly two decades on the council, he was a voice for the Russian, disabled, and LGBT communities, seniors, and veterans.  Mr. Guarriello received a Purple Heart when he was wounded while serving as an Army combat medic during World War II. For the rest of his life, he strove to honor and represent the needs of his fellow veterans. In 1998, he proposed that a veterans' memorial be built in West Hollywood to honor the sacrifices of all of America's veterans, and 5 years later his vision became reality.  Before joining the West Hollywood City Council, Mr. Guarriello worked to provide affordable housing as a member of the board of directors of the West Hollywood Community Housing Corporation and the West Hollywood Rent Stabilization Commission.  Mr. Guarriello also created the West Hollywood Children's Summer Olympics, initiated a successful anti-drunk driving campaign, and formed the Eastside Redevelopment Agency, which was instrumental in the successful negotiation of a plan to rehabilitate Santa Monica Boulevard.  Sal Guarriello will be remembered by his family, friends, and constituents as a patriot, a public servant, and an exceptional leader of the community.                          ____________________
