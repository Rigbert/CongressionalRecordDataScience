Mr. Chairman, I will not yield. I did not mention the gentleman's name. I did not mention the gentleman's name. I am just going to suggest respectfully, we could drill off the coast of California.                              {time}  1445  We could drill off the coast of Florida, Massachusetts, North Carolina. We could do those things. But we have to understand the marketing principle of oil. What has happened here, the only State in the Union which required in 1973, the only State that owns its own oil, was required to transport it to, by law of this Congress, really one market. And as the gentleman from California mentioned, we also required the full maximum production of oil out of Elk Hills. It was a classic example of Government interference in the marketing capability of a resource. And it has been a disaster that has decreased production of our domestic oil producers and made us more dependent.  Let us keep in mind also that there will be, in fact, a different type oil in many cases that will be shipped to the Asian market that has no place in the United States, that is high in sulfur, and is what we call coal oil. There is a market in the Asian countries that do want this oil. It will not be just Prudhoe Bay oil; it will be an Alaskan oil.  Mr. Chairman, we have also heard the statement we are going to exploit. If anything, we have not, very frankly, explored enough, because as I mentioned in my opening statement, the highest trade deficit mark, highest in 7 years, is the importation of fossil fuels that do not come necessarily from the Far East, but other countries, because we killed our domestic production.  This is an attempt to make the marketplace work; an attempt to open other fields and to get some of our independent oil producers back into the field.  So, Mr. Chairman, I suggest respectfully, I know rhetoric is very popular on this floor, that we look at the facts, the people that support it, including this administration. Those that are directly affected support it and it was wrong to begin with and it is time that we lift that ban.  Mr. Chairman, I yield such time as he may consume to the gentleman from North Carolina [Mr. Burr].  (
