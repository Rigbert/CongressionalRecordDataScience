 The Senator has the right, of course, to file his amendment, but there is an amendment presently pending and it would have to be set aside. There issomeone on this side who does not want it set aside, so I will object. Of course, the Senator can file his amendment, but the request, as I understand it, is to set aside the pending amendment. On behalf of several Senators on this side, I object.
