 There are periodic meetings in my office with a coalition in defense of the first amendment that includes a set of groups that have never met each other before. On the left, the American Civil Liberties Union and the National Education Association; on the right, Right to Life, Christian Coalition, and all shades of philosophies in between, all of whom have one thing in common--they do not want Congress to push them out, do not want them to push them off the playing field and keep them from participating in American elections.  So this coalition is very active. You would think, listening to the broadcast media and reading the Washington Post, that there was nobody on the other side of this debate, that Common Cause was the only conscience out there pressing for these kinds of reforms. Ironically, Common Cause is against the Hollings constitutional amendment as well. But there is a broad coalition, I would say to my friend from New Mexico. They are very active, very involved, and do not intend to be taken off the playing field.
