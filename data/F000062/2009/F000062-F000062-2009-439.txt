 He has served in the body for 50 years. I have had the privilege of working on the Appropriations Committee with him. There has been no one who has been more faithful to the Constitution, to the goals of the Senate or who has served this Senate more honorably. I wish to say congratulations, Mr. Chairman. May you have many more years.                          ____________________
