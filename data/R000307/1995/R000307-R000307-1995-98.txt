Chairman, I yield myself much time as I may consume.  [[Page H3601]] Mr. Chairman, I rise in reluctant opposition to the gentleman's amendment. The gentleman from Ohio [Mr. Traficant], as every Member knows, is the Buy American amendment champion of the House of Representatives and does yeoman work in that regard.  I agree with the gentleman's intent of the amendment. And the gentleman does describe a real problem we have in the Food Stamp Program where approximately $3 billion in expenditures, as itemized by the inspector general of the Department of Agriculture, is going to fraud, abuse, and organized crime.                              {time}  1330  We have stores in big cities that are not stores, they are just clearing houses in regard to using the Food Stamp Programs and the coupons as a second currency to bankroll organized crime.  We have a strong antifraud provision in this bill. It is bipartisan. The distinguished ranking minority member, the gentleman from Texas [Mr. de la Garza], chairman emeritus of the House Committee on Agriculture, has contributed to that effort, and the administration has contributed to that effort.  We asked the inspector general of the Department of Agriculture whether or not the amendment of the gentleman from Ohio [Mr. Traficant], from a practical standpoint, would be of help. I think from a perception standpoint there is no question that gentleman's amendment in terms of intent is very positive, but the amendment requires that the EBT cards contain a photograph of the family receiving food stamps.  In the first place, we have a problem here with an unfunded mandate, since the States pay half the cost of the EBT, or that card. By this amendment, they would be required to pay additional amounts for a system that includes the photographs.  In addition, in contacting the Inspector General, there is very little if any evidence, there is no evidence that having a photograph of the entire family of the EBT card will stop any kind of trafficking.  In order to traffic in Food Stamp Programs with an EBT card, there must be a willing participant and a willing person in the grocery store. Having a photograph on that card will not deter the trafficking, because the grocery store person is a willing participant. That certainly would not stop the case. Without a willing partner in the grocery store, there would be no trafficking with the EBT cards.  I want to make it clear that the EBT cards are instrumental in reducing the incidences of street trafficking of food stamps, but it does not eliminate the trafficking. However, EBT does provide a trail, so that law enforcement personnel can trace these violations, and then really prosecute all who violate the act.  I would say to my colleagues, Mr. Chairman, that while I admire the gentleman's intent, and I admire the gentleman, the cost of placing a photograph of a family on the EBT card, while unknown, is unlikely to pay off. I think it is going to slow down our efforts to have States adopt a criteria to put in place the entire system is regard to EBT.  Mr. Chairman, I yield such time as he may consume to the gentleman from Missouri [Mr. Emerson], the distinguished chairman of the subcommittee in charge of food stamp reform.
