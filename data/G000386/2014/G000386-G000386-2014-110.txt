 President, the legalization of marijuana is an issue that has generated significant media attention in recent months. Last year Colorado and Washington State became the first jurisdictions in the world to legalize the production, trafficking, possession and use of marijuana for recreational purposes. The consequences of legalization are only beginning to be understood. But one thing is clear. Legalizing marijuana does not make it any safer. Marijuana remains a Schedule I drug under the Controlled Substances Act. According to that designation, it is a substance that presents ``a high potential for abuse.''  Colorado's previous experience legalizing medical marijuana suggests that the consequences of full-on legalization could be dire for public health and safety. From 2006 to 2010, the number of Colorado drivers involved in fatal car crashes who tested positive for marijuana doubled. The number of Colorado students who have been suspended or expelled for marijuana use has increased considerably. Nearly three-quarters of Denver teenagers in drug treatment reported obtaining marijuana from a ``medical marijuana'' user. Colorado has become a source State for the distribution of marijuana throughout the United States. Law enforcement in my home State of Iowa reports that the percentage of marijuana interdicted there that originated from Colorado has increased from 10 percent in 2010 to 36 percent in 2012.  Against this backdrop, the Obama administration has recently sent mixed signals, especially to young people, about the dangers of marijuana use. President Obama recently stated that in his view, marijuana use was no worse than drinking alcohol. The Department of Justice declined to challenge State laws that have legalized marijuana, despite the obvious conflict with Federal law. Additionally, the Department issued guidance to prosecutors concerning the enforcement of the Controlled Substances Act and Federal money laundering laws that is plainly intended to permit marijuana businesses in these States to grow and flourish. These actions have caused confusion and uncertainty about whether using marijuana is really something that should be discouraged because it is harmful.  However, many community anti-drug coalitions, healthcare professionals, public health officials, and law enforcement groups are speaking out about the dangers of marijuana use. One such group, Smart Approaches to Marijuana--or Project SAM for short--has recently begun to confront the marijuana legalization movement head-on.  One of Project SAM's cofounders, former Congressman Patrick Kennedy, has been outspoken in his efforts to fight the marijuana legalization movement. He has appeared on numerous television and radio shows, including ones where audiences may disagree with his views against legalization. He has bared his own struggles with addiction, offering himself up as a cautionary tale about the dangers of becoming addicted to marijuana and other substances. And he has broken with many in his party by speaking out against the President's permissive attitude toward marijuana use and the Obama administration's failure to enforce the Controlled Substances Act. Indeed, all former DEA Administrators, appointed by Republican and Democratic presidents alike, have joined with Project SAM and others tooppose the Obama administration's policies in this area.  According to a recent article from NBCnews.com, an article I ask unanimous consent to have printed in the Record, Project SAM recently launched a serious counter-offensive to the marijuana legalization movement. The organization began by placing a billboard near the Super Bowl stating that ``Marijuana kills your drive.'' Project SAM launched a website dedicated to tracking public health incidents linked to marijuana use in Colorado and Washington to highlight the consequences of legalization in those States. It is also launching websites that will allow current or former marijuana users to share their stories about how marijuana has damaged their lives.  Project SAM has also been active in my home State of Iowa. The organization recently co-hosted town hall meetings with local community anti-drug coalitions, highlighting the risks of legalizing marijuana. Project SAM has also briefed State officials about the dangers of legalizing marijuana.  It is not every day that I have the occasion to praise a Democrat. However, Congressman Kennedy is to be commended for his courage in coming forward and participating in this debate by publicizing the dangers of marijuana use and opposing the Obama administration's failure to enforce Federal law in this area. His voice is a welcome one for those of us who believe that the legalization of marijuana is an unwise policy that will have a profoundly negative effect on public health and the lives of many young people.  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in the Record, as follows:                   [From NBCnews.com, Feb. 14, 2014]    Treatment or Jail: Patrick Kennedy Wages Fierce Anti-Pot Crusade                           (By Tony Dokoupil)       As a hard-partying teenager, Patrick Kennedy met President      Reagan at a fundraiser for the JFK Library, a meeting      captured in a photograph that the former Rhode Island      congressman now hangs in his home office. He used to think of      it as a funny episode, a collision of Camelot's cocaine kid      and America's foremost opponent of illegal drug use. But      Kennedy took his last hit of anything in 2009, and he's since      honed an anti-drug message that sounds a bit like Reagan with      a Boston brogue.       Kennedy believes there is ``an epidemic in this country of      epic dimensions when it comes to alcohol and drugs. He'd like      to treat it all, but he's convinced that the single biggest      threat to America's mental health is free-market marijuana.      So even as Democrats favor the legalization of pot--by a 34-     point margin, according to the latest WSJ/NBC News poll--the      scion of America's most famous Democratic family has broken      ranks, criticized the White House, and aligned with the likes      of Newt Gingrich to warn voters against trying to tax and      regulate today's psychoactive chlorophyll.       ``I don't think the American public has any clue about this      stuff,'' says Kennedy, after welcoming guests with a choice      of Gatorade or bottled water.       The ``stuff'' in question is modern marijuana, of course,      which gets pumped into snack foods and candies, and carries      more THC (tetrahydrocannabinol, the chemical that gets you      high) than the ditch weed used by the hippie generation.      Kennedy calls legalization ``a public health nightmare      because he believes it will warm more people to a dangerous      drug, and lead inevitably to ``Big Marijuana,'' a blood-     sucking vice industry dependent on converting kids and      selling to heavy users--same as the tobacco and alcohol      industries.       ``The science tells the story,'' he says, breaking into an      attack on the idea that marijuana is safer than alcohol. He      ticks through studies showing that smoked marijuana is      ``associated with'' or ``linked to'' IQ loss, psychosis, and      self-reported dissatisfaction with life. ``It takes you to      the same place as cocaine or heroin,'' he often adds. ``It      just takes longer.''       ``Incarceration is a powerful motivator,'' says Kennedy,      who after a prescription drug-addled crash in 2006 spent a      year urinating in front of a probation officer three times a      week.       Last January Kennedy went public with his beliefs,      launching Smart Approaches to Marijuana, or Project SAM, a      campaign to keep marijuana illegal and address the failings      of the drug war through other means. But what other means?      Kennedy has sometimes been vague, promising ``a fresh      approach that neither legalizes, nor demonizes marijuana,''      but never quite clarifying what makes him different from      Reagan-era prohibitionists.       Not anymore. In a series of interviews, Kennedy and his      cofounder Kevin Sabet--a former senior advisor to the Obama      administration on drug policy--previewed SAM's aggressive new      posture for 2014. It's not a new War on Pot, but it might be      the most potent campaign since Nancy Reagan made marijuana      the centerpiece of her ``Just say no'' tour three decades      ago.       As Kennedy and Sabet cut a path between the poles of      legalization and prohibition, they seem to list toward the      status quo. They would make the simple possession of      marijuana a civil infraction, like jaywalking, which could      take 750,000 annual marijuana arrests down to zero, and      alleviate the disproportionate burden that prohibition puts      on people who are nonwhite and poor.       But instead of handcuffs, Kennedy and Sabet propose a      mandatory screening for marijuana addiction, according to the      ``Legal Reform'' section of their website. That could lead to      ``marijuana education,'' and ultimately a year in a      ``probation program to prevent further drug use.'' And if the      pot smoker still insists on getting high? It's handcuffs      time.       ``Incarceration is a powerful motivator,'' says Kennedy,      who after a prescription drug-related car crash in 2006 spent      a year urinating in front of a probation officer three times      a week. He faced a jail term if he relapsed. ``That does it      for a lot of people,'' he added. ``That's the turning point:      hearing that judge say treatment or jail.''       ``I think Madison Avenue has proven that it can get around      more rules and be more ruthless than any Mexican drug      cartel,'' adds Sabet.       Kennedy and Sabet can also sound old-school on medical      marijuana. As a member of Congress, Kennedy voted in favor of      allowing patients access to pot but now says he was wrong.      He'd like to repeal every law that treats smoked marijuana as      medicine. Instead he hopes to see pharmaceutical-grade      cannabis satisfy an FDA approval process and sell as a patch      or pill. ``We don't smoke opium for morphine,'' as Sabet      explains, ``we don't need to smoke pot for medicine.''       SAM's opponents argue that legalizing weed would raise tax      revenue, allow law enforcement to chase more serious crime,      and undercut Mexico's violent drug cartels. Kennedy and      Sabet sharply dispute all this--and so much more--but      they're particularly unapologetic about championing the      continued existence of a black market. They say it's      mostly nonviolent on the American side, and will create      fewer public health problems than allowing advertisers to      flog for Big Marijuana.       ``There is no way to minimize the greed and profit motive      in promoting a dangerous substance,'' says Kennedy. When it      comes to pushing a product, adds Sabet, ``I think Madison      Avenue has proven that it can get around more rules and be      more ruthless than any Mexican drug cartel.'' He calls the      black market, ``better than having Joe Pot, heir to Joe      Camel, on a bus-stop where I'm going to be hanging out with      my kids before school.''       When Project SAM launched, opponents mocked the effort as      foolhardy, and they had a point. Voters had just legalized      marijuana by a landslide in Colorado and Washington. Polls      showed that a majority of Americans supported doing the same      nationwide, and Kennedy could do little at first but appear      on TV as the token voice of dissent.       Now, however, SAM is poised to launch a serious counter-     offensive. It began this month with a billboard outside the      Super Bowl.``Marijuana kills your drive,'' read the      carefully-calibrated text, which picked up national coverage,      spreading on a tide of the opposition's howls and guffaws.       It was crafted by Sabet, a 34-year-old prodigy of drug      politics, who launched his first anti-drug campaign (Citizens      for a Drug-Free Berkeley) while in college and is now, in the      opinion of Rolling Stone, the number one national ``enemy of      legalization.''       ``Yep,'' he emailed after the ad launched. ``Game on.''       ``My name is John and marijuana ruined my life,'' begins      one entry from a young man who says that marijuana took ``the      gifts and potential I was born with.''       The game continues this spring, with SAM planning a      response to ``We Are the Marijuana Majority,'' a web      compendium of legalization's best and most famous friends,      launched with a grant from the Drug Policy Alliance, a      leading advocate for reform. The SAM answer will be a      directory of--you guessed it--the anti-marijuana majority.       The precise URL and title is still under discussion, but      the webpage will feature opponents of legalization, an      infinite scroll of head shots and quotes from the likes of      Tina Brown, David Brooks, and Barack Obama (whose tangled      statements on the subject appear to have landed him on both      sites at once).       SAM's second website will take aim at Colorado and      Washington, the world's first state-approved markets for      marijuana, and to Kennedy and Sabet a slowly unfolding      disaster that will prove them right in the end. The Justice      Department has said it will shut down the state experiments      if the regulations fail or public health falters, which is      why SAM will use this site to track every known example of      pot gone wrong.       The third website is tentatively titled ``The Other Side of      Marijuana'' and it will collect stories from people who      believe marijuana damaged their lives. It's a counterpoint to      the notion that marijuana is a safe, non-addictive substance.      Based on a sample of entries, it's also likely to draw more      fire than anything SAM has done yet.       ``My name is John and marijuana ruined my life,'' begins      one note from a young man who says that marijuana took ``the      gifts and potential I was born with.'' ``Most of my      daughter's former friends are in jail or     dead,'' adds the mother of an 18-year-old in residential      treatment for marijuana addiction. She is ``sickened'' by the      idea that marijuana will be the next big business in America.       In another note a therapist quits her practice in despair      after a rise in marijuana-related patients. ``I witnessed      first-hand too many of the problems,'' she writes, ticking      off ``anxiety, depression, irritability and psychosis.''       ``This is the stuff of life,'' Kennedy says, trying to      explain his passion for drug policy, ``so you bet I'm      emotional about it.''       Not every pot smoker goes crazy or brainless, as Kennedy      admits, but SAM is about minimizing the risk to those who--     like him--start drugs young and are predisposed to break bad      for life. After he got married in 2011, in his early 40s, he      moved to his wife's hometown of Atlantic City, N.J. Now he is      the father of three kids under 5 (one is a step-child), and      he worries they will inherit his addictions. He can also see      the casinos from his backyard.       ``The appetite for Americans to lose themselves is just . .      . '' Kennedy shakes his head and seems too pained to finish      the thought. His six-week-old daughter was fussy the night      before, and it was his turn to shush and pace. In the      hallway, near a stairway to where his 20-month-old son is      napping, there's a toy fire engine and Kennedy's eyes return      to it again and again. Suddenly, he seems to be on the brink      of tears.       ``This is the stuff of life,'' he says, trying to explain      his passion for drug policy, ``so you bet I'm emotional about      it.''       The rollout of the new SAM continued this month at a      conference in Washington, D.C., where Kennedy and Sabet held      a standing-room-only rally for supporters. They celebrated      25,000 media mentions, and 22 states with SAM affiliates.      They aired footage of Kennedy telling CNN's Sanjay Gupta that      his ballyhooed endorsement of marijuana was ``shameful,'' a      ratings ploy that ``history will not remember well.''       So far, however, the legalization side seems to have an      edge in the war of ridicule. They charge Kennedy and Sabet      with 21 st century reefer madness, which the duo bats away as      a sign that the opposition is afraid to engage with the      facts. But while they can sometimes be unpopular at parties,      they keep going, fueled by those letters from the public, and      enthusiastic notes from past drug advisors.       ``SAM is doing what no one else has done and doing a darn      good job of it,'' wrote Robert DuPont, Richard Nixon's head      of drug control, in a recent email to Sabet. ``Absolutely      brilliant presentation,'' Clinton-era drug czar Barry      McCaffrey added in a different note.       In a sense, nothing has changed since a teenage Kennedy      gave President Reagan a sly smile. To make the world a      healthier place, the anti-drug crowd wants to protect people      from their most dangerous appetites. The reform side supports      the same vision of health but wants to make drug use itself      safer, believing that insobriety is normal and indulgence      inevitable.       Neither side appears to be winning, because there's no such      thing as an ``objective'' position on marijuana policy. Would      legalization really be so bad? Or is it the panacea its      proponents claim? The honest answer is: nobody knows for      sure, because no modern nation has ever tried legalization      before--until now.       ``Life isn't really in our control,'' says Kennedy, as      another sober day fades to night. ``There's a mover in the      universe, a higher power, so to speak, and we can't imagine      what we're going to find in our universe if we let go and      just let God lead us.''                          ____________________
