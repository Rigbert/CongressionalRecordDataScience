Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.  Mr. Speaker, I rise today in support of S. 150, the Internet Tax Nondiscrimination Act.  In 1998, Congress passed the Internet Tax Freedom Act to protect the Internet from crippling taxation and piecemeal regulation. The act prohibited States from imposing multiple and discriminatory taxes on electronic commerce and shielded consumers from new Internet access taxes. However, some States that had already begun taxing on Internet access by 1998 were allowed to continue such taxation temporarily.  During the 107th Congress, we extended the moratorium until November 1, 2003. On July 24, 2003, well before the November expiration deadline, the House Committee on the Judiciary reported H.R. 49, the Internet Tax Nondiscrimination Act. Introduced by the gentleman from California (Mr. Cox), H.R. 49 made permanent the ban on taxes that targeted the Internet for discriminatory treatment and immediately ended all taxes on Internet access by all States and localities.  Unlike the Senate bill, H.R. 49 also eliminated the so-called grandfather clause for States that taxed Internet access prior to October 1, 1998; and through a bipartisan amendment offered in subcommittee by the gentleman from Utah (Mr. Cannon) and the gentleman from North Carolina (Mr. Watt), the House bill preserved the original intent of the law by not punishing broadband users, then providing tax freedom for all forms of Internet access, whether by dial-up, cable, or DSL line. H.R. 49 passed the House by voice vote on September 17, 2003. Unfortunately, the other body was unable to pass legislation extending the moratorium until April 29, 2004, 6 months after the moratorium expires.  The Senate bill differs from H.R. 49 in several ways. First, rather than a permanent moratorium, it creates a temporary 4-year moratorium on Internet access taxes running retroactively from November 1, 2003, until November 1, 2007. Secondly, it extends the 1998 grandfather clause for the life of the moratorium so that all those States currently taxing Internet access will continue to do so with the one notable exception of Wisconsin, which I already addressed fully when we considered the related enrolling resolution.                              {time}  1215  Third, it creates a new, 2-year grandfather clause for States that tax Internet access after the expiration of the moratorium.  Despite these weaknesses which I believe to be substantial, passing the Senate bill extending the Internet tax moratorium is still a big win for the vast majority of American Internet users. Without any action by this Congress, Internet commerce would still be subject to State and local taxes in thousands of jurisdictions. The digital economy and its participants are more vulnerable if we do not act, even if we must act on a weaker bill.  For those reasons I support passage of S. 150, which will extend the benefits of the moratorium until 2007.  At this time, let me put everyone on notice that in the next Congress, even though the moratorium does not expire during the life of the 109th Congress, I will attempt, once again, to make this moratorium permanent so that no State, when it puts together its budget in January of 2007, will fall into the trap of counting Internet access taxes as revenue.  The bill, together with the enrolling resolution just passed, will at least temporarily protect against those States and localities taxing our e-mail and taxing Web service. The extension of the moratorium will help vitalize the Internet economy, provide tax relief to consumers no matter how they get their Internet access, and will stimulate equal access to this increasingly important medium. I will continue to assess future avenues that will promote greater Internet access at higher speeds and at less cost for all Americans. Let everybody be on notice that that is going to happen sooner rather than later.  For now, I urge my colleagues to join me in supporting S. 150 and making the Internet a less taxing and more productive experience.  Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.
