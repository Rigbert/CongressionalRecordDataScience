 President, tomorrow the Senate will vote on cloture on the miscellaneous tariffs conference report. It is our expectation that cloture will be invoked by a large margin, and I hope we will complete our work on this measure in short order. Also, during tomorrow's session we are continuing to await the Omnibus appropriations conference report from the House of Representatives. Finally, we will also consider the intelligence reform legislation if it becomes available.                          ____________________
