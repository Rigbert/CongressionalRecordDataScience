President, it is with pride and gratitude that today I commemorate the 150th anniversary of Caribou, ME, which happens to be my hometown.  The early settlers of Caribou were brave, self-reliant pioneers who left the comfort and security of established communities behind to make their own way in the wilderness of northern Maine. I am proud that my ancestors, led by Samuel Wilson Collins, were among that intrepid number, and grateful that for six generations my family has been a part of this wonderful community.  I have great memories of growing up in Caribou, where my parents both served as mayor, and where my brothers now run our fifth generation family lumber business. I remember fondly starting the school year in August so that we could take time off to pick potatoes, working at the public library, and the fun we had going to high school basketball teams, especially during the exciting 1969 State championship season.  But more than anything, I remember what it was like to grow up in a place that had such a strong sense of community. We learned to care for our friends and neighbors and to value our family members. We learned to help those in need. And Caribou's farm and lumber roots taught us the importance of hard work. The lessons I learned growing up in Caribou have stayed with me my entire life and I know many others who would say the same.  This sesquicentennial year is a time to honor those who turned a remote settlement into a center of commerce, education, arts and recreation. It is a time to honor the valiant young men who served in many wars, beginning with the Civil War, and who have risen to our Nation's defense ever since.  It is a time to honor the people of Caribou who celebrate each others' joys and who share each others' burdens.  Mr. President, a couple of years ago, the television host and author Larry King asked me to contribute to a book he was compiling of short essays describing an all-important lesson the contributors learned growing up. I was delighted by the request and had no trouble recalling that defining moment.  One of my earliest childhood memories is of being taken to the Caribou Memorial Day Parade by my Dad. A decorated World War II veteran, with the modesty characteristic of all who serve our Nation in uniform, he would hoist me onto his shoulders so I could better see the parade. And what I was able to see was the entire street lined by the people of Caribou, taking off their hats and putting their hands over their hearts as our flag went by, their eyes shining with pride in their country and with gratitude for those who serve her. A community that joins together to honor its past and to face itsfuture that is Caribou. That is my hometown.  Mr. President, I am proud of what the people of Caribou, ME, have accomplished in building a great American community. I am deeply grateful for the many blessings that this community has given me, and so many others.                          ____________________
