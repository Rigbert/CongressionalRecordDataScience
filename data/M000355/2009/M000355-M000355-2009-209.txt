 President, I say congratulations from this side of the aisle to the distinguished Senator from Montana on his 11,000th vote, which he is about to cast. The majority leader pointed out his great physical prowess in running these marathons. As he also indicated, presiding over the Finance Committee in the last few weeks has certainly qualified him for another long run.  For over 30 years, Senator Baucus has represented Montana in the State legislature, in the U.S. House of Representatives, and in the U.S. Senate. He grew up on his great-grandfather's ranch, and he has always fought hard for the people of the Big Sky State. He has had a simple message: Montana comes first. He has fought to strengthen our Nation's transportation infrastructure. As we have seen over the past couple of weeks, he has a pretty strong work ethic, which should not surprise any of us for a guy who, as the majority leader pointed out, walked across the entire length of Montana.  Senator Baucus has given three decades of dedicated service and has kept his pledge to put Montana first. I join the majority leader in congratulating him on his 11,000th vote.  (Applause.)
