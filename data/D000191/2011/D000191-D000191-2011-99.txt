Some of this debt will weigh upon the country. But the question is, how do we get there? The deficit this year will be $1.5 trillion, an unimaginable amount of money, borrowed, a lot of it from China, and that is just virtually unfathomable.  Now, they're going to dink around essentially and pretend they're doing something meaningful next week. They're going to take out after a Federal budget of $3.7 trillion--and remember, $1.5 trillion of that is with borrowed money--they are going to discuss cuts to actually $446 billion of that. So a $3.7 trillion budget, but the only place you can cut is $446 billion of that. Hmm, let's see, if we eliminated that entire $446 billion of expenditures, we'd still have a deficit of over $1 trillion.  Now, that doesn't seem quite to work. So perhaps they've made a few too many things off-limits in terms of where we might look to cut.  Then there's one other thing they've done which is totally bizarre and I don't think many Americans would think very honest. They're saying if we decrease the income of the Government of the United States, i.e., cut taxes, give you back your money, and we don't reduce expenditures in the same amount, that doesn't count as new debt or deficit. You've got to borrow the money, probably from China; and you can send the debt forward but it doesn't count. So they're not going to look at something called tax expenditures.  So, you know, we can't begin to address things like the $20 billion of subsidies in the agriculture bill for five crops grown in eight States that are in surplus and paying people not to grow things. That's off-limits. That's mandatory spending. That can't be considered for cuts, paying people to not grow things. We can't do away with that. We're going to borrow the money so they can get paid to not grow things.  All right. Well, how about the oil companies? Now, Exxon Mobil reported the largest quarterly profit for a corporation in the history of the world the last quarter of last year, $9 billion, and they didn't pay any taxes in the U.S. last year. None. They pay a lot of taxes around the world, but not in the United States. We actually gave them a tax refund because of the loopholes in the tax laws. That's called a tax expenditure. We're borrowing money to give to the Exxon Mobil Corporation, which had a $9 billion profit by gouging consumers in America. Now, that's pretty extraordinary; but, no, we can't talk about eliminating the subsidy to Exxon Mobil. The Republicans have put that off-limits. That would be called a tax increase. You know, by plugging that loophole, that's a tax increase, can't talk about that.  Let's look at one other aspect of this. We were headed for a lower deficit this year. It would have been lower than last year, $1.3 trillion last year. We were headed toward $1.1 trillion, a good glide path, $200 billion reduction in 1 year. If we could do that for 5 more years, we'd be down to virtually zero. But with one vote, one vote, with a deal cut between the Republicans andthe President of the United States, we increased the deficit by $400 billion this year. Yep, the tax cuts. But remember, tax cuts don't count. Now, they increase the deficit by $400 billion. We didn't cut expenditures by $400 billion. So the money is going to be borrowed for those tax cuts, from China and elsewhere; and it's going to be passed on to our kids and our grandkids, part of the national debt.  But that doesn't count in the Republican world. Reducing the income of the government while not reducing expenditures by the same amount doesn't count. They pretend.  Let's not pretend. This is deadly serious. Let's not go after programs that are essential to America. They're going to put things like Pell Grants that are helping people get a college education and become more educated so they will have better lifetime earnings and our country will be more competitive, educate the next generation of folks to lead our Nation--that's on the table next week. We'll probably see some cuts there. Other programs like that will be on the table. Subsidies to oil companies? Tax cuts, yes, we can do more of those and increase the deficit.  So let's get real. It is a real problem, and let's stop pretending that you really care about it and you're going to do something about it.                          ____________________
