. 1628, and I ask unanimous consent that it be printed in the Record. The motion is supported by Senator Blumenthal.  Under the ACA, our Nation has seen the largest decline in the child uninsured rate, and in Illinois, we have seen a 40 percent drop. Today more than 95 percent of kids in our country are insured.  Half of all children born in Illinois are covered by Medicaid.  That means they are guaranteed quality, comprehensive health coverage, from vaccinations and vision checks, to dental health, mental health, and lead poisoning screenings.  Medicaid serves low-income children in schools, and -I have visited many school-based health clinics that provide critical access and services for our kids.  But every single Republican healthcare repeal proposal would slash Medicaid for our most vulnerable kids, jeopardizing the services they receive and their ability to access care.  That is why my motion to commit would instruct the Finance Committee to report out a bill--within 3 days--that protects our kids and tells Republicans they will not be a bargaining chip in this cruel repeal effort.  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in the Record, as follows:                   Motion to Commit With Instructions       Mr. Durbin moves to commit the bill H.R. 1628 to the      Committee on Finance with instructions to report the same      back to the Senate in 3 days, not counting any day on which      the Senate is not in session, with changes that--       (1) are within the jurisdiction of such committee; and       (2) ensures no children on Medicaid lose benefits, have      reduced provider payments for services furnished to them, or      have any increase in out-of-pocket costs.
