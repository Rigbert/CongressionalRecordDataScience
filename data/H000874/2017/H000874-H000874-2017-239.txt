Speaker, I ask that the gentleman's words be taken down. I have never had such a vicious attack made on me.  But I must admit I was deeply disappointed last night. My congratulations to the young men at Xavier and their coach, but my, my, my, I was disappointed in the quality of our play. We have got a great group of young people playing, but it was not their night.  I am sure that I will pick another team sometime as the March Madness continues. What I would hope, though, is we would not have March Madness on this floor next week.  Mr. Speaker, I yield to the gentleman.    Mr. McCARTHY. There will be no upsets.
