President, this is an important amendment. You each have on your desk editorials from the Washington Times, the Washington Post, and the New York Times. They all agree and are in support of this amendment.  Do not confuse asylum with illegal immigration. This speaks of America's vital role in offering asylum. Senators Hatch, Kerry, DeWine, Hatfield, and I have united on this because what we are saying is, if somebody comes to this country trying to escape religious oppression, political oppression, or whatever, the mere fact that they have come here under a false passport--usually the only way they can get out of the country these escape--we should not have a low-level person be able to turn them back automatically for that.  Let them have a full asylum hearing. It does not do anything for illegal immigrants. But it makes sure that the U.S. promise of a fair hearing for those who are escaping religious or political persecution can get it.
