 President, I would like to first give approximately a 1-minute speech and then speak for a longer time on another subject.  I am happy to recognize small businesses in Iowa, and, of course, we should recognize them all across our country. We do that by celebrating National Small Business Week.  In my State of Iowa, 99 percent of all businesses are small businesses. Also, almost half of Iowa's employees are employed by small businesses.  Government regulations have a disproportionate impact on small businesses, often costing them 20 percent more than the average of all businesses. So we need to remember that small businesses are the main source of America's innovations and economic strength. We should all be proud of and support these men and women who work hard to keep our communities vibrant.  This week is devoted to honoring small business.                               Tax Reform  Mr. President, a few weeks ago, our tax filing season came to an end. This filing season was a very important milestone as it was the first tax filing season under the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act signed by the President before Christmas 2017.  Congressional Democrats sought to turn the filing season into an indictment of the tax reform through a campaign of misinformation and a campaign of half-truths.
