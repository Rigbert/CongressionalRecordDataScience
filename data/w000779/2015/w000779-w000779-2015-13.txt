On November 3, Kate Rogers McCarthy, a lifelong conservationist, activist, and friend, passed away in her hometown of Parkdale, OR. Born in 1917 adjacent to the snow-capped peaks of Mount Hood in Parkdale, Kate spent most of her life in awe of the natural beauty that surrounded her. Kate drew from that passion as she worked to preserve many of Oregon's most iconic outdoor spaces, eventually taking on many leadership roles in conservation groups at the State and national levels.  Growing up with the wilderness of Mount Hood as her backyard, Kate learned the value of nature and the importance of protecting our natural treasures. By the time she was in high school, Kate and her younger sister Betty ran an outdoor recreation camp for girls on the family property that introduced those girls to the beauty of Mount Hood. Kate attended Reed College, Yale Nursing School, and the University of Oregon Medical School. After earning her degrees and with new commercial development threatening the preservation of the Mount Hood wilderness, Kate began her lifelong campaign to preserve the lands she loved.  In the mid-1970s, with development rapidly expanding into wild areas near Mount Hood, Kate and a group of Parkdale residents began a campaign to encourage county representatives to vote on zoning options. Thanks to her diligence and that of the other residents, the county voted to protect agricultural zones. Agricultural zoning still protects farmland in the upper valley today. In 1977, Kate gathered a few friends and founded the Hood River Valley Residents Committee. The committee grew to 1,200 members under Kate's leadership and continues to protect the natural spaces that are so unique to Oregon.  A tireless advocate and conservationist, Kate was involved in a multitude of other conservation groups as well. She served as a member of the Oregon Natural Resources Council, what is now Oregon Wild; the Board of the Oregon Environmental Council; and Friends of the Columbia Gorge. She was also a charter member of 1000 Friends of Oregon. To motivate still greater involvement by citizens in the protection of Mount Hood, Kate helped form Friends of Mount Hood, a nonprofit organization dedicated to protecting the alpine meadows, wetlands, wildlife, and forests of Mount Hood by working with the Forest Service and the Oregon congressional delegation.  In 2002, Kate McCarthy was recognized as a Women of Distinction honoree by the soroptimists of Hood River for making a difference in the lives of women and girls in her local community. She also received the highest award given by the Mazamas Mountaineering Club, becoming only the 41st person given the top award since the club's founding in 1894. For several years, Kate worked closely with local organizations, as well as my office, to protect the north side of Mount Hood and Cooper Spur from a massive destination resort in the Hood River Valley. After years of hard-fought battles, Congress passed the Mount Hood Wilderness bill. The bill protects the more than 200,000 acres of wilderness and rivers in the Hood River Valley, an accomplishment I am proud to have been a part of.  Because of Kate's lifetime of work to protect some of our most beautiful wetlands, forests, wildlife, and farms, she has given Oregonians and people from around the world opportunities to experience Oregon's natural splendor for generations to come. Kate McCarthy, a mother, grandmother, great grandmother, friend, and advocate of the natural beauty around her, deserves the utmost appreciation for a life fully lived. I honor the prolific life and career of Kate Rodgers McCarthy and express my gratitude for her everlasting impact on our State and Nation.                          ____________________
