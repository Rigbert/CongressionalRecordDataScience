President, I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be printed in the Record.  There being no objection, the text of the bill was ordered to be printed in the Record, as follows:                                S. 1036       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of      the United States of America in Congress assembled,     SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.       This Act may be cited as the ``Affordable College Textbook      Act''.     SEC. 2. FINDINGS.       Congress finds the following:       (1) The high cost of college textbooks continues to be a      barrier for many students in achieving higher education.       (2) According to the College Board, during the 2017-2018      academic year, the average student budget for college books      and supplies at 4-year public institutions of higher      education was $1,240.       (3) The Government Accountability Office found that new      textbook prices increased 82 percent between 2002 and 2012      and that although Federal efforts to increase price      transparency have provided students and families with more      and better information, more must be done to address rising      costs.       (4) The growth of the internet has enabled the creation and      sharing of digital content, including open educational      resources that can be freely used by students, teachers, and      members of the public.       (5) According to the Student PIRGs, expanded use of open      educational resources has the potential to save students more      than a billion dollars annually.       (6) Federal investment in expanding the use of open      educational resources could significantly lower college      textbook costs and reduce financial barriers to higher      education, while making efficient use of taxpayer funds.       (7) Educational materials, including open educational      resources, must be accessible to the widest possible range of      individuals, including those with disabilities.     SEC. 3.
