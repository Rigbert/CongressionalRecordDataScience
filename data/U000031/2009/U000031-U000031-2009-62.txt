These outstanding young women have come a long way this past season and have made their community so very proud. It had been 25 years since the Lady Tigers last appeared in the Class A finals . . . and this time they emerged as champions!  Winning a state championship is something that will last a lifetime. It is a remarkable achievement that few teams in southwest Michigan ever experience, and it is a legacy that will live with the 2008-09 Lady Tigers forever. The Lady Tigers and Coach Harvey know what brought this state title back to Benton Harbor--hard work. It is doing that one extra sprint, that extra drill, shooting that extra free throw after practice that helped make the Lady Tigers champions. Nobody outworked the Tigers and nobody could beat them in the state tournament. And nobody had a greater following or more community support than our Lady Tigers.  It is an honor to pay tribute to the entire Lady Tiger squad: Olivia Askew, Damonica Buford, Tiara Greer-Allen, Andrea Ellis, Iesha Ellis, Deborah Meeks, Rashonda Pargo, Nyesha Winbush, and All-American Destiny Williams, who led the Lady Tigers with 31 points and added 21 rebounds. We salute all of you.  On behalf of all the residents of southwest Michigan, congratulations again to the Lady Tigers and Coach Harvey and the entire Benton Harbor community--you are an inspiration to us all. It is Tiger Pride at its finest. Go Tigers!                          ____________________
