 President, I am pleased to become a cosponsor of S. 228, the Congressional Pension Equity Act. I commend Senator Bryan for his leadership on this issue and I look forward to working with him to reform our pension system and bring it in line with all other Federal civilian pensions.  Like pensions in the private sector, the pension a member of Congress receives is based upon length of service and rate of pay. So, naturally a senior member, or staffer, earns a bigger pension than an individual with just a few years of service. But, under the current system members and staff receive substantially more generous pensions than other Federal employees. This bill will rectify that situation and bring parity between the legislative branch and the executive branch. Those who serve in Congress should be treated the same as other Federal employees.  For those who claim that people come to Congress and serve too long, this fix should end the careerism charge. Overly generous pensions will no longer entice people to stay in their congressional jobs. Congressional service will be no more desirable than other Federal service, and members and staff will not be deterred from rotating out of Congress.  This bill makes three important changes to congressional pensions. First, it places a cap on retirement benefits. Now, retired members can wind up receiving pensions that are bigger than the salaries they made while in Congress. The bill will ensure that pension benefits do not exceed the highest salary earned while in Congress. Second, it establishes a uniform rate of accrual for all Federal employees, so that congressional employees earn their pension benefits at the same rate as all other Federal employees. And, finally it adjusts the contribution rate for congressional employees to conform to the rate paid by all other employees. Currently, members and staff pay a slightly higher contribution for a much more generous benefit. This bill will require congressional and executive branch employees, including Members of Congress, to pay the same for the same benefit.  Congressional retirement benefits are not an entitlement. We are in the midst of streamlining and cutting back the scope of the Federal Government. We are trying to make the Federal Government more efficient and effective. That's what the American people want and what they deserve. Well, one place to begin is with congressional pensions. This bill represents that effort. I look forward to early consideration of this bill by the Government Affairs Committee and its swift passage by the Senate.                          ____________________
