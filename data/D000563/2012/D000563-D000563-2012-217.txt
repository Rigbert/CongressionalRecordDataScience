President, some of you may have seen in the press last week that an inspiring Cuban citizen who tirelessly fought for a peaceful transition to democracy recently died in a tragic car accident on that island.  Oswaldo Paya was a modest man. A brave man. A hero. A Cuban patriot.  And he was also very wise.  He realized that one of the best ways to change the cruel and repressive Cuban regime was to work from within.  He used a provision in Cuba's constitution to seek peaceful political change and openness.  More specifically, he and his team created the Varela Project to gather more than 11,000 signatures of Cuban citizens on a petition that called for a more open political system.  Keep in mind that putting one's name on a petition to the Cuban Government is a courageous thing to do on that island. It puts that person and his or her family at great risk.  Nonetheless, in May 2002, he bravely presented the petition to the Cuban National Assembly for action exactly as allowed for in the Cuban Constitution.  What did the Cuban Government do in response to a heroic and reasonable call for change allowed for under the country's own laws?  It harassed Paya and his followers. It began its own referendum that made the island's socialist system ``irrevocable,'' even after an additional 14,000 signatures were added to the Varela Project petition.  A year later many of Paya's allies were arrested in a crackdown that sent many dissidents, writers, and even librarians to prison.  Can you believe this craven response?  The Cuban Government couldn't blame this Cuban-born effort on the United States, on other outside forces, on any of the usual suspects on which it blames all the island's woes.  Thousands of brave Cubans asking for political reform within the bounds of their own constitution were simply belittled, ignored, and harassed.  Paya was a modest man. I had hoped to meet him on my trip to the island earlier this year, but we were unable to visit--you see, the Cuban government doesn't want outsiders to visit people like Paya.  His peaceful and tireless efforts for peaceful change earned him the European Parliament's Sakarov Prize for Freedom of Thought in 2002, the National Democratic Institute's W. Averell Harriman Democracy Award in 2003, and a nomination for the Nobel Peace Prize from Vaclav Havel in 2005.  Paya's daughter Rosa Maria said amid her loss and tears last week that her father never gave up hope that the country could be changed from within and that ``he just wanted for Cubans to have their rights . . . that's all he ever wanted.''  Tragically the Cuban Government even arrested almost 50 Cubans who showed up to pay their respects at Paya's funeral.  Can you imagine--arresting people at a peaceful memorial service?  My colleagues, Senators Bill Nelson, Menendez, and Rubio, have introduced a Senate resolution recognizing his work and calling for the peaceful democratic changes in Cuba that Paya spent his life pursuing. I am pleased to be a cosponsor of that resolution and was happy to see that it passed the Senate just yesterday.  Lastly, let me note that Paya was often concerned for his safety--sadly, given the Cuban Government's treatment of those wanting political freedom, not an unwarranted fear.  So I want to emphasize an important point in the Senate resolution on Mr. Paya. Specifically, I call on the Cuban Government to conduct a credible and transparent investigation into the auto accident that caused his death.  The Cuban Government owes this Cuban patriot and the Cuban people nothing less than a full accounting of his death. It also owes them the basic freedoms he tirelessly stood for.  Mr. President, I want to also take this opportunity to talk about another tragedy that continues day after day in Cuba--that of the detention of American citizen Alan Gross.  Alan was arrested more than 2\1/2\ years ago while trying to help the Cuban people have greater ability to communicate with one another.  When you go to Cuba, you realize the Castro regime not only blames the United States for all its woes but cynically makes it difficult for everyday Cubans to communicate or connect to the outside world using the Internet.  That is why thousands upon thousands of Cubans use a free Internet library every year at the U.S. Interests Section in Havana.  Alan Gross was arrested initially as a spy and eventually sentenced to 15 years in prison.  That is right--15 years.  Mr. Gross apologized for his actions and has asked for Cuban compassion to allow him to visit his 90-year old mother suffering from inoperable lung cancer in the United States. The United States recently let a former Cuban detainee who was out on supervised release in the United States visit his ailing brother in Cuba, but the Cuban Government has shown no such decency in return.  I met Alan in January in Cuba, and I am appreciative of the Cuban Government for allowing me that visit. He tried to remain in good spirits, but it wasn't easy. He has lost more than 100 pounds since his incarceration. He struggles to keep busy and healthy in jail, but it is not easy. Quite simply, he has been separated from his family for far too long.  Alan Gross is a kind, decent man. He is no spy. He is no threat to anyone. In fact, despite all that has happened, he noted to me how deeply he still cares for the Cuban people.  Let me say this as clear as I can: Alan Gross should no longer be a pawn of the Cuban Government in its disagreements with the United States.  The Cuban Government has made its point. It will get nothing but international shame from holding Alan any longer.  Let me also note that I do not support the failed U.S. embargo against Cuba and think the best way to see change on the island is to flood it with American ideas and people.  But I will have to think long and hard before I do anything further to ease our relations while Alan remains so cruelly behind bars.  To Oswaldo Paya's family and brave colleagues and to Alan Gross, please know that you are not forgotten here in the Senate and around the world.                          ____________________
