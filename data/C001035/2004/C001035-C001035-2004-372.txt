I have the language. The NID would establish collection and analysis requirements for the Intelligence Community, determine collection and analysis priorities, manage and issue collection and analysis tasking, and resolve conflicts in the tasking abilities of the intelligence community. So the language is very clear that the NID would have enhanced authority to resolve the kinds of conflicts that sometimes do occur now on the allocation of satellite resources, for example.  Mr. DeWINE. So it is the Senator's feeling that--and everything is very time sensitive--in a matter of hours this person could make the decision and basically order this to be done?
