Speaker, at this very moment our United States trade ambassador is announcing proposed trade sanctions against Japan for its unfair trade practices. After a decade, the executive branch of our Government has taken seriously Congress' mandate to open Japan's auto market.  Imposing penalties on Japan has my full support. In the weeks ahead, as Democratic cochair of the auto caucus here, I urge United States representative Mickey Kantor to hang tough for America and fight as hard as he can to increase our access to Japan's market. If this Nation were to achieve auto trade equity with Japan we could build 100 new factories in this country, each employing 5,000 people. That is how big the gap really is.  The United States has trade balances with every other major trading partner in the world but for Japan. So for Japan, the time has come.                          ____________________
