 President, I wish to thank our colleague from Nebraska and our guest this morning for reminding us of the wonderful story of Boys Town. We were discussing the movie from the late 1930s staring Spencer Tracy and Mickey Rooney, as well as learning what has happened to Boys Town since then.  Thank you so much, Senator Fischer and our guest, for bringing us up to date on the latest on Boys Town.                          ____________________
