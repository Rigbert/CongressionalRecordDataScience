 President, I want to commend to my colleagues the exceptionally thoughtful lead editorial in yesterday morning's Washington Post. It is entitled ``The Test Ban and Arms Control,'' and it makes some cogent points about the Comprehensive Test-Ban Treaty and a Senate where few objections are raised to the Treaty itself, but most Republicans still cast symbolic votes against it.  The Post notes correctly that leading Senate Republicans seem to assume that a national missile defense is the only answer to the problems of nuclear proliferation and the risk of nuclear war.  As the Post concludes, however, treaties like the Chemical Weapons Convention and the Comprehensive Test-Ban Treaty ``are capable of serving American requirements well.'' Whatever one's views on national missile defense, those treaties ``would strengthen the American position in the world.''  I would note two areas in which I disagree with the Post editorial. First of all, the Test-Ban Treaty was signed 2 years ago, rather than ``earlier this year.'' The Treaty was submitted to the Senate nearly a full year ago, and has languished because the Republican leadership is afraid to let it come up.  I do not accept the Post's pessimistic view, moreover, of the Test-Ban Treaty's chances on the floor. In last week's vote, moderate Republicans could support their Leader without doing any tangible harm.  When the Test-Ban Treaty finally comes up for a vote on ratification, however, I am confident that at least 67 members will support it, just as they supported the Chemical Weapons Convention last year.  With those two caveats, I strongly urge my colleagues to read Tuesday's Post editorial and I ask unanimous consent that it be printed in the Record.  There being no objection, the editorial ordered to be printed in the Record, as follows:               [From the Washington Post, Sept. 8, 1998]                     The Test Ban and Arms Control       An early Senate vote on funds for implementation of the      comprehensive nuclear test ban treaty indicates that the two-     thirds majority needed to ratify the test ban may be lacking.      There would be some votes from the Republican majority for a      treaty, but at this moment the dominant blocking position of      the party leadership looks strong. The evident resistance to      ratification is attributed not simply to dissatisfaction with      some of the treaty's terms--there isn't all that much      dissatisfaction--but to a fundamental and wrongheaded quarrel      with the premises of arms control itself.       Modern arms control was invented during the Cold War to      restrict the nuclear armories of the then-two great powers      and, if not to bring something deserving of the name of peace      between them, then to lessen the risks and costs of their      preparing for nuclear war. There were ups and downs, and      their ultimate worth can be argued, but there is no denying      that at a certain point Ronald Reagan demolished arms control      as everyone had known it.       From being a policy aimed at producing nuclear parity or      stalemate in a condition of reduced but continuing political      hostility, arms control became under President Reagan a bold      program to end Soviet-American nuclear competition and beyond      that, to close out the Cold War itself by seeing to the      transformation of the Soviet Union. Many other hands,      especially Mikhail Gorbachev's, shared in this task. But      Ronald Reagan was a leading contributor to the different      state of affairs we enjoy with Russia to this day.       Since the Cold War's demise, the urgency has gone out of      classical arms control. The United States, far from deterring      Russia and preserving a balance of terror, is helping Russia      dismantle its excessive and expensive nuclear capability,      concentrating on the specter of ``loose nukes''--weapons      under uncertain official control and vulnerable to private      theft and misuse. Still, the weapons that most trouble the      United States and Russia are those in the hands, or in the      aspirations, of third countries. Nonproliferation or counter-     proliferation is at the heart of post-Cold War arms control.       This is the context in which the comprehensive test ban      treaty, which was decades in the making, finally was signed      earlier this year. This arms-control perennial had changed      from being a check on Russian and American arms programs into      a restraint on the spread of weapons of mass destruction      among assorted regimes around the world. This is the test      ban's 21st century mission: to give the multitude of nations      an additional lever with which to press Iran and Iraq, North      Korea, India, Pakistan and Israel--and rogues elsewhere--to      abandon or slow their nuclear urges.       Leading Senate Republicans perversely persist in blaming      the test ban, and by extension the whole updated post-Cold      War framework of arms control, for nuclear and chemical and      other programs being pursued by various countries. These      naive senators seem to believe that arms-control measures are      magically self-enforcing. They fail to understand that the      signatories of arms-control agreements must take upon      themselves the burdens of observing their terms and of      enforcing compliance to others' formal pledges of self-     denial. If the signatories fall short, the responsibility      falls on them, not on the agreements.       The senators also profess to rely on American power and      American technology alone--especially on a new national      missile defense--to ensure the security of the United States.      Such a missile defense is in the works, but questions remain      about its strategic purpose, efficacy and cost. The pace of      pondering these questions has itself become a sharp political      issue. Meanwhile, some senators carelessly would throw away      the increments to American security that could be added by      cooperation with other friendly countries in matters such as      the chemical weapons treaty, the nuclear nonproliferation      treaty and the test ban.       These are imperfect instruments, but they are capable of      serving American requirements well. Even if a missile defense      of minimal cost, deadly accuracy and reliability were ready      today, which it is not, those instruments would strengthen      the American position in the world.                          ____________________
