Chairman, I move to strike the requisite number of words.  Mr. Chairman, I listened with care to the presentation of the gentleman from Wisconsin [Mr. Klug] and the special manner in which his request has been treated in this appropriations bill.                              {time}  1630  Now, what I find very unusual about it is that this really is not a matter for the Committee on Appropriations. In fact, as I listened to the gentleman concerning how you wished to handle the section 8 certificates, and I believe you are from Madison, WI, this is really a matter for the authorizers. In fact, you could bring a separate bill to the floor, and what I find really amazing is that the Committee on Rules allowed you to do this and you have been given a special waiver to be included in the appropriations bill for a given project when, in fact, we cannot even get included in the rule governing the debate on this bill major programs, not just a project here or there, but major programs that we are being denied the ability to debate, such as the drug elimination program which I brought up this morning during the debate on the rule.  So I would like to ask the gentleman how is it that you were given this really quite unique opportunity? I think you were one of only two such special inclusions in the appropriations bill.  What presentation did you make to the Committee on Rules and how were you able to get this included? I am very curious.
