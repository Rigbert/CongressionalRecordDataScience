Speaker, I yield myself 1 minute.  Mr. Speaker, once again the gentleman from California repeats the same old refrain that it is the fault of this House that a conference has not been set up.  That is not the case. The Senate never messaged their bill to the House when they passed it in May. The only place where a conference can be set up is in the other body, and they can take up the House-passed bill and strike out all after the enacting clause and set up a conference. And only they can explain why that has not been done.  Secondly, the gentleman from California says that the catch and release change is meaningless. The Secretary of Homeland Security disagrees. I have a letter supporting the changes, specifically stating that the injunction that was issued against expedited removal of Salvadorans is costing the taxpayers money. This bill changes that.  And I will include the letter sent to me by Secretary of Homeland Security Michael Chertoff on September 20 in the Record at this point.                              Department of Homeland Security,                               Washington, DC, September 20, 2006.     Hon. F. James Sensenbrenner, Jr.     Chairman, Committee on the Judiciary,     House of Representatives, Washington, DC.       Dear Mr. Chairman: Thank you for your support of critical      injunction reform legislation, which will significantly      support the Department of Homeland Security's (DHS) efforts      to maintain ``catch and remove'' of non-Mexican illegal      aliens apprehended along our Nation's borders. DHS urgently      needs Congress to approve this legislation to ensure that      long-outdated court decisions do not frustrate efforts to      secure the border.       DHS has made great strides in increasing the number of non-     Mexican illegal aliens detained for removal along the      Nation's borders. In fact, DHS now detains all eligible      individuals for prompt removal upon apprehension along both      the Southwest and Northern borders. However, I am concerned      that DHS will not be able to maintain this success because of      a 1988 court order that impedes its ability to quickly remove      Salvadorans caught after illegally crossing the Nation's      borders.       The 1988 court decision hinders DHS's ability to place      aliens subject to the injunction into expedited removal      proceedings--proceedings that allow for quicker immigration      processing. Instead, these aliens must be placed into full      administrative immigration proceedings. Consequently, they      are detained for an average of 48 days prior to removal in      contrast to those aliens apprehended on the Southwest border      for illegal entry and placed into expedited removal who are      detained for an average of only 19 days prior to removal. At      an average cost of $95 per day for detention, the inability      to fully utilize expedited removal for this population costs      the taxpayer approximately $2,755 per alien.       In addition, the injunction requires that unrepresented      aliens subject to the court decision be detained in the same      geographic area in which they are apprehended for seven days      prior to transfer in order to afford them the opportunity to      obtain counsel. DHS acquires detention space based on current      migration trends. If aliens shift migration routes to a      jurisdiction outside of the current area where extra bed      space is available, this injunction could have serious      repercussions on DHS's ability to detain such aliens due to      the restriction on transferring them to areas of higher      detention capacity. If the shift is sudden and large, the      injunction could place enormous strain on available detention      space, potentially forcing a return to the recently ended      practice of ``catch and release'' until additional resources      could be obtained, if available, in appropriate locations.       This decision was issued at a time when El Salvador was in      the midst of a civil war and when immigration was governed by      very different statutes. Yet, the decision continues to      dictate the processing of Salvadorans almost 20 years later.      On November 17, 2005, DHS fully explained to the district      court the dramatic changes in the facts and the law that have      occurred since the entry of its perpetual injunction in 1988.      DHS asked the district court to lift its order; but, I have      no firm date for when this process will reach its conclusion      in the district court or upon appeal.       There are additional longstanding civil injunctions that      impede DHS' s ability to effectively enforce the Nation's      immigration laws. These district court decisions have created      onerous operating procedures that require the commitment of      vast amounts of government resources. They detrimentally      impact immigration enforcement on a daily basis, often      frustrating DHS's efforts. One such order has resulted in the      creation of extra procedures requiring substantial additional      resources for routine visa processing. Another such      injunction has resulted in certain Freedom of Information Act      requests being given priority over other pressing work.       For all practical purposes, such invasive court-ordered      requirements hamstring the President and the Congress's      authority over the borders even when the conditions that gave      rise to such requirements may have changed. Under current law      and court procedures, it can be extremely time-consuming and      difficult to end these injunctions. With this legislation,      Congress will be taking significant steps to ensure that DHS      is no longer held hostage by these antiquated court orders.       Thank you again for your support of DHS's immigration      enforcement efforts. I look forward to continuing to work      with you on this and other measures to ensure that this issue      is fully resolved.       Sincerely,                                                 Michael Chertoff.  Mr. Speaker, I now yield 3 minutes to the gentleman from Texas (Mr. Hensarling).
