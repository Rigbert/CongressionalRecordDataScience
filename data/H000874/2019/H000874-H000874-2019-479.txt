The staff at the daily paper, based in Annapolis and covering news across Anne Arundel County and the surrounding area, were recognized last month by TIME as one of its `Person of the Year' honorees. They joined murdered Saudi journalist Jamal Khashoggi; Maria Ressa, a reporter in the Philippines working to expose corruption amid the country's drug war; and Burmese journalists Kyaw Soe Oo and Wa Lone, imprisoned for covering the plight of Rohingya refuges. TIME's award focused on the dangers facing journalists as they seek to fulfill their role as `guardians' of truth. At the Capital Gazette, that danger took the form of a deadly mass shooting on June 28, 2018, which killed five employees and injured several others.  On that tragic day, a gunman entered the Capital Gazette offices in Annapolis and took the lives of Gerald Fischman, Rob Hiaasen, John McNamara, Wendi Winters, and Rebecca Smith. It was a targeted attack by a mentally disturbed individual who should never have been able to acquire dangerous firearms. The attack came after months of vitriol leveled at the press, where reporters were called `enemy of the people' and lambasted as purveyors of `fake news.' To their credit, even after this deadly shooting took the lives of their friends and colleagues and after having to endure threats targeted at them and other journalists, the staff of the Capital Gazette continued their important work of reporting the news to the people of Maryland and released an edition of the paper the very next day. They would not be deterred from their mission, so critical to our open and deliberative democracy.  Madam Speaker, I hope all of the Members of this House will join me in congratulating the Capital Gazette and thanking its staff for the hard work they do every day--as well as all the members of the press who are risking danger to report the news. We must continue to stand up for the freedom of the press, which is critical to the liberty of our people and to all nations around the world.                          ____________________
