President, let me reemphasize to my friend from Indiana, as soon as this amendment is disposed of, we will return to the regular order, which is the pending Bayh amendment.  This amendment, which was crafted on a bipartisan basis in the Senate Banking Committee, provides $51.6 billion to address growing public transportation needs across the country.  It provides for record growth for public transportation and for the first time recognizes the growing needs in rural communities across the country, including my State and the State of the Presiding Officer, Oklahoma, which has a rural population of greater than 57 percent. In fact, in the final year of this bill, the rural transportation program is doubled over its TEA-21 levels.  Additionally, it creates a new formula within the urbanized area formula called the ``Rural Low Density'' formula. Rural transit is as challenging to provide as the distances between employment centers and health care centers are great.  This amendment also creates a formula to recognize ``growing States''--those locations which are forecast to grow more quickly than the average over the course of the next 15 years. This change will allow those States, which includes Oklahoma, to be proactive with regard to their transportation needs.  Finally, this amendment makes several modifications to enhance the role of the private sector in public transportation. By creating opportunities for competition, public transportation services can be provided more efficiently.  I am happy to have had the opportunity to work with Senator Shelby on the development of this amendment. I look forward to working with him on final passage and a successful conference report.  I ask unanimous consent that the amendment be agreed to, that the language be considered as original text as part of the substitute for the purpose of further amendment.
