Chairman, I rise in strong support of this Sanders amendment. It is eminently reasonable and aims to protect the jobs of American workers and strike a blow against the corporate welfare state.  This amendment is beautifully simple. It says no more Export-Import Bank help for corporations that lay off a greater percentage of workers in America than in other countries where they employ workers, including Mexico or China and other low-wage platforms. No more Export-Import Bank help for General Electric when it cans workers in Bloomington, Indiana, and exports all their jobs to Mexico.  Why cut workers' throats in our country with their own taxpayer dollars? Eighty percent of Ex-Im subsidies go to the biggest boys on the block, the Fortune 500 countries with global reach. And how do they return the favor to the American taxpayer? Well, General Motors gets more than $.5 billion from Ex-Im and then shrinks its U.S. workforce from 559,000 to 314,000 workers. That is almost a quarter million lost jobs in America. Motorola took $.5 billion from the taxpayers in the form of Export-Import Bank help and then slashed the American percentage of its workforce down to 56 percent.  Here is how I see it: if we cannot have the Ex-Im Bank for American workers, then at least we should stop cutting our own throats with this giveaway to the runaway multinational companies that export jobs and leave American workers, American families, and American communities holding the bag.  Say ``no'' to this abuse of taxpayer dollars and this betrayal of American communities. Stand up for the Sanders amendment. Vote ``yes'' on the Sanders amendment, which actually says, ``Do not hurt America first.'' If we have to take cuts, at least make those cuts equal globally to other countries. It does not say only serve America, it only says be fair to all concerned.  Support the Sanders amendment.
