I appreciate the work that has gone into this. He obviously has strong views on it. It has been very constructive in trying to work with me and others.  I ask my colleague about a procedural matter that could allow us to go forward and bring the parties together. Senator McCain and I introduced legislation several weeks ago that is virtually identical to what the House passed this week. The House has already begun to move.  My question to my colleague is, would the distinguished Senator from Wyoming be willing to work with me and others, the entire group involved, to craft a unanimous consent request that could come up early next week where we could take up in the Senate the House-passed bill and then have an open and fair debate on amendments and all of the up-or-down votes that Members of this body would choose to have?  Would my colleague be willing to work with me and others to see if we could craft that kind of approach that is agreeable all around?
