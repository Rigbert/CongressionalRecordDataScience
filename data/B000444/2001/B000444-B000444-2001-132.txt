 President, I missed this vote by a couple seconds. I was conducting a hearing on the Balkans. It was my fault. I am not suggesting that it is anybody's fault but mine. But if I had been here in time to vote, I want the Record to reflect that I would have voted for the Dodd amendment. I realize I cannot have my vote recorded, but I want to be recorded as being in favor of the Dodd amendment if I had been here in time. I apologize to my colleagues.
