Mr. Chair, she didn't like the way we did it, so she wanted to fix it. It had to do with the Under Secretary for Intelligence and the title. It is kind of irrelevant what it was, but we worked with her, and we got it solved.  We had it ready to go, and she pulled it today. She said she didn't want to do it.  As I understand it, the reason was that she didn't want to feel obligated to vote for the bill because we had cooperated and worked with her. Well, how obnoxious of us to do that.
