 Late last Friday afternoon President Bush made his most cynical and divisive appointment to date when he bypassed the Senate and unilaterally installed Charles Pickering to the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit. That appointment is without the consent of the Senate and is a particular affront to the many individuals and membership organizations representing African Americans in the Fifth Circuit who have strongly opposed this nomination.  With respect to his extreme judicial nominations, President George W. Bush is the most divisive President in American history. Through his extreme judicial nominations, President Bush is dividing the American people and undermining the fairness and independence of the federal judiciary on which all Americans depend.  After fair hearings and open debate, the Senate Judiciary Committee rejected the Pickering nomination in 2002. Originally nominated in 2001 by President Bush, this nominee's record underwent a thorough examination by the Senate Judiciary Committee and was found lacking. Rejected for this promotion by the Committee in 2002 because of his poor record as a judge and the ethical problems raised by his handling of his duties in specific instances, Judge Pickering's nomination was nonetheless sent back to the Senate last year by a President who is the first in our history to reject the judgment of the Judiciary Committee on a judicial nominee. This is the only President who has renominated someone rejected on a vote by the Judiciary Committee for a judicial appointment.  The renomination of Charles Pickering lay dormant for most of last year while Republicans reportedly planned further hearings. Judge Pickering himself said that several hearings on his nomination were scheduled and cancelled over the last year by Republicans. Then, without any additional information or hearings, Republicans decided to forego any pretense at proceeding in regular order. Instead, they placed the name of Judge Pickering on the committee's markup agenda and pushed his nomination through with their one-vote majority. The Committee had been told since last January that a new hearing would be heldbefore a vote on this nomination, but that turned out to be an empty promise.  Why was the Pickering nomination moved ahead of other well-qualified candidates late last fall? Why was the Senate required to expend valuable time rehashing arguments about a controversial nomination that has already been rejected? The timing was arranged by Republicans to coincide with the gubernatorial election in Mississippi. Like so much about this President's actions with respect to the Federal courts, partisan Republican politics seemed to be the governing consideration. Indeed, as the President's own former Secretary of the Treasury points out from personal experience, politics governs more than just Federal judicial nominations in the Bush administration.  Charles Pickering was a nominee rejected by the Judiciary Committee on the merits--a nominee who has a record that does not qualify him for this promotion, who injects his personal views into judicial opinions, and who has made highly questionable ethical judgments. The nominee's supporters, including some Republican Senators, have chosen to imply that Democrats opposed the nominee because of his religion or region. That is untrue and offensive. These smears have been as ugly as they are wrong. Yet the political calculation has been made to ignore the facts, to seek to pin unflattering characterizations on Democrats for partisan purposes and to count on cynicism and misinformation to rule the day. With elections coming up this fall, partisan Republicans are apparently returning to that page of their partisan political playbook.  Never before had a judicial nomination rejected by the Judiciary Committee after a vote been resubmitted to the Senate, but this President took that unprecedented step last year. Never before has a judicial nomination debated at such length by the Senate, and to which the Senate has withheld its consent, been the subject of a Presidential appointment to the Federal bench.  In an editorial following last week's appointment, The Washington Post had it right when it summarized Judge Pickering's record as a federal trial judge as ``undistinguished and downright disturbing.'' As the paper noted: ``The right path is to build consensus that nonpartisanship and excellence are the appropriate criteria for judicial selection.'' Instead we see another dangerous step down the Republican's chosen path to erode judicial independence for the sake of partisanship and their ideological court-packing efforts. I will ask unanimous consent that this editorial be printed in the Record. The New York Times also editorialized on this subject and it, too, was correct when it pointed out that this end-run around the advice and consent authority of the Senate is ``absolutely the wrong choice for one of the nation's most sensitive courts.'' I will ask unanimous consent that this editorial also be printed in the Record.  Civil rights supporters who so strenuously opposed this nominee were understandably offended that the President chose this action the day after his controversial visit to the grave of Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr. As the Nation was entering the weekend set aside to honor Dr. King and all for which he strived, this President made one of the most insensitive and divisive appointments of his administration. I will ask unanimous consent that the op-ed published in the Chicago Sun Times by the Reverend Jesse Jackson be printed in the Record. In this op-ed, Reverend Jackson observed that this President ``has shown a remarkable cynicism about playing racial politics.''  So many civil rights group and individuals committed to supporting civil rights in this country have spoken out in opposition to the elevation of Judge Pickering that their views should have been respected by the President. Contrary to the false assertion made by the Wall Street Journal editorial page this week, the NAACP of Mississippi did not support Judge Pickering's nomination. Indeed, every single branch of the Mississippi State Chapter of the NAACP voted to oppose this nomination--not just once, but three times. When Mr. Pickering was nominated to the District Court in 1990, the NAACP of Mississippi opposed him, and when he was nominated to the Fifth Circuit in 2001 and, again, in 2003, the NAACP of Mississippi opposed him. They have written letter after letter expressing their opposition. That opposition was shared by the NAACP, the Southern Christian Leadership Conference, the Magnolia Bar Association, the Mississippi Legislative Black Caucus, the Mississippi Black Caucus of Local Elected Officials, Representative Bennie G. Thompson and many others. Perhaps the Wall Street Journal confused the Mississippi NAACP with the Mississippi Association of Trial Lawyers, which is an organization that did support the Pickering nomination.  This is an administration that promised to unite the American people but that has chosen time and again to act with respect to judicial nominations in a way that divides us. This is an administration that squandered the goodwill and good faith that Democrats showed in the aftermath of September 11, 2001. This is an administration that refused to acknowledge the strides we made in filling 100 judicial vacancies under Democratic Senate leadership in 2001 and 2002 while overcoming anthrax attacks and in spite of Republican mistreatment of scores of qualified, moderate judicial nominees of President Clinton.  Then, just 2 days ago, the President sent the nomination of Claude Allen back to the Senate. From the time this nomination was originally made to the time it was returned to the President last year, the Maryland Senators have made their position crystal clear. This Fourth Circuit vacancy is a Maryland seat and ought to be filled by an experienced, qualified Marylander. Over the Senate recess, the White House had ample time to find such a nominee, someone of the caliber of sitting U.S. District Court Judges Andre Davis or Roger Titus, two former Maryland nominees whose involvement in the State's legal system and devotion to their local community was clear. This refusal to compromise is just another example of the White House engaging in partisan politics to the detriment of an independent judiciary.  The third disappointment we face is the ongoing fallout from the cyber theft of confidential memoranda from Democratic Senate staff. This invasion was perpetrated by Republican employees both on and off the Committee. As revealed by the Chairman, computer security was compromised and, simply put, members of the Republican staff took things that did not belong to them and passed them around and on to people outside of the Senate. This is no small mistake. It is a serious breach of trust, morals, and possibly the rules and regulations governing the Senate. We do not yet know the full extent of these violations. But we need to repair the loss of trust brought on by this breach of confidentiality and privacy, if we are ever to recover and be able to resume our work in a spirit of cooperation and mutual respect that is so necessary to make progress.  Democratic cooperation with the President's slate of judicial nominees has been remarkable in these circumstances. One way to measure that cooperation and the progress we have made possible is to examine the Chief Justice's annual report on the Federal judiciary. Over the last couple of years, Justice Rehnquist has been ``pleased to report'' our progress on filling judicial vacancies. This is in sharp contrast to the criticism he justifiably made of the shadowy and unprincipled Republican obstruction of consideration of President Clinton's nominees. In 1996, the final year of President Clinton's first term, the Republican-led Senate confirmed only 17 judicial nominees all year and not a single nominee to the circuit courts. At the end of 1996, the Republican Senate majority returned to the President almost twice as many nominations as were confirmed.  By contrast, with the overall cooperation of Senate Democrats, which partisan Republicans are loath to concede, this President has achieved record numbers of judicial confirmations. Despite the attacks of Sept. 11 and their aftermath, the Senate has already confirmed 169 of President Bush's nominees to the Federal bench. This is more judges than were confirmed during President Reagan's entire first 4-year term. Thus, President Bush's 3-year totals rival those achieved by other Presidents in 4 years. That is also true with respect to the nearly 4 years it took for President Clinton toachieve these results following the Republicans' taking majority control of the Senate in 1995.  The 69 judges confirmed last year exceeds the number of judges confirmed during any of the 6 years from 1995 to 2000 that Republicans controlled the Senate during the Clinton presidency years in which there were far more vacant Federal judgeships than exist today. Among those 69 judges confirmed in 2003 were 13 circuit court judges. That exceeds the number of circuit court judges confirmed during all of 1995, 1996, 1997, 1999, and 2000, when a Democrat was President.  The Senate has already confirmed 30 circuit court judges nominated by President Bush. This is a greater number than were confirmed at this point in the presidencies of his father, President Clinton, or the first term of President Reagan. Vacancies on the Federal judiciary have been reduced to the lowest point in two decades and are lower than Republicans allowed at any time during the Clinton presidency. In addition, there are more Federal judges serving on the bench today than at any time in American history.  I congratulate the Democratic Senators on the Committee for showing a spirit of cooperation and restraint in the face of a White House that so often has refused to consult, compromise or conciliate. I regret that our efforts have not been fairly acknowledged by partisan Republicans and that this administration continues down the path of confrontation. While there have been difficult and controversial nominees whom we have opposed as we exercise our constitutional duty of advice and consent to lifetime appointments on the Federal bench, we have done so openly and on the merits.  For the last 3 years I have urged the President to work with us. It is with deep sadness that I see that this administration still refuses to accept the Senate's shared responsibility under the Constitution and refuses to appreciate our level of cooperation and achievement.  I ask unanimous consent that the materials to which I referred be printed in the Record.  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in the Record, as follows:                       End Run for Mr. Pickering               [From the Washington Post, Jan. 18, 2004]       President Bush's decision Friday to install controversial      judicial nominee Charles W. Pickering Sr. on the U.S. Court      of Appeals for the 5th Circuit using a recess appointment is      yet another unwarranted escalation of the judicial nomination      wars. We have lamented some of the attacks on Mr. Pickering,      but his record as a federal trial judge is undistinguished      and downright disturbing, and Senate Democrats are reasonable      to oppose his nomination. Installing him using a      constitutional end run around the Senate only inflames      passions. The right path is to build consensus that      nonpartisanship and excellence are the appropriate criteria      for judicial selection.       The recess appointment--the president's power to      temporarily install federal officers without Senate      confirmation--is a uniquely bad instrument for federal      judges. Judges are supposed to be politically independent.      Yet Mr. Pickering will be a controversial nominee before the      Senate as he considers cases and will lose his job in a year      if he is not confirmed. Even his supporters should understand      that he will be subject to the political pressures from which      judges are supposed to be insulated.       We don't rule out the recess appointment in all      circumstances. At times judges have commanded such uniform      support that presidents have used the power to get them in      office quickly, leaving the formality of confirmation for      later. We supported, moreover, President Bill Clinton's lame-     duck recess appointment to the U.S. Court of Appeals for the      4th Circuit of Roger Gregory, who, like Mr. Pickering, was      held up in the Senate. But there was a big difference: Mr.      Gregory was not controversial. His nomination, in fact, was      eventually resubmitted to the Senate by none other than      President Bush. It was held up initially because of a long-     standing dispute over appointments to that court, not because      of any concerns about the nominee himself. There was reason      to hope that Mr. Gregory would be confirmed--as, indeed, he      was. In this case, Mr. Bush has used a recess appointment for      someone who cannot, on his merits, garner a vote of      confidence from the Senate and who has no prospect of      confirmation in the current Congress.       We don't support the filibuster of nominees, but the answer      to Democratic obstruction cannot be the appointment or      installation of temporary judges who get to hear a few cases      over a few months, all the while looking over their shoulders      at the senators who oppose them. The great damage the      judicial nomination wars threaten over the long term is to      erode judicial independence, to make judges constantly aware      of how they might have to answer to the Senate for a given      opinion. Using the recess appointment to place Mr. Pickering      on the 5th Circuit has made that danger into a realty.                                  ____                           A Judicial End Run                [From the New York Times, Jan. 17, 2004]       President Bush has used the only avenue remaining to him to      install Charles Pickering Sr. of Mississippi on the Fifth      Circuit Court of Appeals: a recess appointment, which avoids      the confirmation process. That recess appointments are a      perfectly legal device used by other presidents in the past      does not make this appointment any more palatable.      Mr. Pickering is absolutely the wrong choice for one of      the nation's most sensitive courts.       Mr. Bush claimed that only a ``handful'' of senators had      opposed Mr. Pickering. The opposition was in fact a good deal      broader than that.       Mr. Pickering was rejected in 2002 by the Judiciary      Committee when the Senate was still in Democratic hands. When      the same committee, in Republican control, approved him last      fall, the nomination was blocked by a filibuster. Another      attempt on the president's part to win Senate approval of Mr.      Pickering's nomination would almost certainly have produced      the same result.       The reasons are clear enough. Over the years, Mr. Pickering      has displayed skepticism toward cases involving civil rights      and expressed doubts about well-settled principles like one      person one vote. The Senate inquiry into the nomination      uncovered troubling questions of judicial ethics. Mr.      Pickering took up the case of a man convicted of burning a      cross on the lawn of an interracial couple, urging      prosecutors to drop a central charge and calling a prosecutor      directly. He also seems outside the mainstream on abortion      rights.       Mr. Pickering is not the only hard-right candidate Mr. Bush      has pushed for high judicial office. But his nomination was      among the most troublesome. As Senator Charles Schumer said,      Mr. Bush's decision to bypass the Senate in this manner is      ``a finger in the eye'' for all those seeking fairness in the      nomination process.                                  ____                    Bush Insults King's Legacy Again              [From the Chicago Sun Times, Jan. 20, 2004]                           (By Jesse Jackson)       Monday marked what would have been Dr. Martin Luther King's      75th birthday. And once more, President Bush chose the      occasion to issue a cold and calculated insult to African      Americans and Dr. King's memory.       Last year, the president chose Dr. King's birthday to      announce his decision to ask the Supreme Court to overturn      our civil rights laws by challenging the University of      Michigan's affirmative action program. Despite its      conservative majority, even this Supreme Court found that too      offensive to constitutional guarantees of equal rights, and      ruled against the president's case.       This year, the president took time from his big-donor fund-     raising to lay a wreath at Dr. King's grave and call for      racial reconciliation. Then after collecting $2.4 million      from wealthy beneficiaries of his tax cuts, he announced he      would make a recess appointment of Judge Charles Pickering.       Pickering shares views, history and friendship with      Mississippi Sen. Trent Lott, who was removed from leadership      of the Senate Republicans after he celebrated the      segregationist cause of the Dixiecrats. Pickering, with a      history of embracing racist causes, was rejected by the      Senate Judiciary Committee when Democrats held the majority.       Bush renominated him when Republicans took over, but      Pickering's views are so extreme that Democrats made him one      of only six judges they have blocked. Now the president      chooses Dr. King's holiday to announce his symbolic      appointment to the bench. From Willy Horton to Charles      Pickering, the Bush family has shown a remarkable cynicism      about playing racial politics.       But the true insult to Dr. King's memory is not Bush's      symbolic politics; it is the substance of his policies. Here      the contrast is stark.       Dr. King called on America to measure itself from the      bottom up, not the top down. As the Bible taught, we should      be judged on how we treat the ``least of these,'' not how we      cater to the most powerful.       Even many of Bush's supporters acknowledge he is the      reverse: His policies are designed to reward the wealthy and      serve the corporate interests that pay for his party. On his      watch, we've mortgaged the store to lavish tax breaks on the      wealthy, even as support for the poor has been cut, and      working people have been abandoned.       Dr. King devoted his life to fighting against poverty, for      peace; against racism, for equal opportunity. In the midst of      the Vietnam War, he courageously challenged America's      wrongheaded intervention, and warned of the moral poverty of      a country that spent more on its military than on its people.       Bush's priorities are literally the reverse. He has done      nothing as poverty has worsened, while finding his      ``mission'' in endless wars abroad. He'll spend over $200      billion toppling Saddam Hussein, while cutting back on      programs designed to give every child a healthy start.       Dr. King's politics came from his deep and abiding faith.      Bush's faith seems defined by his politics. King spoke in      pulpit after pulpit challenging the faithful to join the      movement for social change. Bush, at his best,     goes to churches to preach social service, urging the      congregation to accept the status quo and help minister to      its victims. Like Moses, King led his people out of      oppression. Like Pharaoh, Bush urges people to adjust to      their condition.       Dr. King's legacy is as important today as at his death      because things haven't gotten much better. A report by United      for a Fair Economy shows racial inequities in unemployment,      family income, imprisonment, average wealth and infant      mortality have gotten worse since he died. And progress in      areas like poverty, homeownership, education, and life      expectancy has been so slow it will take literally centuries      to close the gap.       As Americans celebrate Dr. King's birthday and listen to      President Bush's State of the Union address tonight, we must      remember King's warning of the moral peril of a nation that      fails to create opportunity for all of its people.       No longer do we hear of a War on Poverty, which as Dr. King      noted was ``barely a skirmish'' before abandoned for war      abroad. Instead, as Dedrick Muhammad, author of the UFE      report, observed: We are left with a ``compassionate      conservatism, which has been very conservative in its      compassion.''                                  ____             [From the Wall Street Journal, Jan. 19, 2004]                        The Pickering Precedent       President Bush's recess appointment of Charles Pickering      Sr. to the federal appeals bench last Friday is a welcome      move, not least because it shows he's willing to carry the      fight over judicial nominees from here to November. Mr.      Pickering will now get the honor of serving a year on the      Fifth Circuit Court of Appeals, and at 66 years old might      well make this his career coda. The Mississippi judge was one      of Mr. Bush's first nominees, in May 2001, and has always had      confirmation support from a bipartisan majority of Senators.      But he has been denied a floor vote by a minority filibuster      orchestrated by Northeastern liberals Ted Kennedy, Hillary      Rodham Clinton and her junior New York partner Chuck Schumer.       Mr. Bush has every right, even an obligation, to use his      recess power to counter this unprecedented abuse of the      Senate's advice and consent power. A filibuster has never      before in U.S. history been used to defeat an appellate court      nominee, but Democrats have used it against six of Mr. Bush's      choices. All of them have enough bipartisan support to be      confirmed if they could only get a full Senate vote.       One of the more despicable elements of the anti-Pickering      smear has been the use of the race card, even though the      judge has the support of the African-Americans who know him      best, including the Mississippi chapter of the NAACP. Mr.      Pickering sent his children to the newly integrated public      schools in that state in the 1960s, and he helped the FBI in      prosecutions of the KKK, testifying against the imperial      wizard in 1967 at some personal risk.       But these facts are irrelevant to liberals who are panicked      after their recent election defeats and are clinging to their      last lever of national power through the appointed judiciary.      They're hoping the public won't notice or care much about      this power play, which means that Mr. Bush and Republicans      will have to keep the issue front and center. Five Southern      Senate seats are open this year, and voters in those states      in particular deserve to know how much the bicoastal      Democratic liberals despise their values.                          ____________________
