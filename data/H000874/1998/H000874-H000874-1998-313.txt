Speaker, I rise today to pay tribute to the 300th Anniversary of Christ Church of Accokeek, Maryland, built by the Church of England, and one of six pre-Revolutionary War churches. It is believed this church congregation held their first prayer meetings sometime in 1698 in private homes with their first formal church structure being built a few years later.  Mr. Speaker, as I am sure you can imagine, Christ Church has weathered countless trials and tribulations through its 300 years of existence. Early settlers triumphed over the harshness of the 1700's, the separation from the Church of England, and the invasion of troops during the War of 1812. Christ Church's survival over the decades shows the uniqueness of the community of Accokeek.  In 300 years of existence there have been vast changes in liturgical theologies. In the early days the dictates of theology permitted no music, no stained glass or colored windows and only box type pews. Today, Christ Church radiates this same simplicity and symmetry with the addition of beautiful stained glass, music, conventional pews, and a bell tower. The ornate Holy Services offered now at Christ Church are a reflection of strong roots and faith of its members. A quality that has been strong enough to trickle down and bless the numerous generations of this Maryland community.  Christ Church makes a rich contribution to the history of Maryland and our great Nation. It sits as a symbol of the great sacrifices made by the early settlers to exercise their religious beliefs and through the years the clergy has worked tirelessly to minister to the people of the region during good times and bad.  Christ Church has seen years and years of families and neighbors coming together for convocations and picnics, weddings and funerals, for comfort and direction. In the words of an early Accokeek resident, Mr. Henry Williams (1862-1936) on speaking of the importance of this church to the community, ``I think it has quite a bright future before it--good roads, good schools, and a dear old church.''  Mr. Speaker and colleagues, please join with me in wishing this ``dear old church'', the Christ Church of Accokeek, congratulations on their 300th Year Anniversary.                          ____________________
