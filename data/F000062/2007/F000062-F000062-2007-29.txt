 President, I rise to introduce legislation to ban the use of phthalates in toys.  This legislation will ban the use of six types of phthalates in toys, which are linked to birth defects. Phthalates are plasticizing chemicals used in a variety of everyday products, including cosmetics, nail polish, paint, and shower curtains. Alarmingly, they are used in a variety of children's toys, such as rubber ducks, teething rings, and bath toys.  This legislation will ban the manufacture, sale or distributions of toys and childcare articles that contain more than .1 percent of DEHP, DBP, or BBP.  It will also ban the manufacture, sale, or distribution of toys and childcare articles for use by children 3 years old or younger that contain more than .1 percent of DINP, DIDP, or DnOP.  It clearly states that phthalates cannot be replaced with other dangerous chemicals identified by the Environmental Protection Agency as carcinogens, possible carcinogens, or chemicals that cause reproductive or developmental harm.  Phthalates are used in a variety of PVC, polyvinyl chloride, plastic products to make them soft and pliable. Phthalates are not chemically bonded to PVC molecules. When a child places a plastic toy with phthalates into his or her mouth, these phthalates leach out of the plastic product and into the child's system.  Phthalates are found in many common children's toys: rubber ducks, soft bath books, teethers, and even dolls. In 2006, the San Francisco Chronicle sent 16 common children's toys to a Chicago lab for testing to see if they exceeded the .1 percent limit proposed in this legislation. The results should alarm parents everywhere. One teether contained a phthalate at five times the proposed limit. A rubber duck sold at Walgreens had 13 times the proposed limit of DEHP, a carcinogenic phthalate. The face of a popular doll contained double the proposed phthalate limit.  While the science is still evolving, we know that exposure to phthalates can cause serious long-term health effects. Phthalates interfere with the natural functioning of the hormone system, and can cause reproductive abnormalities, many resulting from low levels of testosterone.  In 2005, Dr. Shanna Swan of the University of Rochester School of Medicine found that pregnant women with high levels of phthalates in their urine were more likely to give birth to boys with a birth defect that is a key indicator of low testosterone levels.  Men with high phthalate levels have lower sperm counts and damaged sperm DNA.  Phthalate exposure has also been linked to premature birth and the early onset of puberty. They may be a factor in some cancers.  Young children, whose bodies are still growing and developing, are particularly vulnerable when exposed to phthalates in the toys around them.  In the face of this troubling science, at least 14 other nations have acted to ban or restrict the use of phthalates in children's products. Examples include: the European Union's ban, upon which this legislation is modeled, has been in effect since 2006; the Argentina Ministry of Health imposed a ban in 1999; and Japan banned toys containing DEHP and DINP intended to be put in the mouth of children up to the age of 6.  My home State of California recently became the first state to ban phthalates in toys and other products intended for children. California parents will now know that the toys they give their children are not placing them at risk for serious health problems.  It is time for the rest of the country to follow the lead of California, the European Union, and other nations. Without action, the U.S. risks becoming a dumping ground for phthalate laden toys that cannot legally be sold elsewhere. American children deserve better.  Opponents of this ban will argue that we cannot safely replace phthalates, and that these replacements could place children at an even greater risk. The experience in the European Union certainly suggests otherwise.  Facing the phthalate ban, European manufacturers began to develop alternatives. Danisco, a Danish company, has introduced a phthalate alternative that has been approved for use in both the U.S. and the European Union.  Manufacturers have found ways to make safe, phthalate free toys for European Union children, and there is no reason that they should not do the same for American children.  There is much we do not know about the chemicals that surround us. Evidence is demonstrating that phthalates are posing a risk to children. I strongly believe that products not known to be safe should not be in the hands and mouths of children.  I urge my colleagues to support this legislation, and to provide all American children with the same safe toys available in Europe and California.  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be printed in the Record.  There being no objection, the text of the bill was ordered to be printed in the Record, as follows:                                S. 2275       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of      the United States of America in Congress assembled,     SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.       This Act may be cited as the ``Children's Chemical Risk      Reduction Act of 2007''.     SEC. 2. BAN ON CERTAIN PRODUCTS CONTAINING PHTHALATES.       (a) Findings.--Congress finds that--       (1) phthalates are a class of chemicals used in polyvinyl      chloride (PVC) plastic to improve flexibility and in      cosmetics to bind fragrance to the product and are used in      many products intended for use by young children, including,      teethers, toys, and soft plastic books; and       (2) there is extensive scientific literature reporting the      hormone-disrupting effects of phthalates and substantial      evidence of phthalates found in humans at levels associated      with adverse effects.       (b) Banned Hazardous Substance.--Effective January 1, 2009,      any children's product or child care article that contains a      phthalate shall be treated as a banned hazardous substance      under the Federal Hazardous Substances Act (15 U.S.C. 1261 et      seq.) and the prohibitions contained in section 4 of such Act      shall apply to such product or article.       (c) Prohibition on Use of Certain Alternatives to      Phthalates in Children's Products and Child Care Articles.--       (1) In general.--If a manufacturer modifies a children's      product or child care article that contains a phthalate to      comply with the ban under subsection (b), such manufacturer      shall--       (A) use an alternative to phthalates that is the least      toxic; and       (B) not use any of the prohibited alternatives to      phthalates described in paragraph (2).       (2) Prohibited alternatives to phthalates.--The prohibited      alternatives to phthalates described in this paragraph are      the following:       (A) Carcinogens rated by the Environmental Protection      Agency as Group A, Group B, or Group C carcinogens.       (B) Substances described in the List of Chemicals Evaluated      for Carcinogenic Potential of the Environmental Protection      Agency as follows:       (i) Known to be human carcinogens.       (ii) Likely to be human carcinogens.       (iii) Suggestive of being human carcinogens.       (C) Reproductive toxicants identified by the Environmental      Protection Agency that cause any of the following:       (i) Birth defects.       (ii) Reproductive harm.       (iii) Developmental harm.       (d) Definitions.--As used in this Act--       (1) the term ``children's product'' means a toy or any      other product designed or intended by the manufacturer for      use by a child;       (2) the term ``child care article'' means all products      designed or intended by the manufacturer to facilitate sleep,      relaxation, or the feeding of children, or to help children      with sucking or teething; and       (3) the term ``children's product or child care article      that contains a phthalate'' means--       (A) a children's product or a child care article any part      of which contains any combination of di-(2-ethylhexyl)      phthalate (DEHP), dibutyl phthalate (DBP), or benzyl butyl      phthalate (BBP) in concentrations exceeding 0.1 percent; and       (B) a children's product or a child care article intended      for use by a child less than 3 years of age that--       (i) can be placed in a child's mouth; and       (ii)(I) contains any combination of diisononyl phthalate      (DINP), diisodecyl phthalate (DIDP), or di-n-octyl phthalate      (DnOP), in concentrations exceeding 0.1 percent; or       (II) contains any combination of di-(2-ethylhexyl)      phthalate (DEHP), dibutyl phthalate (DBP), benzyl butyl      phthalate (BBP), diisononyl phthalate (DINP), diisodecyl      phthalate (DIDP), or di-n-octyl phthalate (DnOP), in      concentrations exceeding 0.1 percent.                                 ______                                       By
