Speaker, today the House approved H.R. 2440, the Full Utilization of the Harbor Maintenance Trust Fund Act of 2019. Nearly every segment of our Nation's infrastructure is in disrepair due to chronic underfunding, including our Nation's water infrastructure, a true lifeblood of our economy.  This year, as he did last year, President Trump proposed drastic cuts to the Army Corps of Engineers' budget. Unbelievable. But our Appropriations Committee rejected his proposals and those cuts. Today I stand with my colleagues on the Transportation and Infrastructure Committee to call for greater investment in our water infrastructure.  For our part, the House passed the FY20 Energy and Water Appropriations bill that included $1.6 billion from the harbor maintenance trust fund, an increase of $147 million above fiscal year 2019 and $732 million above President Trump's paltry and unrealistic budget request.  Big, medium, and small ports across our country are efficient economic engines that anchor jobs and progress. They are hubs of production for communities everywhere. And, yes, they rely on leadership from this Congress to fund their maintenance.  I congratulate Representative DeFazio for his hard work in writing H.R. 2440 and hope we continue the momentum to utilize the Harbor Maintenance Trust Fund Act.  Mr. Speaker, I include in the Record a letter from the Port of Cleveland.                                            Port of Cleveland,                                                 October 28, 2019.     Hon. Marcy Kaptur,     Congresswoman, 9th District of Ohio,     Washington, DC.       Dear Congresswoman Kaptur: The Port of Cleveland is pleased      to know that an important bill will be considered on the      House floor on Monday, October 28. The bill, H.R. 2440, the      Full Utilization of the Harbor Maintenance Trust Fund, has      bipartisan support on the Transportation and Infrastructure      Committee and I urge your support for the measure.       As you know, the Port of Cleveland and others in our state      depend on the Corps of Engineers' civil works program. Our      port relies on the maintenance dredging work each and every      year. Around $8 million is needed every year to keep the      Cuyahoga River Federal shipping channel, the port's      breakwater and related infrastructure in a condition that      enables the safe navigation of ships and mariners. Major      American industry and U.S. exports rely on maintenance      dredging that occurs twice each year.       Since 1986, when Congress created the Harbor Maintenance      Tax (HMT) and Harbor Maintenance Trust Fund (HMTF), most      cargo in American ports is charged an ad valorem tax for the      purpose of covering Federal channel maintenance-related costs      in U.S. seaports. In the first years, the tax revenue was      fully spent on Federal channel maintenance but soon revenues      increased and a surplus was allowed to accumulate in the      trust fund, even as many shipping channels in the country      were not fully maintained to their design depths and widths.      Overtime, the Harbor Maintenance Trust Fund balance has been      allowed to grow to over $9 billion while Congress has      continued to under-spend on the infrastructure that is our      national navigation system.       In more recent years, the House and Senate became more      alert to the inadequately maintained American ports and the      existence of the HMT and HMTF. Targets for maintenance      spending were approved in WRDA 2014 and appropriations have      increased. We ports have appreciated that improvement, but      the fact is that the unused HMT revenue continues to      accumulate while maintenance dredging in many parts of the      country, including on the Great Lakes, is insufficient. The      graph below, prepared in 2016, provides a snapshot of      spending versus tax revenue. (In the years since, the trend      is much the same with a projected HMTF balance (per FY 2020      budget) of as much as $10.4 billion.                                                      20 YEARS OF THE HARBOR MAINTENANCE TRUST FUND                                                                  [Dollars in millions]--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------                                                                  1998     1999     2000     2001     2002     2003     2004     2005     2006     2007                        HMTF Cash Flow:                          Actual   Actual   Actual   Actual   Actual   Actual   Actual   Actual   Actual   Actual--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------BOY Balance...................................................    1,106    1,246    1,556    1,621    1,777    1,850    2,001    2,299    2,695    3,234Receipts & Interest...........................................      651      607      767      816      730      737      946    1,102    1,337    1,427Outlays.......................................................     -511     -297     -702     -660     -657     -586     -648     -706     -798     -910                                                               -----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------EOY Balance...................................................    1,246    1,556    1,621    1,777    1,850    2,001    2,299    2,695    3,234    3,751----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------                                                  2008     2009     2010     2011     2012     2013                                              2017                HMTF Cash Flow:                  Actual   Actual   Actual   Actual   Actual   Actual  2014 Actual  2015 Actual   2016 Est.

That the unspent balance has been allowed to accumulate and      sit in the Federal Treasury as ballast against budget      deficits is especially disturbing at a time when Congress and      the White House have rightly talked about the importance of      tending to the county's essential infrastructure. In the case      of port channels, the money exists. That is an important      consideration. No new revenue stream is required.       As a final note, and for clarity sake, this issue is      unrelated to the funding of the inland waterway system. There      vessels, including as tug and towboats, are charged an excise      tax on fuel expenses. That revenue is accounted for in the      Inland Waterways Trust Fund and is spent on construction work      such as lock and dam improvements. It is noteworthy that      unlike the case with the Harbor Maintenance Trust Fund, the      Inland Waterways Trust Fund resources are fully spent on that      system's navigation projects.       Please vote for the Full Utilization of the Harbor      Maintenance Trust Fund legislation.           Sincerely,                                              William D. Friedman,     President & Chief Executive Officer.                          ____________________
