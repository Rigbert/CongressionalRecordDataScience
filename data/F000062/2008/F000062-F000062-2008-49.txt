 Kerry, Mr. Reid, Mr. Obama,         Mr. Schumer, Mr. Leahy, Mrs. Clinton, Mrs. Murray, and Mr.         Wyden):  S. 3308. A bill to require the Secretary of Veterans Affairs to permit facilities of the Department of Veterans Affairs to be designated as voter registration agencies, and for other purposes; to the Committee on Rules and Administration.  Mr. President, I am pleased to be an original cosponsor of the Veteran Voting Support Act, which Senator Feinstein and Senator Kerry have introduced today.  This bill will address an issue of great concern to me and to so many Americans: the rights of Americans who fight to defend our values and freedoms abroad must have the full enjoyment of those rights here at home. This legislation responds to an announcement by the Bush administration's Department of Veterans Affairs that it will ban non-partisan organizations and state election officials from conducting voter registration drives at its facilities.  It is a sad commentary that in our great Nation, so many of our young veterans who have been treated shamefully by their government when it sent them into harm's way under false pretenses are again mistreated after they return home. Our troops were sent to fight an unnecessary war in Iraq--without sufficient armor, without adequate reinforcements, without a plan to win the peace, and without adequate medical care and other services to help them adapt to life upon their return.  Given this President's obsession with democracy taking root in the Middle East, I would think that at a minimum he would be equally concerned with guaranteeing the right to vote to veterans returning home after risking life and limb spreading that right to others. Yet, his administration has done just the opposite. Under this President's watch, the Department of Veteran Affairs has erected barriers to voter registration that impede veterans being treated in VA facilities from participating in the political process.  First, this administration's Department of Veteran Affairs has shown little interest in, or commitment to, assisting veterans in exercising the fundamental right to vote. Since 2004, the Department has often sided in Federal court against allowing third-party organizations to conduct voter registration drives at VA hospitals. Until this past April, the Department's national policy was silent on whether it could assist disabled veterans access and complete voter registration forms. Indeed, court findings appear to indicate that in some instances, the Department may have even prohibited its own staff from providing such assistance.  Second, although the Department has made recent strides to allow veterans more access to voter registration forms, it has not gone far enough. Three months ago, the Department issued a written directive' requiring all VA facilities to develop voter registration plans that would assist patients in registering to vote. I applaud this action as a positive first step. However, I am concerned that the new directive stops short of mandating that VA facilities affirmatively offer disabled veterans a chance to register to vote. To paraphrase Paul Sullivan, the Executive Director of Veterans for Commonsense, the new directive only changed the Department from being in active opposition to veterans' voter registration to passively supporting it.  Third, and perhaps most troubling, the new directive prohibits third-party organizations and state election officials from conducting nonpartisan voter registration drives among veterans at VA facilities. I am concerned that this ban will not only undermine the Department's goal of assisting disabled veterans in registering and voting, but will also make it more difficult for these Americans to participate in the political process.  The Veterans Voting Support Act would address these concerns. This important measure would designate VA facilities as voter registration agencies, thereby ensuring that the Department actively offers veterans the assistance they need to vote and register to vote. This provision would also protect disabled veterans from being disenfranchised by a procedural technicality. In addition, the bill provides our veterans with information relating to the opportunity to request an absentee ballot, ensure the ballots are available upon request, as well as provide assistance in completing them.  It would also require a meaningful opportunity for nonpartisan groups and election officials to provide voter registration information and assistance at VA hospitals. The Department was founded on the principle that its first duty to veterans was to meet their medical, social, and civic needs, including the full participation of veterans in our society. As a corollary, this provision will strengthen that mandate and send an important message to our veterans: our country will make every effort to ensure that those who sacrificed so much to expand democracy around the globe are involved in our democracy at home.  Finally, to ensure that the Department does not backslide from its critical function of expanding the civic involvement of disabled veterans, the bill also provides reporting requirements to ensure that the Department complies with this important goal.  The Nation's disabled veterans have given extraordinary service to our country. These courageous men and women deserve our help to ensure that they receive the necessary assistance to guarantee their full participation in our democracy. I look forward to Senate passage of the Veterans Voting Support Act, and I hope the House and the President will act quickly on this legislation to ensure the implementation of this important measure in time for the upcoming national election.                          ____________________
