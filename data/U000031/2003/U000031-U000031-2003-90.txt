Speaker, premature birth is a serious and growing problem. Each day 1,305 babies are born too soon, and the rate of preterm birth increased 27 percent between 1981 and 2001. In 2001, 476,000 babies were born prematurely in the United States. Tragically, premature infants are 14 times more likely to die in their first year of life, and preterm births account for 23 percent of deaths in the first month of life. Further, premature babies who survive may suffer lifelong consequences, including cerebral palsy, mental retardation, chronic lung disease, and vision and hearing loss. Preterm delivery can happen to any pregnant woman, and in nearly one-half of the cases, no one knows why.  That is why today I am introducing, with my colleagues Anna Eshoo, Jim Ramstad, Sherrod Brown, Spencer Bachus, Ed Towns, and Jesse Jackson, Jr., the bipartisan Prematurity Research Expansion and Education for Mothers who deliver Infants Early Act, or ``PREEMIE Act.'' The goal of the PREEMIE Act is designed to reduce the rates of preterm labor and delivery, promote the use of evidence-based care for pregnant women at risk of preterm labor and for infants born preterm, and reduce infant mortality and disabilities caused by prematurity. This will be accomplished by expanding federal research related to preterm labor and delivery and increasing public and provider education and support services. Expanding these federal initiatives is supported by the March of Dimes, the American Academy of Pediatrics, the American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists, and the Association of Women's Health, Obstetric and Neonatal Nurses.  We hope that you and many more of our House colleagues will join us in the fight to ensure a healthy start for all of America's children by cosponsoring and working with us for the enactment of the PREEMIE Act.                          ____________________
