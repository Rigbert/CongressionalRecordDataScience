Chairman, when they point out that if we do not put ground troops this effort at trying to stabilize a critically important situation will not succeed and the Europeans will not participate, we can all say they should but we saw in Bosnia that they would not.  My colleagues, I ask that the amendment of the gentlewoman from Florida (Mrs. Fowler) be rejected, which I know is well intended and she believes strongly that it is the right policy, but it is a policy that will inevitably lead to failure of the effort to bring peace to the Balkans. It is an amendment which I think detracts from the Gejdenson amendment which tries, as I said at the beginning, to limit and make proportional our participation.  I would ask my colleagues to reject the Fowler amendment, to pass the Gejdenson amendment and then to pass this resolution so that America continues to lead and continues to be the moral leader as well as the military leader of this world.
