As he was making those comments, I thought to myself, that is right up Senator Mikulski's alley, and I looked over my shoulder and there in the well of the Senate she is. Senator Mikulski addressed this issue of providing opportunities to cross the digital divide so everybody has this right to access. I invite the Senator to join us at this point. We were talking about the H-1B bill that addresses an immediate need but doesn't address the needs of the skill shortage which she raised at our caucus luncheon, or the digital divide. I would like to invite a question or comment from the Senator from Maryland on those subjects.
