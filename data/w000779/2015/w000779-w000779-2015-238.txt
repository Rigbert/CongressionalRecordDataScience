President, more than 5 years after being signed into law, the Affordable Care Act is improving the health and well-being of millions of Americans. Many of the Affordable Care Act's greatest successes are getting lost in the noise of political attack ads. The Affordable Care Act has expanded health care coverage to millions of Americans. These people no longer have to go to bed at night worried about the possibility of bankruptcy if they get sick.  Americans who had coverage already are benefiting from new protections.Women now pay the same premiums as men. Preexisting conditions can no longer be used as an excuse to deny coverage, and health plans no longer put lifetime caps on benefits. This amendment would require insurers to disclose all of the benefits afforded to consumers through the Affordable Care Act.  I strongly urge my colleagues to support this amendment.
