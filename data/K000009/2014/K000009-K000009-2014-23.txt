Speaker, today, NATO's Commander Breedlove said in Bulgaria, ``We have seen columns of Russian equipment, primarily Russian tanks, Russian artillery, Russian air defense systems, and Russian combat troops entering into Ukraine.'' In response, Ukraine has redeployed troops to the east to counter the insurgency. But these soldiers are severely undersupplied.  Ukraine had an election just a couple of weeks ago, the most transparent, the most free, and the most pro-Western election in history. But pro-Russian parliamentarians received less than 10 percent of the vote.  Today, once again, Ukraine faces war, as the ceasefire there collapsed as Russia attempts to reassert its influence by sinister and illegal means.  Ukraine's young soldiers don't have proper boots or weapons or defensive equipment. How many times must Ukraine be invaded before we call it an invasion?  I call upon the House to pass H.R. 5190, the bill I introduced with my fellow Ukrainian Caucus cochair, Jim Gerlach of Pennsylvania, to provide meaningful humanitarian aid and security assistance to Ukraine. The Senate has passed S. 2828 that does much the same.  Let us stop the advance of this tyranny in the new century. Liberty is calling. Let us measure up in this lameduck session.                          ____________________
