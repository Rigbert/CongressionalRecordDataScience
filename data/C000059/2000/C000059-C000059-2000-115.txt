Chairman, I rise today in proud support of a responsible Fiscal Year 2001 Budget Resolution put forth by this Republican Congress. This budget provides the blueprint to do great things this year, including: Balancing the budget for the second consecutive year, eliminating the public debt by 2013, safeguarding Social Security, increasing defense spending, setting aside $40 billion for Medicare reform and prescription drug coverage, increasing elementary and secondary education funding by more than 9 percent and much more.  The Clinton-Gore administration's budget, submitted to Congress on February 7 this year, increases discretionary spending by over $39 billion. That is an increase of more than twice the rate of inflation--evidence that the Clinton-Gore-Gephardt alliance continues to support a ``government on autopilot'' approach.  Mr. Chairman, that is simply irresponsible. There is plenty of fat that can still be trimmed off Uncle Sam. Just because we have increasing surpluses does not mean all Government spending is responsible or justified. We need to continue to address the billions of dollars lost on waste, fraud, and abuse. We need to eliminate those programs that don't work and are a burden to the American taxpayers. This budget resolution will do that by restraining federal spending, setting aside funds for paying down the debt and saving Social Security.  This budget resolution will allow Americans to keep more of their hard earned dollars and allow us to keep our promises to the nation's youth, small businesses, parents and seniors.  In closing Mr. Chairman, I strongly encourage my colleagues on both sides of the aisle to support the Fiscal Year 2001 Budget Resolution.
