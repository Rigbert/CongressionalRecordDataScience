Speaker, I am pleased to stand before you and my colleagues today to applaud Mr. Dale Johnsen upon his retirement. Dale has devoted his life to the interests of his fellow tradesmen and women, and to the entire community of Northwest Indiana. Mr. Johnsen has been a member of Bricklayers Local #4 Indiana/Kentucky for 36 years, 22 of which he served as an officer and field representative. Additionally, he has served as President of the Indiana State Building and Construction Trades Council for the past two years. For his lifetime of service to the Bricklayers and the Northwestern Indiana Building and Construction Trades Council, as well as the Indiana State Building Trades Council, Mr. Johnsen will be honored at a retirement dinner taking place at Avalon Manor in Merrillville, Indiana on August 17, 2012.   During his 36 years with Bricklayers Local #4 Indiana/Kentucky, Dale Johnsen has assisted those who want to work for a living wage in countless ways. For example, he has represented the union as a Trustee for the Pension Fund and the Health and Welfare Fund, as well as the Joint Apprenticeship and Training Committee. A leader in the truest sense of the word, Dale has also served as President of the Northwestern Indiana Building and Construction Trades Council. Also, he is currently a member of the Business Construction Resource Center and the Tripartite Committees for ArcelorMittal Indiana Harbor and Burns Harbor. In addition, Dale served as Admiral for the Pirates Charity Organization and now serves on the organization's Captain's Table. Mr. Johnsen's enthusiasm, dedication, and constant support to the Building Trades and charities within our greater community is truly outstanding, and for this, he is worthy of the utmost praise.   Northwest Indiana's building trades have a strong history of excellence in its craftsmanship and loyalty by its members, as well as a steadfast commitment to serving the community. Dale Johnsen has always exhibited these qualities, and I have a profound respect and admiration for his absolute dedication to helping others, both locally and statewide. When it comes to serving those in need, the Indiana State Building and Construction Trades Council and the Northwestern Indiana Building and Construction Trades Councils have long been one of the state's most generous organizations. Dale Johnsen has been at the forefront of these efforts.   From a personal perspective, I am proud and lucky to have Dale Johnsen as a friend. A friend who has been completely loyal, a friend who has been selfless, a friend who has always ``been there.''   Mr. Speaker, in conclusion, Dale Johnsen has generously dedicated his life and all his efforts to those he has worked with and represented so well. His passion and commitment to the Building Trades and to the community of Northwest Indiana is to be admired. I respectfully request that you and my other dignified colleagues join me in commending Dale for his many years of service and in wishing him well upon his retirement.                          ____________________
