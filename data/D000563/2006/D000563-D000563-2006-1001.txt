President, I would like to ask the Senator a question because perhaps he has thought this through and he could help me understand it. I support the President's effort to make the border stronger and safer. What I understood him to say was at least 6,000 National Guardsmen at any one time, rotated every 2 or 3 weeks to accommodate what was their normal training schedule. By my calculation, that means that in the first year over 100,000 National Guardsmen from around the United States will be sent to the border. And in the second year, when half as many are needed, another, say, 50,000. So out of the 400,000 National Guardsmen nationwide--I hope my figure is correct, although I don't know if it is--but is it your understanding that 100,000 to 150,000 will end up on border duty during that period?
