Speaker, on May 9, I came to the Floor and spoke about the March For Our Lives on March 24 and the nine extraordinarily poised students in Morristown, New Jersey, who spoke at the rally there, which I attended. I include in the Record remarks by Isabella Bosrock. I hope my colleagues will read them and internalize the sense of fear in which our nation's students are living every day--and our responsibility as Members of Congress to do something to address this crisis of gun violence.                      March for our Lives Remarks                         (By Isabella Bosrock)       My name is Isabella Bosrock, and I am a senior at West      Morris Mendham High School. Today you will be hearing from      seven incredible high school students from across the      district who are here today to say `enough is enough' and      `never again' to senseless gun violence. Before we begin, I      would like to take a moment and thank Mr. Steny Hoyer, a U.S.      Representative for Maryland's Fifth Congressional District      and the Minority Whip of the House for being here today.       On March 20, a mere four days ago, a seventeen year old boy      named Austin Wyatt Rollins walked into Great Mills High      School with his dad's hand gun and shot two students, one of      which was an ex-girlfriend. Reports say he did this because      of a recent break up with the girl he shot. The student      resource officer on duty, Blaine Gaskill managed with great      bravely to shoot and kill the gunman, avoiding the loss of      many more lives.       While this event is incredibly upsetting it is not unlike      many things that have happened in the country is the years      since Columbine. It is horrible that as adolescents we have      become used to the idea that gun violence is a method of      dealing with our problems. This pattern of gun violence has      been perpetuated by adult lawmakers who refuse to do anything      about the bloodshed in their schools.       I bring this up today because Mr. Hoyer is the      representative of the district where Great Mills High School      is located, yet he is still here at our march today. Let's      all thank him for being here today. I also bring this up      because I think that it is so important that we make sure we      acknowledge every instance of senseless gun violence that      occurs within this country. While Parkland was able to get      mass media attention, hashtags on social media and `thoughts      and prayers' from everyone around the world, there are so      many acts of violence that occur in the U.S. every single day      that go completely unnoticed.       Often times we give them attention for a couple of days,      maybe a week, then we forget, and other times we fail to      acknowledge them at all. In fact there have been eighteen      instances of a gun firing at schools in the U.S. since the      beginning of 2018, which averages out to about three per      week.       This cannot be our reality. However many people do not know      this because they never gain the same attention as events      like Parkland. These other shootings often resulted in no      bloodshed or a few injured. But this doesn't mean that they      are any less catastrophic because every single life of those      students will be forever changed. Each and every day they      walk into the school that almost cost them their lives, and      they are forced to face their worst fears. The lives of the      students in the eighteen schools will never ever be the same.      It is so easy for us to watch these catastrophic events      unravel on the news for a week, donate money to the cause,      post a hashtag on social media, then move on with our lives.      But it is so important in our crazy, ever changing lives to      never forget.       We have to make sure that we not only remember to hold the      lives of those lost in our hearts, but to make sure that we      are holding the people who are accountable, responsible for      the lives of innocent people murdered.       It is up to us to change the future, but these changes will      only come by reflecting on the past and acknowledging what      happened. Forgetting will not do anything but make us      complacent and allow more of these massacres to happen.       That being said, I encourage every single one of you today      to go out and read about the other school shootings that you      may have missed and hold those victims in your memory so that      we can use those losses to fuel the fire of change.                          ____________________
