 Mr. President, the Senator said something about how long we have been talking about the balanced budget amendment, and tomorrow I plan to go back and revisit an experience I had with Senator Carl Curtis, a former Senator, conservative Senator who was the father of the balanced budget concept way back in 1972.  At that time, when his idea was to get three-fourths of the States to ratify, force Congress to do this instead of talking about it, he brought up at that time that every time it has been brought up it has been killed by someone who wanted to have an exception to it written into the Constitution, knowing full well that it will not work.  Does the Senator think that after 22 years, people out there are now going to be in a position to demand that we quit talking about it and do it?
