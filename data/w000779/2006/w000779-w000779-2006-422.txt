President, on this difficult evening, I wish to take just a few minutes to talk about the budget.  Last Congress, Senator Snowe and I, on a bipartisan basis, saw 51 Members of the Senate support our bipartisan legislation to lift the restriction on Medicare so that program could bargain to hold down the cost of medicine. That vote, where a majority of Senators went on record in supporting the effort to hold down the cost of medicine, took place before the program went into effect. It seems to me everything that has happened over the last few months, since a majority of the Senate voted for our bipartisan amendment, supports our case for passing that legislation now.  We will be offering our bipartisan proposal, the Snowe-Wyden amendment, later this week, and I wish to take just a few minutes to outline why it is so important.  The American Association of Retired Persons says it all in a letter endorsing our bipartisan Snowe-Wyden proposal. I ask unanimous consent that the AARP letter endorsing the Snowe-Wyden legislation be printed in the Record.  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in the Record, as follows:                                                         AARP,                                                   March 13, 2006.     Hon. Ron Wyden,     U.S. Senate,     Washington, DC.       Dear Senator Wyden: AARP supports your amendment to the      Senate fiscal year 2007 budget bill to provide for the      ability of the Secretary of Health and Human Services to      participate in negotiations with pharmaceutical manufacturers      under the Medicare prescription drug program.       Prescription drug prices continue to rise much faster than      the rate of inflation. AARP's latest Rx Watchdog report      released in February 2006 found that prices for nearly 200 of      the brand name medications most commonly used by older      Americans rose 6.0 percent during the 12 month period from      October 2004-September 2005. At the same time, the rate of      general inflation was 3.3 percent. These drug price increases      particularly hit older Americans, who use prescription drugs      more than any other segment of the U.S. population.       Millions of older and disabled Americans now have the      opportunity to choose prescription drug coverage as part of      their 2006 Medicare benefit options. To date, millions of      Medicare beneficiaries have enrolled in the program and as a      result are realizing savings on their prescription drugs.      However, improvements to the Medicare Modernization Act are      necessary to strengthen the benefit and the Medicare program.      We believe the first step is to keep the drug benefit      affordable for beneficiaries as well as taxpayers.       While we have seen that the current competitive structure      existing in the MMA has helped to bring prescription drug      prices down, we believe that giving the Secretary the      authority to participate in negotiations may also help to      make prescription drugs more affordable for Medicare      beneficiaries.       We look forward to working with you and your colleagues on      both sides of the aisle to ensure that the new Medicare Part      D benefit remains affordable over time. If you have any      further questions, please feel free to contact me, or have      your staff contact Anna Schwamlein of our Federal Affairs      staff at 202-434-3770.           Sincerely,                                              David P. Sloane,                                            Sr. Managing Director,                                Government Relations and Advocacy.
