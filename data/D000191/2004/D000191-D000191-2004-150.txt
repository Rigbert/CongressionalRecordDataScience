Chairman, we are in incredible denial on the other side of the aisle. Once again, it is not needed, not now, not this way.  Nationwide, 375,000 people will exhaust their unemployment benefits this month. In Oregon, by March, 43,000 will have lost all their benefits. We hear the unemployment rate is dropping. Yeah, the statistic is dropping. We are not creating jobs. People no longer qualify for benefits. Well, they do not count as unemployed anymore.  We heard this extraordinary statement that some have become entrepreneurs, some are the modern day equivalent of selling apples and pencils on the street corner. Yeah, the entrepreneurs in my district are picking up bottles and cans for the five cent deposits, and it is really ironic.  Unlike the tax cuts for the billionaires where we have to borrow money from average working people and the Social Security trust fund to give tax breaks to billionaires, we do not have to borrow money to extend unemployment benefits. Working people have already paid the tax. There is $17 billion in the unemployment trust fund. All we need is for the majority to allow us a vote to authorize spending that money that is on account to help these people in their time of desperation and the President to sign the bill.  Vote ``yes.''
