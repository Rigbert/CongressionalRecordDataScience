 Right now, under current law, when I go into chapter 7 filing for bankruptcy, I am bound by the requirements of the Bankruptcy Code under section 521 to file a list of my creditors, unless the court orders otherwise, a schedule of assets, liability, current income, current expenditures, and statement of debtor's financial affairs and more when it comes to consumer debt currently. That is what happens when one goes into bankruptcy court--and that is this sheath of paper--they have to fill these things out. These are the documents that get one into court.
