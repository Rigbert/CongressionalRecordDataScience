Speaker, I thank the gentleman. The gentleman has just said we want to have individuals have the right to offer amendments. Mr. Sean Patrick Maloney of New York wants to offer this amendment.                              {time}  1400  This House voted for his amendment, as the gentleman recalls. A majority of this House supports the Maloney amendment, unless they have theirvotes changed. They had their votes changed. We came back the following week, and the majority of this House voted for the Maloney amendment. Unfortunately, the bill went down. I say ``unfortunately'' because the Maloney amendment didn't go forward. There were a lot of good things in that bill. A majority of your Members voted against it. Had a majority of your Members voted for it, it would have passed, notwithstanding what we did, because you are in the majority and you have the numbers.  So I would simply urge not to talk about we have had 15 amendments or 500 amendments. We would feel it very important that this Congress go on record telling our fellow Americans that we don't believe in discrimination against LGBT citizens, period. If the majority of the House would vote that way, I think the majority of the Senate would vote that way. If the Maloney amendment is made in order, it will have, in my view, the support of the majority of this House. In that regard, therefore, it is certainly not specious, and I would hope that it would be made in order.  Lastly, Mr. Speaker, we have seen a 16-hour filibuster on the floor of the United States Senate. That filibuster was about bringing to the floor of the House of Representatives legislation which is supported by over 75 percent of Americans.  First of all, if you can't fly, you ought not to be able to buy a gun. If you are so dangerous that you can't get on a plane, you ought not to be allowed to buy a gun that could kill a lot of people very quickly, as we saw just the other day.  And secondly, the overwhelming majority of Americans support enhanced background checks overwhelmingly. Those two issues.  I am led to believe, though I haven't done the poll directly, that a majority of those who are members of the NRA--not the association itself, the National Rifle Association, but the majority of the members--when asked, support those two propositions.  I would hope that they would be brought to the floor so that the House could work its will, again, on the premise, as you have stated and others have stated in your party, that under the leadership of the Republican Party the House is going to be able to work its will on important issues. That, we believe, is a critically important issue. I would hope the gentleman could assure me that that will be brought to the floor not necessarily next week, but in the very, very near future.  I yield to my friend if he wants to respond.  Mr. McCARTHY. Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentleman for yielding.  As the gentleman knows--and I thank you for buying the book; I thought only my mother did--an open process also means going through committee. I can't will something just to come to the floor. We like things to go through committees.  I know at times like this we want to make sure that fear does not get the better of our judgment. It is absolutely appropriate for us to discuss options that could hopefully prevent the next attack.  I am proud of the fact that the last bill we just passed dealt with the radicalization of Americans. But we cannot lose sight of our basic rights protected in the Constitution, including the right to due process.  In the weeks and months to come, I would expect that the House will take additional action in response to the threat posed by ISIL and others. I look forward to working with the gentleman in a constructive way to ensure the safety and security of all Americans.
