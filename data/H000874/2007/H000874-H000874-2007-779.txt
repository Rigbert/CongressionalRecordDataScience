 Under the rules of the House, the Office of the General Counsel should provide legal advice and assistance to all Members of Congress, committees, officers, and employees without regard to political affiliation. Since her 1997 appointment by Speaker Newt Gingrich to lead that office, Ms. Gennet has dutifully fulfilled that obligation. Despite the unfortunate partisan tenor within Congress over the past 10 years, the Office of the General Counsel unfailingly has been a professional, nonpartisan advocate for individuals across the ideological spectrum--this is a testament to Ms. Gennet and to her ability to place the long term interests of the institution before parochial concerns and partisanship.  In addition to providing general legal guidance to Members and staff on issues related to subpoenas, requests for information, and tort claims, Ms. Gennet also worked tirelessly to uphold the institutional privileges and immunities of the House of Representatives. Upon my election as Democratic Whip, I became a member of the Bipartisan Legal Advisory Group, otherwise known as BLAG. This body is comprised of both Democratic and Republican leadership and is responsible for directing the Office of the General Counsel to file amicus briefs on behalf of the House of Representatives. During my work with BLAG, I had the opportunity to observe first-hand the deep respect Ms. Gennet has for the House of Representatives. Ms. Gennet is a firm believer in the separation of powers and in the speech or debate clause of the Constitution. When it may have been more expedient to relent on these issues, Ms. Gennet fought to preserve the powers and prerogatives of the Congress.  On behalf of myself and the members of my Caucus, I again want to extend my deepest thanks to Geraldine Gennet for her service and I wish her the best with her future endeavors.                          ____________________
