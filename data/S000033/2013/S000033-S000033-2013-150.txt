 President, I ask to have printed in the Record winning essays written by Vermont High School students as part of the Third Annual ``What is the State of the Union?'' Essay contest conducted by my office.  The essays follow.      Caroline Braun, Champlain Valley Union High School (Winner)       There is no simple cure for the abundant issues plaguing      our nation. Not only are we recovering from a recession, but      we also are confronting challenges related to climate change,      healthcare, and education. While our efforts to address these      issues are noble, our failure to solve them reflects a more      concerning societal problem.       On December 14, 2012, twenty children and six faculty      members were fatally shot in Sandy Hook Elementary School in      Newtown, Connecticut. Not only did this devastating tragedy      leave close friends, family, and the local community in      shock, but also the nation. Though it is remarkable that our      country embraced the friends and families of those killed, we      only seem to value such a strong sense of community after a      crisis. The dramatic increase in violence in the past decade      raises new questions about our current societal values and      priorities: have we forgotten what's truly important in this      new age? While we enjoy the many luxuries that accompany      technology and contemporary life, has the lure of modern      convenience eclipsed our fundamental human need to take care      of and support each other, our families, and our communities?       Perhaps it is time we recalibrate who we are and who we      want to be as a country so that the fundamental values on      which our country was founded can once again flourish. How      can one pursue happiness without access to basic healthcare,      food, or the ability to spend time with the ones we love?      Certainly when our forefathers declared our right to bear      arms, their intent was not for corporations and special      interest groups to profit from its citizens being armed with      assault weapons intended for war. Instead of unbridled greed      and big business dominating our economy, it is imperative we      support small businesses so they can thrive once again.      Environmentally, we have yet to replace our dependence on oil      with renewable energy resources and reduce our effects on      climate change. And while we all agree educating our children      is a requisite investment in our future, teachers continue to      earn, on average, 12 percent less than other workers with      similar education and work experience.       As a world leader and role model for democracy and peace,      we need initiatives that not only connect people and      communities, but also ones that will act as catalysts for      change. Increasing awareness of issues related to social      justice will spark larger movements for societal change;      whether it is reducing community violence, practicing      business ethics, implementing renewable energy sources,      advocating for mental health care, or investing in our      teachers and schools. Instead of businesses and special      interest groups being the sole influence on policies and the      direction of our country, now is the time, once again, for      all citizens to be heard, cared for, and respected. Although      as a nation we have made and continue to make advances that      were inconceivable just a century ago, our penchant for the      new shouldn't trump our commitment to older values and      fundamental human rights.          Emily Ellsworth, Colchester High School (2nd Place)       Social mobility is essential to the development of the      American character. The ability to overcome class      distinctions and succeed economically through hard work      equates to opportunity. Yet current U.S. taxation policies      are harming the middle-class and widening the gaps of income      inequality, thus narrowing the window of opportunity for      Americans. Federally enforced legislation such as the Bush      Tax Cuts and the income     tax on capital gains provide a disproportionate amount of      benefits to the wealthiest Americans. This leaves a majority      of citizens possessing less means to increase their income,      obtain education for higher paying occupations and provisions      for the next generation.       It is necessary to consider the purchasing function and the      insurance function of wealth. The quality of a child's      education and neighborhood is dependent upon the volume of      wealth the parent has access to. Children also receive a very      different set of choices and opportunities upon entering the      adult world depending on their family's economic status. To      combat the further detriment to future generations, taxes      must be raised in areas which will inflict minimal harm, and      produce the most beneficial results. America is experiencing      the largest disproportion of wealth since 1928, and current      taxation policy not only aids in widening the income gap, but      harms the accumulation of government tax revenue.       The sale of stocks and bonds are called ``capital gains.''      Until the 1990's, the capital gains tax was at 28%. Today its      current level is 15% which enables less revenue gained from      any individuals whose main source of income comes from stocks      and bonds, such as wealthy businessmen. In 2006, for      instance, Warren Buffett paid 17.7 percent in taxes on the      $46 million he booked that year, while his secretary paid 30      percent of her $60,000 salary to the government. Simple      practices such as restoring tax rates to past levels are      essential to the aid of our country's recovery and to improve      the state of the Union.        Gena Chiola, Mount Abraham Union High School (3rd Place)       Today, we face problems concerning the environment, war and      conflict, as well as lack of resources. In these times, more      than ever before, the solution to these problems lies in      global communication. If we put our heads together, and help      each other, we can create a plan to reduce climate change. If      we increase our efforts to work out conflicts between      countries, through effective communication, less people will      lose their lives through unnecessary wars. Sharing of      resources can occur when we effectively communicate between      countries, which will reduce poverty worldwide. All it takes      is effective global communication to resolve global issues.       One major global problem is conflict between nations. There      will always be conflicts between people, it is part of being      human, but how we deal with these conflicts is what makes the      difference. Today, approximately 60 countries are involved in      a war. Millions of people die each year from these conflicts.      This fighting and killing is indeed a form of communication,      but it is not effective in solving world problems. We      accomplish nothing by killing people. We need to stop      thinking of ourselves as being separated by national      boundaries and focus on how to break down these walls. By      communicating and working towards the same common goal, we      will improve the planet. If we think globally, we will have      more of a chance of communicating globally, and resolving      conflicts through peaceful means, rather than war.       Enter Climate Change conundrum. Climate Change is the      increased temperature of the atmosphere due to human carbon      emissions. Our use of gasoline to run cars, and oil to heat      our homes contributes to the heating of the climate. We are      slowly destroying our environment, and creating an      increasingly dangerous habitat for all living thing. It is no      question that this is a dangerous issue that needs      addressing. And in order to address it, we must work      together. Bill Mckibben, of Vermont, helps us do this. He      organized 350.org, which is a global campaign to solve      climate change. The mission of 350.org is ``building a global      grassroots movement to solve the climate crisis.'' He      organizes global rallies and projects to bring the world      together in the face of this crisis. He helps us communicate      as a world to get the job done, since it can be done no other      way.       Earth's lack of resources needs to be addressed and solved      through global communication. 25,000 people die from hunger      every day. Other poverty induced diseases, like AIDs, cause      millions of deaths worldwide. However, by globally      communicating, we can reduce poverty. Global communication      can help us redistribute the resources. Some places are      brimming over with resources, such as fresh food, water, and      technology while others suffer. The U.S.A. has an abundance      of resources. If we use global communication to be at peace      with one another, we can share what we have, so that less      people suffer. If the United States were to share resources      with poverty stricken countries of Africa, people in Africa      would have happier lives, while people in the United States      would still have enough to live comfortably. This can all be      achieved through effective global communication.       Global communication is the answer. If we all put our      hearts and heads together, and forget our differences, we can      change the world for the better, which is always the ultimate      goal. Whether it's to prevent wars, bring the temperature of      the atmosphere down, or to redistribute resources, it's      undebatable that communication is what we need. Let us come      together, and work together and never forget the importance      of global communication.                              Bibliography       Mckibben, B. 350.org.
