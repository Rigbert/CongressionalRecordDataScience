President, I rise today to call the attention of my colleagues to an article published in the New York Times on September 21, 1999. The article describes the efforts by the people of East Peoria, Illinois, to combat racism and hatred in the aftermath of Benjamin Smith's shooting rampage during the July 4 weekend. Mr. Smith, a former member of the so-called World Church of the Creator, targeted Jews, African-Americans, and Asian-Americans, killing two and wounding nine before shooting himself. Matthew Hale, a self-proclaimed white supremacist who established the World Church of the Creator, set up its headquarters in East Peoria.  Mr. President, it would have been easy for the citizens of East Peoria to simply move on with their lives, dismissing this incident as an aberration and passively hoping that future acts of racial hatred would not plague their community. But the citizens of East Peoria are embracing a proactive approach to combating hatred, fostering tolerance, and celebrating diversity. Mayor Charles Dobbelaire recently announced the creation of a Human Relations Commission, which will guide East Peoria in their campaign to combat hate and teach tolerance.  While we can prosecute crimes motivated by hatred, we unfortunately cannot legislate hate out of the human heart. Each of us has a responsibility to speak out against racism and embrace our differences, rather than use them as a wedge to divide our communities. I ask that my colleagues join me in recognizing the commendable efforts made by the citizens of East Peoria to combat racial hatred and promote tolerance and that an article from the New York Times be inserted in the Congressional Record.  The article follows:             [From the New York Times, September 21, 1999]                   A City Takes a Stand Against Hate                             (By Jo Thomas)       East Peoria, Ill.--For years, the hard-working residents of      this mostly white town on the eastern bank of the Illinois      River did not take seriously the white supremacist views of      Matthew F. Hate, 27, the son of a retired local policeman.       They recall trying to ignore his leaflets and appearances      on public-access television. When he set up the headquarters      of the World Church of the Creator in his parents' home, some      thought it was a joke.       But after the July 4 weekend, when Benjamin Smith, a former      World Church member, went on a two-state rampage against      Jews, blacks and Asian-Americans, killing two and wounding      nine before shooting him-self, the laughter stopped.       ``We were sickened,'' said Dennis Triggs, 54, the City      Attorney. ``We had the sense that benign neglect must come to      an end.''       Mr. Triggs called Morris Dees, co-founder of the Southern      Poverty law Center, a nonprofit civil rights organization, to      ask what East Peoria could do.       Mr. Dees sent Mr. Triggs and Mayor Charles Dobbelaire, 59,      a copy of the center's publication ``Ten Ways to Fight      Hate,'' and advised city leaders to do two things: Speak out      immediately and form a broad-based coalition on race issues.       Mr. Dees also put leaders in touch with the Rev. David      Ostendorf, a United Church of Christ minister in Chicago who      leads the Center for a New Community, a group dedicated to      fighting white supremacist ideas and organizations in the      Midwest.       Mr. Ostendorf, who believes that ``the only way this      movement is going to be stopped is if communities stand up      and say no and organize to oppose it,'' added a stop in East      Peoria to a civil rights tour that retraced Mr. Smith's      deadly trip through Illinois and Indiana.       On July 22, with members of Mr. Ostendorf's caravan and 200      local residents present, the Mayor announced that East      Peoria, which has only a few dozen nonwhites in its      population of 23,400 would set up a Human Relations      Commission ``to guide us in combating hate and teaching      tolerance.''       ``We will not surrender the minds of our young to Matt      Hale,'' Mr. Dobbelaire continued.       ``I know that still today there are those who believe we      should not attract attention     to the hatemongers,'' he said. ``They believe that if we      quietly go about our everyday life, those who preach hate      will fade slowly into the night. I ask you this: If we do not      speak out, loud and clear, when the hate messages spewing      forth from this so-called church lead to death, then when do      we speak out?''       Mr. Dobbelaire's speech was followed by a prayer vigil in      front of the Hale family home. On the other side of the      ordinary, tree-lined street, a neighbor had posted a sign      saying ``Hate Has No Home here.''       The Mayor, who grew up in East Peoria and said racial      issues rarely crossed his mind, appointed a new Human      Relations Commission on Aug. 17.       ``We're in this for the long haul,'' he said.       East Peoria has survived severe blows before, the worst      being the closing of a Caterpillar tractor plant that had      been its economic cornerstone. But it has enjoyed a comeback      in recent years, with a new riverboat casino and jobs in      entertainment, tourism and service industries.       The idea that their town might be seen as some kind of hate      capital horrified the Mayor and the human relations      commissioners.       ``This is really causing a bad image for our tri-county      area, not just East Peoria.'' said David Mingus, the      commission chairman. ``It's unfortunate and unrealistic. Our      towns are good town.''       Mr. Mingus, 48, a mental health professional, said the      commission intended to take a broad look at diversity and      tolerance.       ``We will keep it open to all areas,'' he said. ``It's      something nobody has on the scope all the time. We have to      change attitudes.''       Anthter member of the commission, Charles Randle, 53, who      is black, said he had lived in an upscale neighborhood of      East Peoria for 17 years with no difficulty. But Mr. Randle      said he could not forget the searing experience of childhood      on a cotton plantation in Mississippi, where two of his      brothers, then young boys, were jailed for supposedly      whistling at a white woman. To escape that life, their      father, a sharecropper, moved his wife and 10 children to      Peoria, where he worked at a slaughterhouse and then started      a series of successful family businesses.       Mr. Randle, the director of economic development for      Illinois Central College, said he saw the Human Relations      Commission as a chance for East Peoria ``to step outside the      box and look around.''       Other communities have made similar efforts.       In Boise, Idaho, several years ago, the state's image began      to worry the staff at Hewlett-Packard, said Cindy Stanphill,      the company's diversity and staffing manager.       ``When we recruit, people know about Idaho potatoes and the      Aryan nations,'' Ms. Stanphill said. ``The image does not      necessarily represent the reality, but you have to deal with      both.''       For three years, the Hewlett-Packard staff has tried to      find ways to insure that people they recruit and employ in      Boise feel welcome at work and in the community. Staff       members are now trying to organize an Idaho Inclusiveness      Coalition, a group of major employers and human rights      groups to promote tolerance and celebrate diversity.       In Pennsylvania, the state's Human Relations Commission has      helped more than 50 communities form groups to do something      about hate. One group stated in Boyertown, a historically      all-white community northwest of Philadelphia where the Ku      Klux Klan distributed recruitment literature once a month.       Residents formed a unity coalition and asked citizens to      pledge 5 cents to 50 cents for each minute the Klan spent in      town. The money went to civil rights groups and helped      organize the town's first rally to honor the Rev. Dr. Martin      Luther King Jr.       The head of the local Klan complained that the group, which      was collecting $1,051 an hour, was using the Klan's name to      raise money, said Louise Doskow, a member of the coalition.      But the group persisted. ``We have raised over $11,000,'' Ms.      Doskow said. ``We did it every month for 13 months, then they      didn't show up again for a year. One person came to the      corner at the end of June, so we did another collection.''       The experiences of these communities and others, collected      by Jim Carrier, a former reporter for The Denver Post, have      been added to an updated version of ``Ten Ways to Fight      Hate.'' Mr. Carrier said the Southern Poverty Law Center      would distribute a million free copies of the booklet and a      companion, ``Responding to Hate at School.'' The booklets      will go to every school principal, mayor and police chief in      the nation, as well as to human rights groups, religious      leaders and interested citizens.       One group profiled, Coloradans United Against Hatred,      formed after an African immigrant was murdered by a skinhead      in 1997. Seeing the use of the Internet by hate groups, the      group set up its own Web site to offer an alternative.       ``Are we making a huge impact?'' said Anita Fricklas, the      Colorado director of the American Jewish Committee, which      helped underwrite the project. ``It's hard to know. But an      impact? Definitely.''                          ____________________
