I concede that the President is the leader of his party, and every President has spent time trying to help his party and its candidates. Idon't begrudge any President doing that as we come close to an election. As I travel in my State, the people are more focused on the problems that families are running into when it comes to the basic necessities of life than on the next election. They are hoping this President and all candidates will address issues as basic as income security, health care security, and, may I add, pension security.  This is something that has become a devastating issue for families in Illinois. Former steelworkers worked a lifetime and paid in religiously, week after week, month after month, year after year, with the promise that when they retired, they would have a pension and health care. They now find themselves high and dry with bankrupt companies. I haven't heard a word from the administration about pension security. This really hits a lot of people close to home.  I grew up in an area in Illinois that had a lot of steel mills. I used to apply there for jobs in the summer and hope that I could get one of those great-paying jobs. I have gone to meet with displaced steelworkers. I see tough men, muscular people, who worked hard their whole lives, who just don't take much foolishness at all, break down and cry in front of me because at age 59 they have lost all their health insurance protection. These are retirees who really followed the rules and did what they were supposed to do in America. Can we ask the President for 1 hour a week to talk about pension security--Just 1 hour? I think that would be an indication the President is listening to the people across America in terms of the economic issues.
