 President, I am advised that the Senator from Mississippi did bring this matter to the Subcommittee's attention and requested the Subcommittee's consideration for funding. As the Senator from Mississippi knows, the subcommittee considered a number of requests for research projects that could not be funded within the allocations. However, I share the Senator from Mississippi's view that the research program proposed by Jackson State University would make an important contribution to multi-modal transportation research.
