 President, let me conclude by pointing out that I find it kind of interesting. The very people who stand up here and say, as I happen to believe, that they have confidence that our scientists in the future are going to be able to shoot out of the sky like a bullet meeting a bullet incoming nuclear weapons over the ocean traveling at multithousand miles per hour and do it with certainty and accuracy--they have faith in the ability of that to occur, but they don't have faith in the ability of our scientists at the three laboratories, who say they are well on their way to doing that, to be able to say what they need.  I find it kind of interesting. I must admit it is a double-edged sword. I find my Democratic colleagues who do not support any national defense initiative--because they say this star wars notion can't work, it is too far out--I do not know how they come and rely so easily upon the likelihood that a $45 billion investment is going to guarantee these supercomputers will function to the degree they are needed to when these weapons reach their shelf life. But let's be fair. You can't have it both ways. I would respectfully submit that the ability to guarantee MIRV nuclear warheads fired in the hundreds or the thousands at the United States could be blown out of the sky with impunity by a missile defense initiative on our part is a mildly greater scientific feat than what the stockpile requires.  As someone said: ``The faith of our father''--``the faith of our father''--has always been that if we put our mind to it, if we invest the money, we have the intelligence, the ingenuity, and the know-how to get it done. I would respectfully suggest our three present laboratory Directors and all the doubts they express are primarily related to whether or not safeguard F and funding of $45 billion for the stockpile would be forthcoming.  I yield the floor.
