Speaker, for the information.  Obviously, one of the bills that I am particularly concerned about is the Labor, Health, and Education investments that we have been making. There is a substantial cut proposed in the 302(b) allocations, which is the allocations of the larger number to the 12 subcommittees, a substantial cut in the Labor-Health bill, well below historic levels. I hope that as we continue to work through the appropriations process, we can address that issue and not double down on the cuts that have already occurred in what I think the Leader and I both believe is a very critical bill, which includes funding for the National Institutes of Health.  We have 31 days left to go before the August break, legislative days, 43 days until our break in October, so time is essence. I would hope that we could address these bills and debate the priorities that these bills represent before we leave for the August break.  I yield to my friend if he wants to comment on that.
