President, I am pleased to introduce with Senators Hatch, Biden, DeWine, and Schumer, a bill to provide railroad police officers the opportunity to attend the Federal Bureau of Investigation's National Academy for law enforcement training in Quantico, Virginia.  The FBI is currently authorized to offer the superior training available at the FBI's National Academy only to law enforcement personnel employed by state or local units of government. Police officers employed by railroads are not allowed to attend this Academy despite the fact that they work closely in numerous cases with Federal law enforcement agencies as well as State and local law enforcement. Providing railroad police with the opportunity to obtain the training offered at Quantico would improve inter-agency cooperation and prepare them to deal with the ever increasing sophistication of criminals who conduct their illegal acts either using the railroad or directed at the railroad or its passengers.  Railroad police officers, unlike any other private police department, are commissioned under State law to enforce the laws of that State and any other State in which the railroad owns property. As a result of this broad law enforcement authority, railroad police officers are actively involved in numerous investigations and cases with the FBI and other law enforcement agencies.  For example, Amtrak has a police officer assigned to the New York City Joint Task Force on Terrorism, which is made up of 140 members from such disparate agencies at the FBI, the U.S. Marshals Service, the U.S. Secret Service, and the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco and Firearms. This task force investigates domestic and foreign terrorist groups and responds to actual terrorist incidents in the Metropolitan New York area.  Whenever a railroad derailment or accident occurs, often railroad police are among the first on the scene. For example, when a 12-car Amtrak train derailed in Arizona in October 1995, railroad police joined the FBI at the site of the incident to determine whether the incident was the result of an intentional criminal act of sabotage.  Amtrak police officers have also assisted FBI agents in the investigation and interdiction of illegal drugs and weapons trafficking on transportation systems in the District of Columbia and elsewhere. In addition, using the railways is a popular means for illegal immigrants to gain entry to the United States. According to recent congressional testimony, in 1998 alone, 33,715 illegal aliens were found hiding on board Union Pacific railroad trains and subject to arrest by railroad police.  With thousand of passengers traveling on our railways each year, making sure that railroad police officers have available to them the highest level of training is in the national interest. The officers that protect railroad passengers deserve the same opportunity to receive training at Quantico that their counterparts employed by State and local governments enjoy. Railroad police officers who attend the FBI National Academy in Quantico for training would be required to pay their own room, board and transportation.  This legislation is supported by the FBI, the International Association of Chiefs of Police and the National Railroad Passenger Corporation.  I urge prompt consideration of this legislation to provide railroad police officers with the opportunity to receive training from the FBI that would increase the safety of the American people. I ask unanimous consent that a copy of the bill and letters from the National Railroad Passenger Corporation's Chief of Police, Ernest R. Frazier, and Amtrak's President and CEO, George Warrington, be printed in the Record.  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in the Record, as follows:                                S. 1235       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of      the United States of America in Congress assembled,     SECTION 1.

Senator Patrick Leahy,     Russell Senate Office Building,     U.S. Senate, Washington, DC.       Dear Senator Leahy: I am very grateful that you have agreed      to support legislation which will allow railroad police      officers to attend the FBI Training Academy. Your recognition      of the importance of this bill speaks highly of your respect      for law enforcement.       The FBI Training Academy offers training for upper and      middle-level law enforcement officers. The curriculum focuses      on leadership and management training. The completion of this      training allows the law enforcement professional to play a      significant role in developing a higher level of competency,      cooperation, and integrity within the law enforcement      community.       Railroad police officers are sworn officers charged with      the responsibility of enforcing state and local laws in any      jurisdiction in which the rail carrier owns property. In      their efforts to provide quality law enforcement services to      our transportation systems, railroad police officers should      have access to the premier training that is currently offered      to other police agencies.       Thank you again for your support of the legislation that      will provide FBI Training to railroad police officers. Please      do not hesitate to contact me on this issue, or any matter of      mutual concern.           Sincerely,     Ernest R. Frazier, Sr., Esq.                                  ____                            National Railroad Passenger Corp.,                                    Washington, DC, April 6, 1999.     Hon. Patrick Leahy,     U.S. Senate,     Washington, DC.       Dear Senator Leahy: I want to take this opportunity to      express my thanks for your     support of the Amtrak Police by introducing legislation that      would allow railroad police officers to attend the Federal      Bureau of Investigation Training Academy.       Amtrak relies on its well-trained officers to serve and      protect its customers, employees, trains and stations. It is      critical that they are afforded quality training      opportunities, such as what the FBI Academy offers, to      effectively carry out their duties. I am proud that Amtrak      has the privilege of working with this fine group of men and      women, and I wholeheartedly support any measure that would      enhance their job performance.       Again, thank you for your support of passenger rail and the      dedicated law enforcement officers who help make safe travel      possible.           Sincerely,                                              George D. Warington,                                                President and CEO.                                 ______                                       By
