 President, I would like to take a moment to recognize the invaluable contributions that Dana Duzan, outgoing president of the American Society for Clinical Laboratory Science (ASCLS), has made to the clinical laboratory science profession.  In her leadership role with the Society, Ms. Duzan has dedicated herself to promoting the clinical laboratory profession and helping guarantee that the public has access to quality laboratory services. She has strengthened ASCLS's tradition of proactive involvement in government affairs and led the Society in its efforts to ensure that health care reform measures recognize laboratory testing as an integral part of health care delivery. During her tenure, ASCLS worked to maintain the integrity of the Clinical Laboratory Improvement Amendments (CLIA) and protect the laboratory and the public from potentially damaging reform measures such as co-insurance and competitive bidding. And in her efforts to promote the interests of the laboratory profession, she has remained an undaunted champion of patient interests, believing that all Americans have the right to quality, accessible laboratory services.  Ms. Duzan's leadership style reflects the team approach she takes in managing the hematology laboratory at the Sacred Heart Medical Center in Spokane, WA. Her dedication to coalition building can be seen in ASCLS's involvement with a variety of colleague health care organizations, in the Society's commitment to bringing the clinical laboratory industry together as a united front, and in ASCLS's unique partnership with industry leaders.  As president of the Society, Ms. Duzan has worked to further the mission of the Society, including promoting high standards of practice in the workplace, advocating professional autonomy, ensuring professional competence, supporting continuing education, and enhancing the public's understanding and respect for the profession and its practitioners.  In conclusion, Ms. Duzan's love of science, her tireless service to ASCLS and the laboratory profession, and her dedication to making laboratory services available to all make her an inspiration to her professional peers. She is to be commended for her valuable contributions and personal commitment to her work.                          ____________________
