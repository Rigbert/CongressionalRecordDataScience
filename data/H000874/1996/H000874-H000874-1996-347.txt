Speaker, it is with great pleasure that I rise today to recognize the Alice Ferguson Foundation and the Hard Bargain Farm Environmental Center located in Accokeek, MD. On January 23, Hard Bargain Farm was named the winner of Renew America's National Environmental Award. This award is part of the 6th annual Renew America National Awards for Environmental Sustainability. The awards are given each year to programs throughout the Nation that demonstrate leadership and excellence in environmental sustainability.  I have long been a supporter of the educational programs offered by Hard Bargain Farm and commend them on this selection from a pool of over 1600 applicants in 24 categories. I have been honored to work hand in hand with them throughout the Fifth Congressional District to protect the Potomac River through education efforts, environmental stewardship, and conservation action projects.  Mr. Speaker, this recognition of Hard Bargain's achievement and dedication to the environment marks two important firsts. Not only is this the first time that Renew America has honored a Maryland organization in the institutional education category, but it is also the first time that a National Park Program has received such recognition.  For the past 25 years, Mr. Speaker, Hard Bargain Farm has worked in a unique and highly effective partnership with the National Park Service to develop quality environmental education programs. I commend the leadership and experience of the Alice Ferguson Foundation and am very proud to rise today with my colleagues in recognition of this very special award.                          ____________________
