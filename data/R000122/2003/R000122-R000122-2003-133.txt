President, I commend Mayor James Doyle and the city of Pawtucket, RI for being recognized by the United States Conference of Mayors Best Small Business Practices 2003. This public-private partnership between the Conference of Mayors and American Management Services identifies outstanding programs and initiatives that successfully promote business development.  Over the past few years, as Rhode Island has witnessed a decline in manufacturing, cities throughout the State have increasingly been left with unused plants and mills. This trend has been especially apparent in Pawtucket, a city that had been a symbol of manufacturing and industrial innovation ever since Samuel Slater successfully built cotton spinning machines at Slater Mill in 1793. For the next 200 years, Pawtucket was home to a thriving textile industry and machines andironworking shops, but from 1991 to 2001, over 3,000 manufacturing jobs were lost.  Drawing on Pawtucket's rich history as a home to artists, Mayor Doyle reached out to the artist community and embraced an innovative solution to these emptied mills that once were the engines of growth for Pawtucket. City leaders and Mayor Doyle worked to create the largest arts and entertainment district in Rhode Island, and, although it typically takes a decade or more for cities to see tangible results from these districts, Pawtucket is already enjoying its benefits. Five mill properties have been sold to artists for commercial and live-work lofts, and 122 artists rent eight mill properties, filling 117,000 square feet of previously empty space.  The burgeoning arts district is also expected to improve quality of life and raise property values. Indeed, according to Department of Commerce models of economic multipliers, the city of Pawtucket has estimated that two new jobs will be generated for every three new artists who move into the district.  The United States Conference of Mayors' recognition of this initiative establishes in name what was already becoming known about Pawtucket. Through visionary leadership, the city is a leader in changing with the times and setting itself up for future success.  Mayor Doyle has always been a strong advocate for the arts, and his determination and belief in this initiative is perhaps best encapsulated when he stated: ``Some say a picture is worth a thousand words. But here in our city we know that it's worth a lot more. Combine this picture with pieces of one-of-a-kind artwork sold citywide from local studios and galleries--small businesses--and you create a powerful economic engine that can totally transform a City.'' I agree wholeheartedly with Mayor Doyle, and commend him and the people of Pawtucket for their forward thinking and commitment to innovation and the arts.                          ____________________
