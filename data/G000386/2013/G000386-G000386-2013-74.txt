 I think there is an insinuation in his comment that there is a strategy on our part not to speak. That is not true. It is that there is a Republican meeting going on right now. I went to that meeting and said to the people in the meeting they ought to be out here speaking and they had an opportunity to do it. And, for the group, I have objected for that reason.  I yield the floor.
