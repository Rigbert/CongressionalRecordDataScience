Speaker, reclaiming my time, and we are running out of time, I want to say that when I yielded, I was talking about symbolism. All of us believe that symbolism is very important. Our flag is a great symbol. Samoans have died for that flag. Residents of the District of Columbia have died for that flag. Residents of the Virgin Islands have died for that flag. Residents of Guam have died for that flag. And many, many residents of Puerto Rico have died for that flag.  Yes, this is symbolic, which is why the courts said it was appropriate, because it does not constitutionally diminish the vote of any one of the 435 Members of this body one iota. Why? Because if their votes make a difference, we automatically have a vote of the 435 of us. That is why the courts said this is absolutely constitutional.  It is not enough, what we do today. But it would be tragic if we do not do at least this basic step to recognize the inclusion of those who serve with us, who can speak with us, who can vote in committee across the street or in this building, but who have had their vote in the Committee of the Whole taken away from them when the Republicans took power in 1995.                              {time}  1115  Let us restore that vote today. Vote for this rule, which is a fair rule. And I say to my friend who quoted my comments, you were accorded a right to a substitute. You chose not to take it. You were accorded the right to an amendment. You now want to withdraw that. I will tell you that, on our side, if you want to withdraw that amendment by unanimous consent, we will not object. But my understanding is you don't want to make that request.
