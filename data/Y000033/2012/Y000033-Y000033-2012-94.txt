Mr. Speaker, I rise today in memory of a dedicated wife, proud supporter of our military and veterans, and most importantly, a great Alaskan. On April 26, 2012, Alaska lost one of its hardest working and most dedicated daughters, Mrs. June Burkart.  Mrs. Burkhart was a loving wife and mother whose life was defined by service to her family and community. For decades she served on the boards of countless organizations that supported Alaskans, most recently raising significant funds for the Wounded Warriors Program. As an avid outdoor lover, she worked to ensure that any wounded warrior who wished to hunt or fish had the opportunity to do so through the Safari Club International Alaska Chapter.  For days, I can continue praising her many accomplishments and the many ways that she improved my life and the lives of anyone who knew her. Her memory will continue to live on in our hearts and souls. I hope that June's family, and especially her husband Roy, can take comfort in the bond they had with June as it will be with them always. I hope the precious memories the family has of her will bring them comfort, and that they will come to find, in the lovely words of Hugh Robert Orr:  ``They are not dead who live in lives they leave behind. In those whom they have blessed, they live a life again, and shall live through the years eternal life, and shall grow each day more beautiful, as time declares their good, forgets the rest, and proves their immortality.''                          ____________________
