 President, we have waited day after day in the Senate on political issues when we should be taking the Senate's time to make America more secure.  Last week, the majority leader mentioned port security in a long list of issues to be debated before the August recess.  While Senator Frist continues to pay lipservice to this important priority, I remain concerned that with only a week left before the August recess we have no firm schedule or commitment to bring this bill to the floor.  I am worried that while the majority says it wants to act, it refuses to put any action behind that rhetoric.  And here's the bottom line--if God forbid there is an incident at one of our ports--the fingers will point to this Chamber.  And people will want to know: Why did the Senate sit on a bill that passedthe full House and passed the Senate Homeland Security Committee? Why didn't we make these ports secure when we had the chance?
