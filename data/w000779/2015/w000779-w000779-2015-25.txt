President, I wish to commemorate the honorable veterans and civilians of Umatilla County, OR, who worked tirelessly and fought valiantly for their community and country during the Second World War. These brave men and women served in a variety of capacities on all fronts, working to support the war effort at home, defending our coastlines from attack, and risking their lives in battle overseas. As the country continues to mark the 70th anniversary of World War II this year, I am proud to raise my voice to pay tribute to the men and women of Umatilla County for their part in the Allied victory.  Umatilla County played a unique and important role in helping our country achieve victory in World War II. In 1941, the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers created an airport in Pendleton, OR, which became home to the U.S. Army Air Forces 17th Bombardment Group. Following the attack on Pearl Harbor, the 17th Bombardment Group was called upon to defend the west coast from Japanese submarines. The group's aircraft and many of its members participated in the daring Doolittle Raid on Tokyo--the first U.S. bombing of the Japanese homeland. All 80 of Jimmy Doolittle's raiders trained in Pendleton, and 5 of them were Oregonians.  Umatilla County also played home to another facility vital to the war effort: the Umatilla Army Depot, located near Hermiston, OR. The Umatilla Army Depot was a repository for munitions and supplies in hundreds of semisubterranean silos. The depot created an economic boom for Hermiston--then a town of 800--which ended up harboring 7,000 new workers. The Umatilla County Depot became the largest munitions facility in the world and stayed active in Hermiston until 2001.  Umatilla County lost 86 people during World War II, but their spirit and stories live on through their families and in their communities. One of these men, SGT Modie L. Hubbard, even has a great nephew who now works in my office. Sergeant Hubbard was killed in action, and his is just one of many stories of those fearless men and women who died preserving the freedom of future generations.  There is sometimes a temptation to focus on the massive scale of events like World War II, on the number of tanks built or brigades in the field. As we reflect on these and other aspects of America's war effort, I would encourage people to remember the communities across this country--communities like Umatilla County--that built those tanks or provided those soldiers. It must be our responsibility to honor these communities and their sacrifices to this great country, and it is my hope that their stories will continue to live on and inspire future generations of Americans to service.                          ____________________
