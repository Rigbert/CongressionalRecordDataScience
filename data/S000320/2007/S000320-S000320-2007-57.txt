 President, today I pay tribute to MacDonald Gallion, who passed away on Saturday, August 11,2007. For 13 years, MacDonald Gallion served as Alabama's attorney general. He was a personal friend of mine and along with the entire State of Alabama, I mourn his passing.  Born in Montgomery and raised in Birmingham, MacDonald Gallion moved to Tuscaloosa in the 1930s to attend the University of Alabama. While at the university, MacDonald Gallion studied law and subsequently received his bachelor of law degree in 1937. That same year, he returned to Birmingham where he began his law practice.  In 1941, following the start of World War II, MacDonald Gallion took a leave of absence from his law practice to enlist in the U.S. Marine Corps. He served his country with great valor, witnessing extreme combat in the South Pacific. While serving abroad, he was wounded at Saipan and was later awarded a Purple Heart. He received several other honors for courage and returned to the United States as first lieutenant.  Upon his return from war, MacDonald Gallion relocated to Montgomery to serve as assistant attorney general for the State of Alabama. However, after several years, he resigned to return to private practice.  Later, MacDonald Gallion would again be called to serve his State. He was appointed special counsel to Governor Gordon Persons during the historic Phenix City Trials and was asked in 1955 to serve as chief assistant attorney general to Attorney General John M. Patterson. In 1958, MacDonald Gallion was elected to serve as attorney general for the State of Alabama. He would again be elected to this position in 1966.  MacDonald Gallion served two terms as Alabama's attorney general. During his tenure, MacDonald Gallion led successful litigation in several significant cases including one that established Alabama's offshore oil and gas rights. This historic ruling would later pave the way for the State's multimillion-dollar trust fund. He also led the successful litigation against loansharks. At the time, this was the largest litigation of its kind in the United States.  Active in his community, MacDonald Gallion was a member of many civic organizations and legal associations. He held the position of assistant editor at the Alabama Lawyer and was listed among the ``Who's Who in America.'' He was instrumental in the founding of the Alabama District Attorney's Association. For his many accomplishments and contributions to Alabama, MacDonald Gallion was inducted into the Alabama Senior Citizens Hall of Fame.  MacDonald Gallion will be missed by his son Thomas Travis Gallion III, and his daughter Mallory Gallion Bear. He will be remembered for his dedication and decades of service to the State of Alabama. I ask the entire Senate to join me in recognition of the life of MacDonald Gallion.                          ____________________
