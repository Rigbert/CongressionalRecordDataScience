 President, I ask unanimous consent to have printed in the Record my letter dated October 17, 2011, to the minority leader regarding S. 1385.  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in the Record, as follows:                                                  U.S. Senate,                                 Washington, DC, October 17, 2011.     Hon. Mitch McConnell,     Minority Leader, U.S. Senate,     Washington, DC.       Dear Leader McConnell: I respectfully request that the      Senate not enter into any unanimous consent agreement      pertaining to S. 1385, a bill to terminate the $1      presidential coin program. I have concerns about the impact      of this bill, including whether taxpayers will benefit from      ending the $1 presidential coin program.       Thank you.           Sincerely,                                              Charles E. Grassley,     United States Senator.                          ____________________
