I am pleased that my colleague, Senator Reed, joins me in this initiative.  Immunization against vaccine-preventable disease is perhaps the most powerful health care and public health achievement of the 20th Century. Remarkable advances in the science of vaccine development and widespread immunization efforts have led to a substantial reduction in the incidence of infectious disease. Today, vaccination coverage is at record high levels. Smallpox has been eradicated; polio has been eliminated from the Western Hemisphere; and measles, pertussis and Hib invasive disease have been reduced to record lows.  The bill I introduce today builds on these successes. ``The Comprehensive Insurance Coverage of Childhood Immunization Act of 2001,'' ensures that all health plans cover the recommended childhood and adolescent immunizations. This improvement is simple, it is cost effective, and it is long overdue.  More than 3.6 million children currently insured in the private sector are not covered for the recommended immunizations. Millions more have partial insurance for some of the recommended vaccines, but not all. Even if private coverage is complete, cost-sharing may be a significant barrier for many families.  A number of reputable studies confirm these statistics. The Institute of Medicine found in its report of last year that ``While most private health plans provide some form of immunization coverage, this coverage varies by type of plan, as well as by vaccine. Enrollment in a private plan does not guarantee that immunizations will be provided as a plan benefit.'' Results from a 1999 William M. Mercer/Partnership for Prevention survey of employer sponsored health plans found that about one of five employer-sponsored plans does not cover childhood immunizations, and out of four does not cover adolescent immunizations. And researchers at the George Washington University recently collected data on the immunization coverage policies of five health care companies, four national and one regional, that suggest significant variation by type of plan, as well as by vaccine.  The States have enacted some requirements to address these gaps in coverage, albeit limited. Only about 28 states have laws requiring that insurers cover childhood immunizations to some degree. Coverage standards vary considerably from state to state. And, as we know, employers that self-insure are generally exempt from state insurance regulation under the federal Employee Retirement Income Security Act. Approximately 50 million private-insured individuals are covered by self-insured plans.  These gaps are not insignificant. The private sector is a critical partner in vaccine delivery. Almost half, 45 percent, of all vaccine is delivered in the private sector. Certainly most health plans do provide some immunization coverage, but there is a just no reason why every child who has private insurance should not have access to such a basic, essential benefit. This is not only a flaw in our health system, it is simply illogical and irresponsible.  This is the 21st Century. We have long since learned how important immunizations are to the health of children and adolescents and to entire communities. At the beginning of the 20th century, infectious diseases were widely prevalent in the United States and exacted an enormous toll on the population. For example, in 1900, 21,064 smallpox cases were reported, and 894 patients died. In 1920, 469,924 measles cases were reported, and 7,575 patients died; 147,991 diphtheria cases were reported, and 13,170 patients died. In 1922, 107,473 pertussis cases were reported, and 5,099 patients died. Today these numbers are unheard of, and overall U.S. vaccination coverage is at record high levels.  But despite the dramatic declines in vaccine-preventable diseases, such diseases persist, particularly in developing countries but also in our own.  Just this past June, the Chicago Sun Times reported that a new study found ``distressingly low'' vaccination rates in a South Side Chicago neighborhood of Englewood. Twenty-six percent of children under the age of three have not been vaccinated for measles in this community. In 1999, the measles preschool vaccination rate for all of Chicago was 86 percent, down from 90 percent in 1996. In many pockets of the city, such as Englewood, rates are much lower than average. It was just a little over a decade ago that such low vaccination rates led to an epidemic of the highly contagious disease. In 1990 there were more than 4,200 cases of measles and 15 deaths in the Chicago area.  It is also important to keep in mind that an estimated 11,000 children are born each day in the United States. Every year, approximately 170,000 of these babies are born into families with private health insurance that does not cover immunizations. Each one of these children needs up to 20 doses of vaccine by age two to be protected against childhood diseases.  We must remain vigilant. Insuring universal age-appropriate vaccine coverage requires a strong and consistent partnership among State, local and Federal Governments, vaccine industry leaders, private and public health insurers and policymakers. From the beginning, immunization financing was explicitly structured to be a Federal/State/private-sector partnership. In 1955, under President Eisenhower, the Federal Government began Federal funding for immunization when he signed the Poliomyelitis Vaccination Assistance Act. This support was expanded in the 1960's under Kennedy when the Vaccination Assistance Act created the National Immunization Program at CDC. Over the years, Federal support for vaccine purchase and assistance to states for immunization activities has grown.  Today, Federal and State grants, the State Children's Health Insurance Program, the Vaccines for Children's Program and private-sector health plans and providers together provide a comprehensive approach to get our Nation's children immunized. This systemis the result of a concerted effort to fill in the gaps in coverage. But the system must adapt to new science and new social conditions. Shifting finance patterns require all partners to adapt to minimize system instability. For example, last year, after the Institute of Medicine reported that Federal funding has waned and that the public system was becoming increasingly unstable, Congress increased the appropriation for immunization infrastructure and vaccine purchase grants.  The public system cannot do it alone. Maintaining high immunization rates is a public health responsibility that must be shared by both the public and private sector. Most Americans rely on a system of insurance for their care. Most children today receive their immunization services from private-sector providers.  The National Vaccine Advisory Committee, the Institute of Medicine and the American Academy of Pediatrics have recommended that all health plans should offer first-dollar coverage for recommended childhood vaccines. The provisions of this bill have been supported by a broad coalition of groups for many years, including Every Child by Two, the Children's Defense Fund, the American Public Health Association and Partnership for Prevention. Yet still today, many health plans and insurers do not cover all immunizations fully as a covered benefit.  The Comprehensive Insurance Coverage of Childhood Immunization Act implements these long-standing recommendations by requiring all health plans--including groups, individual, and ERISA--cover all vaccines for children and adolescents that are recommended by the Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices. The Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices' recommendations are the standard of care. It is the Committee's Congressionally-mandated job to provide advice and guidance to the Secretary, the Assistant Secretary for Health, and the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, CDC, on the most effective means to prevent vaccine-preventable diseases.  The Act also directs that health plans cover immunizations without a copayment or deductible. Out-of-pocket costs have been identified as a barrier to proper immunization. In 2001, the cost of fully immunizing one child is approximately $627, with almost half of that cost resulting from the newly-recommended pneumococcal conjugate vaccine series. New vaccines and new combination vaccines currently under development will significantly increase this cost in the future. The U.S. Task Force on Community Preventive Services found that reducing out-of-pocket costs can result in increases in vaccination coverage by improving availability of vaccines and increasing demand for vaccinations. More than a dozen studies have documented the effectiveness of reducing out-of-pocket costs and the resulting improvement in vaccination outcomes.  Another obvious barrier to appropriate immunization is the lack of private coverage itself. Studies have shown that providers are more likely to refer children with less private insurance coverage to other sites for vaccination, and referral practices are known to have an adverse effect on both the timing and the rate of immunization. Service utilization studies within public health clinics indicate that some low-income parents use public clinics because of the reduced cost, even though they might prefer to receive immunizations from regular private providers. This certainly places an unfair burden on parents who have to take their children to different sites for care. It makes it even harder for families to keep track of their children's complicated immunization schedule. And it may result in missed opportunities to immunize children who are lacking needed shots. Studies of the implementation of the Vaccines for Children Program have indicated that referrals to health departments decrease when free vaccines are provided to private providers, suggesting that both parents and providers take advantage of the free vaccines. The Comprehensive Insurance Coverage of Childhood Immunization Act will help parents avoid unnecessary referrals due to lack of coverage or financial barriers and retain their child's medical home.  This practice of referral to public clinics also shifts the cost of vaccinating children from the private sector to taxpayers. Through the Federal Vaccines for Children Program, children with health insurance that does not cover immunization may receive vaccines at a Federally Qualified Health Center or a Rural Health Clinic. Vaccines at these clinics are also supported by federal grants to states for vaccine purchase through the Federal discretionary National Immunization program. States also fund the purchase and distribution of vaccines. When the private sector fails--the public sector picks up the tab.  For this reason, the Congressional Budget Office found that this legislation will increase the budget surplus by $70 million dollars over five years and $150 million dollars over 10 years. This savings is somewhat offset by the reduction in Federal tax receipts, but still saves $20 million over five years and costs less than $35 million over 10 years. There is no doubt that the States would see similar savings. Many States contribute up to 30 percent of the public sector vaccine purchase bill. This means that State funds, like Federal funds, are picking up the tab for kids with private insurance. And the CBO found that the new requirement would have a negligible effect on health insurance premiums, increasing premium costs, if at all, by no more than 0.1 percent.  Private providers should find comprehensive childhood vaccination cost-effective as well. Immunizations are one of the rare health services that have been proven to save money. The Measles-Mumps Rubella, MMR, vaccine saves $10.30 in direct medical costs for every $1 dollar invested. The diphtheria and tetanus toxoids and pertussis DTP vaccine saves $8.50 for every $1 dollar spent. The Haemophilus influenzae type b (Hib) vaccine saves $1.40 per dollar. The Inactivated Polio Vaccine, IPV, saves $3.03 for every $1 dollar investment. These figure are all direct medical savings.  It is rare that we have policy decisions that are this easy to make. The Comprehensive Insurance Coverage of Childhood Immunization Act will help millions of working families afford the immunization they need to protect their children. It represents a shared responsibility that we all have to our communities. Like safe food and clean water, high immunization rates safeguard all of us. I urge my colleagues to support this legislation and to act promptly to pass it on behalf of American families.                                 ______                                       By
