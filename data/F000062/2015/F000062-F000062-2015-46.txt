 President, thank you very much.  I just want to urge people to vote yes on cloture. We have been at this for 6 years. This is the third bill. We have been bipartisan. The bill is considered. This is a complicated and difficult arena. The bill is all voluntary. The moaning and groaning of companies, I say, if you don't want to participate, don't participate, but I can give you hundreds and thousands of companies that are desperate to participate to be able to protect themselves without a lawsuit, and this enables that. It is a first-step bill.  I particularly wish to thank the chair and ranking on the Homeland Security Committee. I very much appreciate this support and know that Senator Burr, I, and others will continue to work as we recognize this most serious threat on our economy and the privacy of individuals. To do nothing now is to admit that we cannot come up with a bill, and, in fact, we can. Please vote yes.  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Flake). The Senator from Oregon.
