 President, I rise to mourn the loss of an honored Kentuckian, renowned businessman,and public servant, and my personal friend, Ed Lane. After battling cancer for more than 2 years, Ed passed away on August 2. He was 73 years old.  Ed was passionate about supporting his hometown of Lexington and the Commonwealth of Kentucky. He was well connected to the State's business community through his work as a commercial real estate broker. Seeing a need for a publication for and about Kentucky business, he founded and was the publisher of the Lane Report, a great business news magazine for Kentucky.  Encouraged by his friends in the community to seek public office, Ed also represented the 12th District of Lexington on the Lexington-Fayette Urban County Government Council since 2005. He was reelected without opposition in 2014. As a council member, he brought his business experience and his wisdom to fight for and represent Lexington businesses and his district.  In addition to his public service as a council member, Ed supported his community through many philanthropic efforts and volunteer service. He served on the boards of many community, arts and civic organizations, including the Breeders' Cup Host Committee, the UK Sanders-Brown Center of Aging Foundation Board, the Lexington Downtown Development Authority Board, the Lexington-Fayette Urban County Airport Board, the Kentucky Arts Council, the 2010 FEI World Equestrian Games Advisory Committee, LexArts, the Lexington Ballet, the Lexington Philharmonic, the Better Business Bureau of Lexington, Junior Achievement of the Bluegrass, the Mayor's American Recovery and Reinvestment Act Committee, the Fayette County Equine Task Force, the Commerce Lexington Agribusiness Committee, and others.  Ed was an artist, photographer, and art collector. He loved cooking, reading, gardening, and talking politics. He also loved fast cars, earning him the nickname ``Fast Eddie'' in the 1960s. Ed is survived by his daughters Susan Brett Lane and Katherine Meredith Lane.  I was deeply saddened to hear of Ed's passing. He was a good friend, and I always enjoyed reading the Lane Report, especially Ed's engaging One-on-One interviews. Elaine and I send our condolences to his family.  The Lexington Herald-Leader recently published an article detailing Ed's life and achievements. I ask unanimous consent that said article be printed in the Record.  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in the Record, as follows:            [From the Lexington Herald-Leader, Aug. 3, 2015] Lexington Council Member, Business Magazine Founder and Publisher Ed                             Lane Dies at 73                    (By Greg Kocher and Karla Ward)       Lexington Urban County Councilman Edwin ``Ed'' Green Lane      III, founder and publisher of The Lane Report magazine, died      Sunday night. He was 73.       Lane, a longtime commercial real-estate broker, had battled      cancer for more than two years, according to a statement      Monday afternoon from The Lane Report, an online and monthly      print magazine of business news.       He made his first run for public office in 2004, when he      was elected to represent the 12th District on the council. He      took office in 2005 and had been re-elected to two-year terms      ever since.       Lane is survived by daughters Susan Brett Lane and      Katherine Meredith Lane, who were with him when he died,      according to The Lane Report.       ``The staff is saddened by the passing of an amazing man,      but it is lessened by how we marvel at the legacy Ed Lane      leaves,'' said Mark Green, editorial director of Lane      Communications Group.       ``His energy, his intelligence, his enthusiasm, his      optimism and concern for his family, community and the nation      will be missed but will continue to influence us. He was a      true leader. The man had enthusiasm for life.''       Mayor Jim Gray issued a statement: ``Not only was Ed highly      successful in his own business, he was an outstanding public      servant who brought his business experience and expertise to      City Hall to fight for Lexington's business men and women. He      also was a strong advocate for his district. Our city will      miss his leadership and experience.''       Sen. Mitch McConnell said he ``was saddened to hear of the      passing of my good friend Ed Lane. Ed was a dedicated public      servant and a tireless advocate for the people of Kentucky.      He was also a successful businessman and publisher. I always      enjoyed reading the Lane Report, a great publication for and      about Kentucky's business community, especially Ed's engaging      `One-on-One' interviews.''       Councilman Bill Farmer Jr. said Lane's knowledge about real      estate proved valuable whenever the council considered      whether to buy property.       ``He could make or break any land deal,'' Farmer said. ``He      could sit and go through the numbers at the microphone, off      the top of his head, about what the overhead would be, how      much something would cost, what the cost would be per square      foot. . . . He could look at any deal like that and criticize      it or laud it, and immediately you would go, `Yep, that's it      and why.' ''       That talent for finances made Lane a strong member of the      council, former Mayor Jim Newberry said.       ``His financial acumen was way above average,'' Newberry      said. ``He was really helpful when it came to budget issues      or the pension problems, or whether or not we ought to      refinance bonds.''       He said Lane also was ``a fun person to be around'' and      they became good friends.       ``Ed just had a personality that I would characterize as      delightful,'' Newberry said. He ``had a good sense of humor,      didn't get too worked up about things, certainly didn't take      himself or what he was doing too seriously. . . . He gave a      lot to the community and had so much more to give.''       Lane was born in Nashville and graduated from the      University of Georgia.       After college, he worked for a major advertising agency in      New York for a couple of years, according to The Lane Report      website. He later moved to Atlanta, where he was sales      manager for WRNG radio and was president of the Atlanta Young      Republicans.       He also got into the commercial real-estate business, which      led to a job as national director of real estate for      Lexington-based Jerrico in its Atlanta regional office, The      Lane Report said. Lane came to Lexington regularly as he      scouted new locations for the company, and he was involved in      many site acquisitions for Long John Silver's Seafood Shoppes      nationwide.       In 1981, Lane started the Lexington-based commercial real-     estate brokerage Lane Consultants and, later, Lane      Communications Group, publisher of The Lane Report.       Running a magazine is ``a risk that very few people have      been able to be successful in,'' but Lane ``did it      terrifically well,'' said Jim Host, founder of Host      Communications and former Kentucky secretary of commerce.       ``It ended up kind of being the official business magazine      of the state,'' he said.       Host said Lane was kind, insightful and had a non-     threatening demeanor during interviews ``but also really got      to the core of what he was trying to communicate.''       ``I admired the dickens out of him,'' Host said.       Former councilman Doug Martin said he and Lane were from      opposite ends of the political spectrum, but they enjoyed      breaking bread together in a restaurant or at Lane's home.       ``He was a fine chef,'' said Martin, who sat next to Lane      in the council chambers from 2009 to 2013. ``He was always      very proud of coming up with some great concoction or some      great recipe or some great ingredient that he'd found. He      would have pots of herbs and fish and seasonings, and it      would all just kind of stew together, and it would end up in      this fabulous presentation.''       Services will be at 7 p.m. Aug. 15 at Kerr Brothers Funeral      Home on Harrodsburg Road. Visitation will begin at 6 p.m.                          ____________________
