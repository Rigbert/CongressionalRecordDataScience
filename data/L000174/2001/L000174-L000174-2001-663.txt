President, when we talk about the time involved in a nomination such as this, I recall the last controversial nomination for Attorney General we had when the Republicans controlled the Senate. That was for Edwin Meese. It took considerably longer, with far more witnesses and questions than we are having in this debate. We sometimes forget the history of what goes on here.  This is a case where the White House actually sent Senator Ashcroft's nomination to the Senate on Monday--Monday of this week, 2 days ago. We are having the debate on the floor today. Prior to the President's inauguration, the Democrats controlled the Senate. We moved forward even without the paperwork or anything else from the incoming transition team. We moved forward to speed up a hearing on Senator Ashcroft.  Today we begin the debate on the floor, after the Judiciary Committee debated the nomination yesterday and voted yesterday evening. As I said, I convened 3 days of hearings on this nomination over a 4-day period from January 16 to January 19. That was prior to having received all the paperwork on Senator Ashcroft. We did that to help the new administration. The Republican leadership announced weeks ago that all 50 Republican Senators would vote in favor of the nomination, irrespective of whatever came out of those hearings. I am glad that other Senators declined to prejudge the matter.  Actually, the Committee on the Judiciary has done the best we could to handle this nomination fairly and fully. We have had hearings, I think, that make all members of the committee and the Senate proud. I have served in this body for 26 years. I believe very much in the committee system. I believe very much in having real hearings and then having a record available for Senators.  In fact, we actually invited Senators who had served in the 106th Congress and were going to leave the committee, as well as some we anticipated would be coming in from both the Republican and Democratic side, to sit in on those hearings. I mention this because we did not actually set the membership of our committee until last Thursday, but we did this ahead of time.  The committee heard from every single witness Senator Ashcroft or Senator Hatch wanted to call in his behalf. This is not a case where suddenly one side or the other was something loaded up. I think there were an equal number of witnesses on both sides. We completed the oral questioning of Senator Ashcroft in less than a day and a half. We limited each Member to two rounds of questions, for a total of only 20 minutes. The nominee was not invited back by the Republicans following the testimony of the public witnesses. As a result, any unanswered questions had to be answered in writing.  We then expedited the sending of written questions to the nominee. We sent the majority of written questions on Friday, January 19, the last day of the hearing, rather than waiting until the following Monday when they were due. Senator Hatch sent out the final batch of written questions on the Tuesday following the hearing.  We received some of what were described as answers to some of the written followup questions sent to the nominee late last Thursday. It is clear from those answers that the nominee has chosen not to respond to our concerns or address many of our questions. In fact, the committee has had outstanding requests to the nominee to provide a copy of the entire videotape of the commencement proceedings in which he participated at Bob Jones University, as has been discussed here on the floor. We have had that request pending since early January. That videotape was provided, incidentally, to news outlets but not to the committee.  I have also requested that the nominee provide a formal response to the allegations that while he was Governor of Missouri he asked about a job applicant's sexual preference in an interview, and we have not received any answer.  There have been references on the floor already today as though there were some kind of left-wing conspiracy to defeat John Ashcroft. I am not aware of that. I have asked my questions as the Senator from Vermont, and I responded to the interests of my constituents, both for and against Senator Ashcroft, from Vermont.  But if there is any question of whether there is influence of anybody on this nomination, I will refer to the New York Times of Sunday, January 7, and the Washington Post of Tuesday, January 2, in which they quote a number of people from the far right of the Republican Party who openly bragged about the fact that they told the new President he could not appoint Governor Racicot of Montana--whom he wanted to appoint--but that he must appoint John Ashcroft.  I mention that because, if anybody thinks this nomination has been influenced by liberal groups, the only ones who have actually determined this nomination and have openly gone to the press and bragged about influencing it are an element of the far right of the Republican Party. They have openly bragged about the fact that they told the incoming administration and President Bush that he could not have his first choice, the Governor of Montana--who is a conservative Republican and now the former Governor--but that he must appoint Senator Ashcroft. That remains a fact. That is why we are here.  Notwithstanding all this, and notwithstanding the fact that the questions have not all been answered, the requested material has not all been sent, we Democrats granted consent to advance the markup date in order to proceed yesterday afternoon and last evening. As the distinguished chairman knows, normally we would have had our debate before the committee today. I said, following his request, that we would not object to moving it up 24 hours. I was told the Republicans have a meeting of their caucus scheduled for later this week and it would accommodate both the new administration and the Republicans in the Senate if we moved that up. I agreed to that. As I said, the Senate works better if Senators can work together. Accommodation, however, does not mean changing one's vote.  We had a good debate in the committee. I think Republicans and Democrats would agree it was a good, solid debate. We reported the nomination to the Senate by a margin of 10-8, a narrow margin. Actually, in most of that debate we had between six and nine Democratic Members present. We usually had three to four Republican Members.  I brought with me the hearing record. Here it is, right here. This is a good, solid record. It is part of the history of the Senate. I wish all Senators would review that record. Many have. Unfortunately, we are not going to have a committee report on this controversial nomination. I think we would have been helped by doing that. There was a time when we did seek to inform the Senate with committee reports on nominations, nominations such as that of Brad Reynolds or William Bennett and a number of important and controversial judicial nominations. We prepared such reports when Senator Thurmond required that as chairman.  In lieu of a committee report, each Senator is left with the task of reviewing the record and searching his or her conscience and deciding how to vote.  I did put into the Record a large and I hoped complete brief prepared by me and the lawyers on the Senate Judiciary staff--Bruce Cohen, Beryl Howell, Julie Katzman, Tim Lynch and others--which I think would be very helpful to the Senate.  We may want to consider and contrast the behavior that has been engaged in on the other side. We have talked about the time this may have taken. We had the hearing, we expedited the debate, and we came to the floor. The consideration of the nomination of Attorney General Meese when the Republicans controlled the Senate--with a Republican Senate, one would assume that would move very quickly--that took 13, not days, not weeks: 13 months. And then we had several days of debate in a Republican-controlled Senate before final Senate action.  There was reference to how we how we handled the nomination of Attorney General Reno. That was noncontroversial, and that still took a month from nomination to confirmation. She was not confirmed by the Senate until mid-March in the first year of President Clinton's term. Attorney General Meese was not confirmed by the Senate until late February in 1985, at the beginning of President Reagan's second term. Here we are in January. This nomination was sent to the Senate on Monday, 48 hours ago.  I hope those who advise the President will point out to him these facts so he is not under the impression this nomination has been delayed from Senate consideration. The Democrats, when we controlled the Senate for a few weeks, expedited this. Republicans, when they controlled the Senate at the time of President Reagan, took 13 months to get his nomination of Edwin Meese through.  I have reviewed the hearing record and the nominee's responses to the written followup questions from the Judiciary Committee. I did that before I announced I would oppose John Ashcroft to be Attorney General of the United States.  I have talked to the Senate already about this, and to the committee, about my reasons for opposing the nomination. I expect we will go back to this during the debate.  Let's not lose sight of the historical context in which we consider this nomination. This is an especially sensitive time in our Nation's history. Many seeds of disunity have been carried aloft by winds that come in gusts--especially, unfortunately, from the State of Florida. The Presidential election, the margin of victory, the way in which the vote counting was halted by five members of the U.S. Supreme Court--these remain sources of public concern and even alienation. Deep divisions within our country have infected the body politic. We experienced the closest Presidential election in the last 130 years, probably the closest in our history. For the first time, a candidate who received more votes than were cast for the victor in the last three elections for President, who received half a million more votes than the person who eventually was inaugurated as President--received half a million more votes, I should say, than the man who became President--saw the man who became President declared the victor of the Presidential election by one electoral vote.  I do not question the fact that President Bush is legitimately our President. Of course, he is. I was at the inauguration. We all were. He was inaugurated. Yet, I would hope Senators will realize the concerns in this country: One person gets half a million more votes, the other person becomes President; the one who becomes President after a disputed count in one State becomes President by one electoral vote.  He is President. He has all the powers, he has all the obligations, all the duties of the Presidency, and all the legitimacy of the Presidency. I have no question about that. But I think he has an obligation to try to unite the country, not to divide the country. In fact, 11 days ago, President Bush acknowledged the difficulties of these times and the special needs of a divided Nation. He said:       While many of our citizens prosper, others doubt the      promise, even the justice, of our own country.  He pledged to ``work to build a single nation of justice and opportunity.''  I was one of those who had lunch with the new President less than an hour after his inauguration. I spoke to him and told him how much his speech meant to me. I told him he will be the sixth President with whom I have served. I told him how impressed I was by his inaugural speech. I said he had a sense of history and a sense of country, and I applauded him for it. I do think the nomination of John Ashcroft to be Attorney General does not meet the standard that the President himself has set. For those who doubt the promise of American justice--and, unfortunately, there are many in this country who doubt it--this nomination does not inspire confidence in the U.S. Department of Justice.  My Republican colleagues have urged us to rely on John Ashcroft's promise to enforce the law, as if that is the only requirement to be an Attorney General.  If Senator Ashcroft would have come before the committee and said he would not enforce the law, we would not be debating this issue today. I cannot imagine any nominee--and I have sat in on hundreds of nomination hearings--would say they would not enforce the law. That is not the end of the story. The Senate's constitutional duty to advise and consent is not limited to extracting a promise from a nominee that he will abide by his oath of office. Let me quote what my good friend, Senator Hatch, said on the floor on November 4, 1997, about the nomination of Bill Lann Lee to be Assistant Attorney General for Civil Rights:       His talents and good intentions have taken him far. But his      good intentions should not be sufficient to earn the consent      of this body. Those charged with enforcing the Nation's law      must demonstrate a proper understanding of that law, and a      determination to     uphold its letter and its spirit * * *. At his hearing before      the Judiciary Committee, Mr. Lee suggested he would enforce      the law without regard to his personal opinions. But that      cannot be the end of our inquiry. The Senate's responsibility      is then to determine what the nominee's view of the law is.  Like Senator Ashcroft, Bill Lann Lee promised to enforce the law as interpreted by the Supreme Court. He made the promise emphatically, he made it repeatedly, and he made it specifically with respect to certain Supreme Court decisions with which he may have personally disagreed. Despite all of Bill Lann Lee's assurances that he would enforce the law, the Republican-controlled Senate would not allow a vote up or down on the floor on his nomination.  I believe John Ashcroft's assurances that he would enforce the law is not the end of our inquiry. Far more than the Assistant Attorney General for Civil Rights, a job to which Bill Lann Lee was nominated, the Attorney General has vast authority to interpret the law and to participate in the law's development.  Unlike one of his assistants, he has to be held to a higher standard because he sets the policy. The assistant carries out the policy of the Attorney General. The Attorney General's job is not merely to decide whether common crimes, such as bank robbery, should be prosecuted. Of course, they should. Does anybody believe that whoever is Attorney General faced with something as horrendous as the Oklahoma City bombing is going to say, ``I am not going to prosecute''? Does anybody believe an Attorney General faced with a skyjacking or assassination is going to say, ``I am not going to prosecute''? Of course, they are going to prosecute.  But there are many other less spectacular matters, matters that are not in the news every day, where the Attorney General has to decide how the law is to be enforced. The Attorney General has more discretion in this regard than anybody in Government.  The Attorney General advises the President on judicial nominations. He decides what positions to take before the Supreme Court and lower Federal courts. He decides which of our thousands of statutes require defending or interpreting. He allocates enforcement resources. The Attorney General decides whom we are going to sue and, even more importantly, perhaps, decides which cases we are going to settle. He makes hiring and firing decisions. He sets a tone for the Nation's law enforcement officials.  I think it is reasonable to go back and look at how John Ashcroft acted as attorney general before, and I go back to Missouri. Again, he was sworn to enforce the laws and all the laws. So how did he focus the resources of his office? This is how he did it.  He focused the resources of his office on banning abortions and also on blocking nurses from dispensing birth control pills and IUDs. He sued political dissenters, and he fought voluntary desegregation. I am sure with murder cases or anything else such as that he would enforce the law, but it is how he chose to decide which of those discretionary areas to act in that troubles me.  He has used language here describing the judiciary that is disturbing to many. He has shown what Senator Biden calls ``bad judgment'' in associating with Bob Jones University and Southern Partisan magazine, and he unfairly besmirched the reputations of Presidential nominees, including Judge Ronnie White and Ambassador James Hormel.  I am particularly concerned that he has not fully accepted what he now calls the settled law regarding a woman's right to choose. His confirmation evolution seems implausible, given his support less than 3 years ago for the Human Life Act, which he now admits is unconstitutional even though he supported it, and his denial of the ``legitimacy'' of Roe and Casey in the 1997 ``Judicial Despotism'' speech, in which he called the Supreme Court ``ruffians in robes.''  I have disagreed with the Supreme Court on some cases, but I have never called them that.  His assurances are totally undercut by the recent remarks of President Bush and Vice President Cheney. Just 1 day after Senator Ashcroft assured the committee that Roe and Casey were settled law and that he would not seek an opportunity to overturn them, the President said he would not rule out having the Justice Department argue for that result. The Vice President similarly refused to commit himself on this issue over the weekend.  A promise to enforce the law is only a minimum qualification for the job of Attorney General. It is not a sufficient one. It is simply not enough just to say you will enforce the law.  Senator Ashcroft's record does matter in making a judgment about whether he is the right person for this job. Throughout the committee hearings, my Republican colleagues said we should give Senator Ashcroft credit for his public service. I agree with that, just as I give him strong credit and admire him for his devotion to his family and his religion.  At the same time, my Republican friends insist that his record and the positions he has taken in public service do not matter because he will take now a different position as U.S. Attorney General.  President Bush asked us to look into Senator Ashcroft's heart, but we are being urged not to look into his record. I do not doubt the goodness of his heart. I do doubt the consistency of his record.  Some of my Republican colleagues went so far as to argue we should not hear from any witnesses other than the nominee, that we need not review all the nominee's required financial disclosures and his files and his speeches before passing on this nomination. That is not the way we go about our responsibility of advise and consent. Remember, the Constitution does say advise and consent, not advise and rubber stamp.  That is why, as chairman of the Judiciary Committee, during the weeks I held that post, I refused to railroad this nomination through. Instead, I had full, fair, informative hearings to review the nominee's record and positions.  The American people are entitled to an Attorney General who is more than just an amiable friend to many of us here in the Senate and promises more than just a bare minimum that he will enforce the law. They are entitled to someone who will uphold the Constitution as interpreted by the Supreme Court, respect the courts, abide by decisions he disagrees with, and enforce the law for everybody regardless of politics. The way to determine that is to look at the nominee's record, not to engage in metaphysical speculation about his heart.  John Ashcroft's stubborn insistence on re-litigating a voluntary desegregation decree consented to by all the other parties over and over again, at great expense to the State of Missouri and with sometimes damaging disruption to the education of Missouri's children, is relevant. It is relevant because someone who has used his power as a State Attorney General to delay and obstruct efforts to remedy past racial discrimination by the State, and who has then publicly excoriated the judges who ruled against him and made a major political issue of his disagreements with the courts, may use his greater power as the U.S. Attorney General for similarly divisive political purposes.  His effort as a State Attorney General to suppress the political speech of a group with which he disagreed--the National Organization of Women--by means of an antitrust suit is relevant, because it reflects on how he might respond to political dissent as U.S. Attorney General.  His actions as Governor of Missouri and as a U.S. Senator are also relevant. In those offices, he took the same oath of office to uphold the Constitution that he would take as U.S. Attorney General. Yet, in both of those offices, he sponsored legislation that was patently unconstitutional under Roe v. Wade: the 1991 anti-abortion bill in Missouri, and the 1998 ``Human Life Act'' in the Senate. It is highly relevant to ask why, if his oath of office did not constrain him from ignoring the Constitution in those public offices, we should expect it to constrain him as Attorney General. And it is also relevant to ask whether the same John Ashcroft who as a U.S. Senator went around making public speeches calling a majority of the current conservative Supreme Court ``five ruffians in robes'' has the temperament needed to be an effective advocate before that same Court as U.S. Attorney General.  I cannot judge John Ashcroft's heart. But we can all judge his record. Running through that record are troubling, recurrent themes: disrespect for Supreme Court precedent with which he disagrees; grossly intemperate criticism of judges with whom he disagrees; insensitivity and bad judgment on racial issues; and the use of distortions, secret holds and ambushes to destroy the public careers of those whom he opposes.  I cannot give my consent to this nomination.  Mr. President, I will say more, but I see several Senators from both sides of the aisle on the floor. I am going to withhold in just a moment. But just think for a moment, we are a nation of 280 million Americans. What a fantastic nation we are. We range across the political spectrum, across the economic spectrum, all races and religions.  I think of, in my own case, my mother's family coming to this country not speaking a word of English. My grandfathers were stonecutters in Vermont. I look at the diversity of ethnic backgrounds in our family, my wife growing up speaking a language other than English. We have great diversity in this country and, over it all, everybody knowing, whether they are an immigrant stonecutter or whether they are a wealthy Member of the Senate, the laws will always treat them the same; everybody knowing, whether they are black or white, they can rely on the law to treat them the same.  But on top of all that, the Attorney General of the United States represents all of us. The Attorney General is not the lawyer for the President; the President has a White House counsel. In fact, to show the separation, the White House counsel does not require Senate confirmation; he or she is appointed by the President, and that is the choice of the President alone. But the Attorney General requires confirmation because the Attorney General represents all of us.  We hold this country together because we assume the law treats us all the same. When I look at the public opinion polls in this country and see a nation deeply divided over this choice for Attorney General, it shows me that American people do not have confidence in this nomination. I hope, if John Ashcroft is confirmed, he will take steps to heal those divisions, take steps to say he will be the Attorney General for everybody, not just for one group who told the President he had to appoint him. So in that regard, I hope all Senators will think about that.  Mr. President, I will go back to this later on, but I see other Senators on the floor, so I yield the floor.                               Exhibit 1             [From the Wall Street Journal, Jan. 31, 2001]        Senate Panel Backs Ashcroft Despite Fund-Raising Issues                (By Tom Hamburger and Rachel Zimmerman)       Washington.--The Senate Judiciary Committee narrowly sent      John Ashcroft's nomination as attorney general to the Senate      floor, even as outside critics complained that his history of      aggressive fund raising raises questions about his ability to      enforce campaign-finance laws.       The committee's 10-8 vote, with Democrat Russell Feingold      of Wisconsin joining the committee's nine Republicans,      signaled that Mr. Ashcroft is almost certain to win      confirmation from the full Senate later this week. But the      panel's sharp division and Senate Minority Leader Thomas      Daschle's announcement yesterday that he will vote against      his former colleague reflect the strong opposition among      Democratic constituencies to Mr. Ashcroft's staunchly      conservative record.       Mr. Daschle accused the Missouri Republican of having      ``misled the Senate and deliberately distorted'' the record      of African-American judicial nominee Ronnie White, leading      the Senate to reject Mr. White's nomination to the federal      bench. Answering such attacks for the GOP, Judiciary      Committee Chairman Orrin Hatch of Utah complained that a      ``vicious'' campaign by liberal advocacy groups had left      Democratic senators giving Mr. Ashcroft ``not one positive      benefit of the doubt.''       One of Mr. Ashcroft's most voluble opponents, Democratic      Sen. Edward Kennedy of Massachusetts, indicated that he won't      attempt to block the nomination with a filibuster. President      Bush urged quick action by the Senate so that his      administration could proceed with the organization of the      Justice Department, where a number of top department      appointments have been held up pending action on Mr.      Ashcroft.       ``I would just hope there are no further delays,'' Mr. Bush      said. ``There's been a lot of discussion, a lot of debate . .      . and it's now time for the vote, it seems like to me.''       Actually, the former senator's history of campaign fund      raising hasn't been debated much within the Senate. Mr.      Feingold, who backed Mr. Ashcroft in yesterday's vote, is one      of the chamber's leading advocates of campaign reform. But      yesterday, he cited the ``substantial deference'' a president      deserves in nominations.       Critics say Mr. Ashcroft has repeatedly pushed at the edges      of campaign-finance regulations by using taxpayer-financed      office staff to wage election campaigns, and by joining other      candidates in both parties in finding loopholes that have      allowed him to pursue larger donations than the $1,000-a-     person contributions permitted to a candidate's campaign      committee.       Those critics, from Democrats in Mr. Ashcroft's home state      to representatives of national organizations promoting      campaign-finance overhaul, say the lack of attention to the      issue reflects how deeply the Senate itself is steeped in the      techniques of fully exploiting the campaign-finance system.      But at a time when an overhaul bill may soon overcome      lingering resistance on Capitol Hill, they say Mr. Ashcroft's      record casts a cloud over his commitment to enforce      rigorously the laws regulating how political money is raised      and spent.       ``The Senate has completely failed its obligation to pursue      this line of inquiry,'' complains John Bonifaz, executive      director of the National Voting Rights Institute, a Boston      nonprofit group that specializes in campaign finance and      civil-rights litigation.       Mr. Ashcroft's backers on Capitol Hill and in the Bush      administration dismiss the complaints as ideologically      inspired sniping. Administration spokeswoman Mindy Tucker      says Mr. Ashcroft has ``always adhered to the law on      campaign-finance issues and his campaign-finance practices      have been above reproach.''       Like other senators in both parties, Mr. Ashcroft formed a      joint committee with his national party's Senate campaign arm      to collect unregulated ``soft money.'' When he was exploring      a presidential bid, he went to Virginia, which has few      campaign-money limits, to establish a political action      committee that accepted a $400,000 donation. ``A blatant      evasion of laws that are designed to protect against the kind      of corruption the attorney general is charged with      upholding,'' complains Scott Harshbarger, Common Cause      president.       In one case, Missouri Democrats allege, Mr. Ashcroft went      over the line of propriety. It dates to 1982, when Mr.      Ashcroft was Missouri attorney general and brought an action      against a local oil company for selling tainted gasoline. The      company, Inland Oil, countersued, charging that Mr.      Ashcroft's actions were motivated by his desire to win      election as governor. In a deposition. Mr. Ashcroft's      administrative assistant said be worked on Mr. Ashcroft's      election campaign while a state employee and contacted      potential campaign contributors from his government office.       The lawsuit also noted that Mr. Ashcroft had solicited an      executive of Inland Oil for a donation to the state GOP in a      fund-raising appeal under the state attorney general's      letterhead, and that he personally sought a donation from a      barge-company owner who did business with Inland. Mr.      Ashcroft has said the mail solicitation was merely sent in      his name, and Ms. Tucker says he hadn't known of the barge      concern's connection to Inland when he sought a donation.       The state later settled its complaint against Inland Oil,      which in turn dropped its counter suit. An opposing legal      counsel in that case, Alex Bartlett, says Mr. Ashcroft      ``caved'' on the case to avoid answering questions about his      fund-raising practices. Mr. Bartlett also says Mr. Ashcroft      later exacted retribution by effectively blocking the Clinton      administration from nominating him for a federal judgeship in      the mid-1990s. Former White House Counsel Abner Mikva says      then-Sen. Ashcroft told him in early 1995, ``I don't like''      Mr. Bartlett.       Ms. Tucker rejects that interpretation of events, saying      Mr. Ashcroft negotiated an appropriate settlement in the      Inland Oil matter. If he later expressed reservations about      Mr. Bartlett to Mr. Mikva, she adds, he didn't block him from      the bench since Mr. Bartlett was never formally nominated.      She also says Mr. Ashcroft never used public employees to      perform campaign work except in their off ours.                         Fund-Raising Vehicles       John Ashcroft has harvested donations, in recent years      using these political committees:       Ashcroft 2000: Senate re-election committee raised $8.9      million in ``hard'' money subject to federal limits of $1,000      per individual donation, $5,000 per political action      committee.       Ashcroft Victory Fund: Collected $3.8 million unregulated      ``soft'' money during 1999-2000, split evenly between      Ashcroft 2000 and National Republican Senatorial Committee.       Spirit of America PAC: So-called leadership PAC collected      $3.6 million in hard money since 1997, largely to finance      Ashcroft's exploration of a presidential bid.       American Values PAC: Virginia-based PAC raised $586,533      beginning in 1998, which financed TV ads in Iowa and New      Hampshire.
