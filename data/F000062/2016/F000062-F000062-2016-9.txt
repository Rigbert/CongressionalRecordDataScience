 President, today I wish to honor our colleagues who are leaving us at the end of this Congress, six individuals who have done a lot to shape how the Senate operates today.  First I would like to thank my three Republican colleagues who are departing. Thank you not only for their service to our country but your willingness to work with me and other members of my party on a number of issues.                               Dan Coats  Mr. President, Senator Coats and I served on the Intelligence Committee together. He was a supporter of many of our efforts, including our encryption bill to require all companies to abide by lawful court orders.                               Mark Kirk  Mr. President, Senator Mark Kirk took a brave stance on gun violence issues, bucking his party by cosponsoring our amendment to close the terrorist loophole.                              Kelly Ayotte  Mr. President, Senator Ayotte and I have worked very closely to improve breast cancer detection. I am hopeful that together we can pass our bill before the end of this Congress.  I would also like to speak to three of my closest colleagues on our side of the aisle.  Over the past 24 years, I have had the pleasure of serving in the Senate with Harry Reid, Barbara Mikulski, and Barbara Boxer, and I am grateful not just for our working relationships but for the close friendships I have formed with each of them.                               Harry Reid  Mr. President, Senator Reid has served in Congress since 1983, and he has been our party's leader for the past decade. Despite more than three decades in Washington, Senator Reid still retains the values instilled in him while growing up in Searchlight, NV. Often described as a tough fighter, he has respect from both sides of the aisle for being a consensus builder who is willing to constantly work to find a deal.  One issue on which Senator Reid and I share a passion is Lake Tahoe, the High Sierra lake that straddles the California-Nevada border.  Twenty years ago, Harry invited President Bill Clinton to announce a major commitment to restoring the health of Lake Tahoe. That first summit launched a public-private partnership that has now invested $1.2 billion in conservation and restoration projects around the lake.  This year, Senator Reid told me he wanted to turn the annual summit into a celebration by inviting President Obama to speak. The event was a huge success, with more than 7,000 people attending.  I will miss Harry's passion and leadership, but if anyone deserves a break, it is him.                            Barbara Mikulski  Mr. President, Barbara Mikulski is another fearless leader whom I admire.  When I first came to the Senate in November of 1992, there were only three female Senators: Jocelyn Burdick of North Dakota, who retired a month later; Nancy Kassebaum of Kansas; and, of course, Senator Barb.  Senator Mikulski often quips, ``I may be short, but I won't be overlooked.'' History certainly will not overlook the contributions she has made.  Rising to become the first woman to chair the Senate Appropriations Committee, Senator Mikulski is often described as a trailblazer. To the women in the Senate, she is a mentor, the dean of the Senate women.  From three women in 1992 to 20 women senators today--and 21 in the next Congress, much of that progress can be attributed to the leadership of the longest serving woman in Congress, Senator Mikulski.                             Barbara Boxer  Mr. President, finally, I would like to talk about my partner from California, Barbara Boxer.  Senator Boxer and I were elected to the Senate on the same day in 1992, the ``Year of the Woman.''  The day Barbara was sworn in was historic; it was the first time two women represented their State together in the Senate. That is an honor I am grateful to have shared with my good friend.  From the Marin County Board of Supervisors, to the House of Representatives, to the United States Senate--Senator Boxer has been a champion for families, children, consumers, and the environment.  She rose to become the chair and now ranking member of the Environment and Public Works Committee. I have great respect for Senator Boxer's passion, dedication, and enthusiasm for protecting the environment. No one does it better.  She led an effort to protect California's coast from offshore drilling. She authored the California Missions Preservation Act to restore and protect the 21 historic missions in California. She helped create Pinnacles National Park, Fort Ord National Monument, and Caesar Chavez National Monument. And she led the effort to expand the Gulf of Farallones and Cordell Bank National Marine Sanctuaries.  In California, there are now more than 1 million acres of protected wilderness thanks to Senator Boxer.  But she was more than just a champion for our environment.  In the Senate, Barbara was a staunch advocate for issues related to children.  She pushed to protect children from dangerous toys by removing lead or other dangerous chemicals and requiring cautionary warnings on children's products sold over the Internet. She fought to remove arsenic from drinking water to protect children. As chair of the After School Caucus, she wrote legislation to secure Federal funding for afterschool programs. Thanks to Senator Boxer, 1.6 million children now have a safe place to go after school.  She fought for our servicemembers.  She founded the Military Families Caucus to provide support for the families of servicemembers. She helped establish the West Coast Combat Care Center in San Diego, so that southern California veterans with traumatic wounds would have access to quality care.  And Senator Boxer fought for consumers.  She authored a bipartisan measure to prevent a conflict of interest with banks acting as real estate brokers. After the housing crisis, she wrote measures to protect homeowners whose mortgage is transferred or sold. And she pushed for legislation to help homeowners refinance with lower rates--thanks to that effort, 1 million borrowers were able to save thousands of dollars in interest payments each year.  And finally, Barbara was a staunch defender of women's rights.  She led the floor fight to pass the Freedom of Access to Clinic Entrances Act and pushed back against repeatedattacks on women's health and a woman's right to privacy. Her efforts led to the passage of the Violence Against Women Act that protects women from domestic and sexual abuse.  She worked closely with then-Senator Joe Biden to pass that landmark bill. After she announced her retirement, the Vice President said: ``You always knew in the Senate if you had Barbara on your side, you didn't need much more.''  Well, I have been lucky to have Barbara by my side for the past 24 years.  She has been a strong advocate for the people of California, and I am grateful to have served with her.  I am also grateful for the friendship we have shared over the years.  Barbara and her husband, Stewart, are two of the kindest, most caring people I have had the pleasure of knowing. Their marriage of more than 50 years has brought them considerable joy. Together they raised two wonderful children and are now blessed with four grandchildren.  I am sure she is looking forward to spending more time with them.  While she may be retiring from the Senate, the passion Barbara displayed for public service will not end.  I know she will continue to advocate and remain a powerful voice for the causes she championed here in the United States Senate.  I look forward to seeing what she is able to accomplish in the next phase of her life and offer her best wishes in a well-deserved retirement.                          ____________________
