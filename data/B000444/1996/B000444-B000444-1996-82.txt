 LEAHY. I yield myself first 1 minute.  Mr. President, I heard his ad hominem attack on the Clinton administration. I have always found the best prosecutions are those that don't become prosecutions but rise above partisanship.  I point out that the Clinton administration has appointed General McCaffrey as drug czar. For the first time, certainly since I have been here, I have seen somebody who really can be a drug czar.  Maybe people have different attitudes. I know the Speaker of the House, who is about my age, implies that all people during the time he was growing up in his age category used drugs, himself included. Mr. President, I never did. I believe perhaps because at that age I was out prosecuting people using drugs. I have never had any desire to. I have never used them.  Let's stop these ad hominem things. If Senators want to say whether they prefer using them or not, fine, but this administration has fought, as other administrations have fought, Republican and Democrat, to stop drug usage.  But let us also acknowledge something, and this is the fact that everybody, Republican and Democrat, has to stand up and admit: simply throwing the money at the drug problem does not make it go away. Whether it is the Speaker of the House saying everybody of that age used drugs or not, that does not make it go away. It is going to take a lot more than simply throwing money at this drug problem to make it go away.  I yield 30 seconds to the Senator from Delaware.
