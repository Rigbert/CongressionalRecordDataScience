Speaker, it is my distinct pleasure to recognize the Indian American Cultural Center of NWIHRC, which will be celebrating its 16th anniversary by hosting a gala dinner and banquet on Saturday, April 7, 2018, at the Halls of Saint George in Schererville, Indiana.  The Indian American Cultural Center, which opened on March 9, 2002, was established with the following goal in mind: to foster peace and harmony amongst the people of Northwest Indiana by showcasing their cultural heritage and creating spiritual awareness in both youth and adults, as well as to engage in various charitable endeavors, both nationally and locally. Since its inception, the Indian American Cultural Center has been instrumental in educating Northwest Indiana's citizens on the traditions and customs of the Indian heritage.  The members of the Indian American Cultural Center of NWIHRC are to be honored, not only for their commitment to preserving tradition, but also for their commitment to making improvements that benefit all mankind. Proceeds from this year's gala, which throughout the years has demonstrated the immense generosity of its attendees and organizers, will go to support numerous charity organizations. In the past, proceeds from the gala have gone to such noble causes as cancer research, educational scholarships, the American Red Cross, tsunami and hurricane relief funds, the Carmelite Home for Girls, Arc Bridges of Hobart, Campagna Academy, and many more. For their significant contributions to the community of Northwest Indiana and beyond, the members and leaders of the NWIHRC are worthy of the highest praise.  Mr. Speaker, I ask that you and my other distinguished colleagues join me in congratulating the Indian American Cultural Center of NWIHRC on its 16th anniversary. The members and leaders of this outstanding organization have dedicated themselves to serving others and continue to improve the quality of life for the people of Northwest Indiana and throughout the world; they serve as an inspiration to us all.                          ____________________
