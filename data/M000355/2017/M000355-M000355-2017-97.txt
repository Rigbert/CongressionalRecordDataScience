 At the age of 84, Clarence still works to serve his community, taking up a campaign to erect reserved-parking spaces for area veterans. These signs are a salute to the men and women who served our Nation in uniform.  As the honor guard commander of Somerset's American Legion Post 38, Clarence cares deeply about America's veterans. To arrange reserved-parking spaces for veterans, Clarence works with local businesses and the city of Somerset's street department. Then, he and his wife, Nancy, install the signs themselves. He says, ``It takes me about 20 minutes to put up two signs.''  To date, there are 10 locations with veterans-only parking throughout Pulaski County. Clarence is also working with other local businesses to install more in the near future. I would like to thank Clarence for his service to our country and to his fellow veterans, and I urge all of my colleagues to join me in doing so.                          ____________________
