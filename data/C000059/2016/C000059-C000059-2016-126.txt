Chairman, let me be clear, the language in the bill does not block EPA's implementation of the rule.  To date, EPA has not yet approved a test kit that meets the false positive and false negative standards. It is yet another example of EPA finalizing a rule with unattainable standards.  Therefore, the FY17 bill prompts the EPA to finish what it intended to do 7 years ago--approve a lead test kit as an alternative to costly third-party lab testing so as to prevent delays and reduce the cost of in-home renovations. Otherwise, EPA should solicit formal public comment on alternatives. The language in the bill prevents EPA from collecting fines for paperwork and recordkeeping violations until EPA solicits public comments on alternatives.  It is straightforward, commonsense language. As such, I urge a ``no'' vote on the amendment.  I reserve the balance of my time.
