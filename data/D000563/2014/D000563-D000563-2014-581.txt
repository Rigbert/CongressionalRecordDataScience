President, in this Chamber we spend a lot of time debating how our actions will affect future generations and the obligations we have to leave future generations a better nation and a better world.  Nowhere is this responsibility more apparent than when it comes to the issue of climate change. It is critical we leave our children and grandchildren a sustainable planet with a promising, bright future.  We can no longer shy away from the fact that over 98 percent of all working climate scientists believe that human activities have led to climate change. The Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change has found it to be unequivocal that the world is warming due to human activities. The existence of manmade climate change is not a debatable issue, nor is it a vague or distant threat. It is a situation which requires serious attention immediately.  I have heard it said there is only one major political party in the world which denies what I just said: the scientific evidence which points to climate change and the fact the world we are living in is changing with extreme weather patterns the life we lead and the future for many generations.  I hope, during the course of this debate, if the Republican Party comes to the floor, they will dispute what I just said. I am calling on them to name any other major political party in the world which agrees with the proposition that they stand for, questioning whether there is scientific evidence supporting climate change. I believe there is, and I believe we should act now.
