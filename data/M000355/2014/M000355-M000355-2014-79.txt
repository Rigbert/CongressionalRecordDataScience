 GRAHAM. Absolutely.  Mr. McCONNELL. We all remember that 10 or 12 years ago Israel--which had previously occupied Gaza for the purpose of preventing these types of devastating attacks--left. They said: We are through. They made a solid statement and said: We are uncomfortable occupying, and all we ask in return for the removal of our occupation is a peaceful border.  The Senator from South Carolina has just outlined that periodically this is what they have gotten in return for basically leaving Gaza alone and giving it a chance--if it chose to--to have a normal, peaceful existence. Yet they choose to continue the conflict, as the Senator from South Carolina indicated, because they are not in favor of a two-state solution; they are in favor of a one-state solution.
