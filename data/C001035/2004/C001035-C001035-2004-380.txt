The NID has the authority, has the power, to use the words of Senator from Ohio, to issue these orders, to task these agencies to carry out these directives.  I note that because the NID has the authority to manage the budgets of these agencies, he has a pretty big stick to use as enforcement.  Mr. DeWINE. If we can just talk back and forth a minute, let me interject and then the Senator can respond. I appreciate the progress the Senator has made in regard to the budget, and I think that is very important, but we have seen from our work on the Intelligence Committee, in looking at the intelligence community, a lot of these decisions that are being dealt with in the real world, are very time sensitive so when a budget change is made, we are talking about the next year or 2 years. Those are very important. They are changing directions. That is important. So I congratulate the Senator for making that change.  I am not concerned that the Senator has not done that in her bill. The Senator has done that. What I am concerned about is the execution. For example, I see in the Specter language: direct, oversee, execute the national intelligence program. Then he goes on to say: supervise, direct, and control the operations of the Central Intelligence Agency, the National Security Agency, et cetera.  So what I see in the Specter language that gives me a great deal of comfort is``supervise, direct, control operations.'' To me, ``operations'' is the key language because now we are dealing with things that are very time sensitive.  What I worry about is not the long-term planning. I am convinced that the Senator has taken care of that and I congratulate her for that. What I worry about is real world examples that I have now, such as we are listening to one country, or we have assets over here that we need to move very quickly over here and target a terrorist organization, and say we have limited assets, can we do that. It is a hypothetical, but could that decision be made?
