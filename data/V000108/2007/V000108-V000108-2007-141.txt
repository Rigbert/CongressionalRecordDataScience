Chairman, I move to strike the last word.  I would like to actually talk about the bill, and I would like to talk about the underlying merits of what Mr. Hobson and I and the members of the subcommittee and the full Appropriations Committee have tried to do.  In this particular title, we are talking about the Bureau of Reclamation, and we are talking about people's health and well-being. Part of that does include the wise stewardship of the moneys that are provided. From the debate that has taken place today, you would think that the only thing we are worried about is spending money and worried about the quantity of the money that we are spending as opposed to the quality of the underlying act and the work that the agencies do. And I would draw, Mr. Chairman, my colleague's attention to page 48 of the report that goes into great detail, and I am going to read it.  The gentleman has an amendment before us to cut $1.236 million from the bill. And the fact is, over the last several years our subcommittee, under the leadership of then-Chairman Hobson, as well as myself, have done everything possible to make sure that the moneys being spent by the Bureau of Reclamation are being spent wisely.  And I read from the report. ``In fiscal year 2006, the Committee directed the Department of Interior to submit, with its fiscal year 2007 budget request, a detailed 5-year budget plan for each of the major budget components, including water and related resources, California Bay Delta Restoration program,Central Valley Project Restoration Fund, and Central Utah Project Completion.''  Because the concern of the subcommittee then, and as it is as of this moment, is that the public's moneys are being spent with quality as well.  ``The Department subsequently informed the Committee that it would be unable to provide a 5-year plan for fiscal year 2007 and intended to make the initial submission with the fiscal year 2008 request. The Bureau failed to make that submission either, and now informs the Committee that the 5-year plan will be submitted at some undefined time in the future.''  The patience of the subcommittee, the patience of the Appropriations Committee is not without limit. And as a result, in the report language we note the Committee's extreme frustration with the Bureau's inability to provide a 5-year budget plan, the act contains a provision that transfers $10 million, not $1.236 million, but $10 million from policy and administration to water and related resources if the 5-year plan is not submitted within 60 days of date of enactment. We are certainly not afraid to move moneys around, and in this case, to the tune of $10 million, if the good judgment of this committee is not abided by.  So I would emphasize that this is not just a matter of quantity of money, it is quality of money. And that is what we are about. That is why I am adamantly opposed to the gentleman's amendment.                              {time}  1515  The Acting CHAIRMAN. The question is on the amendment offered by the gentleman from Colorado (Mr. Lamborn).  The question was taken; and the Acting Chairman announced that the noes appeared to have it.
