President, I would note that this is a very modest expansion of benefits for emergency medical technicians who serve at the direction of a state emergency response system, and is entirely offset by other provisions in the amendment. It simply reforms and improves what is already law and adds no cost--no Federal cost.  And if I could have the attention of the Senator from Indiana, this is less an expansion than a correction to a gap in the existing law. It is a reform of programs we have, and it is of no cost to the Federal taxpayers.  I see the Senator from Arizona on the floor. I am perfectly willing to yield back my time and go to vote if he wishes.  Mr. McCAIN. I thank the chairman.
