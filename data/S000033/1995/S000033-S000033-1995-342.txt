 Chairman, I rise in strong support of the Reed-Wynn-Baldacci-Sanders amendment. Crime is not just an urban issue, it is a rural issue as well. And in the State of Vermont when people in small towns and villages need help they rely on the Vermont State Police to come to their assistance. There are no local police.  Under the bill as it is written, moneys are allocated to municipalities under a formula. If a town's grant is less than $10,000 then that money goes instead to the Governor. He or she is then supposed to distribute that money to local communities but cannot use it for State police protection of those towns.  Mr. Chairman, this amendment would correct this problem. Under the amendment the Governor would be able to use the multiple small grants that come to him or her to fund the law enforcement activities of the State police.  I would like to have seen local police and State police be equally eligible for funding under this bill but I believe that this amendment provides some equity to small communities. This amendment also recognizes the dedication and bravery of State police officers in Vermont and across the nation.  I also want to express my appreciation to Representative Reed. It is always a pleasure to work with him.
