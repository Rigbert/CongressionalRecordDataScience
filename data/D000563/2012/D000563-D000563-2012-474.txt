Patrick ``Coach Fitz'' Fitzgerald, a lifelong Illinoisan, has enjoyed a long and distinguished relationship with Northwestern University.  He completed his undergraduate studies and played football at Northwestern, where he racked up several worthy achievements. A two-time first-team All-American, he won the Nagurski and Bednarik Awards twice, was named Big Ten Defensive Player of the Year and Linebacker of the Year, and received the George Ballentine, Jr., Memorial Leadership Award.  As Northwestern University's head football coach, Pat Fitzgerald has amassed an impressive record, leading the Wildcats to four consecutive postseason games and 5 consecutive years of eligibility for postseason games. And his leadership isn't confined to the football field. His commitment to academic achievement among Northwestern's football scholar-athletes has led to many being named Academic All-Big Ten students and the school's ranking among the Nation's leaders in annual graduation rates.  Coach Fitzgerald has been recognized for his work ethic, integrity, and positive attitude. He was designated one of college football's top recruiters and serves on the Ethics Committee of the American Football Coaches Association and USA Football's Tackle Advisory Committee.  Pat and his wife Stacy are active at Northwestern University and in the Chicago community, participating in many charitable activities, toy collection drives, and school health and wellness programs.  I congratulate Coach Pat Fitzgerald on the many successes of the Wildcats' football program and thank him for his service to one of our finest schools and the broader Chicago community.                          ____________________
