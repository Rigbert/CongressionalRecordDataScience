President, through the Chair, in response to the Senator from New Hampshire, they are equally disastrous.  Listen to these quotes from the Congressional Budget Office this afternoon about the Republican repeal plan: ``People who are less healthy, including those with preexisting conditions, would ultimately be unable to purchase comprehensive individual market insurance at premiums comparable to those under current law if they could purchase it at all.''  Listen to this. It goes on to say: ``In particular, out-of-pocket spending on maternity care and mental health and substance abuse services could increase by thousands of dollars in a given year for the individual market enrollees who use those services.''  Let me bring this home to your State. Your State has been devastated--our State has been hurt badly--your State has been devastated by the opioid crisis. I would like the Senator from New Hampshire, if she would, to respond to that by giving us some detail. What they are saying is that the Republican repeal of the Affordable Care Act is going to deny coverage in health insurance for substance abuse treatment for families whose kids are discovered to be on opioids.  I yield through the Chair without yielding the floor to the Senator from New Hampshire to describe her challenge in New Hampshire.
