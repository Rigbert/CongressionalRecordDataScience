President, I voted for S. 1723 because I am convinced that some high technology companies are facing critical labor shortages, which is in turn hampering growth in this important economic sector of Oregon's economy. It is critically important, however, that the final legislation contain additional protections for workers rights. Specifically, we should make certain that no qualified U.S. worker will be laid off simply to be replaced by a foreign worker. Further, we should ensure that employers who want to use this program have taken steps to find qualified American workers. I look forward to continued progress on this legislation as it proceeds to conference.
