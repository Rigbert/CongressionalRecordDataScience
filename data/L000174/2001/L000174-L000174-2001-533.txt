President, so everybody understands where we are, the Senator from New York brought up an amendment on Thursday. He was promised on the Record by the manager of the bill that he would get a vote. The Senator from New York is within his rights to ask for that vote.  It seems to me to be a concern that everybody is holding things up so we cannot have votes. Is there any reason why we cannot set up a situation here--and both my friend from Connecticut and my friend from New York are on the floor--that we could have some kind of agreement that says, within the next 45 to 50 minutes, we could have at least two stacked votes, that of the Senator from New York and that of the Senator from Connecticut, with the understanding we can have one or two others after that; otherwise, we can spend as much time making unanimous consent requests to vote.  Why would that not be sensible? It is not just enough to say the Senator from Connecticut will bring up his, and after his vote on it we will have somebody else, if the vote turns out to be tomorrow afternoon at 5. I want to get a few votes today.
