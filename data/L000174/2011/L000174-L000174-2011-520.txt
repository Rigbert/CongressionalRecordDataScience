Senator Grassley and I spent hours on the floor yesterday just waiting for people to bring up amendments. We went through a number of quorum calls. We are talking about something that is going to be a tremendous boost to businesses and inventors. Those who are watching are wondering probably why we have spent years getting this far. So much time is being wasted.  I just want everybody to know the two of us are ready to vote. Yesterday we took hours of delay to vote on the Leahy-Grassley, et al. amendment, and then it passed 97 to 2.  So I would urge Senators who have amendments to come to the floor. As the gospel says, ``Many are called, but few are chosen.'' It may be the same thing on some of the amendments, but ultimately we will conclude. Before my voice is totally gone, unless the Senator from Iowa has something to say, I yield to the Senator from Iowa.
