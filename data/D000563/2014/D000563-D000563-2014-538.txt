The Senator from Arizona and I stand together in a bipartisan fashion, urging the passage of this resolution as quickly as possible.  I just left the phone--the reason I came to the floor, I say to the Senator from Arizona, I was on the phone with the Ambassador of Ukraine and we were talking about the situation there, and I said: Senator McCain is on the floor and I would like to go down and say a word.  He said the people of Ukraine are watching what we are doing. They are watching what Congress and the United States are going to do.  There are some differences between us. There are some differences between the parties. There comes a moment--and there always has, at least in the past--where we decide we are going to stand together as a nation, particularly when it comes to issues of foreign policy. This resolution doesn't address every issue the Senator from Arizona has raised, but it certainly addresses some key issues on which the Senator and I both agree. We both voted for this in the Senate Foreign Relations Committee and we both want to see this move. The sooner the better.  I wish to salute my colleague, the Senator from Arizona, for returning to the Maidan, that area in Kiev where 103 Ukrainians lost their lives demonstrating against the former government and asking for change. Our experience together, visiting that country with a delegation of eight Senators, I hope sent a strong message: There is bipartisan support for Ukraine and we will not tolerate Putin's aggression at the expense of innocent people.  Mr. McCAIN. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent to engage in a colloquy with the Senator from Illinois.
