President, all of us who are friends and colleagues of the senior Senator from Pennsylvania, Senator Specter, are delighted with his robust recovery from a difficult illness.  Nearly a year ago Senator Specter announced that he had been diagnosed with Hodgkin's disease. He declared that he was going to beat it, just as he had beaten a brain tumor, heart surgery and several other challenges. We are delighted that his promise has been fulfilled, as we knew it would be.  Over the last year he underwent a regimen of grueling treatments. Throughout dozens of Judiciary Committee hearings and voting sessions on difficult topics, he and I sat side by side, month after month, as his treatments progressed. He slowly lost his hair, but he never lost his grit, his sense of fairness or his respect for the Senate and its special role in our system of Government. Nor did he lose his legislative skill, or his humor. Then, and now, he has maintained for himself, and for our committee--a brisk schedule, fueled by an energy level that would be daunting to many who are half his age.  He has all of the vigor of his earlier days, and maybe more. His hair is back, and if I may say so, he looks better than ever.  He is an inspiration to us all, and his example is a particular inspiration to millions of victims and survivors of cancer, and their families, across the Nation.  I value the partnership that he and I have forged over the years, and especially during the time that he has been our committee's chairman. One product of our partnership is the asbestos trust fund bill that is now before the Senate. Bringing this bill on its long journey to the Senate floor has required unending commitment and effort. I have been proud to work with him on this project, and I applaud him for all he has done to bring the bill to this point.  I commend to the attention of our colleagues an editorial about Senator Specter in today's edition of The Hill newspaper.  I ask unanimous consent that the editorial be printed in the Record.  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in the Record, as follows:                     [From the Hill, Feb. 8, 2006]                            Looming Specter       The past year has been tumultuous for Sen. Arlen Specter      (R-Pa.), but he has emerged from its trials triumphant.       It is not quite 12 months since the lawmaker announced he      had been diagnosed with Hodgkin's disease, a form of cancer.      In his statement disclosing his ailment and the imminent      start of chemotherapy, Specter said, ``I have beaten a brain      tumor, bypass heart surgery and many tough political      opponents, and I'm going to beat this, too.''       He has been as good as his word. He lost his hair but      continued to shoulder his heavy workload (and to keep in      shape playing squash before he got to his desk in the      morning). He was never absent, and his hair is back. At 75,      Specter is looking spry.       At the time of his diagnosis, the senator had only just      secured his chairmanship of the Judiciary Committee, after a      tough battle against conservative Republicans who feared he      would not fight hard for conservative Supreme Court justices      should President Bush have the opportunity to nominate them.       Those fears have proved unfounded. There are now two new      members of the high court, Chief Justice John Roberts and      Justice Samuel Alito, whose conservative credentials are not      in doubt. Those on the right trust and hope (just as those on      the left believe and fear) that the new justices, replacing      the late Chief Justice William Rehnquist and Justice Sandra      Day O'Connor, will move the court toward conservative      textualism and away from the ``living Constitution'' ideas      that have produced liberal change on social issues for the      past two generations.       It is Specter, a supporter of abortion rights, who has      presided over these changes to the bench. And he has done so      with aplomb and without any hint either of truckling to those      on either his right or his left. He rejected, for example,      conservative demands that Alito's confirmation hearings be     brought forward in December so that the nominee would not be      left hanging out as a target for too long. At the same time,      he did not allow his own ideological positions to blind him      to the nominees' obvious qualifications. Alito's and      Roberts's critics were given ample time to air their      concerns, yet both were steered swiftly and comparatively      easily to confirmation.       Bush must surely be well-satisfied with his decision in      2004 to back Specter's re-election despite their obvious      differences in ideology, temperament and outlook.       Specter is not resting on his laurels. His agenda is      dominating Senate business. He is presiding over a Judiciary      investigation of the National Security Agency's controversial      terrorist surveillance program. And his asbestos reform bill,      an effort to clean up a mountain of debilitating litigation,      is atop the legislative calendar put together by Majority      Leader Bill Frist (R-Tenn.).       People who know Specter rarely make the error of      underestimating him. They are even less likely to do so      following his performance in the past 12 months.                          ____________________[Pages S854-S855]From the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]            STAMINA, LEADERSHIP, AND RESPECT FOR THE SENATE
