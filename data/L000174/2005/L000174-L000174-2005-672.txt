President, I thank my friend from Utah for his usual courtesy. After all, he has in his lineage a Senator. His father, as does he, served as a Senator. He knows, as did his father, the normal courtesies that make this place run so much more smoothly. So I appreciate it.  I spoke at the beginning of the week about the alarming rise of religious McCarthyism. I hoped that by drawing attention to this situation the majority leader and other Republican leaders would speak out against any campaign that improperly characterizes Senators as being ``against people of faith.'' That demonizing of Senators and their motives has no place in this country, and absolutely none in debate among Senators. It is a slur. It is a smear. It is untrue. Every Senator, Republican and Democratic, knows it.
