We have $400 million for the disaster program. That is a commitment to agriculture to know that the Secretary can begin to work on the problem in the Atlantic States. That doesn't mean if down the road we have continued droughts--it is the worst in a hundred years in the Atlantic region--that we will not be committed to doing what we have to do. But to do it here, we have no way of knowing what that crop damage will be. So I urge the Senator to say here is $400 million in regard to all of the problems we are experiencing in terms of national disasters, and it doesn't mean that down the road that could not be addressed; we just don'tknow at this particular time. I don't think it would be responsible to add a whole bunch more money when we don't even know.  I thank the Senator for yielding.
