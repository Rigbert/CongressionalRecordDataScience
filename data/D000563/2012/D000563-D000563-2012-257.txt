President, tomorrow evening, hundreds of athletes from across the world will gather in London for the opening ceremonies of the 2012 Summer Olympic games.  Among those marching in the Parade of Nations will be 20 athletes from Illinois.  Making his Olympic debut in the 100-meter butterfly is Tyler McGill, a native of Champaign. After turning in the second-fastest time in the world this year at the U.S. Olympic trials, Tyler will be swimming for a spot at the top of the podium in London.  Lake Forest native and Northwestern Wildcat Matt Grevers is already an Olympic Gold-medalist as a member of the two winning relay teams in Beijing. This year, he'll be swimming for individual Gold--and maybe a world record--in the 100-meter backstroke.  As the son of an All-American, swimming is in Conor Dwyer's blood. After achieving personal bests in every event in which he competed at the trials, the Winnetka native will compete in the 400-meter freestyle as well as a relay at his first Olympic games.  Star diver Christina Loukas was born in Riverwoods, where she began swimming and diving at an early age. Although she moved away from Illinois after high school, Christina remained a Cubs fan and returns to Chicago often.  Chatham's Kelci Bryant will join Christina on the women's diving team as she competes in the 3-meter synchronized diving event. Already a two-time NCAA champion, this will also be Kelci's second Olympics.  Algonquin runner Evan Jager won four Illinois State titles in cross-country and track, but he will be competing in a relatively new sport for him--the steeplechase--at this year's Olympics. He qualified for the team after just a few years training for the grueling event.  Chicago's track and field star Wallace Spearmon, Jr., will be looking for vindication this year in the men's 200-meters--a high-pressured sprint that will include many of the fastest runners of all time.  Dawn Harper, who hails from my own hometown of East St. Louis, will be defending her 2008 Olympic Gold Medal in the 100-meter hurdles in London. She won in Beijing in a thrilling upset and with a personal best time, making her the one to beat in this year's games.  Member of the Fighting Illini and All-American Gia Lewis-Smallwood made her first international team in 2011 after competing in the discus for 11 years. She remained in Champaign after graduating, where she not only trains but also volunteers at the nearby YWCA and with Parkland Community College.  Competing in the men's discus event will be Lance Brooks, a New Berlin high school graduate who attended Decatur's Millikin University, where he played for the men's basketball team.  Growing up in Itasca, Sarah Zelenka tried swimming, soccer, volleyball, and basketball. But it wasn't until she went to college that this naturally gifted athlete found her sport: rowing. She has since won gold at the Rowing World Cup and World Championships and will be looking to add an Olympic medal to that collection in London.  Rowing twins Grant and Ross James have competed next to each other their entire lives and share their biggest fan--their mom. After Ross captured the final seat on the eight-man boat going to London, the twins learned that they had fulfilled their lifelong dream of competing next to each other at the Olympics.  At 6 feet 9 inches, Sean Rooney is a natural for the sport of volleyball. He was named Illinois' Player of the Year in 2001 when he led his high school team, Wheaton-Warrenville South, to an Illinois State championship. He competed in his first Olympics in Beijing, where he helped Team USA to a gold medal. He will help them defend that title this year.  Bob Willis grew up in Chicago and learned to sail on beautiful Lake Michigan. After qualifying for the Olympic games, he returned briefly to Chicago before leaving for London, where ``the first water [his] Olympic board touched was Lake Michigan water.''  Greco-Roman wrestler Ellis Coleman grew up in Chicago's Humboldt Park and joined the wrestling team as a way to stay out of trouble in a rough neighborhood. His signature move is an impressive leap called the Flying Squirrel, which he may employ as he wrestles to win Olympic Gold this year in London.  Growing up in Naperville, Candace Parker was a devoted Chicago Bulls fan. So it wasn't surprising when she began to play basketball herself, leading her high school team to multiple Illinois State championships and becoming the first female high school player to dunk a basketball in a sanctioned game. She has been a member of the USA Basketball Women's National Team since 2009 and helped win Gold for the United States at the Beijing Olympics.  Swin Cash will join her on the women's basketball team. Swin was draftedinto the WNBA after leading her college team to an undefeated 39 to 0 season and her second national championship. She now plays for the Chicago Sky.  Born and raised in Springfield, basketball swingman Andre Iguodala will represent the United States on the 2012 Dream Team, or Dream Team Three. His jersey number is now retired at Lanphier High School, where he was both a star student and athlete.  Star defender on the women's soccer team, Amy LePeilbet grew up in Crystal Lake. Her high school coach at Prairie Ridge remembers her not only for her athleticism but for her work ethic and persistence. She will compete as a member of the U.S. women's soccer team in London.  Each of these athletes has arrived in London as a result of years of perseverance and hard work. They have woken up in the dark for early morning practices and endured aching muscles and sore limbs. They have arrived early and stayed late, spending hours at the gym, on the field, or in the pool training for this moment and their Olympic dream.  I congratulate the athletes from Illinois and every athlete representing his or her country at these Olympic games. I look forward to watching them over the coming weeks as they compete for Olympic Gold.                          ____________________
