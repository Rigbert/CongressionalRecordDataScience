 President, I rise in support of the Interior appropriations bill. I commend the chairman and ranking member for developing a bill that provides a number of benefits to the people of the Nation and, particularly, the people of the Pacific Northwest. I want to highlight some of the bill's strengths and weaknesses.                           forest road policy  I voted in favor of the amendment offered by my colleague, Senator Bryan, on forest road funding and purchaser road credits. I did so in response to the enormous outpouring of public opposition to the current road-building policies of the Forest Service. Everyplace I've gone in recent months, I have been approached by average citizens--not just environmental activists--and urged to slow new road construction and stop subsidies to timber companies. Editorial boards across my State and the Nation have said now is the time for a change in the road building policies of the Forest Service. I agree.  However, this has been a difficult decision for me. My top forest priority is full implementation of the President's forest plan, including meeting timber production goals. A severe cut in road construction and reconstruction might have impacted the Forest Service's ability to meet all of the plan's objectives. However, I have been assured by the administration that the Northwest forest plan remains a top priority and it will not be affected by the $10 million cut in road construction proposed by the Bryan amendment. The administration believes it can minimize the impact of these cuts on the timber program throughout the country, but will make the scientifically validated Northwest forest plan a priority.  Despite my strong and continuing support for the Northwest forest plan, I am concerned about the Forest Service's policies on roadless areas. The scientific assessment recently completed for the Interior Columbia Basin ecosystem management project demonstrates the importance of roadless areas for fish, wildlife, water quality, and ecosystem health. Thus, I believe we should only build news roads into large roadless areas infrequently and with great care and full environmental analysis.  That said, I continue to be a strong supporter of multiple use, including timber harvest, on our Nation's national forests. I cannot fathom why some want to prohibit harvest of second growth timber of Forest Service land. Timber harvest not only provides needed jobs and wood products, but in some cases it can improve the health of timber stands and reduce the risk of devastating wildfire.  I intend to work with the administration to improve our road-building policies, reduce subsidies, protect vital watersheds, and ensure ecologically healthy systems remain strong. I do not support elimination of all new roads, because roads are necessary for timber harvest. But we must stop subsidies and/or the appearance of subsidies by revamping the agency's accounting systems and ensuring our Nation's public lands are managed as economically viably as possible.                              log exports  I want to explain why I believe the provisions in this bill regarding log export restrictions make good environmental and economic policy. As many of my colleagues know, the issue of log exports is very contentious. The battle over log export policy has raged in the Pacific Northwest for years. We first passed a comprehensive log export bill in 1990. Since then Congress has revisited that law in 1992, briefly in 1996, and again this year. The USDA Forest Service issued regulations in 1995 that would have seriously impacted the entire timber economy of the Northwest. Those regulations precipitated a demand by Senator Gorton for those Washington State entities impacted by log export policy to develop legislation they could all support. That was a tall order, but this legislation embodies the best compromise that could be developed. Let met explain what these provisions do.  First, this bill imposes a permanent ban on the export of all logs cut from State lands. My home State of Washington has been the biggest exporter of public timber in the Nation. However, under the compromise law Congress passed in 1990, no timber from State land could be exported for the first 5 years of the law. Those 5 years have passed, so the State ban on log export will--on October 1--be lifted and the existing law will prohibit the export of only 400 million board feet, of a total sale program of 650 million board feet. That means without this bill, 250 million board feet will go overseas without domestic processing. That means jobs would be lost in rural America and our region's forests would be cut without gaining their highest economic value.  Second, this bill also protects the private property rights and values of both industrial and family tree farmers. Without these provisions, a timber grower whose land was located next to a sawmill that uses Federal timber could not sell his or her trees to that sawmill if that sawmill also used Federal timber. That limitation does notencourage domestic processing of timber--one of the original goals of the 1990, and this, legislation. In addition, the proposed agency regulations that this legislation will correct would have required all private timber owners to brand each and every tree cut on his or her land. It is simply bad policy and does not encourage landowners to keep their lands in timber production instead of selling them off for development.  Third, some have objected to the so-called buyer-broker provision saying its guts existing log export law. This provision allows a third party sawmill owner that uses Federal timber also to purchase private timber from another company or individual and export a portion and process a portion of that timber. This allows a timber purchaser both to supply an American sawmill and pay the landowner the highest price for the trees. Currently, the State of Washington has very similar policy instituted in its log export regulations--and the ban on State log export has worked, by all accounts, very well. This provision provides necessary flexibility and will likely lead to more private timber being processed domestically than would otherwise occur. And, let me be clear, under this bill, a private company that grows timber on its own land still cannot export that timber from the same area in which it purchases Federal timber.  Finally, this provision will hopefully bring closure to log export policy. I--and the vast majority of the public--support a permanent ban on the export of unprocessed timber from public lands. Most of us would also like to encourage greater processing of private timber. This provision provides the tools to accomplish these goals. It is the right economic and the right environmental policy.               export of forest service alaska red cedar  I have offered an amendment that I hope will be accepted under unanimous consent regarding the domestic processing of Alaska red cedar from National Forests in Alaska. Alaska is a unique place. When most of us think of exporting a product, we think of exporting it out of the United States. In Alaska, a product is exported if it leaves Alaska--even if that product goes to the lower 48 States.  Thus, on the Tongass National Forest, Western red cedar is first offered to Alaska timber purchasers. However, there is no market or no capacity to manufacture this species in Alaska, so it has been declared a ``surplus species.'' As a surplus species, these fine, scarce logs can be sold on the long export market to Asian buyers. While American companies are certainly free to purchase these public logs, they must pay the significantly higher prices offered on the export market. In the lower 48 States, Western red cedar is very much in demand.  Under my amendment, these national logs must be offered at domestic prices to mills in the lower 48 States. My amendment requires the Forest Service to establish a three-tiered policy giving Alaskans first priority, other American companies next priority, and only if no one wants these logs--which is highly unlikely--may they be exported.  The current policy must be remedied. I hope my amendment will be accepted.                    land and water conservation fund  This bill provides critical funding for important land acquisition within the Pacific Northwest. The Columbia Gorge National Scenic Area will receive $8 million to purchase land to protect the ecological and scenic values in the gorge. It includes funds to acquire land and develop a trail along Cape Horn, one of the most beautiful areas on the Washington side of the gorge. Outside of the gorge, we appropriated $1.5 million for vital wetlands along the Black River in Thurston County. This unique, spring-fed river contains lands threatened by the growing population around Olympia and Tacoma.  I am very excited by the commitment Chairman Gorton has made to help secure funding to purchase the Elwha and Glines Canyon dams with land and water conservation funds. The acquisition and removal of the Glines Canyon and Elwha dams have been a priority of mine since I was elected in 1992. So far, we have $8 million authorized to purchase both dams from Diashowa Co. for a total of $29.5 million. It appears we can tap some of the $700 million allocated for LWCF purchases this year to acquire both dams and begin the process of removing one dam and restoring the outstanding salmon fisheries in this Olympic National Park River.                      recreational trails funding  I also support the increased funding for trails contained in this bill. Recreational use of our national forests has increased almost every year since the 1950's. This year, we added $3.5 million to the President's already high budget request for Forest Service trails maintenance in Washington and Oregon. These dollars desperately needed to keep our beautiful forests accessible, disperse forest users, and protect the forest system.                                title vi
