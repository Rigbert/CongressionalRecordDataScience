President, I am proud to introduce today a bill to try to bring some transparency and fairness into FEMA's disaster declaration process. It is the Fairness in Federal Disaster Declarations Act.  The inspiration for the bill was a tragic one. On February 29, 2012, leap day, a category F-4 tornado tore through southeastern Illinois, causing damage in 11 Illinois counties and causing major damage in the small towns of Harrisburg and Ridgway. Eight people in Harrisburg, alone, died in the event and 15 people were killed in total. Winds reached 175-miles per hour. It is not too much of a stretch to say these two small towns were almost wiped off the map.  Requests for Federal assistance after a disaster are made by the Governor of each State. The state emergency management agency typically does a preliminary damage assessment and then the Governor decides whether State resources are adequate to absorb the costs of clean up and recovery. In the case of the Harrisburg and Ridgway tornado, the Governor's request for federal emergency designation for Individual Assistance was denied, as was the State's appeal of that decision. With that denial, individuals whose homes or properties were damaged were precluded from direct federal help.  I asked FEMA why it denied the Governor's request--which was supported by my colleague Senator Kirk and me, along with the entire Illinois delegation--and we were told it was because the disaster did not meet or exceed the State's per capita. In other words, because Illinois is a highly populous state, it is presumed it can absorb the costs of cleanup and recovery from disasters up to a certain level. FEMA said the deadly tornado event did not exceed the state's presumed capacity.  Currently, FEMA multiplies the number of people in a state by $1.35 to determine a threshold of the amount of damage a state would have to have incurred to be considered for Assistance. In Illinois, that figure is about $18 million. Well, Harrisburg, Ridgway, and the surrounding communities had about $5.5 million in Public Assistance damages. $5.5 million is a lot of loss, particularly in a rural area--but not enough to qualify for Federal assistance under FEMA' s rules.  From 2002 to 2015, Illinois was denied federal disaster assistance seven times. Texas was denied thirteen times--for damage caused by everything fromwildfires to tropical storms. Florida was denied Federal disaster assistance eight times during that 13-year period, and California, New Jersey, and New York were each denied four times. FEMA's formula does not work for large, populous states, particularly those with a concentrated urban area, like Illinois.  Although the ultimate decision whether to award Federal assistance is made by the President, by statute, under the Stafford Act, FEMA is required to consider six factors when determining whether assistance is warranted. After the Harrisburg and Ridgway tornado, we pushed FEMA a little harder and asked what else, in addition to the per capita, was considered in the denial. After all, 15-people died in the event and the damage was startling. We were told that specifics of FEMA's analysis is not public and wouldn't be disclosed.  Illinois ran into the same issue in November 2013 when, once again, tornadoes swept through the State. This time six people were killed and whole neighborhoods were nearly destroyed. The Cities of Washington, Gifford, and New Minden, Illinois, experienced the worst tornado damage I have ever seen. Public infrastructure was decimated, but because Illinois did not meet one of FEMA's criteria, we were denied Federal Public Assistance. These events inspired my colleague, Senator Kirk, and me to introduce a bill to try to build in a bit more transparency and fairness into FEMA's process.  The Fairness in Federal Disaster Declaration seeks to improve the disaster analysis by assigning a value to each of the factors FEMA must consider when determining whether Federal disaster assistance will be made available. When it comes to Individual Assistance--funding to help people repair and rebuild their homes--the breakdown would be as follows:  Concentration damages--the density of damage in an individual community--would be considered 20 percent, Trauma--the loss of life and injuries and the disruption of normal community functions--would be 20 percent of the analysis, Special Populations--including the age income of the residents, the amount of home ownership, etc.--would comprise 20 percent, Voluntary agency assistance--a consideration of what the volunteer and charitable groups are providing--would make up 5 percent, the amount of Insurance coverage--20 percent, and the average amount of individual assistance by State, which includes the per capita analysis--would make up 5 percent of the analysis.  The bill also would add a seventh consideration to FEMA's metrics--the economics of the area, which will receive 10 percent consideration. This includes factors such as the local assessable tax base, the median income as it compares to that of the state, and the poverty rate as it compares to that of the state.  For Federal Public Assistance, the breakdown would be similar, with a greater emphasis placed on the Localized Impacts of the disaster, which would warrant 40 percent of the analysis.  It is reasonable that FEMA should take into consideration the size of the state requesting assistance, but as the regulations stand, large states are being penalized. Assigning values to the factors will help ensure that the damage to the specific community weighs more than the state's population. Illinois is a relatively large State, geographically, and has a concentrated urban area. The State--particularly downstate--is being punished for this fact.  If the Cities of Washington and Gifford, and Harrisburg and Ridgway, do not qualify under FEMA's current criteria for federal assistance, something is wrong. This legislation is necessary because the way FEMA evaluates whether to declare an area a Federal disaster is not working. It is done behind closed doors and it works against states with large populations.  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be printed in the Record.  There being no objection, the text of the bill was ordered to be printed in the Record, as follows:                                 S. 870       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of      the United States of America in Congress assembled,     SECTION 1.
