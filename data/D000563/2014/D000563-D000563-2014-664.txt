President, last Friday at Rockefeller Chapel on the campus of the University of Chicago hundreds braved the frigid weather to pay tribute to a fallen American hero. The life story of John Rogers, Sr., recalls an extraordinary chapter in the life of our Nation.  Seventy years ago, during World War II, the first African-American military aviators in the history of the United States Armed Forces deployed to North Africa.  These brave men were part of the now-legendary 99th Pursuit Squadron of the United States Army Air Corps. We know them better today as the very first Tuskegee Airmen to be deployed overseas--the first of the first.  During the war, Tuskegee Airmen were often referred to as ``Red Tails,'' after the distinctive color of the aircraft tails. Many of the bomber crews whose missions the Tuskegee Airman escorted over Nazi-occupied Europe had another name for them. They called them the ``Red-Tailed Angels'' because they made possible for so many other pilots to come home after the war to their families.  Last Tuesday, one of those original Red-Tailed Angels went to his final home. I am proud to say that I knew him and his family. His name was Judge John Rogers. He was 95 years old. He lived in Chicago.  Let me tell you about him.  John Rogers was born in Knoxville, TN in 1918. His father was a minister who also owned his own 12-chair barber shop. His mother died of tuberculosis when Judge Rogers was just 4 years old. The family lives across the street from Knoxville College, which John's parents had both attended.  Their father instilled in John and his three sisters a reverence for education. In addition to learning, young John Rogers also developed a love of flying. These were years when flying was still a new miracle.  As a boy, Judge Rogers would construct his own model planes using paper, string and the light wood from cheese boxes. When he was 9 or 10 years old, he walked miles from his family's home to the Knoxville airport just to be able to say that he had touched an airplane. When he was 12, he suffered another terrible loss. His father died of kidney failure.  John and his three sisters moved to Chicago to live with his mother's brother, a kind man who raised them in a loving home. Judge Rogers attended Tilden Technical High School in Chicago, walking 4 miles each way to school--8 miles a day.  After high school, he earned a degree from Chicago Teachers College. He put himself through college working as a short-order cook, among other jobs. After college, he became a teacher in the Chicago public schools.  At the same time he was studying to be a teacher, he was also learning to fly in the Army's Civilian Pilot Training Program in Chicago, where all the instructors were black.  He received his civilian pilot's license in 1938, when he was 20 years old--one of only about 120 African Americans pilot in the whole country at that time.  When World War II broke out, John Rogers tried to enlist in the Army as a pilot. The Army told him that it didn't have any ``colored'' pilots and didn't have any plans to have any ``colored'' pilots,'' but they had an opening for a truck driver. John Rogers told them: No thanks. He said he figured if he was going to be in combat, it was safer to be in the air than on the ground. So he volunteered in 1941 for a new Army Air Corps training program that had just been established for African American pilots in Tuskegee, AL.  He became part of the 99th Pursuit Squadron, the first all-black air unit, under the leadership of the legendary Lt. Colonel--later General--Benjamin O. Davis. In April 1943, he one of the first 28 African-American pilots to go overseas.  The 99th was based in Northern Africa and flew escort and bombing missions over Italy. Pilots of the 99th once set a record for destroying five enemy aircraft in under 4 minutes. Even among such an elite group of pilots, John Rogers stood out for his keen eyesight and steady nerves.  Mark Hanson is curator of the Chanute Air Museum--formerly Chanute Air Force Base--in Rantoul, IL, where the 99th was first activated. He said John Rogers was revered as a pilot who was so good he ``could put a 500-pound bomb through a building's window.''  A photo at the Chanute museum, taken by an armaments officer and friend, shows John Rogers standing next to his P-40 Warhawk. An inscription on the photo reads: ``This is Jack Rogers, the best dive-bomber pilot in the business.''  Another photo of John Rogers and members of the 99th hangs at the Smithsonian Air and Space Museum in Washington, DC.  The skill of the men of the 99th was well known among pilots, especially by the British, who often asked for the Airmen's close-air support.  What I am about to say here I read as I sat at that church service. I looked at it and I said it must be a misprint, and I read it again and it is true. All told, John Rogers flew 120 often dangerous combat missions for his Nation, over Europe, most of it over Nazi-occupied territory, and he rose to the rank of Army captain--120 missions.  After the war, he returned to Chicago. He decided at that time he wanted to go to law school so he said: I am going to the best. He applied over the phone at the University of Chicago law school. He was told that he lacked ``the necessary qualifications.''  Undeterred, John Roger showed up the next day at the law school wearing his Army officer's uniform. He said that someone who served his country in war deserved a chance to at least take a test to prove that he did have the qualifications to go to law school. So they gave him a test and he passed it, and he attended law school under the GI bill.  He went to school year-round, summers too, and graduated ahead of his class in 1948. He also, over time, earned a Ph.D. from Ohio State University.  On his first day in law school, John Rogers met his future wife Jewel Stradford, who would go on to become the first African American woman to graduate from the University of Chicago law school. She later served in the administrations of two Presidents of the United States. John and Jewel Rogers have one son, John, Jr. Although they divorced after 15 years of marriage, they remained close friends until her death many years later, and they both were actively engaged in raising an extraordinary son who is my friend today.  Judge Rogers practiced law in Chicago for almost 30 years. He gained a reputation as an outstanding attorney who was committed to justice and to his clients--and to mentoring younger and talented African-American lawyers.  In 1968, on a blind date, he met a fellow University of Chicago graduate, an educator who was active with the NAACP fund. John Rogers and Gwen DuBose dated for 33 years before marrying in 2001. They were a good match, and they were devoted to one another.  In May 1977, John Rogers was appointed an associate judge in Cook County, and several months later he was assigned to the juvenile division. Some judges don't like the juvenile court and look for a transfer. The cases can be heartbreaking and the proceedings occur out of the public view,so juvenile court judges don't receive the publicity some of their colleagues receive.  John Rogers loved juvenile court. He spent 21 years as a judge there and eventually became the supervising judge. To the often-complicated cases involving minors, Judge Rogers strove to bring wisdom, compassion, and justice.  Gwen Rogers has a stack of letters from men and women who appeared before Judge Rogers as youths and later wrote him letters thanking him for giving them a second chance. There was one letter in particular that he kept close and read several times. It was from a man who appeared before Judge Rogers on three different occasions. On his third court appearance, Judge Rogers said: ``I could send you to juvenile detention and you would deserve it. But I still see a glimmer of hope in you, so I am sending you to Boystown.'' He made it clear to the young man that this was his last chance.  Years later that boy--now a grown man--wrote to him and said he finished at Boys Town, went on to graduate from college, became a minister, and founded a church in the Presiding Officer's home State of Indiana.  Judge Rogers was the sort of man who became a father to many young men who needed someone to look up to. The young man he really poured his hopes and dreams into was his own son John Rogers, Jr. When John Jr. was 12 years old, his parents invested in some stock for him. Every birthday and Christmas after that, instead of toys John Jr. received stock certificates. At the age of 16, he got his first summer job--that was a family rule. Judge Rogers saved every dime he could in order to send his son to the best school. Eventually John Rogers, Jr. graduated from Princeton University. He would go on to found Ariel Capital Management, now called Ariel Investments, the first African-American-owned asset management company in America.  In 2007, the Tuskegee Airmen were honored right here in the U.S. Capitol with a Congressional Gold Medal, the highest civilian honor our Nation can bestow. The Tuskegee Airmen are the largest group ever to receive the medal. About 300 of the airmen crowded into the Capitol Rotunda on that cold March day to receive their medals. What an incredible sight. Many wore red jackets, a symbol of their Red-Tailed Angels reputation.  Afterwards, I was honored to host a reception in my Capitol office for the 11 Tuskegee Airmen from my home State of Illinois. One of them was John Rogers. Also joining us for that little reception was my colleague at the time, Senator Barack Obama. What a moment that was to see the arc of history and justice.  Five years later, President Barack Obama invited Judge Rogers and 14 other surviving Tuskegee Airmen to the White House for a screening of ``Red Tails,'' a George Lucas film about the historic flyers. Talk about the arc of history--the first African-American President inviting the first African-American aviators to the White House.  Judge Rogers, this man whose courage helped to break the color barrier in America's military, first knew Barack Obama as a promising young community organizer who was dating Michelle Robinson. The Rogers and Robinson families go back a long, long way. When John Rogers, Jr. was captain of Princeton's basketball team, he recruited Craig Robinson, Michelle's brother, to play for Princeton. Craig Robinson would later help persuade his younger sister to attend Princeton. There they were all those years later, Judge Rogers, President and Mrs. Obama, together in the White House watching a Hollywood film about the Tuskegee Airmen.  Judge Rogers' granddaughter Victoria said her grandfather actually watched the film three different times. Every time he moved his hands as though he were flying. She said, ``He said he could remember the tension.''  A while back Judge Rogers told a reporter: ``I hope there are planes in heaven so I can fly, because you know how much I love to fly.''  Well, Judge, I hope there are planes there too for your sake, and I hope you are sitting in first class or in the cockpit where you belong. You earned it.  In closing, Loretta and I and our family extend our sincere condolences again to Judge Rogers, his beloved wife Gwen, his son John, Jr., his granddaughter Victoria, to the rest of the Rogers family, to Judge Rogers' many friends, and all of those whose lives he touched and enriched.  That gathering in that Rockefeller Chapel was such an outstanding turnout of people in Chicago who wanted to pay tribute to the great man John Rogers, Sr. He will be dearly missed.                          ____________________
