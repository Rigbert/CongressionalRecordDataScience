President, this amendment provides reconciliation instructions to three Senate committees for the purpose of repealing and replacing the Affordable Care Act; in effect, rerunning the same bad movie the Senate has now seen three times. By now, Americans understand what these partisan Republican healthcare bills have in store for the middle class: higher premiums, worse healthcare, and a safety net in tatters.  I will close by saying that there is now a desire on both sides of the aisle to set aside this my-way-or-the-highway approach to governing. Bipartisanship is about taking each other's good ideas, and I believe the Senate can work together to lower people's premiums.  This amendment is a vote to look for more partisan ideological trophies when the Senate ought to be working together to find common ground.  I urge my colleagues to reject this amendment.
