Speaker, I would first like to thank Chairman McHugh and the ranking member, Representative Collins of the Subcommittee on Postal Service and Chairman Clinger of the Government Reform and Oversight Committee for helping me bring this bill to the floor. I would also like to thank my colleague from Rhode Island, Mr. Kennedy, who cosponsored this bill with me, and Senators Chafee and Pell, who have introduced an identical bill in the Senate.  This bill would designate the main U.S. Post Office in Providence, RI, as the ``Harry Kizirian Post Office.'' Because some of you may not know Harry, I would like to tell you a little about this outstanding Rhode Island citizen.  Harry Kizirian is the most decorated living veteran in Rhode Island. On Okinawa, he was severely wounded while leading an infantry assault. For his extraordinary heroism, Harry was awarded the Navy Cross, the Bronze Star with V Device for Valor, the Purple Heart with a Gold Star, and the Rhode Island Cross.  When Harry returned to the United States, he immediately went to work at the main post office in Providence where he had worked during high school to support his widowed mother. Displaying the same commitment and teamwork he showed on the frontlines at Okinawa, he worked his way up to an appointment as the Postmaster. He was confirmed by the U.S. Senate in 1961, and held the position of Postmaster for 25 years.  Throughout his career with the Postal Service, Harry also devoted much of his time to the community, serving on numerous boards and committees. Harry served on the board of directors for Butler Hospital, Big Brothers of Rhode Island, Rhode Island Blue Cross, the Rhode Island Heart and Lung Associations, and numerous others.  Harry and his wife, Hazel, also successfully raised a wonderful family. They have five children: JoAnne, Thomas, Janice, Shakay, and Richard; four grandchildren: Rebecca, Thomas, Joseph, and Janice; and three step-grandsons: Dylan, Collin, and Matthew.  Harry has served his country in every capacity: in the military, as a civil servant, as a devoted husband and father, and as a loyal American. Harry Kizirian is a source of inspiration for the young and old, and he is a particularly cherished member of Rhode Island's proud and vibrant Armenian community.  This bill would commemorate his generosity and valor for future generations, and it would pay tribute to a remarkable gentleman who has given so much to his Nation, his community, and his family. I urge my colleagues to join me in honoring Harry Kizirian by supporting this bill.                              {time}  1445  Miss COLLINS of Michigan. Mr. Speaker, I yield as much time as he may consume to the gentleman from Rhode Island [Mr. Kennedy].
