Mr. Chairman, I rise in opposition to the amendment.  Mr. Chairman, the way the amendment is written, each amount provided by this act is hereby reduced by 3 percent. In other words, every account in here, other than the mandatories, would be reduced by 3 percent. That is what the language says.  The problem here is that a large portion of that, almost two-thirds of that reduction, would come from operation and maintenance and military personnel.  Let me tell you what we would be cutting out of military personnel: the pay raise. Do not the people that serve in the military deserve a pay raise?
