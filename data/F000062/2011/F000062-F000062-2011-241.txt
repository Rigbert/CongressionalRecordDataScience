 President, I come to the floor to reintroduce private relief legislation on behalf of Jacqueline Coats, a widow living in the San Francisco Bay Area. I rise today to ask my colleagues to support this legislation in the 112th Congress, which would provide Jacqueline with the extraordinary relief I believe she deserves.  Jacqueline came to the United States from Kenya in 2001 on a student visa to study Mass Communications at San Jose State University. In January 2002, based on the advice she received from a college advisor, Jacqueline attempted to transfer to City College of San Francisco, which required her to file for reinstatement. However, the request for reinstatement was denied in October 2002, and Jacqueline's immigration status lapsed the following year.  Jacqueline married Marlin Coats, an American citizen, on April 17, 2006, at San Francisco City Hall. But not even a month after the marriage, on May 13, 2006, Jacqueline's husband died while heroically attempting to save two boys from drowning at Ocean Beach in San Francisco. The two children survived with the help of a rescue crew, but Mr. Coats was caught in a riptide and died. The sudden and unexpected loss of her husband devastated Jacqueline.  Unfortunately, a loophole in U.S. immigration laws meant that Jacqueline's status in the United States was suddenly in jeopardy due to the death of her husband. Jacqueline and her husband had prepared and signed an application for a green card at their attorney's office just four days before Mr. Coats died. However, the petition did not get filed until after his death, meaning it could no longer be considered valid.  Jacqueline very likely would have received permanent residence in the United States were it not for the abrupt death of Mr. Coats. At the time, Jacqueline received a medal honoring her husband's heroic actions. The SanFrancisco Board of Supervisors, the San Francisco Police Department, and the San Francisco chapter of the NAACP all passed resolutions in support of her remaining in the United States.  In 2009, I co-sponsored legislation known as the Fairness to Surviving Spouses Act to address this hole in U.S. immigration laws that creates unnecessary hardship for foreign-born men and women--like Jacqueline--whose immigration status is at risk when the sponsoring U.S. citizen spouse dies. I do not believe our immigration system should penalize individuals whose earnest efforts to become permanent legal residents of this country are cut short when their sponsoring spouse dies.  I was pleased that the President signed the Fairness to Surviving Spouses Act into law as part of a Department of Homeland Security appropriations bill on October 28, 2009. U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services is now implementing this law, which allows widows of American citizens to continue to petition for permanent residency as long as they can prove that they entered into their marriage in good faith. Jacqueline may be eligible for this form of relief; however, I believe that a private bill remains necessary until this process can be finalized.  Jacqueline has been a hard-working employee for a transit company in Oakland, California, since 2004. She is taking three classes at St. Mary's College, and she remains close with the family of her late husband. For Jacqueline, the Coats family here in the United States has become her own.  Ramona Burton, one of Mr. Coats' siblings, wrote in a letter to me: ``She spent her first American Christmas with us, her first American Thanksgiving . . . I can't imagine looking around and not seeing her there. She needs to be there.'' Another concerned California constituent wrote to me that common fairness, morality and decency'' should be the standards by which we view this case. I agree. Despite the tragedy of losing her husband, Jacqueline continues to work hard, take classes, and integrate herself within her community.  Without some form of relief, Jacqueline will be deported to Kenya, a country she has not lived in since she was 21 years old. This is never what her late husband, a citizen of the United States, intended.  I believe Congress should honor this family by granting Jacqueline permanent residency in the United States. I urge my colleagues to give consideration to Jacqueline and to support this private relief immigration bill.  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be printed in the Record.  There being no objection, the text of the bill was ordered to be printed in the Record, as follows:                                 S. 450       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of      the United States of America in Congress assembled,     SECTION 1. PERMANENT RESIDENT STATUS FOR JACQUELINE W. COATS.       (a) In General.--Notwithstanding subsections (a) and (b) of      section 201 of the Immigration and Nationality Act (8 U.S.C.      1151), Jacqueline W.

(b) Adjustment of Status.--If Jacqueline W. Coats enters      the United States before the filing deadline specified in      subsection (c), Jacqueline W.

(c) Application and Payment of Fees.--Subsections (a) and      (b) shall apply only if the application for issuance of an      immigrant visa or the application for adjustment of status is      filed with appropriate fees not later than 2 years after the      date of the enactment of this Act.       (d) Reduction of Immigrant Visa Numbers.--Upon the granting      of an immigrant visa or permanent residence to Jacqueline W.

Coats under section 203(a) of the Immigration      and Nationality Act (8 U.S.C. 1153(a)) or, if applicable, the      total number of immigrant visas that are made available to      natives of the country of birth of Jacqueline W. Coats under      section 202(e) of that Act (8 U.S.C. 1152(e)).
