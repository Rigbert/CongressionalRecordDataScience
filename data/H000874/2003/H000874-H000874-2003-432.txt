Is that the same Gephardt rule that the minority, when the Democrats were in control, thought was undemocratic, masked the desire of Democrats to raise the debt limit and spend more money; is that the same rule you are talking about reinstituting and you have reinstituted and are going to apply? I just want to clarify and make sure that is the same awful rule that you attacked so vigorously when you were in the minority.  Mr. DeLAY. I think it is a different rule. I think it is the Hastert rule now.
