Mr. Speaker, today I am introducing H.R. 1949, the Vendee Loan Restoration Act. This legislation, which is cosponsored by my friend Lane Evans of Illinois, the Ranking Member of the Committee on Veterans' Affairs, will re-establish the Department of Veterans Affairs' highly effective loan program, which VA terminated administratively on January 23, 2003.  When a purchaser agrees to buy a foreclosed VA home, VA may offer to finance it through a ``vendee'' loan to encourage the prompt sale of the property. Vendee loans are made at market interest rates and often require a down payment. Borrowers are assessed a 2.25 percent funding fee that is paid in cash.  I view vendee loans as an important tool to obtain a higher return on property sales, which reduces the overall cost of program operations. In the past, VA made, and subsequently sold, $800 million to $1.2 billion in such loans each fiscal year. There is an ample body of empirical data indicating that offering vendee financing is cost effective. In March 2002, Booz, Allen, and Hamilton, Inc., independently analyzed the cost effectiveness of vendee loan financing. Their report indicated a savings to the Government of $16 million in fiscal year 1999 due to vendee financing. We believe the vendee loan program is based on sound business principals and should be re-established.  I urge all of my colleagues to support this legislation.                          ____________________
