 President, it has been said that the United States and the United Kingdom are a common people separated by a common language. But we also share a unique cause for freedom, and to preserve that we should also share a common market.  Today I am offering an amendment that ensures that our economies become as integrated as the other common causes that we share. The amendment will provide for a Free Trade Agreement to be negotiated between the United States and United Kingdom similar to the North America Free Trade Agreement.  Specifically, this amendment will create room in the budget for Congress to consider, and the President to successfully negotiate with, the United Kingdom for a Free Trade Agreement with the United States.  The world is witnessing once again the unique brotherhood of freedom and the special bond between America and United Kingdom. Those who know and enjoy the benefits of freedom are willing to join together and pay freedom's price. With so much at stake, America and United Kingdom should do all we can to ensure our common cause stays strong for the benefit of generations to come. With this United Kingdom--United States Free Trade amendment, our mutual bond will only become stronger.
