Speaker, I thank the gentleman for that information.  I note, Mr. Whip, that the intelligence authorization bill, which was schedule to be on the floor today, which had been pulled, is not on the schedule for next week.  That obviously is a very important bill. And it is, I would say to my friend, as I understand it, a bill which has the agreement between the chairman of the Intelligence Committee and the ranking Democrat on the Intelligence Committee. So it would seem to be a bipartisan agreement on the substance of the bill. Can the whip tell us when we might see that bill back?  I am sure you agree it is a very important bill, providing for the work of the national intelligence director and providing to make sure that we can keep this country safe from terrorists, and I know that both sides are hopeful that it will come forward pretty quickly.  Can the gentleman tell us when that might be on the floor?
