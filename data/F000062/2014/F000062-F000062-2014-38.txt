 President, I supported the confirmation of Mr. John Carlin to be Assistant Attorney General for National Security in the Department of Justice, DOJ.  Mr. Carlin was serving as the Acting Assistant Attorney General for National Security, the top position in the National Security Division at the Department of Justice, which brings together the counterterrorism, intelligence, and counterintelligence efforts within DOJ.  The National Security Division is also important because it reviews and approves requests to the FISA Court for surveillance authorities.  Mr. Carlin has superb experience for the position to which he has been confirmed, having served as the Acting Assistant Attorney General since hispredecessor, Lisa Monaco, went to the White House last year to be President Obama's top advisor for counterterrorism and homeland security.  Before his position as Acting Assistant Attorney General, Mr. Carlin was the Principal Deputy Assistant Attorney General and chief of staff for the National Security Division. From 2007 to 2011, he served in leadership roles at the FBI, including as chief of staff to FBI Director Robert Mueller.  Mr. Carlin also served in a variety of positions in the Department between 1999 and 2007, including as a career Federal prosecutor, where Mr. Carlin served as National Coordinator of DOJ's Computer Hacking and Intellectual Property, CHIP, program. Before that, he was an assistant U.S. attorney for the District of Columbia, where he prosecuted cases ranging from homicide and sex crimes to cyber, fraud, and public corruption matters.  In one noteworthy case, he obtained a guilty verdict against Modou Camara on charges of conspiracy, fraud, and money laundering, in connection with real estate transactions in which Camara persuaded unqualified buyers to submit fraudulent loan applications through a first-time homebuyer program run by the Department of Housing and Urban Development's, HUD, Federal Housing Administration, FHA. Through this scheme, Camara bought properties at low prices and sold them--usually on the same day that he purchased them--at an artificially inflated price for a large profit. When Camara's recruited purchasers failed to repay their loans, HUD was forced to reimburse the lender. HUD lost over $1 million due to Camara's scheme.  As a prosecutor, he also obtained convictions in cases against a defendant who tortured and murdered a baby girl, a defendant who bribed former Congressman ``Duke'' Cunningham, and a defendant who was charged with first-degree murder.  Mr. Carlin was approved by the Intelligence Committee on March 4, 2014, and by the Judiciary Committee on February 6, 2014. Both committees received several letters in support of Mr. Carlin from senior officials and colleagues from both sides of the aisle.  I fully support Mr. Carlin's confirmation.                          ____________________
