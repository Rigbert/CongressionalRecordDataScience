President, I thank the Senator from Vermont for his excellent statement. I agree with all of it.  I see the Senator from New Jersey is not in the Chamber, but let me make one comment. When I was talking about the withholding of funds and the Federal mandates, he is accurate in the fact that funds would not be withheld. It would mandate that 3 percent of the money of the portion of funds that would go to his State would be taken from the surface transportation program, the National Highway System, and the interstate maintenance programs. That is the problem I have. In a way that is withholding money. That is a mandate that is backed up by withholding funds.  It is my understanding we have two Members who are due to bring their amendments. We encourage them to come.  I yield the floor and suggest the absence of a quorum.
