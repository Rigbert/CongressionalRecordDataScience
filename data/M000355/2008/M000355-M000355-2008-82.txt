 President, I rise to pay tribute to a dear friend of mine who has left behind her belovedCommonwealth stronger than when she found it. Mrs. Trilby Whobrey Ball was 80 years old when she passed away in her Owensboro, KY, home this August 26.  Born in the Kentucky town of Semiway, in McLean County, Trilby--or Trib, to her friends--graduated from Calhoun High School in 1946. She married her husband, Dr. Coy ``Eddie'' Ball, in 1947 when they both were attending Western Kentucky University. The Balls moved to Owensboro in 1964, where they would stay until this day.  Trib became well known to her neighbors and friends as she became active in her community. She was a member of the Daviess County Medical Auxiliary/Alliance since 1964 and served on the boards of several important charitable causes, including the Ellis Park Foundation, the Alma Randolph Foundation and the H.L. Neblett Center.  In fact, I first became aware of the H.L. Neblett Center through Trib. The old building she showed me wasn't good enough, and I was able to appropriate funds to construct a new H.L. Neblett Center for the community to focus on mentoring children and their families. That is directly due to Trib, and a room in the new building is appropriately named after her.  Since 2005, she was a member of the Kentucky State Legislative Ethics Commission. She joined Owensboro's First Baptist Church and became an integral member of the New Ladies Sunday school class, a group of fast friends who were very supportive of the Ball family during Trib's final years.  Trib also became involved in local politics and devoted a lot of time to serving her community and her country that way. Back in the days when Kentucky was very much dominated by one political party, she stood up for a competitive two-party system. She became active in the Republican Party of Daviess County and of Kentucky, and was chairperson of the 21-county Second District from 1968 to 1972. She cochaired the Daviess County gubernatorial campaign for Kentucky Governor Louie B. Nunn.  Trib served on the party's State Central Committee for more than 20 years, and represented Kentucky as either a delegate or a guest at the Republican National Convention three times. In fact, in my role as its temporary chairman, I selected her to be my honorary escort for the 2008 Republican Convention, just held last week. Sadly, she left us before that date, but I decided to let her appointment stand as I know Trib would have loved to be with us in St. Paul, MN.  May I add, that Trib was also a longtime, steadfast supporter of my own campaigns, and I remember her eagerness to help and to volunteer very well. Trib was very helpful to me back when no one knew who I was or if I could win a statewide election. I'm gratified that 24 years after the fact, she told a reporter at a Lincoln Day luncheon this year that my first Senate race in 1984 was one of the sweetest campaigns she ever worked on. It was made all the sweeter by her presence.  Friends and family members will remember Trib's love of boating, basketball and bluegrass music when they think of her long, well-lived life. She leaves behind her husband of nearly 61 years, Eddie; their two children, Bonnie Harris and her husband Jay as well as David Ball and his wife Christy; her grandchildren, Jack, Cal and Keeley Harris; her sister, Sylvia Gross; several nieces and nephews; and many other beloved family members.  Mrs. Trilby Whobrey Ball was a very special woman and one of Kentucky's finest citizens. I extend my deepest sympathies to her family. She will be greatly missed by all who loved her.                          ____________________
