 President, this is an excellent amendment that has been cleared on both sides of the aisle. It is an important contribution. The Senator from Alabama is making an effort to combat this plague, which is clearly the No. 1 public health problem in the world today. I thank him for this important contribution.  Has the Senator sent the amendment to the desk?
