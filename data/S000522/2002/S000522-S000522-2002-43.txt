Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.  Mr. Speaker, first of all, I thank the gentlewoman for her fine remarks and leadership on this issue and the efforts of the gentleman from Illinois (Mr. Hyde) and especially to the gentleman from California (Mr. Lantos), the ranking member, for crafting this important bipartisan legislation.  The creation of democracy in Russia must be counted as one of the great achievements of the past century. Yet for all of its accomplishments, that democracy is not yet firmly established. The civil society on which all democracies ultimately rest remains precariously weak. Much of the legacy inherited from Russia's authoritarian past is still to be overcome. The institutions of democracy remain fragile in many areas. The habits of freedom have not yet become universal.  Given these and other concerns, the government's stated goal of creating a guided democracy where the parameters of permitted dissent are significantly narrowed is very troubling indeed, as are the patterns of clear, gross and uncorrected human rights violations associated with the continuing conflict in Chechnya.  Mr. Speaker, you juxtapose these problems along with the trafficking problem, which remains a very significant problem where young Russian women are trafficked into forced prostitution and are abused in the United States and countries of the West as well as in Russia itself, we need to do more. This bill advances the ball and will be an aid to the democratic forces in Russia. It is a good bill and deserves the support of our colleagues.
