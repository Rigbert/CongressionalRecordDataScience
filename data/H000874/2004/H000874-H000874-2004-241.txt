Speaker, reclaiming my time, quoting the majority leader of last week, I do not see it that way. Clearly, as the gentleman has just pointed out, there is not agreement. I think we could get agreement if we could allow the minority to have somesense that they knew the parameters of where we were going, and I think that is all the minority is asking for. I think that is a fair request. But in any event, I think we ought to move this bill, and the gentleman's side is in charge and we would hope that would happen.  Mr. DeLAY. If the gentleman would yield, we can move this bill and move to conference as quickly as we want to. Unfortunately, in the other body, the minority wants certain concessions before they even go to conference. The reason for conference is everybody getting in a room between the two bodies and work out their differences, not make side deals or those kinds of deals outside the conference before they allow their body to go to conference. So when the minority decides to go to conference over in the Senate, we will go to conference and we will have a highway bill.
