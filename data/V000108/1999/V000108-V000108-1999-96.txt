Speaker, it is my great honor to take this moment to salute each and every distinguished individual who has served our country in the United States Armed Forces. Our veterans should be commended for their outstanding contributions and dedication; they have made America great.  Every November 11, Americans take the time to say thank you for the freedom we so often take for granted. This country should not forget that freedom has a price. The sacrifices of those men and women who serve in uniform, as well as their families, have secured our liberty. We also need to recognize those that have paid the ultimate price of giving their lives for something greater than themselves. However, we cannot wait any longer to tell the veterans of today that they are important. It is time to say thank you.  I am a strong supporter of the National World War II Memorial which is to be built in Washington, DC. The site, located between the Lincoln Memorial and the Washington Monument, was dedicated by President Clinton in 1995. The American Battle Monument Commission has been working hard to raise the money to build the monument, for which they expect to break ground on Veteran's Day 2000. This is supported by all veteran's associations, with the American Legion being one of the strongest supporters. Those interested in learning more about the efforts of the American Battle Monument Commission should contact their local veterans' organization.  I am proud of the thousands of veterans who reside in the First Congressional District of Indiana. Mr. Speaker, it is my hope that, on this Veterans Day, the residents of Valparaiso, Portage, Chesterton, Beverly Shores, Kouts, Burns Harbor, The Pines, Porter, Ogden Dunes, Dune Acres, Whiting, East Chicago, Gary, Lake Station, Hammond, New Chicago, Munster, Highland, Griffith, Hobart, Merillville, Dyer, Schererville, St. John, and Crown Point join us in recognizing these noble individuals.                          ____________________
