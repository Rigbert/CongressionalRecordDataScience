Speaker, I rise today to recognize the life of Raymond V. Walendzak, who served for over 20 years as the Chief of the Oregon Fire Department. Ray passed away in his Oregon home surrounded by his family on June 7, 2017.  Ray was born in Toledo, Ohio on September 27, 1941 to Joan and Stanley Walendzak. He played football and wrestled for Clay High School, from which he graduated in 1959. Ray continued his education at Findlay College, and then joined the United States Air Force and served in West Germany.  In 1968, Ray became an Oregon firefighter, where he began his service in the department's maintenance division, became a fire prevention officer, a district chief, and the assistant chief. Ray's father also served as a firefighter, which helped Ray bridge the differences between the different generations who were serving as firefighters. He appreciated the traditions of fire service, and also the need to modernize fire service with technology.  Ray became Fire Chief in 1986 and retired in 2007 for a total of 39 years of fire service. While Fire Chief, Ray made sure his department was current in training and technology, and made sure that the department had the right equipment. Ray has said that his biggest achievement was getting a fire training facility built in Oregon.  His passion about the fire-fighting community led him to serve its various organizations which include serving as the past president of the Ohio Fire Chiefs Association, Lucas County Fire Chiefs Association, Oregon Fire Fighters Association, Ottawa County Fireman's Association, and, for over 26 years, as past president and secretary of the Northwest Ohio Volunteer Fire Association.  He had received the Ohio Fire Chiefs' Association's Distinguished Service Award, and was inducted into the Ohio Fire Service Hall of Fame. Ray served as a Governor appointee to the State of the Ohio Board of Emergency Medical Services for 12 years. He was inducted into the Clay High School Hall of Fame in 2014.  Ray's commitment to his community did not just stop with the fire department--it extended through his service to his church, St. Ignatius, and through many of the civic organizations he was a member of: the American Legion Christ Dunberger Post No. 537, Knights of Columbus, Swiss Club at the GAF, and the Clay Boosters.  Ray dedicated an enormous amount of time to the youth of his community, where he was a longtime coach of youth baseball through the Oregon Recreation Department. Ray also served as a football coach at Oregon Clay High School. His dedication to the young members of his community led him to run for four terms on the Oregon Board of Education where he also served as Board President.  Ray will be remembered for his dedication to his chosen profession of Fire Fighting and for his dedication to the Oregon community at large.  We offer Ray's children, Dean, Donald and Dennis, his six grandchildren, his family and friends, our prayers and hope that they find comfort in the wonderful memories of what Ray had meant to each of the institutions that he served.                          ____________________
