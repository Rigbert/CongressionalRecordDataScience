 President, I am hard pressed to remember a time when I complimented a Democratic Governor for a great appointment, but I think I will have to say once again that the Governor of Wyoming made an outstanding selection in picking our new friend John Barrasso to replace our late and beloved colleague Craig Thomas.  I have heard a few maiden speeches. Actually, some people on the floor right now have made their initial Senate speeches in the last few years, but I believe we just heard one of the best.So I want to add, on behalf of all the Republican conference, our congratulations to Senator Barrasso on an outstanding opening address.  He pointed out that one of his specialties, which is greatly needed around here, is the fact he is a physician. That is extremely important. So your skill set, in addition to your leadership abilities, is certainly welcomed here in the Senate.  Mr. President, I congratulate our colleague from Wyoming on a great maiden speech and welcome him once again to the Senate.
