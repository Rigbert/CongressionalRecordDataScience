 President, on July 27, 1953, the armistice was signed, ending the Korean War. On Sunday, July 25, 1999, nearly forty-six years after the fighting stopped, the Veterans of Foreign Wars gathered for the dedication of a Korean War Memorial in Fultondale, Alabama. I rise today, on the 46th Anniversary of the armistice, to honor the military personnel who faithfully served our nation in this conflict.  Many have wrongfully called Korea ``the Forgotten War.'' I want Korean War veterans to know that we have not forgotten their brave service to our nation. The courage and dedication of American troops who fought on and around the Korean Peninsula should never be forgotten. The names of Pusan, Inchon, Chosin Reservoir and countless other locations where our forces fought against Communist aggression continue to bring pride to the hearts and minds of all Americans.  We are constantly and correctly reminded of the thousands of Americans who lost so much in the Vietnam War. Vietnam left such a lasting impression on our history that there has been a temptation to overlook our nation's first stand against the Communist threat in Asia. I am committed to insuring that we do not succumb to this temptation. We must not forget either the 37,000 Americans who gave their lives in Korea, or the 8,000 MIAs whose fate remains a mystery.  Those who served their nation from 1950-53 suffered much, but have left a proud legacy. The 8th Army, Far East Air Force, 1st Marine Division, and 7th Fleet proved their mettle in Korea and remain among the proudest names in American military history. The peace and prosperity which the people of South Korea enjoy today is the direct result of the gallantry of our Armed Forces. The 38,000 American personnel who currently serve in South Korea are guardians of the liberty which their predecessors fought to establish nearly half a century ago.  Mr. President, I ask you and my fellow United States Senators to join me in recognizing the members of the Armed Services who sacrificed so much in defense of freedom and democracy on the Korean Peninsula.                          ____________________
