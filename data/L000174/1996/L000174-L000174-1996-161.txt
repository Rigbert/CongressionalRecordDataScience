President, Vermont is a very small State in geography but extremely large in the quality of our people.  One of the very special people in Vermont is the Reverend John Nutting. For as long as I can remember my good friend John has been an outspoken and extremely effective advocate for those in Vermont who need him the most. An article in the Vermont Sunday Rutland Herald and the Sunday Times Argus speaks well of his lifetime service to our State. I ask that it be printed in the Record. Marcelle and I are among those privileged to have known and worked with John and I send him my very best as he opens his next career.  The article follows: [From the Sunday Rutland Herald and the Sunday Times Argus, June 16,                                  1996]        Activist's Activist Rev. John Nutting Leaving The Field                          (By Kristin Bloomer)       It's hot as heck under the studio skylights, and Rev. John      Nutting is hawking one of his paintings.       ``Name your price,'' he says, gesturing to a few of the      smaller watercolors in his second-story garage studio in      Waterbury. ``Any price.''       Nutting is walking around in his regular gear; a yellow      shirt, denim shorts, white socks and sandals. No one has said      anything about buying any paintings, but Nutting, 64, doesn't      seem to want to take no for an answer.       ``Come on. Don't be shy,'' he says with a broad, goofy      smile and turning toward some larger forest scenes. ``Hundred      and fifty bucks. I have an easy payment plan. You can pay me      in increments, whatever you want, `til it's all paid up.''       It's hard to say no to John Nutting, for 40 years one of      Vermont's most active and visible social activists.       ``He represents what has really been at the heart of what's      good in Vermont,'' says Scudder Parker, a former minister and      legislator who has known Nutting all his life. At a recent      retirement party for Nutting, Gustave Seelig, executive      director of the Vermont Housing and Conservation Board,      called him Vermont's leader of ``a conspiracy of good will.''       In addition to serving as a pastor and outreach minister      for the United Church of Christ since 1956 and more recently,      writing a 500-page book on the church's history (on sale for      $50), Nutting has served as president of the Vermont      Association for Mental Health, chair of the Vermont Human      Services Board, vice president of the Vermont Natural      Resources Council, Vermont Housing and Conservation Board      member, and consumer board member for the Vermont Program for      Quality in Health Care.       He will retire from his ministry July 1. A retirement party      for Nutting is set for Sunday, June 29, at the Second      Congressional Church in Hyde Park. He says he has ``no set      plans,'' aside from wanting to sell his house and move with      his wife to Colorado.       Nutting says he will have more time to paint--though      friends, colleagues and social advocates say they will miss      him.       ``Good'' Nutting exclaims. ``That's great I love it, I love      it. Weep! Weep! Worry! Gnash your teeth. * * * In a sense, I      want someone else to do it. I've done it. I see it now as      `the ministry of getting out of the way.' ''       ``Getting out of the way,'' however, may be hard for      Nutting.       ``I'm in massive denial,'' he admits.       Many of the organizations and programs he founded on behalf      of Vermont's poor will continue--he's made sure of that. For      example, Camp Bethany Birches--an annual, free, three-day      event for low-income people--has drawn as many as 200 people      annually for almost 20 years, and will continue to serve as a      tool for political empowerment Campers will still gather to      set the coming year's lobbying/legislative agenda.       ``You could say the theme through my ministry has been to      create a community out of diversity, to gather people who      don't naturally come together,'' Nutting says. ``The idea is      to create this new kind of community, that we all might be      one.''       ``The Hyde Park pastor never wanted to enter the ministry      until he was assigned to a congregation in West Dover for a      summer. In college he had wanted to be a physician, like his      father in Duluth, Minn., until senior year. Then he switched      to history and enrolled at Yale Divinity School, still      without a commitment to becoming a minister.       ``I was interested in figuring out the Monty Python thing--     the meaning of life,'' he says, smiling.       ``His greatest theological influences were Karl Barth, a      Swiss theologian who became a church leader in opposing the      Nazis, and Jurgen Moltmann, one of the leading proponents of      the ``theology of hope,'' a belief that God's promise to act      in the future is more important than God's action in the      past. Moltmann's belief that people should not withdraw from      the world but act in it to aid the coming of a better one      became Nutting's inspiration.       The list of programs he has helped initiate in Vermont      reads like a hippie agenda: Project Love, a series of evening      dinners geared toward low-income people; Partners in Service,      an adopt-a-social-worker program for churches; Vermont      Assistance Inc., a corporation that hired and funded a low-     income advocate when Vermont Legal Aid was prohibited from      lobbying the Legislature; Vermont Campaign to End Childhood      Hunger; Vermont Food Bank; Bridges to Peace, an exchange      program with the Soviet Union; and Neighbors in Need, an      organization that has distributed thousands of dollars worth      of emergency grants to low-income people. That's just to name      a few.       But Nutting, who started doing singing gigs in homes and      ski areas in the nineteen fifties, predates most hippies.       ``I had a Volkswagen bug, and I could get 12 folding chairs      in the back, my guitar, song books, three kids and my wife,''      Nutting said. ``We would go off to prayer meetings--the      traveling church.''       He also cut a record, called ``Songs of Lamoille County,''      which begins with a spoken ballad called ``Hills of Dover.''      Nutting's voice sounds uncannily like Pete Seeger's.       ``I came to Vermont in the summer of 1954, and I've been      here off an on ever since,'' Nutting narrates against the      guitar chords. ``That year, I lived with Ted Burchards on a      farm in the town of West Dover.''       The two worked the land together, Nutting says, and he      tells how he would listen from the house as Burchards mowed      the lawn and, invariably, hit a rock: ``He'd stop, swear a      few times, and then back it up and start over, go around that      rock. That's been the story of Vermonters almost ever since      they came here; they've had to back up and start over. It's      been the land that's made the difference.''                          ____________________
