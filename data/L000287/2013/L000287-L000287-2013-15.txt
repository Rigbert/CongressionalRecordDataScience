Speaker, I rise today to congratulate my constituent, Mr. William J. Stanley III, on his election as Chancellor of the College of Fellows of the American Institute of Architects. Mr. Stanley was elected to the College of Fellows' highest position in July at the American Institute of Architects National Convention in Denver, Colorado, and he will be inaugurated on December 12, 2013.  The American Institute of Architects (AIA) is a professional organization for architects in the United States. It is comprised of more than 79,000 licensed architects and associated professionals. The AIA's most prestigious honor is the designation of a member as a Fellow of the American Institute of Architects. A jury of peers awards Fellowship to members who have made contributions of national significance to the profession. Only about two percent of AIA members have been honored by appointment to the College of Fellows. Mr. Stanley's distinction not only recognizes his individual, architectural achievements but also elevates his significant, societal contributions.  Mr. Stanley is the founder and principal for design of the firm Stanley, Love-Stanley, P.C. In 1972, he became the first African-American graduate of Georgia Tech's College of Architecture. He began his private architectural practice in 1977 with Ivenue Love-Stanley, also an AIA Fellow and his wife of 35 years.  Literally, Mr. Speaker, you can find his legacy and beautiful innovative designs throughout Metro Atlanta, across the country, and around the world. His amazing work has been featured in numerous books and periodicals, and he has more than 40 award-winning projects to his credit. His designs in Atlanta include the Olympic Aquatic Center for the 1996 Centennial Olympic Games, the historic Fulton County Courthouse, Ebenezer Baptist Church, the John Hope Hall Science Research Facility at Morehouse College, the Reynolds Cottage at Spelman College, the Thomas Cole Research Center at Clark Atlanta University, the Catholic Center at Atlanta University Center, B.E.S.T. Academy at Benjamin S. Carson All Male Middle and High School, and the Nanotechnology Research Center at Georgia Tech. Outside Atlanta, his handiwork includes the Health & Physical Education Complex at Fort Valley State University in Fort Valley, Georgia; the L.H.O. Spearman Technology Center at Texas Southern University in Houston, Texas; and the Wilberforce Institute in South Africa.  Mr. Stanley has served on the National Board of the American Institute of Architects, as the South Atlantic Regional Director, and as past President of AIA Georgia. In 1995, Mr. Stanley was awarded the Whitney M. Young, Jr. Citation, one of the AIA's highest honors, presented to the country's most socially-conscious architect. In 1999, the Georgia chapter of the AIA bestowed upon Mr. Stanley the Bernard Rothschild Medal, the chapter's highest award. In 2011, AIA Atlanta presented him with its Ivan Allen, Sr., Trophy for sustaining the highest ideals of the profession of architecture through his contributions of service to the Atlanta community. He has also lectured and served as a visiting critic and jury member throughout the United States, Europe, and Africa.  Throughout his career, Mr. Stanley has frequently found himself in positions on projects where he was the first or the only African American with leadership or design responsibility. Even today, he says, ``the profession of architecture has very few persons of color among its ranks.'' Not only does Mr. Stanley's body of work inspire countless young architects of all backgrounds, but he has also broken down invisible barriers through his examples and actions. He is determined to open the door to generations of aspiring architects.  As Fellows, Mr. Stanley and Ms. Love-Stanley take their shared legacy to heart by mentoring countless young architects. Mr. Stanley has served in various leadership positions, affording him the opportunity to mentor young students of architecture academically and professionally, including two years as the President of the National Organization of Minority Architects (NOMA). For the past 27 years, Stanley, Love-Stanley, P.C. has sponsored a scholarship award and internship for the most improved architecture students of African descent. Every day, they inspire young people of color in the AIA, NOMA, and the Metro Atlanta community in general.  Mr. Speaker, architecture holds a special place in my heart. As you know, I love art and history in any form, and architects work so hard and so long to become experts in countless fields--arts, science, math, construction to name a few--in order to design, create, save, and restore beautiful masterpieces for countless generations.  I cannot fully express my great appreciation of Mr. Stanley and Ms. Love-Stanley's service and dedication to Metro Atlanta, nor how deeply proud I am of Mr. William J. Stanley III, FAIA, NOMA, for receiving this well-deserved honor.                          ____________________
