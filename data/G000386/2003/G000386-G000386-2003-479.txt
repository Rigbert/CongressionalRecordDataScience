 President, it has come to my attention that certain provisions of S. 1054 have engendered concern in the equipment leasing industry. I recognize that assets used by vital American industries are often lease-financed. It is not the intention of the Senate or Committee on Finance to impede legitimate leasing transactions. I wish to assure the markets that in any final legislation, the tax incentives utilized in leases that are considered appropriate under current law will be maintained.
