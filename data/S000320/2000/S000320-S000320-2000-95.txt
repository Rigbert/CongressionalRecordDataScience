 President, I rise today to introduce the Older Americans Tax Fairness Act. This legislation would eliminate--yes, eliminate--the unfair tax on Social Security benefits in this country.  Last week, this body, the Senate, took a historic step toward giving senior citizens more financial freedom and retirement security by passing legislation to repeal the earnings limit on Social Security benefits. We seized an opportunity to allow seniors to continue to work and contribute their skills and knowledge to the most vibrant economy in recent memory.  While the U.S. economy is currently reporting the lowest unemployment number in years, employers are finding that labor is difficult to come by and they are searching for ways to address this challenge. Increasingly, they are turning to senior citizens to fill the void. However, many seniors are finding that while they may want to work to better their standard of living or have to work to make ends meet, they are being hit by an additional tax burden, one that taxes their Social Security benefits--their retirement security, in other words--such that working, in many cases, is not financially beneficial to them.  When the Social Security program was first established by Congress, Congress did not intend for benefits to be taxed at all. In fact, Social Security benefits were exempt from Federal taxes for half a century. But because of a financial crisis within the program in the eighties and President Clinton's desire to fund new programs in 1993, seniors who earn a modest wage now find that anywhere between 50 and 85 percent of their Social Security benefits are taxed in America. This tax on Social Security benefits is misguided, I believe, and only acts to penalize hard-working and productive senior members of society. As workers, these senior citizens are taxed when they earn their money, as we all know, they are taxed when the Government returns it in the form of Social Security benefits, and if they are smart enough or lucky enough to save it to give it to their children or grandchildren, they will have to pay estate taxes, or a death tax, before anyone sees a penny, in a lot of cases.  Not only is this essentially double taxation to some of our most vulnerable citizens, our seniors, it is harmful to many seniors. Many seniors need to work in order to pay for costly health insurance premiums, prescription drugs, and other expenses which they incur as they grow older. For these seniors, working is not a choice, it is a necessity.  If we eliminate the tax on Social Security benefits in America, most seniors would have more disposable income to pay for many of these necessities of life. But rather than helping them, I believe we hurt them--that is, the seniors--by taxing their Social Security benefits, lowering their standard of living, and decreasing the amount of disposable income they have available to them.  What many fail to recognize is, working seniors continue to contribute to the economy not only in terms of knowledge and added productivity but by paying taxes on their earnings and paying into the Social Security trust fund without ever recognizing an additional benefit.  Clearly, the benefits seniors provide to our economy in terms of investment, knowledge, and skills far outweigh the minimal costs to the Treasury of repealing this unjust tax on Social Security.  This tax on Social Security benefits implies the Federal Government thinks senior citizens have nothing to contribute in the way of effectiveness, efficiency, experience, or knowledge to the workforce. You know and I know this is not true.  Senior citizens are our most valuable resource. They can provide knowledge, insight, and experience to our booming economy. And they do. We should treat them fairly and allow them to continue to earn and to save without imposing a discriminatory ``old age tax'' simply because they want to continue to contribute to society.  Responsible seniors--who plan for their retirement, who save and invest for the future, and who strive to leave something to future generations--are finding that it is just not worth it. At a time when we are trying to encourage savings and investment, it does not make sense to continue to tax Social Security benefits.  I am today encouraging my colleagues to join me in supporting the Older Americans Tax Fairness Act to bring additional fairness and freedom to the lives of millions of our most respected Americans.  Let's repeal the tax on Social Security benefits. Let's make it like it used to be. It is the right thing for the seniors in America.                                 ______                                       By
