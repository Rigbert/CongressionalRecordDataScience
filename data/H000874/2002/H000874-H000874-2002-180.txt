 Madam Speaker, I guess one aspect of serving for over 2 decades in the House you get to know some extraordinary people, some extraordinary people who have been sent here from around the United States to represent them in the House and in the Senate. Paul Simon is one of the most decent people with whom I have served either in the 12 years I was in the Maryland Senate or the 21 years I have been here. Paul Simon and his wife, Jean, who passed away some years ago, were two people who loved this country, who loved Illinois, and who loved this House. I am sure they loved the Senate as well. But Paul Simon was someone who brought great credit to democracy in his honesty, his integrity, and as the gentlewoman from the District of Columbia (Ms. Norton) has pointed out, his hard work on behalf of his constituents.  Americans were made prouder by this House of Representatives by knowing Paul Simon. Senator Simon, of course, became a candidate for President. He did not win the nomination, but he won the hearts and minds of literally millions of people around this Nation for his honesty and his deep sense of pride in this country and his deep concern for its people. I am proud to rise on this floor to pay tribute to Paul Simon and to say what an appropriate thing it is to name a Job Corps center for someone who cared so deeply about young people and about education, and about opportunities, and about hope.
