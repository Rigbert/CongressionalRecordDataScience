I will consider additional limitations on future U.S. military assistance if the Philippine Government fails to adequately address this issue.  Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, I support amendment No. 2708 that would prevent contributions to organizations that perform or promote abortion as a method of family planning. I was unable to be in attendance for this vote. However, if I had been present, I would have voted in favor of this amendment. Similarly, I support amendment No. 2707 that would prohibit funding of organizations that support coercive abortion. If I had been present, I would have voted in favor of this amendment.  I oppose amendment No. 2719 that would rescind the ``Mexico City Policy'' in its entirety, and, had I been present, I would have voted against it.  Life is the most important gift each of us is given, and I believe that abortion unfairly takes the innocent life of an unborn child who deserves protection, morally and legally. For this reason, I oppose abortion, except in the case of rape, incest or when the life of the mother is endangered.
