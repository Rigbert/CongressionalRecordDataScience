That is a reasonable question.  I would say to him, though, there is clearly, at least, a difference of opinion within the medical community as to medical necessity.  Dr. Koop, whom I respect very much and have worked with on a lot of issues, says: Never. The American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists says it is never the only thing you can do, but it may be the most appropriate thing to do for the health of the mother. And then, of course, you go on to say give us some examples. I think that is reasonable.  I ask we continue the debate at least to find out what those examples might be. That is reasonable.  But you have to say at this moment in time there at least is a difference of opinion, based on the letters introduced by the Senator from California, among medical professionals as to whether this is ever medically necessary or the most appropriate thing.  This raises a policy question. When we get to the point where doctors differ about the use of a procedure, is it appropriate, then, for the Senate to decide that we will ban a procedure, a medical procedure? That is what the Santorum amendment does. I think the Senator from Pennsylvania would concede it.  He attempts to ban the use of this procedure. Based on this letter I received from the American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists, to do so would say to doctors in some circumstances: You may not use the safest procedure for my wife, my daughter, my sister; Congress has banned that procedure. That is where I struggle with what the Senator from Pennsylvania is attempting to do.  I am not the doctor. I will not play one in the Senate. When I rely on doctors' opinions, they are at best divided on the question.  Let me address the second issue in relation to the Santorum legislation, and that is why we are doing this again and again. I do not question the sincerity of the Senator from Pennsylvania. I know his feelings on this subject are heartfelt, but I do question why we continue to bring this same legislation time and time again before the Senate, not because it is not important to the Senator from Pennsylvania and others, but, frankly, we have been getting readings from courts across America that this language he is proposing today is, on its face, unconstitutional.  We are spending our time in a debate over a bill which 19 States have stricken. These States have all tried to model some type of legislation based on his banning this procedure, and time after time, Federal courts have come forward and said, no, this is unconstitutional. The judges making the decisions are not so-called liberal jurists. You will find within their ranks appointees of President Reagan and President Bush, some very conservative jurists who say on its face this is not constitutional.  We took an oath as Members of the Senate to uphold that Constitution. There are times when interpretations can differ as to what that oath means. But in this case, the Santorum legislation before us has consistently been stricken by the courts, I believe, with only one exception, in the United States. Because of that, I have to ask this question, not questioning the Senator's sincerity, but why are we doing this? Why are we engaged in this debate over language which time and time again has been found unconstitutional and enjoined in my home State of Illinois and across the Nation?  This is a political exercise. It is not an attempt to pass a bill which will become a law. Forget for a moment the President's veto, if you will, and take a look at the merits of the legislation which time and time again has been found by the courts to violate the Constitution.  I would think that at this point in time, the author, whose feelings on this are heartfelt, would have changed his approach, changed his language, tried to address some of the constitutional questions, but it has not happened. We get a rerun every year. This is all about a record vote. This is all about raising this issue for public consciousness and a record vote of the Members of the Senate.  Some people want a scorecard. Some people want to use it politically. So be it. That happens around here. It is a shame that it happens on an issue of this gravity and importance because, honestly, I do believe there are things we can and should do which will address what I raised earlier. The feeling of the vast majority of Americans is that abortions should remain safe and legal and that restrictions on abortion should be in place only when necessary.  I am going to offer an amendment shortly which addresses my approach to this. As I said earlier, although I am honored to have nine cosponsors, nine other Senators who join me in this amendment--it is a bipartisan amendment--including the two Senators from the State of Maine, both Republican, I do not suggest it is the point of view of anyone other than ourselves. A vote will demonstrate whether I am right or wrong. I hope a majority sees this as a reasonable way to bring this contentious debate to a constitutional and fairminded conclusion.  If we do not, I predict we will have another vote next year on the unconstitutional Santorum legislation and perhaps in years in the future. But what will we have achieved? Contentious, painful debate with no resolution other than a political scorecard, and that for me is a troubling outcome.  I hope we can find a better way to do it because I believe there is a more sensible way. Let me tell you why I think there is.  I am going to offer an amendment which addresses not an abortion procedure but addresses a stage in pregnancy. It is a stage which is known as postviability, that moment in time where the decision is reached that the fetus can sustain survival outside the womb with or without artificial support. That is a moving target. Viability has changed because medicine has changed. Go into any neonatal intensive care unit in America and look at the size of the babies who are surviving. They are smaller than your hand, tiny little babies who are surviving.  Viability is a moving target, and it was a standard that was used in the Roe v. Wade decision. They said until that moment in time when that fetus is viable, could survive outside the womb, then there are certain legal rights in this country. But once viability is reached, those rights change, and we start acknowledging the fact that this fetus has now become a potential human being at birth. Roe v. Wade said we will define the laws of America based on viability.  The problem with the Santorum legislation, the reason why this bill and versions similar to it have been found unconstitutional time and again, is they refuse to accept this basic premise, the premise of Roe v. Wade, the premise of existing law in this country. They will not acknowledge that you should have a law banning a certain procedure only after viability. Each time it is stricken because it would, in fact, restrict the right to abortion before viability, before the fetus can survive. Court after court after court has stricken down State laws that have followed this Santorum model. Yet here we are again.  My amendment, the one which I will offer to the Santorum bill, accepts the Roe v. Wade premise that any changes which we are going to make have to be consistent with Roe v. Wade, and this is what it says: Any late-term abortion--that is, an abortion after viability--is disallowed or prohibited under law. We are talking usually 7th, 8th, 9th month of gestation. Those abortions are prohibited under law except in two specific cases: where continuing the pregnancy threatens the life of the mother or in those cases where continuing the pregnancy poses a risk of grievous physical injury to the mother. That is it. Grievous physical injury. There are those who disagree with me and say it should include emotional injury as well. I have drawn this line at physical injury.  Here is why I believe this is a reasonable standard: At this late stage in the pregnancy, the 7th, 8th, or 9th month, I believe Roe v. Wade tells us we have to look at the pregnancy in different terms. We are now postviability. We are now in a position where the fetus can survive. In those circumstances, what I have said is, the only reason legally you could terminate the pregnancy is if continuing it could literally kill the mother or continuing it could subject her to the possibility of grievous physical injury, which is defined in the amendment.  I go on. One of the objections customarily made is that if you allow a doctor to certify that a mother's life is at stake or she runs the risk of grievous physical injury if the pregnancy continues, you are playing right into the hands of the people who perform the abortions.  I have heard this argument so many times on the other side of the aisle. They argue doctors will say anything, the ones who perform these procedures, because they just want to make the money; they don't care.  I take an additional step. I require a second doctor to certify. You will have two doctors in those decisions, two doctors who come forward and say: If this pregnancy continues, this mother could die, or, if this pregnancy continues, this mother could risk grievous physical injury.  What risks do these doctors take if they are falsifying this information? Substantial fines and the suspension of their licenses to practice medicine are included in this amendment. It is very serious.  When we get to this stage in the pregnancy, I do believe the rules should be a lot stricter. That is why I am offering this as an alternative, one which I believe deals with some very fundamental questions.  S. 1692 is the bill offered by Senator Santorum. We have to ask ourselves several questions:  Should just one or all postviability abortion procedures be banned? Senator Santorum addresses one. The amendment I offer addresses all postviability abortion procedures.  No. 2: Should a mother's health be protected throughout pregnancy? Under the Santorum legislation that is before us, the mother's health is not an issue; only if her life is at stake could you engage in certain procedures. In the amendment I offer, it will protect a mother's life and a mother's health, the health in terms of the risk of grievous physical injury.  No. 3: Should a woman's constitutional right to choose before viability be preserved? There are differences of opinion on this. Perhaps the Senator from Pennsylvania has a difference of opinion. But Roe v. Wade said--and I agree--that previability, a woman, in consultation with her doctor, her husband, her family, and her conscience, has the right to make this decision. They protect that right in Roe v. Wade.  Oh, I know there are those who disagree. I respect that. I have been in lots of debates with them. That is where I come down. The reason the Santorum language has been rejected in court after court after court as unconstitutional is that, I believe, those on his side just do not accept the basic premise that, previability, this is a decision, a choice, to be made by a mother and her doctor.  As I said, I respect their position, but as long as they fly in the face of this basic principle, as long as they defy Roe v. Wade, with the language in the Santorum bill or the language in the State legislation, it will continue to fall time after time after time; we will continue to go through these political exercises; we will debate until our voices are gone. Then we will have a vote, and then we will go on to the next item of business. And, unfortunately, we will have missed an opportunity to do something that is meaningful. That is why I offer this amendment.  My amendment--I will go to the second chart--in comparison to the Santorum approach, can be spelled out with three specifics.  The Santorum approach bans only one procedure and allows others in its place. Make no mistake, if the Senator from Pennsylvania is successful someday in somehow enacting this legislation, he will not even tell you that is going to stop abortion from occurring. He deals with one procedure. My amendment bans all postviability abortions regardless of procedure.  The Santorum bill violates a woman's constitutional right to have her health protected. We preserve exceptions for life and health of the mother--narrowly defined.  The Santorum approach violates a woman's constitutional right to choose under Roe v. Wade before viability. My amendment specifically protects a woman's constitutional right to choose before viability.  Let me tell you what I am talking about when I talk about grievous injury. Grievous injury in this amendment is narrowly defined. And I quote:       a severely debilitating disease or impairment specifically      caused or exacerbated by the pregnancy; or       an inability to provide necessary treatment for a life-     threatening condition.  What could that be? You can all understand the first part: If continuing the pregnancy could kill the mother is clear. But what would the second one be? What if you diagnosed a mother, during the course of her pregnancy, with serious cancer? And what if you found continuing the pregnancy somehow compromised your ability to treat her for that cancer? That is what I am driving at here, to make sure it is serious and grievous, because we are literally talking about late-term, where I think the rules should be much stricter, as does the Court in Roe v. Wade.  My amendment also requires the attending physician who makes the call on these decisions to have the benefit as well--and it requires it--of an independent physician to certify, in writing, that in their medical judgment the continuation of the pregnancy would threaten the mother's life or risk grievous injury to her physical health.  I make an exception. I want to make it clear for the record. The certification requirement by the doctors can be waived in a medical emergency. But the physician would have to subsequently certify, in writing, what specific medical condition formed thebasis for determining that a medical emergency existed.  This legislation will reduce the number of late-term abortions. In contrast, the so-called partial-birth abortion ban will not stop a single abortion at any stage of gestation. The partial-birth abortion ban, by prohibiting only one particular procedure, will merely induce physicians to switch to a different procedure that is not banned by Senator Santorum.  Other procedures, such as induction, hysterotomy, or dilation and evacuation, can all pose a greater risk to the mother's health in certain cases. My alternative amendment will stop abortions by any method after a fetus is viable, except when medical necessity indicates otherwise.  Can we or should we try to define ``viability'' in this? I did not. And the courts have warned us: Don't even try. That is a medical judgment and, as I mentioned earlier, is a moving target. Viability today, in other words, fetal survivability today, is different from what it will be tomorrow or next month because these procedures are changing so dramatically in terms of saving the fetus and giving it an opportunity for life.  My alternative fits clearly within the constitutional parameters set forth by the Supreme Court for government restriction of abortion. In Planned Parenthood v. Casey, the Supreme Court reiterated Roe's determination that, after viability, the State may limit or ban abortion.  In contrast, the partial birth abortion ban, by prohibiting certain types of abortions before viability, breaches the Court's standard that the Government does not have a compelling interest in restricting abortions prior to viability.  Nineteen Federal courts in 19 States have enjoined, have stopped, the enforcement of the so-called partial-birth abortion bans Senator Santorum brings to the floor. The States include: Alaska, Arkansas, Arizona, Florida, Georgia, Idaho, Illinois, Iowa, Kentucky, Louisiana, Michigan, Missouri, Montana, Nebraska, New Jersey, Ohio, Rhode Island, Wisconsin, and West Virginia.  The Santorum bill is clearly unconstitutional. It will be struck down by the courts and have no lasting impact.  My alternative retains the abortion option for mothers facing extraordinary medical conditions, such as breast cancer discovered during the course of pregnancy, uterine rupture, or non-Hodgkins lymphoma, for which termination of the pregnancy may be recommended by the woman's physician due to the risk of grievous injury to the woman's physical health or life.  In contrast, the partial-birth abortion ban provides no such exception to protect the mother from grievous injury to her physical health.  To this point, this debate has been fairly general. To this point, with the exception of the Senator from California, in noting a few mothers who have been through experiences which they have shared publicly, we have talked in generalities.  The Senator from Pennsylvania has brought up a chart that is not a human depiction; it is an effort to put forth some drawing that depicts this procedure.  We have talked about the Constitution. But I will tell you this. My ambivalence over this issue--I was ambivalent when I first heard of this procedure--was put to rest because I sat down with real people, with mothers and fathers, husbands and wives, who faced medical emergencies. And when each of them told me their stories, I thought to myself: How can I possibly vote for the Santorum bill which would have endangered the life of the woman I am talking to? That is why I opposed his legislation in the past and will continue to do so. For the record, I will at this point tell two or three stories that have been a matter of public record and testimony before Congress and that I think demonstrate when you get beyond the theory of this debate and to the reality of it, life gets complicated, very complicated. It is easy to step back and make a moral decision involving other people, if you are not in their shoes. Listen to some of these and you will see what I mean.  This is the story of Coreen Costello from Agoura, CA. Coreen, her husband Jim and their son Chad and daughter Carlyn live in Agoura, CA. Coreen is a full-time stay-at-home wife and mom. She describes herself as a registered Republican and very conservative. She does not believe in abortion. In fact, she never thought she would be testifying before Congress supporting an abortion procedure, which is exactly what she did, on March 21, 1996, before the House Judiciary Subcommittee on the Constitution.  In March 1995, the Costellos were joyfully expecting their third child. However, when she was 7 months pregnant, Coreen began having premature contractions and had to be rushed to the hospital. After reviewing the results of the ultrasound, Coreen's doctor informed her he did not expect the baby to live. Coreen's child, a girl she had named ``Katherine Grace,'' was unable to absorb the amniotic fluid. As a result, the fluid was puddling into Coreen's uterus. Katherine Grace had a lethal neurological disorder and had been unable to move for almost 2 months. Her chest cavity was unable to rise and fall to stretch her lungs and prepare them for air. It was as if she had no lungs at all. Her vital organs were atrophying. Katherine Grace was going to die.  A perinatologist recommended terminating the pregnancy. All the doctors agreed. The Costellos' safest option was an intact D, the very procedure banned by this bill by the Senator from Pennsylvania. For Coreen and her husband, this was not an option. They chose to wait to go into labor naturally, which wouldn't be long. Due to the excess amniotic fluid, a condition called polyhdramnios, premature labor, was imminent. Despite the difficulty of knowing her baby was going to die, Coreen continued with the pregnancy. Over the course of the next few weeks, she saw many experts. If possible, the results were even grimmer than those she had earlier.  Her baby's body was rigid and wedged in a transverse position in her womb. Most babies are in a fetal position. Katherine Grace's position was exactly the opposite. It was as if she were doing a swan dive. The soles of her feet were touching the back of her head. Her body was in a U-shape. Due to swelling, her head was already larger than that of a full-term baby. Coreen, her mother, did daily exercises trying to change Katherine Grace's position so she could be delivered naturally.  Meanwhile, the amniotic fluid continued to puddle in Coreen's uterus. In the ensuing weeks, the condition had grown worse. Everyone started to fear for the mother's health. The mother could no longer sit or lie down for more than 10 minutes because the pressure on her lungs was so great. During one of her last ultrasounds, Coreen's doctor told her she could not deliver the baby via caesarean under the circumstances because the risk was too great. The doctor told Coreen there was a safer way for her to deliver. It was at this point Coreen realized this was not a choice anymore, that it was not up to her or her husband. There was no reason to risk leaving her children, Chad and Carlyn, motherless, if there was no hope of saving their new baby.  The Costellos drove to Los Angeles for a D They expected a cold gray building. They found a doctor and a staff willing to help them. It was at this point Coreen realized she had done the right thing. This was the safest thing for her. The fact this option was open to Coreen is important in this story. This option would be closed to her by the Santorum bill.  After the procedure, she went on to say Katherine Grace was beautiful. She was not missing part of her brain. She had not been stabbed in the head with scissors. She looked peaceful and she did not suffer. Because of the safety of this procedure, Coreen became pregnant again with another baby, after losing Katherine Grace. Thanks to the skill and compassion of the doctors and the procedure she was forced to use under these extraordinary circumstances, Coreen was able to have a healthy baby.  If you outlaw the surgical procedure, which the Santorum bill seeks to do, women such as Coreen will be denied the safest and best medical procedure they need under these emergency circumstances and their ability to have more children and the happiness in life which children bring us will be compromised severely.  The next story is about a lady who I met several times. I like her a lot. Hername is Vikki Stella. She is from my home State of Illinois, and she came to Washington, DC, to tell her story. Vikki, her husband Archer and their two daughters, Lindsay, age 11, and Natalie, age 7, live in Naperville, the western suburbs of Illinois right outside Chicago.  In 1993, Vikki discovered she was pregnant with a much-wanted son. Because she is diabetic, she had more prenatal tests than most pregnant women--amnios, ultrasounds, the works.  After the first round of tests, her doctor brought her in and said: Your pregnancy is disgustingly normal. Then at 32 weeks, she went in for another ultrasound, and everything fell apart--32 weeks into the pregnancy. Vikki's son was diagnosed, the one she was carrying, with nine major anomalies, including a fluid-filled cranium with no brain tissue at all. Vikki's much-wanted son would never survive outside her womb. The only thing keeping him alive was his mother's body.  The Stellas found the only answer they could: a surgical abortion procedure performed by a physician in Los Angeles. Because Vikki was diabetic, the controlled gentle nature of this surgery was much safer than induced labor or a C section. Vikki's son died peacefully and painlessly from the combination of steps taken in preparation for the surgery. He was brought out intact and the family was able to hold him and say their goodbyes.  That is a sad story about a couple that dearly wanted a baby and then found late in the pregnancy this terrible news that the baby would not survive and continuing the pregnancy could threaten the life of the mother. The procedure Vikki Stella used is the procedure banned by the Santorum bill, a procedure which her doctor thought was best for her.  There is an end to this story which is much happier. The ending to the story is that in 1995, Vikki gave birth to a little boy. They finally got their son. She came up to Capitol Hill with the little fellow in a stroller and a big smile on everyone's face.  It is hard for me, when I hear the intense rhetoric of this debate, to believe we are talking about the same thing. Some people refer to this as ``cruel'' and ``execution-like.'' This family didn't ask for this medical emergency. They wanted to have their little boy and be happy, as all of us. They found late in the pregnancy something terrible happened. When they went to the doctor, the doctor said, this is what you have to do, and they did it. As painful as it was, they did it. This bill says, no, this will not be a decision of the Stella family, the mother and father in a room with the doctor. This will be a decision of the Stella family in a room with the doctor and the Federal Government. If that doctor decides this procedure is the safest to save this mother's life or to give her a chance to have another baby, the Santorum law will say, no, the Government will make the decision--not a decision by a mother and father and a physician, a decision which has to be so painful and emotional.  The last story is about a lady who testified before the Senate Judiciary Committee in 1995 named Viki Wilson. She is a registered nurse, 18 years of experience, 10 in pediatrics. Her husband Bill is an emergency room physician--a nurse and a doctor.       We have three beautiful children: Jon is 10, Katie is 8,      and Abigail is in heaven with God.       In the spring of 1994, I was pregnant and expecting my      third child on Mother's Day. The nursery was ready and we      were very excited anticipating the arrival of our baby. Bill      had delivered our other two children, and he was going to      deliver Abigail. Jon was going to cut the cord and Katie was      going to be the first to hold her. She had already become a      very important part of our family.       At 36 weeks of pregnancy all of our dreams of happy      expectations came crashing down around us. My doctor ordered      an ultrasound that detected what all my previous prenatal      testing, including a chorionic villus sampling, an alpha      fetoprotein and an earlier ultrasound had failed to      detect, an encephalocele. Approximately two-thirds of my      daughter's brain had formed on the outside of her skull.  Viki Wilson said:       I literally fell to my knees from the shock.  This is a woman who was a nurse. When she heard this news, she literally fell to her knees from the shock.       I immediately knew that [my baby] would not be able to      survive outside my womb. My doctor sent me to a      perinatologist, a pediatric radiologist, and geneticist, all      desperately trying to find a way to save [the baby girl].  Her husband is a doctor.       My husband and I were praying that there would be some new      surgical technique to fix her brain. But all the experts      concurred. Abigail would not survive outside my womb. And she      could not survive the birthing process, because of the size      of her anomaly, her head would be crushed and she would      suffocate. Because of the size of her anomaly, the doctors      also feared that my uterus would rupture in the birthing      process, most likely rendering me sterile. It was also      discovered that what I thought were big, healthy, strong baby      movements were, in fact, seizures. They were being caused by      compression of the encephalocele that continued to increase      as she continued to grow inside my womb.  Viki Wilson asked:       ``What about a C-section?'' Sadly, my doctor told me,      ``Viki, we do C-sections to save babies. We can't save      [Abigail]. A C-section is dangerous for you and I can't      justify those risks.''       The biggest question for me and my husband was not ``is      [Abigail] going to die?'' A higher power had already decided      that for us. The question now was: [Am I going to die? Is the      mother going to die with the child?] ``How is she going to      die?'' We wanted to help her leave this world as painlessly      and peacefully as possible, and in a way to protect my life      and health and allow us to try again to have more children.  They used the procedure that would be banned by the Santorum legislation, which is before us today.  Mr. President, I give these three examples because I think it is important for all of us, despite our values and principles and the things we hold dear, to listen to people who struggle with these tragedies. I didn't think in any of those cases, the 5 or 6 women I have met who ever used this procedure to save their lives or protect their health, that I ever detected selfishness or greed. In every single case, these were mothers and fathers who wanted their babies. They had painted nurseries, and they had given them names. They were prepared for this joyful home coming that never happened.  This was not some casual decision. This was a decision that would haunt them for a lifetime. Why had they been singled out to lose that baby? Why did they have to go through the emotion and the trauma of all the decisions that came with that? I can't answer that. All I can do is sympathize with them for what they had to live through and to say to myself as a Senator, do you really want to say that you know better in terms of that mother's life and health? That is what the Santorum legislation says. It says we know better; we want to be the doctors here; we want to decide which abortion procedure you can use and which you can't use.  As I said at the outset, I am not a doctor, and I am not going to play one in the Senate. The doctors that I have relied on and the patients I have spoken to have led me to conclude that the Santorum approach is the wrong approach. I know that it will be an issue in every campaign forever. I have already faced that. I am sure I will face it again. But I am confident in my position that I can go back not only to my home State but even to my family where this is debated and explain to them why I have done what I am doing today.  This amendment I am offering is a sensible approach. It is one consistent with Roe v. Wade. It deals with late-term abortion, and it is one that is sensitive to a mother's health. It is one that attempts to protect that mother when she runs the risk of grievous physical injury.                           Amendment No. 2319              (Purpose: To provide a complete substitute.)
