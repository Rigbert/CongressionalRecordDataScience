Chairman, I rise today in support of H.R. 1534, the Private Property Rights Implementation Act. As a Member representing California, as well as a member of the Western Caucus, I am acutely aware of the need for legislation to protect priority property owners, especially those who have fallen victim to the current administration's ongoing war with the West.  H.R. 1534 is fair legislation. It simply allows property owners injured by Government action equitable access to the Federal courts. Currently, 80 percent of Federal property claims are thrown out of the court before their merits can be debated. With a statistic like that no one can argue that the current process is fair.  No matter what reason the Government has for restricting private property use, and there are many legitimate reasons, there is no excuse for denying landowners their day in court.  Mr. Chairman, I urge my colleagues to oppose all weakening amendments to H.R. 1534, especially the Boehlert amendment. This amendment would eliminate the bill provisions allowing landowners to take their appeals to Federal court. Instead, the amendment states it would help landowners get to court ``more quickly.'' But what does that mean, more quickly?  It currently takes an average of 9\1/2\ years for the process to be resolved. ``More quickly'' could mean 8 or maybe 7 years, but it does not make that timeframe any more acceptable. This is not an issue about taking power away from the States and localities, as the Boehlert amendment would lead my colleagues to believe. H.R. 1534 is about the rights of property owners to have their claims considered fairly and in a timely manner.  Mr. Chairman, I urge my colleagues to oppose the Boehlert amendment and support H.R. 1534.
