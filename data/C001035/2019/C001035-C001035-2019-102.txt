 This is a momentous occasion for me, a real milestone. I am proud of the fact that I have never missed a rollcall vote during the time I have been privileged to represent the great State of Maine in the Senate. There have been some close calls over the years, but fortunately I have been able to be present for each one. I realize that I have been blessed with good health and that when I had broken ankles, including one that required surgery, it fortunately happened over the Christmas break, so once again I was able to come back and not miss a vote.  But it is the embodiment of how seriously I take the responsibilities with which I have been entrusted by the people of Maine. Voting is a Senator's most solemn responsibility, and I feel strongly about making sure that my State is represented on each and every rollcall vote we take in this Chamber. It hasn't always been easy, but it is such a privilege and honor to represent the people of the great State of Maine.  I thank the majority leader, Senator McConnell, for acknowledging thismilestone in my tenure in the Senate and in my service to the people of Maine and this Nation.  Thank you, Mr. President.
