I say to the Senator, after the Senator gave his eloquent talk aboutthe safety problems that are out there throughout America right now, I came to the floor and talked about the safety core provisions that are in this bill, that if we are on an extension, as opposed to passing a bill, people are going to die. This is a life-or-death issue. I think you brought that out very forcefully, and I know it comes from the heart.  Mr. DeWINE. Mr. President, I appreciate what my colleague has done. The Senator from Oklahoma is absolutely correct that if this bill is passed, these provisions will be in there, as well as a lot of new construction that will save lives as well.
