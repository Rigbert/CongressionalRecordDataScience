 In the history of the U.S. Senate, only one Senator, Robert Carlyle Byrd, has served for 50 years.  A half century of service to his State, our Nation, this institution, and our Constitution. That is a remarkable achievement and one that we are not likely to see again for a very long time.  Senator Byrd is, of course, a great student of history and the author of the definitive work on the history of the Senate. In fact, one could say that Robert C. Byrd is Senate history.  Senator Byrd has served with (not under, with) 11 Presidents--very soon to be 12 Presidents.  He was the first U.S. Senator ever to cast 15,000 votes, and he is the only Senator ever to cast 18,000 votes.  Senator Byrd has served as majority leader, and held more leadership positions than any Senator in history.  To help put the length of his service in perspective, consider a few facts:  When Senator Byrd cast his first vote in the Senate--on January 8, 1959--his colleagues included Senators John Kennedy and Lyndon Johnson. Vice President Richard Nixon was the Presiding Officer. Hawaii was not yet a State. And a state-of-the-art computer would have taken up half of the space of this Chamber and had roughly the same amount of computing power as a Palm Pilot.  He has been a candidate for election 13 times--10 times as a candidate for the Senate and 3 times as a candidate for the House. He won every time.  And he has become perhaps the most popular political figure in West Virginia history. He was named West Virginian of the Century by the residents of his home State.  Senator Byrd's recent reelection to this body is a testimony to West Virginians' enduring respect and admiration for this proud son of ``the Mountain State.''  It is an honor to serve with this giant of Senate history, and to share with him this milestone. Again, I commend him and congratulate him.  Madam President, I yield the floor, and I suggest the absence of a quorum.
