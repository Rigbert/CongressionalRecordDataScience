President, Today I would like to pay tribute to Anthony Lewis who passed away on March 25. As a reporter covering the Supreme Court and through his books, including ``Gideon's Trumpet,'' Mr. Lewis shaped the way millions of Americans understand the role of the judiciary in safeguarding our democracy. He was truly an iconic figure in American journalism and he will be greatly missed.  Reading Anthony Lewis changed the way so many of us thought about justice in this country. He brought legal decisions to life and made clear the impact the law has on our lives. He made us aware of the humanity behind the technical legal arguments. Nowhere did he do this better than in ``Gideon'sTrumpet,'' his 1964 book about the Supreme Court decision in Gideon v. Wainwright. That landmark case affirmed a fundamental principle of our democratic society: that no person, regardless of economic status, should face prosecution without the assistance of a lawyer.  I have spoken countless times over the years about the importance of that decision. And each time, whether it was here on the floor of the Senate, in the Judiciary Committee questioning nominees to the Supreme Court, or in conversations with young law students, I have thought about ``Gideon's Trumpet'' and the powerful impact that book had on me.  In fact, on the 50th anniversary of the Gideon decision, which was just days before Mr. Lewis's death, I introduced the Gideon's Promise Act, a bill intended to breathe new life into that seminal case and ensure the fairness of our criminal justice system for all participants. Much of what I said about the anniversary of Gideon, and the work that remains, finds its roots in my days as a young attorney when I read ``Gideon's Trumpet'' and was moved both by the unfairness it revealed of a system that allowed poor people to be jailed without a lawyer, and the powerful equalizing impact a courageous Supreme Court can have when it is willing to stand up for those who are marginalized.  When I was a young law student, my wife and I had an opportunity to have lunch with Justice Hugo Black shortly after he wrote the majority decision in that case. It was a powerful experience. He recognized that the Sixth Amendment's guarantee to counsel in a criminal case was fundamental to a fair trial. He called it an obvious truth. And I know from my days as a prosecutor how right he was.  Now, as we pause to remember Anthony Lewis and his contributions to our understanding of the right to counsel and so many other fundamental principles of American democracy, it is also fitting that we acknowledge that the promise made in Gideon remains unfulfilled. In too many courtrooms it is better to be rich and guilty than poor and innocent. The rich will have competent counsel, but those who have little often find their lives placed in the hands of woefully overburdened public defenders or underpaid court-appointed lawyers who are inexperienced, overworked, inept, uninterested, or worse.  And now our Federal public defender system, long held out as the gold standard of indigent defense, is being hobbled by sequestration. In New York, the Federal Defenders Office is being forced to furlough each of its 30 lawyers for 5\1/2\ weeks by the end of September, resulting in delays in even the most significant terrorism cases. Chief Judge Loretta Preska of the Southern District of New York called these cuts ``devastating.'' The head of the Federal Defenders Office stated: ``On a good day, we're stretched thin. . . . Sequestration takes us well beyond the breaking point. You simply can't sequester the Sixth Amendment.'' He is right.  I am hardly alone in my concern over this fundamental American right. Last month, four leading advocates for fairness in the criminal justice system, including former Vice President Walter Mondale, sent a letter to President Obama urging him to create a bipartisan commission on the fair administration of justice for the indigent accused. I applaud their efforts and I believe Anthony Lewis would have too.  Through his reporting on the Supreme Court and our Nation's civil rights challenges, Anthony Lewis opened the eyes of millions of Americans to the power of law and judges to change lives. He helped shape my thinking as a young lawyer, and I hope his work will continue to be an inspiration for the generations to come. Our democracy will be stronger for it.  I ask that a copy of an article dated April 8 be printed in the Record at the conclusion of my statement.  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in the Record, as follows:                [From the New York Times, Apr. 8, 2013]           Citing Cuts, Lawyers Seek Relief in Terrorism Case                          (By Benjamin Weiser)       Federal public defenders who are representing a son-in-law      of Osama bin Laden on terrorism charges urged a judge on      Monday not to hold an early trial because automatic      government budget cuts were requiring furloughs of lawyers in      their office.       The request, which seemed to take the judge, Lewis A.      Kaplan, by surprise, follows requests that five or six      federal judges in Manhattan have received from public      defenders to be relieved from cases in the wake of the      automatic cuts, known as sequestration, said Loretta A.      Preska, the chief judge of the Federal District Court in      Manhattan.       ``It's devastating,'' Judge Preska said late Monday. She      praised the work of the federal defenders and said their      replacement in cases with publicly paid court-appointed      lawyers would probably lead to delays and higher costs.       Judge Kaplan said in court on Monday that he was      considering holding the trial of bin Laden's son-in-law,      Sulaiman Abu Ghaith--a onetime Al Qaeda spokesman charged      with conspiring to kill Americans--in September. After the      defense requested a later date, he said: ``It's extremely      troublesome to contemplate the possibility of a case of this      nature being delayed because of sequestration. Let me say      only that--stunning.''       The judge did not set a trial date, saying he would      consider the request, but the exchange shows how the forced      budget cuts are beginning to have an effect on the      administration of justice in federal courts in New York.       About 30 trial lawyers with the federal defenders office      handle around 2,000 criminal cases a year in federal courts      in Manhattan, Brooklyn and other locations, according to      David E. Patton, who heads the office.       The forced cuts, he said, will mean each lawyer in the      office will be furloughed for five and a half weeks through      the end of September, when the fiscal year ends.       ``On a good day, we're stretched thin,'' Mr. Patton said.      ``Sequestration takes us well beyond the breaking point. You      simply can't sequester the Sixth Amendment.''       ``Investigations have to be conducted,'' Mr. Patton added.      ``Evidence must be reviewed. Law must be researched. Those      things don't just happen by themselves.''       In seeking the delay, lawyers for Mr. Abu Ghaith, who was      arraigned in March, cited the need for overseas      investigation, the translation of voluminous materials and      other issues. ``We would urge the court to find a later      date,'' one lawyer, Martin Cohen, said.       Judge Preska said that lawyers had been allowed to leave      one of the cases in which the furlough problem had been      cited; the issue is pending in the others.       Newly appointed lawyers would have to ``get up to speed''      on their cases, and because they are paid by the hour      (federal defenders are salaried), the public would probably      end up paying more, Judge Preska said. ``There's no      resolution,'' she said. ``Time is of the essence, and we're      very, very concerned.''                          ____________________
