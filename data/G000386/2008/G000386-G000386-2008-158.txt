 President, for the past few weeks, I have been leading an effort to dispel the myths surrounding the impact of biofuels policies on our food prices. You may remember that back on May 15, I came to the Senate floor to announce to my colleagues that the campaign to smear ethanol is a well-funded and seemingly well-coordinated campaign. It is being led by none other than the Grocery Manufacturers Association.  In the weeks since that floor statement, I have been using every opportunity I can to beat back this smear campaign and inject the facts into the debate.  Biofuels are being scapegoated for rising wheat prices, even though the 2007 crop was the largest planted in 4 years. Biofuels are being blamed for the increased price of products such as rice and bananas, which have no correlation to corn production or our biofuels policies.  According to economists across the administration, biofuels have caused a tiny fraction of the increase in global and domestic food prices.
