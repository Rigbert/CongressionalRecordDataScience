He is recognized as one ofthe foremost historians of this country and certainly of the Senate. He is so right: We are talking about amending the Constitution, and nobody is here to talk about it.  I say to my friend from New York, there have been 11,000 proposed amendments to the Constitution that have been brought before the Congress. Article V speaks of amending the Constitution when necessary.  The Senator from New York is a far greater student of history than I, but does he think that by any stretch of the imagination--we have had civil wars; we have fought in world wars; we have gone through Presidential assassinations; we have done all these things--we have ever come close to 11,000 times in the history of this great Nation where it has been necessary to amend the Constitution?
