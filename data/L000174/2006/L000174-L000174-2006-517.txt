I supported that amendment. It called for replacing and repairing barriers in certain border towns.  Now Senator Sessions is offering an amendment to correct what Senator Kyl had included in the Judiciary Committee bill and that was incorporated in the underlying bill now before the Senate. I had thought that the Senator from Arizona had consulted with the administration and, in particular, with the Department of Homeland Security before offering his amendment and that the committee action would have been sufficient. Apparently Senator Sessions and his cosponsors, which include a number of Republican Senators on the Judiciary Committee, think that the Kyl amendment was inadequate. They say that their discussions with Secretary Chertoff, the Border Patrol, and Homeland Security lead them to seek a needed change and correction.  As Senator Kennedy noted, the fact may well be that the Secretary and the administration have all the legal authority they need without this amendment to do what they think needs to be done. That they have not done more before now was not for the lack of authority as far as I know. Nor has Congress refused to provide such authority as may have been necessary or that has been requested by the administration.  On this point, I quote a column from today's Roll Call authored by Norman Ornstein. He concludes:       For nearly five years, we drastically have underfunded our      first responders while failing to coordinate plans across      state and regional lines. We still do not have interoperable      communications among first responders. We have underfunded      border security despite warnings that immigration issues were      intertwined with basic security issues. No wonder this issue      has exploded on the national scene, and no wonder we are      seeing this belated move to ``solve'' the problem with a      National Guard presence.       Where has Congress been in all of this? For nearly five      years, absent without leave. It's been AWOL on oversight,      AWOL on serious legislation to deal with either the lapses in      the department or the broader problem of border security,      AWOL on serious deliberations about broader immigration      issues, AWOL on seeking bipartisan solutions for difficult      problems that need some consensus in the middle. And it's      been worse than AWOL in making sure that we have institutions      of governance after the next massive attack. Congress'      approval rating is 22 percent? That seems too high.  Sadly, there is much truth in what Mr. Ornstein writes. During Republican congressional control they have slavishly taken their cues from the Republican administration and defended its every misstep.  With respect to the Sessions amendment I have questions, questions about its value and whether it is meant to signal some kind of ``fortress America'' approach to real world problems. I also have questions about its cost and how the Senator from Alabama intends to pay for its additional costs. He said during the course of the debate that he estimated that it would cost an additional billion dollars. On the day that the President is signing into law billions of dollars of additional tax breaks for the wealthiest Americans, I wonder whether we might not have been wiser to set aside a billion dollars from those tax breaks being provided millionaires to help fund enforcement measures for America's border security.  The Congressional Budget Office says that this bill will require more than $54 billion in expenditures. The Sessions amendment will add additional costs. Is it several hundred million dollars, a billion dollars, as the Senator from Alabama has estimated, or more? The Senator from Texas has said that this bill is merely a downpayment on what it will cost to secure our borders. I wonder what the Senator from Texas believes this will eventually cost. I wonder how he intends to pay for these measures. Under Republican leadership we are already running the largest annual deficits in history and have turned a $5 trillion surplus into a projected debt of somewhere between $8 trillion to $10 trillion.  Earlier today the Republican chairman of the Homeland Security Appropriations Subcommittee came to the Senate to make an extraordinary statement. I am sorry he spoke to an almost empty floor. I urge all Senators to consider his remarks. The Senator from New Hampshire is someone I have worked with to provide interoperable communications to law enforcement along the shared border of our States. He is one of the most straight-talking Members of the Senate and he demonstrated that again today. He said today that the $1.9 billion capital account he had sought to establish for border security improvements is gone, that it has been transferred to operational needs. In addition, he expressed regret for having had to structure his amendment to the emergency supplemental appropriations bill to take funds from military accounts in order to allocate it to border security.  In that regard, the Democratic leader has been proven right in his amendment that would have provided the $1.9 billion without taking funds from our troops. Now the Senator from New Hampshire says that he understands that his amendment will not survive the House-Senate emergency supplemental appropriations conference. The Democratic leader was right to offer his amendment and the Senate would have been wiser had it adopted it to fund border security with real dollars. As matters now stand, if Senator Gregg is correct, it appears there is no money in the budget or available to fund these measures. Let us not make false promises to the American people about border security. Let us not call for measures that we will not be able to pay for but wish to trumpet.  I ask unanimous consent that the article to which I referred be printed in the Record.  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in the Record, as follows:                     [From Roll Call, May 17, 2006]       Congress' Neglect of Immigration Is Why We're Stuck Today                          (By Norman Ornstein)       Why do we need members of the National Guard patrolling our      borders? It is a question, frankly, that doesn't have a very      edifying answer. The National Guard is spread way too thin as      it is, and I am not sure how many members are eager to go      from two tours of duty in Iraq and Afghanistan to a new tour      in Nogales.       If the response to that is, ``Well, we are just sending      token numbers''--6,000--the counter-response is, ``Why mess      with the Guard for token purposes when the results will      include sharper tension with Mexico over the issue of      militarizing the border and fodder for Hugo Chavez and our      other hemispheric adversaries to dump on the imperialist and      militaristic USA?'' Then there's the issue of whether      anything in the training of the National Guard prepares them      for border patrol work, whether on the front lines or back in      the office doing paperwork.       Of course, we know the less edifying answers. The president      needed a symbol of his determination to toughen the borders      in order to pacify his base and to get conservatives in      Congress to consider the immigration plan advanced by Sens.      John McCain (R-Ariz.) and Edward Kennedy (D-Mass.) to      legalize many of the illegals who have been in the country      for years without having to expel 12 million people or more.       This is necessary because the House Republican leadership      will not move a bill that has broad bipartisan support if it      comes at the expense of losing even a sliver of the party's      ideological base. There is another reason. We need some      supplements for the undermanned border patrol forces who are      themselves spread way too thin. The failures of the border      patrol--not just caused by inadequate numbers but also by      dysfunction within their agency and a continuing set of      problems with coordinating responsibilities with federal      customs and immigration officials--have led to serious public      unhappiness in border states, especially Arizona, New Mexico      and Texas, and a need for some kind of governmental response.       I find it more disturbing to dwell on the dynamics of this      issue after seeing the film United 93 over the weekend. It is      a superb movie, and the one-word description of it given by      virtually everyone who has seen it--``harrowing''--is      accurate. But to a student of government, the harrowing part      goes well beyond reliving the Sept. 11, 2001, terrorist      attacks and watching a graphic portrayal of a suicide-     hijacking mission. The movie portrays a government in near-     chaos, with the limited communication between the Federal      Aviation Administration, air traffic controllers and the      military filled with misinformation and nearly inexplicable      delays. The military was unable to scramble any significant      force to protect the airspace around Washington, D.C., for a      long time after it became clear that the capital--and the      Capitol--were obvious targets of the terrorist attack.       Perhaps others left the theater with a belief that the      chaos was understandable; after all, who would have imagined      a broad-based, concerted effort by suicidal terrorists to      kill thousands of people in coordinated attacks on American      soil? Most moviegoers probably felt a small sense of relief      that at least now, more than four years later, we have      learned some lessons, beefed up the communications among      these agencies and the rapid response necessary when      another attack occurs. But I did not.       The response by the federal government since Sept. 11 has      been reluctant, halting and generally ineffectual in most      areas of homeland security. I have no reason to believe that      we have had a systematic effort to improve communications and      coordination--not just between the FAA and the Pentagon but      among other agencies that might be on the front lines in the      next attack, which is not likely to come from commercial      airliners.       I also know that the creation of the Department of Homeland      Security--long after it was clear that the office setup in      the White House was inadequate to the task--was done in a      textbook fashion, specifically a textbook showing how not to      do a major reorganization. Instead of focusing on the      problems in border security by integrating the jobs of border      patrol, customs, immigration and the Coast Guard, and instead      of focusing intensely on crafting a strong bureaucratic      culture around their shared missions, the White House and      Congress brought together 20 disparate units in a massive      reorganization that hasn't come close to working and will      take many more years to become functional.       We saw what happened with Hurricane Katrina, and the      problems with the Federal Emergency Management Agency are      manifest in the border area and many others. We are woefully      unprepared to deal with a biological attack, a pandemic, a      massive natural disaster or another broad-based terrorist      attack. One is coming--we just don't know when. United 93      underscores the ominous reality that al-Qaida takes a long      time doing its planning before making its move. It is surely      planning the next one as I write.       For nearly five years, we drastically have underfunded our      first responders while failing to coordinate plans across      state and regional lines. We still do not have interoperable      communications among first responders. We have underfunded      border security despite warnings that immigration issues were      intertwined with basic security issues. No wonder this issue      has exploded on the national scene, and no wonder we are      seeing this belated move to ``solve'' the problem with a      National Guard presence.       Where has Congress been in all of this? For nearly five      years, absent without leave. It's been AWOL on oversight,      AWOL on serious legislation to deal with either the lapses in      the department or the broader problems of border security,      AWOL on serious deliberation about broader immigration      issues, AWOL on seeking bipartisan solutions for difficult      problems that need some consensus in the middle. And it's      been worse than AWOL in making sure that we have institutions      of governance after the next massive attack. Congress'      approval rating is 22 percent? That seems too high.
