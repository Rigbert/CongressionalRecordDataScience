 I would like to respond to the Senator from Utah.  What concerns me is somebody writes a terrorist handbook. We have that case. And they tell somebody how to steal; how, in detail, to put together, let us say, a light bulb bomb.  You come to them and say, ``You violated a criminal law.''  They say, ``I did not intend this to be used for crime.''  Then the comeback is, ``You should know it is going to be used for crime because that is the only purpose for a light bulb bomb. It is the only purpose for a toilet paper bomb, for a candy box bomb.''
