Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.  Mr. Speaker, I am not a New Yorker, but what happened at the World Trade Center in New York could have happened anyplace in the country, because terrorism knows no boundaries. It could have happened in Milwaukee or San Francisco or Atlanta or anyplace else.  Americans throughout our land, as well as people around the world, witnessed in horror what unfolded on Tuesday morning. First one building was hit, then a second building was hit, then both of the buildings collapsed, and there were hundreds or thousands of people who were in them.  But over and above everything, the public safety officers in New York, the firefighters and the police officers, were unflinching in doing their duty, which was to try to save lives and to protect property. Over 200 of them are now reported as missing and presumed dead. We could be talking about the Milwaukee police and fire department or San Francisco police and fire department or the police and fire department of any community in the country, but New York was the city that was hit.  It is our responsibility to make sure that the families of the fallen receive the benefits that the Federal Government has extended to them for over 30 years as quickly and as promptly as possible. They will suffer enough pain with the loss of their loved ones. They should not be financially strapped because paperwork does not get done quickly.  This bill is the right thing to do. It is the right thing to do for New York today, and it would be the right thing to do for public safety officers who perish in large numbers as a result of a tragedy anyplace else in the country at any time in the future.  Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.
