Speaker, this is, plain and simple, an attempt to obfuscate the facts. And for those around here who supported the balanced budget amendment, for those around here who are voting for these appropriations bills, slashing student loans, and they are going to cut Medicare, there are alternatives. The alternatives are to raise and maintain revenues.  Mr. Speaker, if my colleagues do not vote for this motion to instruct, they will be ceding another $15 billion of revenues, royalty giveaways, to companies that are full well prepared to make profits under the existing scheme, but they are happy to take an additional $15 billion of taxpayers' money. They are always happy to take more of the money that is due to the taxpayers.  Mr. Speaker, it is time to have true fiscal responsibility in this House, to stop BS'ing the people about the issue here. The issue is not development or nondevelopment or national security. We all agree they should be developed, but we do not need to give away $15 billion to do it.
