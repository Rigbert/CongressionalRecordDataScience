We would like to have rough parity in terms of the time given to both sides of the aisle to explain this matter, but we are not going to limit or even try to limit, under the standing rules, any speech by the other side.  Mr. McCAIN. I thank my friend. I ask we keep track of the timing on both sides as both sides talk so we can try to make sure there is parity on timing throughout the day. Obviously, it will be dictated by the number of speakers who want to speak on either side, but we should try to preserve parity throughout the day.  I thank the Senator from Illinois.
