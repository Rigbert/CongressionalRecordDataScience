 President, I yield myself such time as I may consume within my allotted time.  Mr. President, before I begin on this amendment, I want to just tell you, and all of my colleagues who may be listening back in the offices, that while the last vote was going on a colleague of ours, Senator Wendell Ford, came to the floor and said, ``Let me show you something my staff just downloaded from the Internet.'' While you were all voting on whether or not to prohibit people from being able to teach people how to make bombs knowing or intending they be used to violate the law, let me read what was downloaded. This is roughly at 3:20 p.m. today.       Attention all Unabomber wannabes. You will first have to      make a mild version of thermite. Use my recipe but substitute      iron filings for rust. Mix the iron with aluminum filings in      a ratio of 75 percent aluminum, 25 percent iron. This mixture      will burn violently in a closed space (such as an envelope).      This brings us to the next ingredient. Go to the post office      and buy an insulated (padded) envelope. You know, the type      that is double layered. Separate the layers and place the      mild thermite in the main section where the letter would go.      Then place magnesium powder in the outer layer. There is your      bomb!!       Now to light it. This is the tricky part, and hard to      explain.  I am still quoting now.       Just keep experimenting until you get something that works.      The fuse is just that torch explosive I have told you about      in another one of my anarchy files. You might want to wrap it      like a long cigarette, then place it at the top of the      envelope in the outer layer (on top of the powdered      magnesium). When the torch explosive is torn, or even      squeezed hard, it will ignite the powdered magnesium (sort of      a flash light) and then it will burn the mild thermite. If      the thermite did not blow up, it would at least burn your      enemy (it does wonders on human flesh).  You all just voted to keep that legal--to keep that legal--because of the fear, apparently, or concern that we would not be able to convince 35 recalcitrant House Members to make that illegal. That is what you did. That is what you did.  I ask unanimous consent that this be printed in the Record along with the baby food bomb by Warmaster, also taken off the Internet.  For all of you who are concerned about the pornography on the Internet, as I am, how do you explain banning that, which we should, and not this? Pornography deforms the mind. These bombs burn the flesh.  I ask unanimous consent that these recipes available to our children and the demented people out there in the public, the few that exist, be printed in the Record to know what we have just done.  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in the Record, as follows:                    Attention All Unabomber Wannabes       You will first have to make a mild version of thermite.

These things are so powerful that they      can DESTROY a car. The explosion can actually twist and      mangle the frame. They are extremely deadly and can very      easily kill you and blow the side of the house out if you      mess up while building it. Here's how they work.       Go to Sports Authority or Hermans sport shop and buy      shotgun shells. It is by the hunting section. At the Sports      Authority that I go to you can actually buy shotgun shells      without a parent or adult. They don't keep it behind the      little glass counter or anything like that. It is $2.96 for      25 shells.       Now for the hard part:       You must cut open the plastic housing of the bullet to get      to the sweet nectar that is the gunpowder. The place where      you cut it is CRUCIAL. It means the difference between it      blowing up in your face or not.       You must not make the cut directly where the gunpowder is      or it will explode. You     must cut it where the pellets are. When you cut through it,      empty the pellets out and the white stuff (called buffer)      that surrounds the pellets. There is a layer of wadding that      separates the gunpowder from the pellets and that must be cut      through VERY CAREFULLY! Don't use a drill! Whatever      instrument you use (knife, screwdriver, etc.) you must work      very slowly and don't make big movements. Friction can set it      off. You now have a nice supply of gunpowder.       I have also tried this with Quail Shot. The only difference      between buck and quail is that quail has very small pellets      and buck has big ones.       It is strange but almost all shotgun shells have a      different interior. Some have very powdery powder and some      have flakes for powder. Also some have plastic wadding and      some have cardboard. Usually the smaller the pellets the less      gunpowder and more cardboard wadding. The smaller pellet      sizes are the ones with the flakes. Also that white stuff      called buffer is only used in heavy buckshot and is not found      in Quail and Dove shot or other bullets with small pellets.       [Contents deleted from original.]       I would like to stress once again that this is EXTREMELY      dangerous and can very easily kill you. I've done this once      and it scared the------out of me and I am never doing it      again. These are very destructive. If you are stupid enough      to do it, wear two or three pairs of safety glasses and thick      clothes to protect you from the glass. The------can still      hurt you from 100 feet away. The blast is also deafening. But      if you want to spread some choas, this little bomb is the way      to go.       Did I mention that this is also highly illegal?       Unimportant stuff that is cool to know:       They rate shotgun shells by two numbers. Gauge and pellet      size. With gauge the smaller the number the bigger the bullet      (12 gauge is bigger than 14 or 16 gauge). The biggest I know      of is 10 gauge, but that is very hard to find. The other      number is the pellet size. The bigger the pellet the less can      fit in the bullet. The advantage of a big pellet is that it      is more powerful but cover an area very scarcely. The smaller      pellets have a much lower velocity but there are many more      pellets in the shell. Here is how the system goes: 000      buckshot (triple 0) is the very biggest. There are only 10      pellets in it but they are huge. Then comes 00, 0, 1, 2, 3,      4, 5, 6, 7. Number 7 has about 200 pellets in it. It is used      for squirrels and small birds. Generally the 000, 00, 0, 1,      2, 3, and 4 have the best powder. Anything higher up has this      weird flakey gunpowder that doesn't work so well.       Some Other Things That Smart People Do That Don't Want To      Get Killed:       Other things you can do with the powder other than use it      in a babyfood jar is to use it in a smaller jar. You will get      less bang out of it but it is much safer. Some good jars to      use are very small makeup jars and those little TESTORS paint      bottles. The paint bottles have thick glass and it might be      more dangerous. Another thing you can do with the powder is      wrap it up tightly in some paper and stick a fuse in it (it      is easier to put the fuse in before you wrap the paper).
