Speaker, I wish to voice my strong disapproval with the French Government's nuclear testing program. I join with many of my colleagues--and most the world community--in protesting the detonation of six French nuclear weapons in the South Pacific. That is why I am joining the congressional boycott of the French President's visit to Congress.  French President Jacques Chirac will appear February 1 before a joint session of Congress. I can not of good conscience attend. France and the United States have a proud relationship of cooperation extending back to the beginning of our Nation. However, France's conduct in the South Pacific can not be justified. Exploding nuclear weapons in pursuit of further weapons development contradicts the view of 175 nations--including France and the United States--who signed the Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty. It also needlessly endangers the environment and people of the region.  Just last week, France acknowledged the presence of radioactive iodine in the lagoon near the Mururoa test site. Despite their declaration that the tests blast are perfectly safe, we have no way to know if this is true. Since the French Government refuses to allow independent assessment of the environmental impact of these nuclear explosions, I must remain suspicious. Are the people who live in the South Pacific threatened by nuclear poison in their region of the world? What will the ecological and human health threats 10, 20, or a 100 years from now?  Although the Clinton administration has officially denounced the French nuclear testing program, its actions hardly match its rhetoric. I urge the White House to put real pressure on the Chirac government. Let us not forget our responsibility in this matter: the United States has long supported the French nuclear weapons program.  I must take special exception to the U.S. decision to allow French military aircraft to flying to the South Pacific test site the use of U.S. airspace. How can the world take seriously a United States criticism of the French nuclear weapons testing program when the United States refuse to take even the most basic action to resist the French action. The only assurance Congress can get from the U.S. State Department is that no nuclear materials are being transported ``according to the best of our knowledge.'' This hardly represents strong scrutiny by our Government.  Now that the French Government has ended its series of nuclear detonations, I call on President Chirac to firmly commit his nation to end all future test. At the very least, France should declare the permanent closing of the South Pacific test site. France should also clean up the nuclear mess if left behind and allow independent monitoring the area. It is the least they can do for the South Pacific peoples who will have to live with the legacy of decades of nuclear weapons testing.  The rationale for nuclear testing ran out years ago. If the world governments won't stop this cold war relic now, then when? I look forward to the recognition by France that their ongoing nuclear weapons testing program was simply wrong. Perhaps we can now move toward a international ban on all future such explosive tests. The United States must continue to press for a comprehensive ban on all such future nuclear test explosions. And France must become an active player in these negotiations.  It is my hope that a change in the behavior of France's Government will allow me to participate in Mr. Chirac's next visit to Congress. I also look forward to a successful conclusion to the ongoing comprehensive nuclear talks so the world can take an important step toward nuclear disarmament.                          ____________________
