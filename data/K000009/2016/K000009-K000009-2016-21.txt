Chairman, I thank the fine ranking member, Mr. DeFazio, for yielding time, and I rise to discuss the important role of the Great Lakes-Saint Lawrence Seaway as our Nation's freshwater superhighway, a vital economic and security passageway for our Nation.  When the WRDA bill was considered by the Senate, an important reference was included in that bill recognizing the role of the Seaway in U.S.-Canadian maritime trade, as well as global commerce from the heartland. That language authorizes a GAO study of the Seaway's potential to expand economic activity envisioning increased exports, expanded tourism, and a modernized transportation network in a secure operational system.  As the bill moves forward, I would urge the House to incorporate, in any final measure, the directive provisions relating to the Saint Lawrence Seaway's unmet economic potential.  I thank my colleagues on the Great Lakes Task Force, particularly Co-chair Mike Kelly, who was down here earlier, and David Joyce for their continued hard work and commitment to our region of the country. I thank Ranking Member DeFazio for his support of this effort. And I thank Chairman Shuster for his leadership.  Mr. DeFAZIO. Mr. Chairman, I thank the gentlewoman and the other advocates for this provision, in addition to, of course, the Senate. The gentlewoman has worked tirelessly on this issue, approached me many, many times about the fact that we have sort of neglected the potential of the Seaway.  I think that this provision would be extraordinarily meritorious, and I certainly intend to support it in conference and hope to garner support from the chairman and others so that it can stay in the bill as it finally goes to the President's desk.  I reserve the balance of my time.
