Speaker, I rise today to congratulate the Maroon Giants of Kalamazoo Central High School on their second straight Michigan state championship win in men's basketball. These outstanding young men have worked hard for this accomplishment and have made their community very proud.  Winning a state championship is a remarkable achievement that few teams attain. Winning back-to-back championships is an incredible legacy that will live with Kalamazoo Central forever. The Maroon Giants and Coach Mike Thomas know what brought this second straight state title back to Kalamazoo--hard work. It was running that one extra sprint and shooting that extra free throw after practice that helped make the Maroon Giants champions. Nobody outworked the Giants, and nobody could beat them in the state tournament, and nobody had a greater following or more community support. The Giants truly lived up to their name on the court.  It is an honor to pay tribute to the entire Maroon Giants squad: Tyler Bell, Allie Buchanan, Tens Buchanan, TJ Buchanan, Jamaal Conger, Brandon Delk, Juwan Gamble, Lee Gardner, H'ian Hale, Quante Hill, JeRon Johnson, Mark Justice, Daquavion McCants-Wilson, De'tavia Moore, Darius Norman, Von Washington III, and Davarius Williams. I also want to recognize head coach Mike Thomas and assistant coaches Thomas Dillard, Anthony Stuckey, Matt Price, Brandon Williams, Tim Gleeson, Alan Lee and team manager Aminder Sohi. We salute all of you.  On behalf of all the residents of southwest Michigan, congratulations again to the Maroon Giants, Coach Thomas, and the entire Kalamazoo community--you are an inspiration to us all. It is Giant pride at its finest. Go Giants!                          ____________________
