 If I may be precise, when I said that I found no one of the major political leaders in Moscow viewing the expansion of NATO as a security threat to them, I was referring explicitly to the first round. That included the prospect of four nations at the time, not just three. There was no concern expressed by anyone to whom I spoke, including the think tank folks in the Russian-American--my friends from Virginia or New York may remember what it was called.
