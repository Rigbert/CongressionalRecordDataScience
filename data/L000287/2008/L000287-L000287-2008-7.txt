Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.  I thank the gentleman from Minnesota for bringing House bill 7082, the Inmate Tax Fraud Prevention Act of 2008, to the House.  Mr. Ramstad has served at my side on the Oversight Subcommittee for years. He has been a wonderful friend, a good friend. We call ourselves brothers. He will be missed when he retires this year. He has worked to make our taxes fair and to protect taxpayers. This bill is a great and shining example of his good effort.  Jim, I want to thank you again for all of your great work, for working so hard, for hanging in there, for never giving up, and for never giving in. Thank you so much.  The Oversight Subcommittee found that thousands of false returns were being filed by prisoners. However, the Internal Revenue Service could not disclose the information to the Federal Bureau of Prisons. This bill was developed to correct this problem. This bill will stop the abuse of our tax system.  I urge all of my colleagues on both sides of the aisle to vote in favor of House bill 7082.  I reserve the balance of my time.
