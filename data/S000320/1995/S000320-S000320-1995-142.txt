 President, the legislation that we are considering today has no place on the Senate floor or on the Senate calendar. This legislation is a blatant attempt to eliminate over 750 years of Anglo-American common law and to federalize over 200 years of State Tort law in this country.  I want to return power to the States, not federalize important areas of State control. I thought that returning power to the States was a major part of the philosophical victory of the Republican party, my party, which occurred last fall.  Mr. President, our current legal system, based on Anglo-American law, has its beginning in A.D. 1215 when the barons of England forced King John to sign the Magna Carta at Runnymede. The Magna Carta placed the King under the law and put limits on royal power. It also created remedies for many of the abuses that were occurring in England and gave legal protection to the English ruling class, which was later expanded to all Englishmen. Following the Magna Carta other English legal documents provided for additional legal protections for British citizens and the concept of rule of law.  Ultimately, the Magna Carta has come to stand for the proposition that no man is above the law.  English courts, after the Magna Carta, went on to develop a system of common law to provide legal protection to all men and women, the likes of which the world had never seen. Common law, including all Tort law, is basically judge-made law. For hundreds of years English judges decided cases which in turn formed the basis for future decisions.  Under the Magna Carta, the later laws passed by the British Parliament, and the English common law, men were for the first time given certain basic rights in the legal system such as due process, jury trials, and the right to cross examine witnesses.  Mr. President, this system of Anglo-American law was brought to our shores by English settlers and was adopted by our Founding Fathers when they wrote the United States Constitution--the single most important document in our land. Many of the provisions of the Magna Carta anticipate rights that were embedded in the U.S. Constitution and American law.  Our Constitution created a Federal system of Government. Under this system, that so many in this body appear to want to do away with, the Federal Government has certain areas of responsibilities and the States have their areas of influence.  As early as 1648 in the Maryland Act for the Liberties of the People, American colonists explicitly recognized that they were protected and governed by the common law. In 1774, the Declaration of Rights of the First Continental Congress stated that the ``Colonies are entitled to the common law of England.'' After the American Revolution, the colonies, and later the 13 States developed and adopted the common law to their own needs and circumstances. Common law, including Tort law, has remained solely a responsibility of the States for over 200 years.  Mr. President, I would like to direct my colleagues' attention to the tenth amendment of the U.S. Constitution, the tenth amendment states that:       The powers not delegated to the United States by the      Constitution, nor prohibited by it to the States, are      reserved to the States respectively, or to the people.  For over 200 years, the States have had the responsibility and a duty, Mr. President, to develop tort law. They have done so.  The bill we are considering today is the first step, I believe, in destroying the States' important role in developing and administering rules and laws for the redress and compensation for various torts, including product liability cases.  In addition to eliminating over 750 years of Anglo-American common law, this bill violates the 10th amendment [[Page S5991]]  of our Constitution and the basic principles of American federalism.  Mr. President, the States have truly served as laboratories of democracy over the last 20 years in the area of tort reform. Virtually every State in the country has significantly reformed its legal system as it relates to product liability.  Where there have been problems, the States have examined their legal systems and corrected the problems. As Supreme Court Justice Powell has stated,       Our 50 States have developed a complicated and effective      system of tort laws and where there have been problems, the      States have acted to fix those problems.  There is no current justification, I believe, Mr. President, for federalizing our Nation's tort system. Under the logic of this bill, if we carry it a step farther, if we federalize all product liability cases, why do we not federalize all civil and criminal statutes?  The Federal Government can usurp all State power. We know that. Unfortunately, Mr. President, there are many in this body who see federalizing product liability law and other things as a first step to federalizing all legal matters.  This bill will substantially disrupt and may end our country's State common law system. It will result in additional litigation in both State and Federal courts.  Mr. President, I hope that my colleagues will think long and hard before they go down the path toward ending federalism as we know it and preempting all State common law.  The Federal Government, including the Congress, I believe, cannot solve all of our society's ills by Federal statute.  I find this legislation totally unacceptable, and I urge all my colleagues to vote and work against it.                 Amendment No. 621 to Amendment No. 617       (Purpose: To provide that a defendant may be liable for      certain damages if the alleged harm to a claimant is death      and certain damages are provided for under State law, and for      other purposes)
