 Mr. President, today I rise in support of the Central American and Dominican Republic Free Trade Agreement called CAFTA. I also want to state a word of caution in regards to an issue that is commensurate with this vote; and that is the waning support for free trade in this country, more especially in farm country.  It was not long ago when the prospect of expanding our trading opportunities with our neighbors across the ocean--the 96 percent of the rest of the world in terms of trade--was met with great optimism and urgency. I do not know of anybody who made a farm speech who did not say: OK, point No. 2, point No. 3--in the laundry list of things they were trying to get done in Washington--without involving trade and expanding exports. Times have changed.  Today I think we are suffering from what I call ``trade fatigue.'' That is to say, many times we oversell and we overestimate what is going to happen in regard to the expectations of a particular trade agreement. We oversell it. I know that many more times we overcriticize them. As a result, in farm country, I think our producers of food and fiber are a little weary and a little wary of this animal we let out of the chute called free trade.
