 President, I want to share with my colleagues the names of this year's winners of the Congressional Award. Established in 1979, the Congressional Award is a way for the U.S. Congress to recognize the achievements of young Americans aged 14 to 23 years old. It rewards them for success in four vital areas: volunteer public service, personal development, physical fitness, and expedition-exploration.  Recipients choose the activities in each area that interest them and set goals that will challenge them and help them grow. If they are successful, they earn bronze, silver, and gold certificates and medals. Along the way, they have gained new skills and earned greater confidence and positioned themselves to become productive, well-rounded, and accomplished citizens.  Each year in June, a ceremony is held here in the Nation's Capital to present these young people with their Congressional Awards. I want to personally congratulate every one of this year's winners for their achievements and for the example they set for others. By improving their own talents, the recipients of the 2016 Congressional Awards are strengthening their communities and our Nation.  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that a list of this year's recipients of the Congressional Award be printed in the Record.  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in the Record, as follows:                  2016 CONGRESSIONAL AWARD RECIPIENTS       Gabriel Cutler, Sean Villeneuve Jr., Adriana Tapia, Jacob      Massie, Cydney Kaslar, Catherine Liang, Conor Hassett, Gianna      Chien, Dominic Solari, Griffin Ansel, Claire Dashe, Meghan      Leong, Ariane Tsai, William Chen, Terence Lee, Benjamin      Dotson, Madison DeBruin, Sienna Santer, Brandon Chen, Mark A.
