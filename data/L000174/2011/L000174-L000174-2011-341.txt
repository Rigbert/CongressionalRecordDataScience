President, as the Senate prepares to adjourn for the Memorial Day recess, I had hoped that we would be allowed to proceed with the consensus judicial nominees ready for confirmation and who are so needed to fill vacancies on Federal courts around the country. Instead, the Republican leadership's filibuster of the nomination of Goodwin Liu is being supplemented with delays of even those judicial nominations supported by Republican home State Senators and approved by Republicans on the Senate Judiciary Committee. This is too bad.  With judicial vacancies continuing at crisis levels, affecting the ability of courts to provide justice to Americans around the country, I have been urging the Senate to vote on the judicial nominations reported favorably by the Judiciary Committee and pending on the Senate's Executive Calendar. The Senate is recessing with 19 judicial nominations awaiting final action. Of those, 16 are by anyone's definition consensus nominees. All 16 were unanimously approved by all Republican and all Democratic Senators on the Judiciary Committee. Yet they remain stalled without final Senate action.  We should have regular votes on President Obama's highly qualified nominees, instead of partisan filibusters and more delays. With vacancies still totaling 90 on Federal courts throughout the country with nearly two dozen future vacancies on the horizon, there is no time to delay taking up these nominations. Had we taken positive action on the consensus nominees, vacancies could have been reduced below 80 for the first time in years.  All of the nominations reported by this committee and pending on the Senate's Executive Calendar have been through our Judiciary Committee's fair and thorough process. We review extensive background material on each nominee. All Senators on the Committee, Democratic and Republican, have the opportunity to ask the nominees questions at a live hearing. Senators also have the opportunity to ask questions in writing following the hearing and to meet with the nominees. All of these nominees which the Committee reported to the Senate have a strong commitment to the rule of law and a demonstrated faithfulness to the Constitution. All have the support of their home State Senators, both Republican and Democratic. They should not be delayed for weeks and months needlessly after being so thoroughly and fairly considered by the Judiciary Committee.  They include several nominees to fill judicial emergency vacancies, including Paul Engelmayer and William Kuntz of New York, Michael Simon of Oregon, Richard Brooke Jackson of Colorado, Kathleen Williams of Florida, and Nelva Gonzales Ramos of Texas, as well as Henry Floyd of South Carolina to the Fourth Circuit. The nomination of Professor Liu being filibustered by Republican leadership is also to fill a judicial emergency vacancy.  Those nominees who have the support of home State Republican Senators include Bernice Donald of Tennessee to the Sixth Circuit, Henry Floyd of South Carolina to the Fourth Circuit, Sara Lynn Darrow of Illinois, Kathleen Williams of Florida, Nelva Gonzales Ramos of Texas, John Andrew Ross of Missouri, Timothy Cain of South Carolina, Nannette Jolivette Brown of Louisiana, and Nancy Torresen of Maine. In spite of that support, we are unable to secure consent from the Republican leadership to consider and confirm them.  Of the judicial nominations we have been able to get the Senate to consider this year almost 70 percent were delayed from last year. We have only been able to confirm eight judicial nominees that had hearings and were reported for the first time this year. So when some say we are taking ``positive action'' on large percentages of nominees, what this shows is how many unobjectionable nominees were stalled last year by objections from the minority.  We could have made significant progress helping Americans seeking justice in our Federal courts beforethis recess. Sadly, it is a missed opportunity for Senators across the aisle to have joined together with us and worked with the President to provide needed judicial resources.                          ____________________
