  The Republicans regret that our Democratic colleagues have chosen to back away from the agreement we all reached just last month to ensure a smooth, bipartisan funding process. We regret that the Democrats chose to block funding for the national defense, including a pay raise for our men and women in uniform, in order to pick a partisan fight with the White House.  Yet, for the sake of the country, our near-term priority is that of passing a continuing resolution so the government can stay open while work continues. I am glad the continuing resolution on the table earned significant bipartisan support across the Capitol and has also earned the green light from the White House. The Senate will vote on it this week. As Chairman Shelby and Senator Leahy continue their work on regular order appropriations, I hope the cooperation that has surrounded this CR can carry over and that we can get the appropriations process back on track.                          ____________________
