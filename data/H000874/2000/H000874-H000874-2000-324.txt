Speaker, today I wish to pay tribute to an outstanding civil servant, Mr. James L. Harrison, of Bethesda, Maryland, who died October 5, 2000, at age 94. Mr. Harrison was the 16th Public Printer of the United States, serving during the Kennedy, Johnson, and Nixon administrations, and overseeing a fundamental and far-reaching transformation of the Government Printing Office during his tenure.  Mr. Harrison came to the Government during the Great Depression, working as a draftsman at the Bureau of the Census. He later transferred to the Office of Price Administration, rising to the position of liaison officer at the Capitol, a post he occupied until the OPA was disbanded in 1947. In 1949, he became Staff Director of the Congress' Joint Committee on Printing, where for 12 years he worked tirelessly to improve the speed and efficiency of the Government's printing operations. It was through the Joint Committee that Mr. Harrison began his long association with GPO, the organization through which he would make his greatest contributions to the Nation.  In March 1961, following his appointment as Public Printer by President John F. Kennedy, Mr. Harrison took direct control of the Government's printing and publications dissemination work. His successes at the GPO are summarized eloquently in this excerpt from ``The Government Printing Office,'' written by Robert E. Kling, Jr., in 1970:       Under Harrison, the Government Printing Office entered a      period of growth and progress. Dollar volume leaped from less      than $100 million in 1961 to more than $200 million in 1969.      Documents sales jumped from about $9 million to $20 million      over the same period. The far-reaching Harrison policy of      sharing the government's printing requirements with industry      led to a steady increase in work supplied by contract      printers. In 1961, commercial printers provided 42 percent of      the annual volume; in 1970, 57 percent, or $103 million worth      of printing, was done by private industry.       Harrison made strenuous efforts to improve working      conditions and environment in the plant, and during his      tenure took a keen interest in upgrading the equipment used      in supplying the U.S. Government's printing needs. Under his      direction, a major part of the Office's outmoded and obsolete      equipment was replaced by modern, more efficient machinery.      In keeping with nationwide trends in the industry,      letterpress was supplanted by offset as the main production      method . . . offset presses with high running rates and low      plating and press preparation costs keep GPO prices      competitive with those of the best commercial firms.  Mr. Kling could not have foreseen an even further-reaching modernization to the GPO that Mr. Harrison pioneered: the introduction of GPO's electronic typesetting system. This revolutionary change freed the Office of storing, melting, and molding tons of lead in its daily printing operations by converting to electronic database operations. By the time his term as Public Printer ended in March 1970, Mr. Harrison had laid the groundwork for today's on-line editions of the Congressional Record, U.S. Code, and other essential Government publications. As a result of the technological changes that Mr. Harrison initiated, the American public today retrieves an average of more than 25 million Government documents a month from the GPO's on-line service, GPO Access.  Mr. Speaker, it is fitting that we pay tribute to this man who brought so much insight and energy to the public's work. James Harrison's leadership at GPO produced results that not only saved public money, but also built a strong foundation for information technologies developed decades after his tenure ended and which today benefit all Americans. He was, moreover, a friend of the dedicated men and women of the Government Printing Office. He will be missed.                          ____________________
