President, I close by saluting my colleague, the new Democratic leader, Senator Schumer. He and I were roommates for a long, long time before we got our separate apartments--grew up and got our own places. I have come to know him, his family, and his political career. I am looking forward to working with his leadership team in the U.S. Senate. I think his statement today speaks for all the Members of the Senate Democratic caucus.  Mr. President, I yield the floor.
