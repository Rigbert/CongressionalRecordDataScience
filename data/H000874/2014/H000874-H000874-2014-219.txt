 And in conclusion, let me simply say, Mr. Leader, that we welcome moving ahead on the omnibus. We think that is very critical. We hope that we can address the unemployment insurance issue, not as a substitute for focusing on growing jobs and growing the economy, which is essential, but in recognition that some 1.3 million people--growing by 72,000 people a week--are in deep distress, and we want to help them. We think that is the right thing to do. And we think America can do both, grow the economy and help those who have been hurt by the decrease in the availability of jobs available.  Lastly, I might say, that we also hope that we can get to immigration reform as quickly as possible, and we look forward to seeing those principles.  I yield back the balance of my time.                          ____________________
