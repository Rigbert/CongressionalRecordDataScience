 First, we accept the provisions that were in the Baucus bill for offsets. We did suggest a modification on the provision that the Senator said we don't want. He is wrong on that point. We will accept it. There is a slight modification in it that would give an election. We go along with that provision, and I think I made that clear in the remarks I proposed.  The second place the Senator from Illinois is wrong is we are not proposing the cutting of spending. We are proposing the $350 billion increase that their budget has suggested for additional spending be reduced by a very small percentage.
