President, on April 18, I announced my intention to object to any unanimous-consent request for the Senate to take up the nomination of Harvey E. Johnson who has been nominated by President Bush to serve as Deputy Administrator of the Federal Emergency Management Agency. I did so because, prior to his confirmation as Secretary of the Department of Homeland Security, Michael Chertoff told me in my office that if confirmed he would move expeditiously to implement the National Emergency Technology Guard--NET Guard--program. Unfortunately, Secretary Chertoff had failed to honor that pledge.  However, I am pleased to say that this morning the Department of Homeland Security has finally issued a solicitation for applications for a NET Guard pilot program, effectively beginning the implementation process. It is years late, but at last the Department is moving forward with this critical program.  In light of this action, I will no longer object to any unanimous-consent request for the Senate to take up Mr. Johnson's nomination. I will, however, continue to closely monitor DHS's actions on NET Guard.  I ask unanimous consent that a copy of the Department of Homeland Security's press release announcing the pilot program be printed in the Record.  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in the Record, as follows: FEMA Announces Solicitation to Pilot Citizen Corps National Emergency                   Technology Guard (NET GUARD) Program       Washington.--The Department of Homeland Security's Federal      Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) announced today $320,000      is available in Fiscal Year (FY) 2008 to pilot, test, and      develop tools for a potential new Citizen Corps (CC) National      Emergency Technology Guard (NET GUARD) Program. NET Guard      teams will be comprised of volunteers with information      technology (IT) and communications expertise to assist States      and localities in responding to and recovering from incidents      that cause significant damage or destruction to IT and      communications infrastructure. Teams will be a local asset,      managed at the local level, and deployed in response to a      request from local or State authorities.       This competitive pilot program will award funds to four      jurisdictions. To be eligible to apply, local government      applicants must be located in one of the 2008 DHS Urban Area      Security Initiatives jurisdictions and must have a Citizen      Corps Council and programs supported by emergency management.      Additional eligibility criteria are included in the      solicitation announcement. Beginning June 18, 2008, eligible      government entities may apply through the Grants.gov portal,      accessible on the Internet at http://www.grants.gov.      Applications can be received no later than 11:59 PM EST July      2, 2008.       Citizen Corps is FEMA's grassroots comprehensive strategy      to actively involve the full community in preparing and      building resilience through participation with emergency      management in planning, prevention, mitigation, response and      recovery.                          ____________________
