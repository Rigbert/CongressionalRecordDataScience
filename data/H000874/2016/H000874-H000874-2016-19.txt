 Mr. Speaker, the legislation we will be considering next week, I am sure, has support in a number of quarters. The majority leader mentioned, in the last line, that we will be considering efforts to fund the government, the so-called continuing resolution.  Mr. Speaker, as the Speaker knows and the House knows, we have not passed any appropriation bills through the Congress and sent them to the President, nor have we adopted a budget. In the absence of both of those, certainly in the former, we need to have a funding of government passed by September 30th.  I ask the majority leader, therefore, Mr. Speaker, if the majority leader has any knowledge of the status of the CR, either in this House moving forward or in the other body.  I yield to the gentleman from California.  Mr. McCARTHY. I thank the gentleman for yielding.  Yes, we are continuing discussions on the appropriation process and how to ensure the government is funded after September 30th. As soon as it is finished, Members will be advised when floor action is scheduled.
