 President, I say to my friend, my understanding of the way this provision would work is the collateral rule would allow the jury to know but does not reduce the award and does not allow the insurer to subrogate. That is the way this provision is crafted in this legislation. It would allow a jury to know, but it would not reduce the award and would not allow the insurer to subrogate. That is my understanding of the way it is crafted in the underlying legislation.
