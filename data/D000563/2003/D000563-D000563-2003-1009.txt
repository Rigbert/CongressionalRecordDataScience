HATCH. I have changed the Leahy approach because it was in contradiction to the Kennedy, Biden, and Hatch approach, who followed Kennedy and Biden and did it to the letter.  It is very difficult, when two Senators go against a nominee, for that nominee to make it, but it is, as Senator Kennedy said, not dispositive. That has been the rule, as long as I can remember, until Senator Leahy changed it. I think even Senator Leahy basically acknowledged that rule.
