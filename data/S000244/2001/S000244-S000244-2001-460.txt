Chairman, I thank the gentlewoman from Texas (Ms. Jackson-Lee) for yielding.  Mr. Chairman, I believe that the gentlewoman has pointed out an unequal treatment in this bill which needs correction. I am happy to support the amendment of the gentlewoman from Texas (Ms. Jackson-Lee) and hope that we can get it passed quickly.
