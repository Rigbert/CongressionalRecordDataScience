 President, I rise to make two brief comments regarding Egypt and Moldova.  On Egypt, the jury is still out on whether or not the recent presidential election is a meaningful step toward greater democracy in that country. To be sure, there was plenty wrong with the poll which few Egyptians were permitted to access and no international monitors were allowed to observe. President Mubarak's victory was unsurprising. It is important to encourage President Mubarak to appreciate that progress in Egypt, whether relating to freedom, economic development, or Radio Sawa broadcasts, must be judged not by words but by concrete actions. The Egyptian people deserve no less, particularly with legislative elections on the horizon later this year.  On Moldova, I am pleased that the Senate State, Foreign Operations and Related Programs Subcommittee provided an additional $3 million above the Fiscal Year 2006 budget request for that country, a mark worthy of defending in conference. Credible elections in March demonstrated that the country's political leaders are interested in European integration and increased political and economic reforms. I encourage that country to implement proposed reforms relating to the independence of the judiciary and media, transparency in parliamentary proceedings, participation in elections, local self-government, legislative oversight of the executive, and protection of human and civil rights. Such action will demonstrate the seriousness of Moldova's intentions and strengthen its partnerships with the United States and Europe.  I look forward to continued democratic progress in Egypt and Moldova.                          ____________________[Page S10032]From the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]                           EGYPT AND MOLDOVA  Mr. McCONNELL.
