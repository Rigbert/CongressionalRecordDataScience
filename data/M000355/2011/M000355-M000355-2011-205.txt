 President, I would like to join those who have spoken or intend to speak about our former colleague Mark Hatfield.  Most people remember Mark as one of our party's most liberal members--as a Republican who called himself a liberal even after Democrats started avoiding the term.  I think he would like to have been remembered as someone who tried to bring people together or as he put it, as a reconciler.  He was, as we all know, a man of deep principle and compassion. He was also a gifted politician, to this day the longest serving Senator in Oregon history.  Mark was also deeply influenced by his experiences.  It is said his deep aversion to war derived, in part, from his experience as one of the first American servicemen to enter Hiroshima after the dropping of the atomic bomb.  Those of us who knew Mark as a colleague are glad to have had the chance to know him and serve with him. And I would like to take this opportunity to extend my heartfelt condolences to Antoinette and the Hatfield children, as well as Mark's many grandchildren. America, and the Senate family, have lost a good man.
