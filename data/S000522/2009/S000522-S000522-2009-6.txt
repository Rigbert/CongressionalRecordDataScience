This week, another Planned Parenthood clinic director resigned after watching an ultrasound of an actual abortion in progress.  Self-described as extremely pro-choice but now pro-life, Abby Johnson said she watched an unborn child ``crumple'' before her very eyes as the infant was vacuumed and dismembered by a suction device 20 to 30 times more powerful than a household vacuum cleaner.  Ms. Johnson said and told ABC News, ``I could see the baby try to move away. I just thought, `What am I doing?' ``Never again.''  Mr. Speaker, abortion not only kills children; it harms women physically and psychologically, and it risks significant harm to subsequent children.  Recently, the Times of London reported, ``Women who have had abortions have twice the level of psychological problems and three times the level of depression as women who have given birth or never been pregnant.'' The Times said ``senior obstetrians and psychiatrists say new evidence has uncovered a clear link between abortion and mental illness. . . .''  Numerous studies show that the risk of preterm birth to children born to women who have had abortions increases. It skyrockets. One abortion preterm births goes up by 35 percent, two abortions a staggering 93 percent. One of the the leading causes of mental and motor retardation is prematurity.  We have and are going to have more disabling, because of abortion. If we truly don't want to see more abortions and if we want to reduce them, don't fund it.  The Guttmacher Institute has said, formerly the research arm of Planned Parenthood, that prohibiting Federal funds for abortion reduces abortion by 25 percent.  Millions of people are alive today because of the Hyde amendment, because funding was not there to effectuate their demise. Vote for the Stupak-Pitts amendment. It will save lives.
