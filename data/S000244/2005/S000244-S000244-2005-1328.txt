Speaker, I yield myself 15 seconds.  Mr. Speaker, in 1995, my friend from Massachusetts said, in a habeas corpus bill, ``I want judicial review in a reasonable way. I want people who may have had their rights interfered with to be able to sue in reasonable fora.''  That is what this bill does. He was right then. I think this bill is right now.  Mr. Speaker, I yield 3 minutes to the gentleman from Arizona (Mr. Franks), a member of the committee.
