President, I am delighted that the Senate confirmed Frank C. Damrell, Jr. to be a U.S. district judge for the eastern district of California.  The American Bar Association found Mr. Damrell to be well-qualified, its highest rating, for this appointment. He has extensive trial experience as a former deputy attorney general for the State of California, a former deputy district attorney for Stanislaus County, and a trial attorney in the private practice of law for the past 27 years. His nomination enjoys the strong support of Senator Feinstein and Senator Boxer.  I am delighted for Mr. Damrell and his distinguished family that he was confirmed. He will make a fine judge.                          ____________________
