That is the good news.  Unfortunately, the bad news is that so far this year, we have only confirmed six judges since the Republicans took back the majority in January. That is not even a judge per month. Some would claim this is reasonable, but I don't believe it is.  President Bush, in the last 2 years of his term, had a Republican majority for up to that point, but during the last years of his term he had a Democratic majority. I was chairman of the Judiciary Committee at that time. I did not want to do what the Republicans had done to President Clinton in blocking 75 of his judges. I said we have to go with the regular order, because if we didn't go with the regular order, we were going to be politicizing the judiciary.  So we had a Democratic majority, a Republican President, and by this time we had confirmed 33 judges hoping it would set a precedent and stop what was happening when the Republicans blocked 75 of President Clinton's judges. I wanted to set a different pattern. I wanted to take at least judicial confirmations out of politics.  Well, it went back to the same old, same old, doing just exactly what they did to President Clinton. They have allowed only six judges to be confirmed so far this year under the Obama administration, as opposed to 33 whom we had confirmed during the Bush administration. In fact, at this rate, by the end of the year, the Senate will have confirmed the fewest number of judges at any time any one of us have been in this body--the fewest number of judges in more than half a century--even though we have a much larger population, we have a lot more vacancies, and we have a number of judicial emergencies.  This has had a devastating effect on Americans across the country. I hear all the time from individuals and from small businesses about how they go into our Federal courts seeking justice; they want the Federal courts to hear these claims and these courts are saying: We can't. We have so many vacancies in the judiciary, it will be years before we can hear your case.  Last week, I spoke about the Associated Press report on Latino migrant farmworkers who have waited more than three years just to learn whether they can proceed with their claim for stolen wages. The lengthy wait time is due to the fact that there are too many cases and not enough judges in that California Federal court. An empty judgeship in that court has remained unfilled for almost three years. The long overdue vote today to confirm Judge Drozd will finally fill that vacancy.  The Wall Street Journal highlighted a case in the same California Federal court brought by a former Navy technician who alleged that he had been discriminated against by his employer. That lawsuit has been pending for eight years. The technician has not been able to find steady work since filing his suit and does not know how he will manage financially as he waits for a day in court that seems never to come.  One of the Federal judges in that court, Judge Lawrence J. O'Neill, gave the Wall Street Journal this devastating assessment: ``Over the years I've received several letters from people indicating, 'Even if I win this case now, my business has failed because of the delay. How is this justice?' And the simple answer, which I cannot give them, is this: It is not justice. We know it.''  Today, Nancy Kaufman, the CEO of the National Council of Jewish Women, authored an op-ed which said: ``what matters to the average person or business with a case in the federal courts is whether the lower courts are, in fact, able to dispense justice in a timely manner with so many empty seats on the bench. And that is where the majority in the Senate has strangled the process by running up the number of judicial vacancies.''  I ask unanimous consent that Ms. Kaufman's op-ed be printed in the Record.  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in the Record, as follows:                [From the Huffington Post, Oct. 5, 2015]             The Disgraceful State of Judicial Nominations      (By Nancy K. Kaufman, CEO, National Council of Jewish Women)       The first Monday in October marks the beginning of a new      term for the U.S. Supreme Court and a good time to reflect on      the state of the nation's judicial branch of government. This      year the capacity of the federal court system to keep up with      its caseload is seriously in question. Judicial vacancies are      rising and the Senate is likely to confirm the smallest      number of nominees since 1953. The confirmation of federal      judges by the Senate has all but come to a halt. Furthermore,      the pattern of behavior by senators to slow the process      appears quite deliberate. Critics have charged that the      delays in the process are intended to deny President Obama      the ability to appoint judges in the last two years of his      term, unlike the pace of confirmations experienced by other      presidents at this point in their tenure.       How has this happened? Judicial nominations proceed through      the Senate in a sort of formal dance, in which individual      senators have an unusual role. By tradition the president      consults senators in whose states the judicial vacancies      occur prior to nominating anyone. Then the nominees go before      the Senate Judiciary Committee for hearings and a vote. But      individual senators can delay a Senate Judiciary Committee      hearing indefinitely without stating why. Some have done so      even when they agreed to the nomination in the first place. A      nomination can be held hostage due to another matter      altogether or another piece of legislation. After     the hearing and the committee vote, the Senate majority      leader is then supposed to schedule a floor vote, and that      too can be delayed almost indefinitely.       In fact, during the current two-year session of Congress      which began in January, only five judges were confirmed by      the Senate in the first eight months--the slowest pace since      1953. A sixth judge was confirmed in September, the first      nominee in 2015 from a state with a Democratic senator--     Missouri's Claire McCaskill. These weren't controversial      nominees. All six were voted out of committee with bipartisan      support and ultimately confirmed unanimously on the Senate      floor, and yet were forced to wait an average of 80 days for      a floor vote.       Such a slow confirmation rate is without precedent. Most      recently, when Republican president George W. Bush had two      years left, the Democratic Senate confirmed 68 judges. During      the last two years of Democratic president Bill Clinton's      term in office, the Republican Senate confirmed 73 judges. In      both cases, the nominees confirmed in the last two years      accounted for about one-fifth of the total for each      president. At the current snail's pace, less than one in 20      of Obama's confirmations will come during his final two      years.       What's at stake? A situation where ``justice delayed is      justice denied.'' While the Supreme Court is rightly regarded      as the pinnacle of the US legal system, it is nonetheless a      very small part of it. Its nine justices often set landmark      precedents with their decisions, or at least clarify existing      law, but typically the court now handles only 80 cases or      less per term. In contrast, a total of 376,536 civil and      criminal cases were filed in US district courts in 2014. Of      those, the majority--nearly 300,000--were civil cases. That      year, about 55,000 cases were appealed from the district      courts to the 11 US Courts of Appeals. During the last      Supreme Court term, 7,376 cases were appealed to the Supreme      Court. (It is important to remember that cases generally      don't reach the appeals stage in the same year they were      originally filed.) In other words, on average about one-tenth      of one percent of appeals cases make it all the way to the      top of the judicial branch--making the lower federal courts      critical decision-makers.       So what matters to the average person or business with a      case in the federal courts is whether the lower courts are,      in fact, able to dispense justice in a timely manner with so      many empty seats on the bench. And that is where the majority      in the Senate has strangled the process by running up the      number of judicial vacancies. Since January 1, that number      has increased by 56 percent, from 43 to 67.       When the courts lack enough judges, a judicial emergency is      declared by the Judicial Conference of the United States, the      national policy-making body for the federal courts created by      federal law. A judicial emergency is a situation defined by      strict criteria--it is not just an off-the-cuff opinion.      Since January 1, the number of such declared emergencies has      increased by 158 percent, from 12 to 31, affecting districts      with millions of people. Two judicial nominees pending for      over six months have not yet had a confirmation hearing--     although if confirmed, both would end a judicial emergency.       As a country that presents itself as a leader among nations      when it comes to rule of law, the corruption of the process      of selecting judges in a partisan manner ought to be an      international embarrassment. And the only way that      embarrassment will motivate change is if American voters      organize to call on their senators to end the charade of      pretense that surrounds confirming judges today--the pretense      that in effect says, ``Nothing to worry about, just move      along.'' What needs to move along is the Senate confirmation      process with a much greater degree of transparency, or the      damage to our system of justice and, more importantly, to      those individuals depending on it, will only intensify.
