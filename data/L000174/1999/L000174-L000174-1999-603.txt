President, the Senator from Utah and I have had a chance to discuss this during the debate. I think this is the wise way, to go ahead and vote on the amendment before us without the modification. The Senator from Utah and I will work during the morning. We are stuck here like everybody else this weekend so let us work on this. It has come in at such a late time and this is such a technical issue.
