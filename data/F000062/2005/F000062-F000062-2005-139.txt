 President, I am pleased to join the Armenian American community in welcoming the upcoming Pontifical visit of His Holiness Aram I, Catholicos of the Great House of Cilicia. The Pontiff will be visiting the State of California this October at the invitation of His Eminence, Archbishop Moushegh Mardirossian of the Western Prelacy of the Armenian Apostolic Church of America.  His Holiness is one of the most prominent Christian leaders in the Middle East and a spiritual leader for hundreds of thousands of Armenians around the world. The Pontiff presently serves as the Moderator for the World Council of Churches which is comprised of more than 340 churches from different cultures and countries around the world representing over 400 million Christians. Currently serving his second term, His Holiness is the first Orthodox and the youngest person to be elevated to Moderator.  The theme of the Pontiff's visit is ``Towards the Light of Knowledge.'' This theme reflects the Pontiff's faith that only with greater education and dialogue can the world's conflicts be addressed properly.  I take this opportunity to not only thank The Pontiff for his time and worthy endeavors in California, but also thank the sizable Armenian community which has been actively contributing to the California culture and economy since 1878. California cities of Los Angeles and Glendale are home to the second and third largest populations of Armenians outside of Armenia and are important members of their communities serving as business leaders and city council members.                          ____________________
