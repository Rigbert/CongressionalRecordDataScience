President, I am pleased to speak about S. 930, the College Affordability and Access Act of 1997, which I introduced yesterday.  More than 30 years ago, Congress took the historic step of authorizing Federal student aid programs for the purpose of ``making available the benefits of postsecondary education to eligible students.'' Since that time, millions of young Americans have been afforded an opportunity often denied their parents--a college education.  During the three decades since the passage of the Higher Education Act of 1965, both the cost and the importance of postsecondary education have grown dramatically. And, unfortunately, many once again find themselves without the financial resources needed to unlock the door to a better future.  There was a time in Maine when a person armed with a high school diploma and a willingness to work hard could expect to get a job in a paper mill and be assured of a very good wage for life. Today, however, the situation is very different. The manager of one mill told me that it has been 10 years since they hired a high school graduate. Similarly, if you visit the recently built recycling mill in East Millinocket, ME, you are likely to see a handful of computer operators using specialized training to run highly technical equipment.  At a time when 85 percent of the new jobs require some postsecondary schooling, the challenge for the children of less affluent families is to obtain higher education, and the challenge for us is to make that a possibility.  We cannot and should not guarantee our young people success, but we can and should strive to guarantee them opportunity. We have a good record on which to build, as the student aid programs of the Higher Education Act have assisted countless young Americans. Those programs do not, however, do enough to assist middle-class families in coping with the ever-escalating cost of higher education. And they certainly do not do enough to help those for whom the cost of college is a crushing debt load.  Mr. President, much of the impetus for this bill comes from my experience working at Husson College, a small college in Bangor, ME, as well as from the education hearings that Senator Jeffords and I held in that city. Husson's students primarily come from lower- and middle-income families; in most cases, they are the first members of their family to attend college. Thatmakes Husson the perfect laboratory from which to assess the strengths and weaknesses of our current student aid programs.  From my Husson experience, I came to appreciate the critical role of Pell Grants and student loan programs in opening the doors to college for many students. But I also learned that our current programs do far too little for the many middle-class families who must largely bear the financial burden of opening those doors for their children. We also do not do enough for those for whom the road to college ends not with a pot of gold but with a pile of debt. Indeed, even at a school with moderate tuition, like Husson, a student participating in the Pell Grant and Federal Work Study Programs can expect to graduate not only with a degree but also with a debt of more than $15,000. And if this student goes on to graduate or professional school, the indebtedness could easily exceed $100,000.  Missy Chasse, a student who worked for me at Husson, typifies this problem. After graduating with an $18,000 debt, she decided to return to her home town of Ashland in rural Maine where the prospect of a job paying more than $20,000 is remote. Missy is now faced with a daunting debt that will strain her finances for years to come. Many people, confronted with this prospect, simply drop out of college or decide not to go at all.  The dilemma facing middle-class American families who have to rely on borrowing to educate their children was captured in a letter I recently received from Maine parents. They wrote:       We both work and are caught in the middle--too much income      for aid and not enough to support college tuition. Our      daughter has almost completed her second year of college with      two more to go. She has loans, we have loans, and it is      becoming increasingly harder to keep our heads above water.      We have another daughter entering college in three years and      we wonder how we will be able to swing it.  That the experience of this family is widespread is borne out by the statistics. According to the Finance Authority of Maine, the average size of the education loans it guarantees has more than quadrupled during the past 10 years. The prospect of being saddled with a terrifying debt explains why many Maine families decide that the cost of college is simply too great for them. Indeed, Maine ranks a dismal 49th out of the 50 States in the percentage of our young people who decide to go on to higher education.  Mr. President, this is the season when Members of this body hit the commencement trail, summoning up their most stirring rhetoric to inspire college graduates to dedicate themselves to serving others. The irony is that the audience is far more likely to see its future not as one of serving its neighbors, but rather as one of servicing its debt.  My bill recognizes that we have a solid foundation of financial assistance programs. It seeks to build on that foundation by making needed changes that will provide some measure of debt relief, promote private savings, and encourage employer sponsorship of education.  Specifically, the College Affordability and Access Act of 1997 has three components. The first will make the interest on student loans tax deductible. The second will authorize the establishment of tax-exempt education savings accounts. And the third will make permanent the tax exemption for employer-paid tuition for undergraduate programs and extend it to graduate and professional programs.  The first component, a small step for Government that will be a big help to students, allows a tax deduction of up to $2,750 in interest that individuals pay on their student loans. It will alleviate some of the financial pain experienced by the recent graduate with the $18,000 debt and the $20,000 salary. While the deduction will be phased out as the graduate's income increases, the vast majority of those with student loans will qualify for all or part of the benefit. Through this change, we will be recognizing that a loan to go to college is not the same as a loan to buy a stereo, but rather an investment in human capital that will pay dividends not only to the borrower but also to our Nation.  The second component will allow parents to place $1,000 per year into a tax-exempt savings account for the education of a child. Money withdrawn from the account to pay qualified education expenses will not be taxed. Assuming the family puts $1,000 into the account every year for 18 years and the account earns a modest rate of return, the family can expect to accumulate about $35,000, which will put a big dent in their education expenses.  Our education policies must stop penalizing savings. Under current law, families which make financial sacrifices to save for their children's education may face the paradoxical result that they do not qualify for aid programs available to their less prudent neighbors. While this bill will not eliminate that possibility, it will send the clear message that our Government is prepared to encourage and reward those who save for college.  The third component seeks to make greater use of the willingness of businesses to further the education of their employees. It will accomplish that in two ways. First, it will make permanent the current tax exemption for employer-paid tuition for undergraduate studies. Second, it will extend this exemption to those attending graduate and professional programs.  Mr. President, this bill will benefit families facing the challenge of paying for college; it will benefit students currently pursuing their education; and it will benefit graduates struggling to pay their debts. But the benefits will be far more widespread and significant. In its own small way, the College Affordability and Access Act will give us a better educated population, a more competitive economy, and a society in which the rewards are more equally shared. Most important, it will reaffirm our commitment to the principle that success in America should be there for all who are willing to work for it.  Mr. President, I am pleased to tell you this bill has attracted widespread support. I ask unanimous consent that the text of a letter I received from the American Council on Education endorsing S. 930 on its own behalf and on behalf of 12 other educational organizations be printed in the Record.  There being no objection, the letter was ordered to be printed in the Record, as follows:                                    American Council on Education,                                      Office of the President,                                    Washington, DC, June 18, 1997.     Hon. Susan Collins,     U.S. Senate, Russell Senate Office Building, Washington, DC.       Dear Senator Collins: I write on behalf of the higher      education associations listed below to commend you for      introducing ``The College Access and Affordability Act.''       Your bill will help millions of families save money for      college, encourage working adults to take advantage of      employer-provided educational assistance to upgrade their      skills, and help recent college graduates repay student      loans. These provisions will be of enormous assistance to      middle income families.       Your proposal to restore the federal income tax exemption      for interest payments on student loans is especially welcome.      In the last decade, a growing number of students have begun      to rely on federal loans to finance their education. While      the terms of federal student loans are generous compared to      other loans, many borrowers find that the repayment of these      debts restricts their personal and professional opportunities      after graduation. By restoring the income tax deduction for      student loan interest, your bill will help moderate the      impact of loan repayments and provide enormous assistance to      student borrowers. Moreover, by establishing a 2,750 annual      limit on the amount of interest that may be deducted, your      proposal will be especially helpful to graduate and      professional students--a category of borrowers who generally      incur much higher debts while in school.       As you know, there is widespread bipartisan interest in      using the tax code to help families meet college costs and we      are deeply grateful for your leadership in this area. My      colleagues and I look forward to working with you and other      members of the Senate as you consider this vitally important      legislation in the months ahead.           Sincerely,                                             Stanley O. Ikenberry,                                                        President.       On behalf of the following:       American Council on Education.       American Association of Community Colleges.       American Association of State Colleges and Universities.       American Psychological Association.       Association of American Universities.       Association of Catholic Colleges and Universities.
