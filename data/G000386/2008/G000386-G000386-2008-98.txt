 I was here and I remember that. You could look at it as the consequences of the confidence in the large Democratic majorities in Congress, and a newly elected Democratic President. Basically, however, there was no check on one political party's agenda. If that agenda is to raise taxes and increase spending, then it is not a surprise.  Mr. Kelly's article notes the adverse reaction of a prominent player of the leftwing in this town. This is a Mr. Robert S. McIntyre, who was very active in causes that you consider liberal. Quoting from Mr. Kelly's article, this is what Robert S. McIntyre, director of Citizens for Tax Justice, a liberal research group, had to say.       They campaigned on a middle-class tax cut and then four      days into a new Administration the chief economic spokesman      is talking about a middle-class tax increase. That's a flip-     flop.  That is the end of the quote of Mr. McIntyre, quoting from Mr. Kelly's article.  Most folks are unhappy about flip-flopping politicians. Fishermen may like a flip-flopping fish that they brought into the boat. This photo is the best fish I could find to demonstrate that. That is about the only kind of flip-flopper that would be received positively. If a politician flips from a tax cut promise to a tax hike, you can bet most folks will consider that move a flop in more ways than one.  All of this happened almost 16 years ago, but it is relevant for this year as we go into a debate on taxes for this campaign. During almost 14 years since Republicans have held either the White House or the Congress or both--and this chart shows, as I pointed out once before, Congress and the President have generally reduced the tax burden. That is during this period of time, when Republicans controlled both the House and the Senate.  It has been a long time, almost 15 years since the American people have seen a large tax increase, going back to the period of time when the Democrats controlled both the Presidency and the Congress.  Then I remember right here on the floor, because I was here when he said it, the then-Finance Committee chairman Pat Moynihan termed the 1993 tax bill:       . . . the largest tax increase in the history of public      finance in the United States or anywhere else in the world.  Philosopher George Santayana said words to the effect that history repeats itself, and if you do not learn from history, you are bound to repeat the mistakes of the past. A risk Americans face, if we hand over all the reins of power to the Democratic Party, is to repeat the history of 15 years ago.  I am a Republican. I know what polls show. They show right now that theelectorate trusts Democrats more than Republicans on tax policy. But the 1992 campaign shows that if you listen too much to what is said in the campaign, it doesn't necessarily come out that way in the election. So I raise the question, during the debate of 2008, in the Presidential campaign, are we headed in the same direction? Are we going to hear all the talk about taxing nobody but the rich but end up doing as we did in 1993, taxing the middle class?  Our tax increase amnesia may lead us in that direction. We could find ourselves then being like Rip van Winkle. We will hear dreamy rhetoric about hope and about change. It will be clothed in a slumber of middle-class tax relief and tax increases on only the rich, as it was in the campaign of 1992. We could awaken from that slumber, our tax increase amnesia would probably fade, we could wake up to another world record tax increase.  I know what the folks who put in place that world record tax increase will say. They will defend it by arguing that it cut the deficit. They will argue that by cutting the deficit and moving to a surplus, that interest rates dropped. While it is true the fiscal situation went from deficit in 1992 to surplus in 1999, there were many other factors involved and a tax increase was not the biggest reason for it.  First, supporters of the 1993 bill touted it as a dollar of spending cuts matched by a dollar of tax increase. If you were a taxpayer, wouldn't you buy that? Pay one more dollar and get a dollar decrease in expenditures? But, you know, it doesn't work out that way. A close look at the numbers shows the bill contained $4 of tax increase to every $1 of spending cuts.  I ask unanimous consent to have a summary of the Senate Finance Committee Republican staff analysis dated June 28, 1993, printed in the Record.  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in the Record, as follows:             COMPARISON OF TAXES/FEES, SPENDING CUTS AND RATIOS IN FINAL BUDGET RECONCILIATION BILL                                    [In billions of dollars over five years]----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------                                                                     Democrats      Republicans    In this bill----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------Taxes and User Fees:    1.
