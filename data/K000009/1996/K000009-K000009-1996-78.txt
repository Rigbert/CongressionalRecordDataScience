Speaker, I rise today to pay tribute to the life of Toledo area business and political leader Stewart Cochrane. Stu passed away in August, after a valiant struggle against illness.  A World War II veteran, Stu returned home to Toledo and established his own business. He gave his services to many civic and community groups, including Inverness and Belmont Country Clubs, Huntington Bank, the Toledo Club, the Reynolds Corners Rotary, and the Lincolnshire Association. He served as a village councilman for 20 years in Ottawa Hills, a suburb of Toledo, eventually serving as the village's police commissioner. He completed his public service as the village's mayor for 3 years. Throughout his long career of public service, he strove to put the needs of the community first, always doing so with an enthusiasm, gusto, and sense of humor that filled entire rooms with energy.  Committed to his community, Stu's presence will be missed by us all. We extend our sympathy to his wife, Sally; daughter, Paula; son, John; and sister, Bette; and his extended family and friends. Stu made a difference and made us better by believing in us. Godspeed.                          ____________________
