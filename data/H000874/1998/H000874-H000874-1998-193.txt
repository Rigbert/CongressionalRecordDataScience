Speaker, I rise in strong support of the resolution and in deep dismay of the action.  Mr. Speaker, I rise in strong support of this resolution. The heinous crime that we unanimously condemn today is a reminder that racism continues to be far too prevalent in our society. The brutal death of James Byrd, Jr. at the hands of ignorant, racist men should serve as a wake up call to every American and signify that there is still work to be done to promote and protect racial tolerance in our Nation.  It is unfortunate that we, as a Nation, have yet to appreciate the diversity of our country. How shameful that we have not reached a united point of tolerance and respect for our neighbors, judging them not by their race, color or nationality, rather, by the quality of their character, morals, and contributions to society. The children of this Nation should not be the unwitting witnesses to those who continue to foment racial hatred and violence, and they should be given the opportunity to extinguish the blemished record of racial intolerance that mar this century and the ones before it and start anew in the next millennium.  There is no explanation for the loss of life that was a result of racism and hatred and I condemn this act of cowardice. I join my colleagues and extend my heartfelt condolences to the family of Mr. Byrd and the people of Jasper, Texas.
