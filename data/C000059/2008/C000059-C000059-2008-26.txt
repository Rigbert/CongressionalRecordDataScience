Corona has been fortunate to have dynamic and dedicated community leaders who willingly and unselfishly give their time and talent and make their communities a better place to live and work. Michael Warren is one of these individuals. On July 3, 2008, Michael retired after 14 years as the Chief of the Corona Fire Department and a celebration will be held this Saturday, July 12, 2008, in his honor.  Michael Warren was the Fire Chief for the City of Corona since May 1994 and also served as the Emergency Services Director for the City of Corona. In addition, Chief Warren serves as the Operational Area Mutual Aid Coordinator for the Governor's Office of Emergency Services. The Corona Fire Department currently employs a staff of 146 members and operates the suppression activities for the city from seven fire stations. In addition to being the Fire Chief, Chief Warren has served as the Acting Police Chief and Acting Utilities Director for the City of Corona. In his capacity as Fire Chief along with the ``Acting'' assignments he has worked closely with all of the other municipal departments creating collaborative solutions to city wide problems.  Chief Warren previously was the Deputy Chief for the California Department of Forestry and Fire Protection/San Bernardino County Fire Department and Mutual Aid Operational Area Coordinator, and served with the U.S. Forest Service. He has over 36 years of experience in the fire service, serving on major emergency incidents throughout the United States. Chief Warren was a member of the National Emergency Incident Management Team. He has presented discussions on large scale emergency incident management to other state emergency organizations including the State of New York and at the International Association of Fire Chiefs conference.  Chief Warren was the President of the California Fire Chiefs Association from 2004-06, and held the Legislative Director position for the California Fire Chiefs Association.

Chief Warren's expertise and tireless passion for the well-being and safety of the community has contributed immensely to the betterment of the City of Corona and the State of California. I am proud to call Michael a fellow community member, American and friend. I know that many community members are grateful for his service and salute him as he retires.                          ____________________
