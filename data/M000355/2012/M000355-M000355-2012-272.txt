 President, I stand before you today to pay tribute to a man who has been successful in serving his country, in his career, and in building longlasting relationships with family and friends, all because he has learned to incorporate his passion into all that he does: Mr. William ``Bill'' A. Santor of Lexington, KY.  Bill Santor lives on the Griffin Gate golf course with his wife of 72 years, Nettie. He tries to play golf at least twice a week, sometimes more. Mr. Santor turned 100 years old on Easter Sunday of this year. Despite his age, he is a competitor through and through; he recently accumulated an astonishing score of 42 strokes after playing 9 holes.  Mr. Santor truly loves the sport of golf, so much, in fact, that he passed his knowledge of the game down to both of his children as they were growing up. Now they, too, have fit the game into their livelihoods in one way or another. His son, Tom, played golf in college at the University of Kentucky, while his daughter, Patty Driapsa, instructs professional golfers at the Club Pelican Bay in Naples, FL. Both children are not only amazed that their father is still able to play the game but are also awestruck by how good he is. Despite his age, after a long lifetime of practice, he still has exceptional skill.  Bill was first exposed to the game when he began caddying in Youngstown, OH, at age 12. The pay he received was usually 25 cents for working an entire 18-hole game. He picked up a few spare clubs here and there and began playing himself at the age of 15. Bill quickly found that he was a natural-born golfer, and he began playing in and winning local tournaments.  When World War II began Bill enlisted, but he never ceased to play golf. He was stationed at Fort Knox, close to the Lindsey Golf Course, where Bill would eventually play against Byron Nelson, winner of two Masters, a U.S. Open, and a PGA, in the Kentucky Open in 1943. Although Bill didn't win the tournament that year, just being able to participate is one of Bill's fondest memories to this day.  Not long after the Open, Bill was deployed to Europe, but again he found himself in close proximity with the game he loved so dearly. Bill worked maintaining a golf course on the Czechoslovakia-Germany border. Military officers would come to the course when they were on leave to play, relax, and enjoy their time off. One of the visitors was Bob Hope, with whom Bill had the opportunity to play nine holes. All these years later, Bill will be the first to tell you he won that game.  When Bill returned home after the war, golf was a big part of his family and work life. His wife Nettie remembers most of their family vacations were to golf destinations, where the whole family would play. Bill worked for a business equipment company for almost 50 years and he spent a lot of time with clients discussing business over a game of golf. But Bill's competitive nature would never allow him to let a client win.  To this day Bill tries to fit a round of golf into his schedule every chance he gets, which is something he has done his whole entire life. Bill can drive a golf ball 175 yards, and he has a running count of 10 holes-in-one to this day. Bill's children both agree that golf is what keeps their father going; it is something that he has built his life around. Golf has opened many doors for Bill throughout his life, and for that he is grateful.  It is my wish at this time that my colleagues in the Senate join me in celebrating the successful and still very active life of Mr. William ``Bill'' A. Santor.  Mr. President, there was recently an article published in the Lexington newspaper the Herald-Leader. The article featured the legacy of Mr. Bill Santor and the love and passion he has for his country, his State, his family, and the game of golf. I ask unanimous consent that said article be printed in the Record.  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in the Record as follows:            [From the Lexington Herald-Leader, Apr. 1, 2012]   At Almost 100, Bill Santor Looks Back on His Colorful Life in Golf                            (By Mike Fields)       To Mark Twain, golf was a good walk spoiled, but to Bill      Santor, who will mark his 100th birthday on Easter Sunday,      golf has been and still is a wonderful life lived.       ``It's given me so much,'' Santor said. ``Great experiences      and great memories.''       Like when he competed against Byron Nelson in the Kentucky      Open. Or when he played nine holes with Bob Hope during World      War II. Or when he teed it up in the same tournament as Babe      Ruth. Or when he made two holes-in-one in a two-week period      at age 87.       In his prime, Santor was one of the best amateurs in Ohio.      He passed the golf gene on to his children. His son, Tom,      played at the University of Kentucky. His daughter, Patty,      played at Bowling Green State and is now a teaching pro in      Florida.       Bill Santor still plays golf a couple times a week at      Griffin Gate, where he's lived since 1991 with his wife of 72      years, Nettie.       His legs are failing him, and so is his eyesight, but      Santor is still capable of scoring well. Just last week, he      carded a 42 for nine holes.       He has shot his age so many times that he laughs off the      accomplishment as if it were a tap-in putt.       ``It's crazy,'' his son Tom said when asked about his dad's      knack for still hitting the sweet spot.       ``He's a freak show.''       Patty Driapsa, who works at the Club Pelican Bay in Naples,      Fla., said she finds it ``incredible'' how solid her father      still hits the ball. ``He has a little trouble maneuvering in      and out of the cart, but hey, at 100 years old, you'd expect      to have a few challenges.''       Bill Santor's introduction to golf came when he began      caddying as a 12-year-old in Youngstown, Ohio. He earned 25      cents for 18 holes.       He got a few hand-me-down clubs and started playing when he      was 15. A natural athlete, he quickly found his groove and      was winning area tournaments within a few years.       He continued to caddy on occasion to earn entry-fee money      for tournaments. One of his best gigs was looping for Ben      Fairless, president of U.S. Steel.       ``He'd give me $30 for expense money,'' Santor said. ``That      was like $300 then.''       In 1935, Santor played in a tournament in Cleveland and the      field included Babe Ruth, the most famous athlete on the      planet at the time.       When World War II began, Santor enlisted in the Army and      was stationed at Fort Knox. He was upset when he was told the      post's golf course was mostly restricted to officers. But      Santor's golf talent and gift of gab got him playing      privileges.       He was second low amateur in the 1943 Kentucky Open, which      was held on Fort Knox's Lindsey Course. Byron Nelson, who had      already won four majors (two Masters, a U.S. Open, and a      PGA), won that Kentucky Open.       When Santor was shipped overseas during the war, he still      played some golf.       As a staff sergeant, he was part of a Third Army team that      won a military golf competition in Paris in 1945. The spoils      of victory included an engraved gold watch that he's worn for      65 years.       Part of Santor's time in Europe was spent running the golf      course at a resort called Marienbad on the Czechoslovakia-     Germany border. It was where troops on leave would go for      rest and relaxation. And it was where Bob Hope visited during      a USO trip.       ``The manager came up to me one day and said, Billy, you've      got to play with Bob Hope this afternoon.' I said, What?!' I      went out and played nine holes with him, and I beat him,''      Santor said.       Before he returned home after the war, Santor got in a lot      of golf at Marienbad.       ``I played every weekend with a captain, a colonel and a      general, and here I was a staff sergeant,'' he said.       ``They gave me the colonel for a partner, and he couldn't      hit a bull in the ass with a handful of gravel. I'd have to      take out $6 every time we played.''       Golf was also an integral part of Santor's civilian life.       Patty remembers that family vacations were usually golf      destinations. Nettie also played in those days, so there was      a family foursome.       Bill worked for a business equipment company for almost 50      years, and he did his share of schmoozing on the golf course.      Ever the competitor, however, he never lost to a client on      purpose.       ``One guy asked me if I played customer golf.' I said no,      and I threw a 68 at him,'' Santor said, laughing.       While luck is a factor in getting a hole-in-one, there's      skill involved, too, especially when you've had 10, Santor's      running total. In 1999, he aced the par-3 fourth hole at      Griffin Gate on May 3, and aced it again on May 14.       New technology in golf clubs and balls has helped Santor      stay in the swing of things after 85 years in the game. His      odd-looking interlocking grip his left thumb is tucked under      the club still allows for a smooth stroke that can send a      drive 175 yards.       ``I can't swing too hard, but I can still hit it OK,''      Santor says proudly.       Patty Driapsa said golf ``is basically what keeps my dad      going. It's the world he lives in. It's been a game of a      lifetime for him, that's for sure.''       Tom Santor, who lives in Columbus, Ohio, said golf has been      ``one of the cornerstones'' of his father's life ``his family      life, his business life, his social life. When he's on a golf      course, wherever that might be, he feels like he's home.       ``I think that's where he's most at peace.''       And still fairly close to par.                          ____________________
