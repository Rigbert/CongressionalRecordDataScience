 On December 18, 2012, those levels were revised pursuant to the Budget Control Act. Today, I am further adjusting those levels, specifically the allocation to the Committee on Appropriations for fiscal year 2013 and the budgetary aggregates for fiscal year 2013.  Section 101 of the Budget Control Act allows for various adjustments to the statutory limits on discretionary spending, while section 106(d) allows the Chairman of the Budget Committee to make revisions to allocations, aggregates, and levels consistent with those adjustments. This adjustment accounts for changes resulting from the following bills:  One, the American Taxpayer Relief Act (ATRA, P.L. 112-240).  Two, the Disaster Relief Appropriations Act of 2013 (P.L. 112-77).  Three, the Senate substitute amendment to the Continuing Resolution (H.R. 933).  ATRA reduced the overall discretionary spending level by $4 billion and redefined the firewalls. The supporting tables reflect totals that correspond to the revised security/nonsecurity definition included in ATRA. As such, I am reducing the security budget authority allocation by $2 billion, the nonsecurity budget authority by $2 billion, and the total outlays by $2.315.  The Disaster Relief Appropriations Act and the Senate amendment to the Continuing Resolution are eligible for adjustments under the Budget Control Act.  The Disaster Relief Appropriations Act includes $5.379 billion in budget authority that is designated as disaster relief and $41.669 billion that is designated as an emergency. That funding is estimated to result in $3.257 billion in outlays in 2013. The adjustment filed on December 18, 2012 included revisions related to the Disaster Relief Appropriations Act. Removing the adjustment for the Senate bill and including the enacted bill nets to a reduction of $8.909 billion in budget authority designated as an emergency, a reduction of $6.309 billion in outlays designated as an emergency, and an increase of $592 million in outlays designated as disaster relief. Furthermore, the Disaster Relief Act includes $3.459 in budget authority and $344 million in outlays as nonemergency and non-disaster funding, which is not eligible for an adjustment.  The Senate amendment to the Continuing Resolution includes $98.683 billion in budget authority designated as Overseas Contingency Operations (OCO), $11.779 billion in budget authority for disaster relief, $483 million in budget authority for program integrity, and $41.669 billion for emergencies. This is estimated to result in $55.766 billion in outlays in 2013.  Consequently, I am revising the budgetary aggregates for 2013 by a total of -$9.883 billion in budget authority and -$8.603 billion in outlays. I am also revising the budget authority and outlay allocations to the appropriations committee by -$3.504 billion in security budget authority, -$6.381 billion in nonsecurity budget authority, and -$8.605 billion in total outlays, pursuant to the new security/nonsecurity definition included in ATRA.  I ask unanimous consent that the following tables detailing the changes to the allocation to the Committee on Appropriations and the budgetary aggregates be printed in the Record.  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in the Record, as follows:                          BUDGETARY AGGREGATES (Pursuant to section 106(b)(2)(C) of the Budget Control Act of 2011 and          section 311 of the Congressional Budget Act of 1974)------------------------------------------------------------------------                $s in millions                      2012         2013------------------------------------------------------------------------Current Spending Aggregates:    Budget Authority..........................    3,075,731    2,986,115    Outlays...................................    3,123,589    3,006,559Adjustments:*    Budget Authority..........................            0       -9,883    Outlays...................................            0       -8,603Revised Spending Aggregates:    Budget Authority..........................    3,075,731    2,976,232    Outlays...................................    3,123,589    2,997,956------------------------------------------------------------------------* Excludes $2 million in off-budget Social Security funds.
