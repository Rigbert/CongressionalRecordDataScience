President, today we had a very interesting hearing where we had General Casey and Secretary Geren and others before the Armed Services Committee. I want to make sure that before we leave on this recess we have one more chance to talk about the significance of the McConnell-Stevens emergency supplemental appropriations bill. It is vital to our troops overseas, and it is important to the future of our Armed Forces.  As Senator McConnell stated earlier today--and I am quoting now--he said:       Because we have a responsibility to provide this funding to      our men and women in uniform as they attempt to protect the      American people, we need to get a clean troop funding bill to      the President.  I would like to associate myself with these words and these remarks and also express my support for the supplemental he has sponsored.
