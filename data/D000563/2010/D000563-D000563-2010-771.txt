President, I rise today to honor the memories of St. Vincent DePaul and St. Louise de Marillac and to note their legacy on DePaul University in Chicago. This year DePaul is marking the 350th anniversary of the deaths of St. Vincent and St. Louise.  Providing access to social services such as health care and education, St. Vincent and St. Louise attended to the needs of those afflicted by poverty, illness, and injustice in the 17th century. St. Vincent DePaul and St. Louise de Marillac dedicated their lives to serving the underprivileged. It was by their example that the Vincentians founded DePaul University in Chicago, Illinois in 1898.  DePaul University was established with a fundamental mission centered on service and civic engagement, ensuring academic excellence, providing access to affordable education, and promoting respect for the dignity of all persons. The spirit of St. Vincent and St. Louise lives admirably in the University's traditions. Since its founding, DePaul has been a home for students struggling to attain their dreams for higher education. Historically, DePaul has educated many students who would have otherwise seen the door to college closed for them. DePaul was one of the first universities to admit female students in a coed setting. The university also has a long and distinguished history of providing an education to first-generation college students and children of immigrants.  Today, DePaul is one of the largest and most diverse private institutions in the Nation. The student body of over 25,000 represents a wide variety of religious, geographical, ethnic, and economic backgrounds that honor the memory of St. Vincent and St. Louise. And DePaul passes the noble tradition of serving others on to its students. Students at DePaul live the legacy of St. Vincent and St. Louise when they participate in community service through a variety of university-wide programs, including the annual Vincentian Service Day.  The year 2010 marks the 350th anniversary of the deaths of St. Vincent and St. Louise. Today, a commitment to service and a celebration of diversity is more important than ever before in our Nation. DePaul embodies these goals. The University continues to promote socially responsible leadership in its students and upholds its Vincentian mission to make education accessible for all students regardless of family background or financial means.  Mr. President, I commend DePaul's celebration of the 350th anniversary of St. Vincent and St. Louise and praise their continuing pursuit of excellence in higher education.                          ____________________
