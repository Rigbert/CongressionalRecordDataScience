 President, first of all, my usual 1-minute speech after I open the Senate.  Last week, I spoke about consistent congressional oversight, the checks and balances of government, Congress is to make sure that the executive branch of government faithfully executes the laws under the Constitution.  In that speech, I talked about how the Democrats have ignored their own party's use of Russian and Ukranian Government connections to undermine Trump. I noted how the Democrats' action literally fit their own definition of collusion.  Congress ought to conduct aggressive oversight. It is a constitutional demand. However, if you want to be taken seriously in this body and by the American public, you have to be very consistent. Of course, I am pointing out some inconsistencies by the other political party.  When Democrats ignore their own leadership collusion with foreign governments, yet investigate the President after alleging he did the same, that is a lack of consistency and creates doubts about credibility.                          ____________________
