 President, I rise today to celebrate the recognition of Trace Die Cast of Bowling Green, Kentucky as the 1997 Industry of the Year by the Bowling Green Area Chamber of Commerce.  When Trace Die Cast started operations in 1987, it employed 24 Kentuckians. In the 12 years since, the company has undertaken two major plant expansions and now employs 170 individuals, with an annual payroll of $4.6 million. They continue to be well-positioned for future growth in Warren County.  In the last decade, Trace Die Cast has become a major supplier of parts for some of America's favorite automobiles, including the Ford Explorer.  Trace Die Cast's role as a community leader is also well-known, especially their enterprising approach to employee education. They have important partnerships with local vocational schools to train their employees. They also provide scholarships for their employees who want to continue their education. Throughout their existence in Bowling Green, Trace Die Cast has contributed both time and money unselfishly and generously to local charities and civic organizations.  Mr. President, local leaders in Bowling Green have described Trace Die Cast as a community's dream company. I could not agree more. They are a tribute to the American spirit, and I am proud to have such a company in my state. I congratulate them on this honor and ask all my colleagues to join me in celebrating their accomplishments.  (At the request of Mr. Daschle, the following statement was ordered to be printed in the Record.)                          ____________________
