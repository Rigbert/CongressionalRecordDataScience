The bottom line is, we are going to have an hour and a half to state why we think this is not a good veto and to override it.  Mr. President, I do have a number of people, Republicans, who want to come down and be heard who did not have a lot of time for preparation. I am very glad this is coming up right now, but, hopefully, they are still going to be around.  First of all, Senator Bond has been very helpful in this effort and is a very senior member of this committee that put this legislation together. I will yield him whatever time he shall use. Ten minutes.
