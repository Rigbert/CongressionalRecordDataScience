Chairman, I would echo the sentiments about the importance of public-private partnerships and including teaching and clinical hospitals in finding ways to provide the best care possible to our servicemembers.  Mental health disorders are a growing trend in our military, and we must use all resources at our disposal to address the demand for treatment.  Mr. Chairman, I thank the gentleman for his interest and for the colloquy.                              {time}  1530
