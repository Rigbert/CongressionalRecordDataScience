I would simply say regardless of the residue of judges in the Bush administration versus the end of the Clinton administration, the point I am making is there was apparently a very consistent effort on the part of Republicans to deny votes to all manner of judges. I think 64 of President Clinton's nominees never got a vote, never got to the floor. I have the time. I think what it amounts to is a very deliberate protest, which the majority has the power to do, of using the committee process to deny hearings and to deny votes.  It is a contradiction then to come to the floor and say: We can use the rules of the Senate. We can use these rules and we can deny judges, but if the Democrats choose to use the rules of the Senate to challenge a judicial nominee of the President, Bush or otherwise, that represents a violation of the Constitution.  That is my point. The point is borne out regardless of the residue of judges of either administration. The record today, this Senate and the Senate under the leadership of Tom Daschle, shows we have done a remarkable job in confirming this President's nominees. That was not suggested in the treatment of President Clinton's nominees.  I yield to my colleague from New Jersey.
