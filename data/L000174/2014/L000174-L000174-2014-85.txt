. 4323.  Before I do, Senator Cornyn has been very interested in this. This is the Debbie Smith Reauthorization Act. I have been working with Debbie Smith since her bill was first introduced in 2001. He is probably one of the few Senators who was here with me at that time when I first supported it. It is to improve access to rape kits, testing, and services for survivors of sexual assault.  Senator Cornyn has been a strong supporter. I know he also supports the Justice for All Act as well, something he cosponsored, and the distinguished Republican leader has.  I would like to get them all passed. I realize one Republican--not the Senator from Texas--is objecting to passing the Justice for All Act, and I don't want to pit one against the other.  Because at least this one expires this month, I ask unanimous consent that the Senate proceed to the immediate consideration of H.R. 4323, which was received from the House.
