 President, I thank the Senator from Illinois for reminding all of us of the many people and communities and the economy in this country that are being hurt today because of the tea party's insistence, in the House of Representatives, that this government remain shut until ObamaCare is defunded or eliminated. I am frustrated, as is every American today, thinking why can't our government work? Why can't people come together?  As chair of the Budget Committee, I have been out here 19 times since last March saying: Let's go to conference committee and resolve our differences, and 19 times Members of the Republican Party have said no.
