 Speaker, as the sound of war today reverberates throughout this Chamber, let us take this opportunity to make sure that we do not forget about the veterans of past wars, the men and women who have put their lives on the line defending this country.  Frankly, the President's budget is grossly inadequate in terms of protecting veterans' needs, as is the Republican budget. In the State of Vermont, the Veterans Administration hospital at White River Junction is under significant financial pressure, and that is true at VA hospitals all over this country.  Mr. Speaker, at a time when some are proposing huge tax breaks for some of the richest people in this country, let us not forget the veterans.  Let us, in this budget process, go well beyond the President's budget for veterans, well beyond the Republicans' budget for veterans, and finally provide the true funding that the Veterans Administration needs to protect those people who put their lives on the line defending this country.                          ____________________
