 Let me make two comments on two amendments actually to the THUD appropriations bill having to do with CNG, natural gas vehicles. If I could speak very briefly on two amendments, the first is amendment No. 3245. That amendment is the regulatory streamlining for the use of compressed natural gas. This will allow us to give some of the same treatment to natural gas vehicles that are given to other alternative fuel vehicles. In fact, I am joined with Senator Carl Levin on this amendment, which also gives access to HOV lanes for certain vehicles that are using natural gas and other alternative fuel vehicles.  The other one is amendment No. 3275 having to do with light semi trucks that use natural gas, because of the additional weight of the equipment, we would give some leniency--up to 2,000 pounds--in terms of the total weight to allow them and encourage them to use compressed natural gas without facing a freight-weight competitive disadvantage.  Those are the two amendments, when the time comes, that I wanted to get into the Record that I will be proposing at that time.  I thank the Senator from Maine for yielding me a few minutes of her time, and I yield the floor.
