Mr. Speaker, after about 20 meetings and briefings over the last couple of months, last Thursday the Committee on International Relations reported out this resolution, H.J. Res. 114, which would authorize the President to use force in Iraq, if necessary.  Before this came up in the Committee on International Relations, I met with CIA Director George Tenet and National Security Adviser Condoleezza Rice at the White House last Wednesday to get answers to someof my remaining questions. They related classified information about Saddam Hussein's buildup of chemical and biological and radiological and nuclear weapons, as well as the buildup of technology and equipment to deliver those weapons.  This information is very alarming. I suggested to the White House that they try to work at declassifying more of this information and make it available to the American people so that there would be a better understanding of the real threat that Saddam Hussein's regime in Iraq is posing against the United States.                              {time}  1715  As an old Air Force intelligence officer, let me suggest that it is my conclusion that Saddam Hussein represents the same terror that we experienced on September 11, a year ago.  We know that he has a buildup of these weapons of mass destruction. We know that he has shown a willingness to use these weapons against his own people up north in the Kurdish area. We know that he is a bully that wants power, we know he is bloodthirsty, we know that he tried to take Kuwait to expand his power and influence as far as expanding his ability to export his products.  I offered an amendment in the Committee on International Relations to emphasize one important point, that was, that our quarrel was not with the Iraqi people. The Iraqi people had little to do with any of the decisions leading us into this conflict. The aggression and buildup of weapons has happened because the Iraqi Government was seized by Saddam Hussein, who has used Iraq's resources and the Iraqi people for his own delusional purposes. In fact, I believe the people of Iraq will be our allies against Saddam Hussein's regime, as the Afghan people were our allies against the Taliban.  In conclusion, let me recall what we were talking about a year ago after the September 11 attack. There were accusations of who knew what when and what could have been done to prevent that kind of attack.  Well, Mr. Speaker, this is what we can do: we can take a stand. We can inform ourselves of the seriousness of the information that is now available to us to know that this is a real threat. We can have strong support in this Congress so that the United Nations Security Council is going to pass a strong resolution there with ramifications for enforcement.  That is what we can do for this country, and that is what we can do for the free world.
