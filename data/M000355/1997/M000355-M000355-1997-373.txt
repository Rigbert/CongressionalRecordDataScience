 President, I want to thank the distinguished Senator from Washington for his eloquentdefense of the first amendment. He certainly encapsulated, better than I could ever, exactly what the heart of this debate is. I thank him very much for his support and contribution.  I yield the floor.  Mr. McCAIN addressed the Chair.  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Kempthorne). The Senator from Arizona.  Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, daily we are learning of new allegations and revelations regarding how last year's elections were financed. Just yesterday, we learned that the Chinese Government created a $1.8 million fund with which it sought to influence up to 30 Members of Congress with campaign contributions.  The Congress now faces a monumental task. How can the system be effectively and fairly changed? The answer is both simple and daunting: by passing comprehensive, bipartisan campaign finance reform. Some openly oppose campaign finance reform. One of the leaders, if not the leader, my friend, Senator McConnell, is there. I admire him and respect the fact that he is a standup guy. He does not hide that fact. Others have said to me, ``I am for campaign finance reform, just not yours.'' I challenge my colleagues and say that every aspect of Senator Feingold's and my bill is open for debate. Everyone is welcome at the table. I believe there is no excuse for inaction.  Real reform must do two things. It must limit the influence of money in campaigns, and it must level the playing field between challengers and incumbents. I believe those two principles cannot be compromised, but the rest is up for negotiation.  I find that there are fewer and fewer Americans--in fact, recent polls show that 9 out of 10 Americans believe that we must repair this system and that it is out of control. I just heard my colleagues talking about how in 1974 it didn't work, and if we passed further campaign finance reform, somehow that would be bad, as it was bad in 1974.  Now, Mr. President, I wasn't in Congress in 1974, but I am very aware that, in 1972, there were people walking around this town with valises full of hundred dollar bills. The stories I have heard concerned people being asked to contribute 1 or 2 percent of their gross income. Somehow to allege that the changes made in 1974 didn't help reform the system I think, frankly, flies in the face of facts. The facts are that, as a result of the 1974 reforms, we did fix the system for quite a while. Mr. President, when I was elected to Congress in 1982, there was a far different environment than exists today in fundraising. The fact is, it worked for quite a while, and then loopholes were exploited, Supreme Court decisions gave additional avenues for the funneling of so-called ``soft money'' into campaigns, and it is out of control again.  Mr. President, in 1986, we reformed the tax system in this country--supported overwhelmingly here in Congress--and closed some tax loopholes. We took several million people off the tax rolls, and it was generally applauded. We fixed the system to a significant degree. We all know now, in 1997, we need to fix the tax system again. I say to you, in 1974, much needed reforms were enacted by an overwhelming majority of Congress. They did some good things. It did clean up the system dramatically.  Now circumstances and times have changed. We all know the problems, Mr. President. We all know the problems. They are made abundantly clear by picking up any newspaper today. The pursuit of funds and money has become a full-time occupation, and the average citizen no longer has the same voice in Washington, DC, that they did years ago.  Earlier this week, a man who I have not only grown to respect and admire enormously, but I have also become a good friend with over the many years I have been here and worked very closely with, is Senator Ford from the other side of the aisle. I think many would describe Senator Ford, with admiration, as a partisan member of his party. I also know that there are many others of us who have had the opportunity of working with him for many, many years. If you want to reach a legislative result and you want to reach it in a nonpartisan and, if necessary, bipartisan fashion, you sit down with Wendell Ford, along with, by the way, my friend from South Carolina, Senator Hollings. Example: At the end of last year, we were able to pass legislation which was the most massive change in aviation, how we fund and structure it, since 1978 when we deregulated the airline industry. Wendell Ford, acting in a bipartisan fashion, made that legislation possible. I intend, as is appropriate, when the time comes, to elaborate on my feelings of affection and respect for Senator Ford.  One of the things Senator Ford mentioned as the reason why he was not going to seek reelection was because he was going to have to raise $100,000 a week between now and election day. He also added, in his own inimitable style, that his wife would not allow him to rent out the spare bedroom. But the fact is, Mr. President, that every time one of our Members leaves this body, they cite the money chase. They cite the problem that money has become the overriding factor in the determination of candidacy and outcome. That should not be, Mr. President.  Ask anyone who is considering running for public office. They come here to Washington, DC, because they need the support of the party people and the money and the PAC's and the interest groups, and they will tell you they are only asked one question when they announce they are going to seek election, and one question only. It's not, ``How do you stand on taxes?'' or ``on the role of Government,'' or ``how do you feel about national defense?'' There is only one question they are asked, Mr. President: ``Where are you going to get the money?''  When we get into a full-blown debate on this issue--which I hope we will because I still hold the fervent hope and belief that we will address campaign finance reform on this floor in one way or another before this year is out, and I don't know when that will be--I suggest that it will only be done in a meaningful fashion when there is sufficient anger and outrage on the part of the American people who demand that we fix this broken system, and not until.  I don't think we really ought to debate this until we are ready to achieve a legislative result. I don't know when that will be, Mr. President. But I can tell you, we are a heck of a lot closer to that point than we were, say, 6 months ago. I believe 3 months from now, or 2 months from now--after the hearings Senator Thompson is going to be holding--there will be a much greater impetus and desire on the part of the American people that we more thoroughly and completely address this issue and try to fix the broken system. I believe that we can and should and will. It used to be that we waged a battle of ideas between candidates. The battle was well fought and hard won on the election battlefield. Now it is the battle of the bucks.  Again, at an appropriate time, I will talk about the well-known public facts and how much campaign costs have risen, how much it costs to run a Senate race, how much it costs in order to buy television, and how much soft money has grown in exponential numbers to the point where, according to the Washington Post not long ago, the cost of Federal campaigns was well over $2 billion, whether they be small States or large States.  Mr. President, I do not believe that the constitutional amendment is the answer. We can enact campaign finance reform without a constitutional amendment. S. 25, the McCain-Feingold bill, is fully consistent with the law. I can point out many more constitutional scholars, including a former chief counsel of the ACLU, as to constitutionality because it is based primarily on voluntary spending limits.  The Supreme Court has ruled that we cannot stop someone who is willing to spend an unlimited amount of money to campaign for a Federal office from doing so.  This bill provides strong incentives for candidates to voluntarily comply with spending limits regardless of personal wealth. Candidates who choose to spend unlimited amounts of their own money receive none of the benefits under our legislation.  Mr. President, there is an argument that is being bandied about that somehow we cannot place a limit on soft money, that it would be unconstitutional to do so. I find that curious. I find that curious because the courtshave clearly allowed the Congress to place limits on contributions to campaigns. We have placed an individual limit of $2,000. We placed a PAC limit of $10,000. We do not allow a corporation or a union to provide any direct contributions. Yet somehow people on this floor are saying somehow it would be unconstitutional to place limits on soft money. There is no rational constitutional argument there in my view. There is no justifiable need for soft money. All contributions made to the party should be done using hard, fully traceable, fully disclosed dollars. There is no constitutional right to soft money. The courts have stated that any contribution can be limited.  I will submit for the Record those court decisions that have stated that any contribution can be limited.  As you know, Mr. President, my good friend Paul Taylor has worked tirelessly to promote the idea of free broadcast time. Broadcasters use spectrum that is owned by the American people. As such, the Congress and the courts have agreed that when the Government gives out licenses to the broadcasters--enabling them to operate--that such licenses may be conditioned on certain activities deemed to be in the public interest.  When each broadcaster receives a license, they sign on that license that they agree to act in the public interest.  Some of the opponents of the McCain-Feingold legislation complain incorrectly that the bill will limit individuals free speech. As I have just explained, the bill is compatible with the Constitution. But there is even a greater question that must be asked. If spending is akin to free speech, then how much speech does an individual without means have? If money is free speech, how much free speech does a person without money have?  On March 2, on CNN a woman from Bartlesville, OK, called in, and, said, ``I have a question for you. I'm a Republican, supposedly. I'm more Independent than anything else. But I want to ask you something. At $735 a month, how much freedom of speech do I have? I cannot contribute to these big campaigns.''  Mr. President, men and women all over America ask in response to the equation of money and free speech about how much freedom of speech they have if they are a moderate- or low-income American. Where is her voice? Where is the voice of the woman from Bartlesville, OK? What can be done to ensure that her voice is not overwhelmed by the voices of monied special interests?  Spending limits will do more to both level the playing field between challengers and incumbents and give a voice to individuals who either give little or can afford to give nothing at all.  The most money tends to win elections. And this is the incumbent protection system. The reality is that the current, perverse system under which the richest takes all has resulted in entrenched incumbents.  The Congressional Research Service has compiled an analysis of congressional races in recent years, and the conclusion of that study is that the candidate who raises and spends the most money, even if that money is his or her own, usually wins the elections. As I have said before, elections should be about message and ideas. I do not believe it was an accident that in the last election we had the lowest voter turnout in any time in the history of Presidential elections in this century.  Mr. President, I have a letter from Common Cause. I quote:       Dear Senator: The Senate is expected to vote later this      week on a proposed constitutional amendment to provide      Congress with the ability to impose mandatory limits on      campaign spending, thus overriding a portion of the Supreme      Court's 1976 decision in Buckley v. Valeo.       Common Cause opposes the constitutional amendment because      it will serve as a diversionary tactic that could prevent      Congress from passing campaign reform this year. We believe      that a constitutional amendment is not necessary in order to      achieve meaningful and comprehensive reform.       Congress needs to act now to address the growing scandal in      the campaign finance system. Congress can act now--and      constitutionally--to adopt major reforms. Congress need not      and should not start a reform process that will take years to      complete by pursuing campaign finance reform through a      constitutional amendment. Instead, the Senate should focus      its efforts on enacting S. 25, comprehensive bipartisan      legislation that represents real reform. It is balanced,      fair, and should be enacted this year to ensure meaningful      reform of the way congressional elections are financed.  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that this letter be made part of the Record.  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in the Record, as follows:                                                 Common Cause,                                   Washington, DC, March 12, 1997.       Dear Senator: The Senate is expected to vote later this      week on a proposed constitutional amendment to provide      Congress with the ability to impose mandatory limits on      campaign spending, thus overriding a portion of the Supreme      Court's 1976 decision in Buckley v. Valeo.       Common Cause opposes the constitutional amendment because      it will serve as a diversionary tactic that could prevent      Congress from passing campaign finance reform this year. We      believe that a constitutional amendment is not necessary in      order to achieve meaningful and comprehensive reform.       Under existing Supreme Court doctrine, Congress has      significant scope to enact tough and effective campaign      finance reform consistent with the Court's interpretation of      the First Amendment in Buckley.       The McCain-Feingold bill, S. 25, provides for significant      reform within the framework of the Buckley decision. The      legislation would: ban soft money; provide reduced postage      rates and free or reduced cost television time as incentives      for congressional candidates to agree to restrain their      spending; close loopholes related to independent expenditures      and campaign ads that masquerade as ``issue advocacy'';      reduce the influence of special-interest political action      committee (PAC) money; strengthen disclosure and enforcement.       A recent letter to Senators McCain and Feingold from      constitutional scholar Burt Neuborne, the Legal Director of      the Brennan Center for Justice and a past National Legal      Director of the ACLU, sets forth the case that the McCain-     Feingold bill is constitutional. Professor Neuborne finds      that the key provisions of the bill are within the Court's      existing interpretation of the First Amendment, and he thus      demonstrates that a constitutional amendment is not necessary      to enact reform.       Professor Neuborne concludes that the voluntary spending      limits in the McCain-Feingold bill are consistent with the      Supreme Court's ruling in Buckley. He further concludes that      ``Congress possesses clear power to close the soft money      loophole by restricting the source and size of contributions      to political parties. . . .'' He also concludes that efforts      to close loopholes relating to independent expenditures and      so-called ``issue ads'' are also within Congress' existing      authority.       It is, therefore, not necessary to amend the Constitution      in order to enact meaningful campaign finance reform.      Congress has the power, consistent with the First Amendment,      to enact comprehensive reform by statute.       A constitutional amendment for campaign finance reform      should not be used as a way to delay reform legislation.      Typically, amending the Constitution takes years. After both      Houses of Congress adopt an amendment by a two-thirds vote,      it has to be approved by three-quarters of the state      legislatures. Even then, the Congress would still have to      take up enacting legislation. This is a lengthy and arduous      process.       Congress needs to act now to address the growing scandal in      the campaign finance system. Congress can act now--and      constitutionally--to adopt major reforms. Congress need not      and should not start a reform process that will take years to      complete by pursuing campaign finance reform through a      constitutional amendment. Instead, the Senate should focus      its efforts on enacting S. 25, comprehensive bipartisan      legislation that represents real reform. It is balanced,      fair, and should be enacted this year to ensure meaningful      reform of the way congressional elections are financed.           Sincerely,                                                      Ann McBride,                                                        President.  Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, I also would like at this time to have printed in the Record by unanimous consent a letter that is by Mr. Burt Neuborne who is the Legal Director at the Brennan Center for Justice.  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in the Record, as follows:                                   Brennan Center for Justice,                                      New York, NY, March 3, 1996.     Hon. John McCain,     Hon. Russell Feingold,     U.S. Senate,     Washington, DC.       Dear Senators McCain and Feingold. I am writing in response      to a letter to Senator Mitch McConnell, dated February 20,      1997, from the American Civil Liberties Union, arguing that      critical provisions of S.25, the Bipartisan Campaign Reform      Act of 1997, are unconstitutional under existing Supreme      Court precedent. I am the John Norton Pomeroy Professor of      Law at New York University and Legal Director of the Brennan      Center for Justice. I served as National Legal Director of      the American Civil Liberties Union during the 1980's, and      remain active in defense of the First Amendment. I     continue to serve as an ACLU volunteer counsel. I believe,      however, that the ACLU letter on S.25 is simply wrong in a      number of assertions, despite the fact that it was written by      an able lawyer whom I respect and admire.       In assessing the ACLU's views on the constitutionality of      S.25, it is important to recall that the ACLU believes that      an restriction on campaign financing is unconstitutional,      even those restrictions upheld by the Supreme Court in      Buckley v. Valeo. The only Justice on the current Court who      accepts the ACLU's position is Justice Clarence Thomas. Thus,      the ACLU is quite right in predicting that Justice Thomas      would find S.25 unconstitutional--but quite wrong in claiming      that a majority of the Court would condemn critical parts of      the statue.     I. Efforts to Persuade Candidates to Limit Campaign Spending    Voluntarily By Providing Them With Valuable Inducements Like Free                    Television Time Are Constitutional       The ACLU argues that Title I of S.25, which asks candidates      to limit campaign spending in return for free or subsidized      broadcast time and subsidized mailing rates, is      unconstitutional. But, in Buckley, the Court approved      precisely such an approach when it upheld the offer of      campaign subsidies to Presidential candidates in return for a      promise to limit campaign spending.       The fact is that the ACLU still believes the Buckley Court      was wrong when it upheld Congress right to condition public      campaign subsidies on a promise to limit campaign spending.      But the ACLU lost that argument. It is, to say the least,      difficult for the ACLU to argue that a far lesser set of      inducements in S.25 would violate the First Amendment. In      effect, the ACLU argues that virtually any inducement offered      to a candidate to persuade her to limit campaign spending is      unconstitutional as a form of indirect ``coercion''. But the      Buckley Court clearly distinguished between inducements      designed to elicit a voluntary decision to limit spending,      and coercive mandates that impose involuntary spending      ceilings. If giving a Presidential candidate a $60,000,000      subsidy is a constitutional inducement, surely providing free      television time and reduced postal rates falls into the same      category of acceptable inducement. Merely because a deal is      too good to pass up does not render it unconstitutionally      ``coercive''.        II. Ceilings on Contributions by PACS Are Constitutional       The ACLU argues that a $1,000 cap on contributions from      PACs, and a 20% limit on PAC contributions to a particular      candidate violate the First Amendment. Once again, the ACLU's      constitutional position is traceable to an issue that it lost      in Buckley, but continues to re-argue in Congress.       In Buckley, the ACLU challenged the $1,000 ceiling on      campaign contributions, arguing that campaign contributions      were entitled to the same level of free speech protection as      campaign expenditures. The Supreme Court rejected the ACLU's      argument, and upheld the ceiling on contributions. Indeed, in      the years since Buckley, the Supreme Court has upheld every      contribution limit that has come before it in an election      context. California Medical Ass'n v. FEC, 453 U.S. 182      (1981); FEC v. National Right to Work Committee, 459 U.S. 197      (1982). If Congress may limit contributions from individuals      to $1,000, surely the First Amendment does not require      preferential treatment of PACS. If individuals can be      restricted to $1,000, so can PACS.       Moreover, Congress may surely determine that the greatest      risk of corruption occurs in connection with campaign      contributions from self-interested, interest PACS.      Accordingly, placing a 20% ceiling on PAC contributions in      well within Congress' power to prevent corruption, or the      appearance, or the appearance of corruption, by placing      limits on overtly self-interested campaign contributions.  III. Limits on Enormous Campaign Contributions to Political Parties      from Corporations, Labor Unions, and Wealthy Contributors Are                              Constitutional       The ACLU argues that the First Amendment prevents Congress      from closing the notorious ``soft money'' loophole that      threatens to destroy the integrity of the Presidential      campaign process. In the most recent Presidential campaign,      donors poured more than $250 million through the soft money      loophole to political parties, ostensibly for use in building      local parties, registering voters, and increasing voter      turnout. The vast bulk of soft money contributions came from      corporations and labor unions, barred by law from      participating directly in federal campaigns, or from wealthy      individuals anxious to contribute in excess of existing      contribution ceilings.       The ACLU argues that the First Amendment prohibits Congress      from closing the loophole. But, once again, the ACLU's      constitutional position is simply a reprise of arguments it      has lost in the Supreme Court. In Buckley, the ACLU argued      that any effort to limit campaign contributions violated the      First Amendment, an argument the Court rejected. In later      cases, the Court also dismissed the argument that      corporations and labor unions have a right to use their money      to influence federal elections. See, e.g., Austin v. Michigan      Chamber of Commerce, 494 U.S. 652 (1990); FEC v. Nat'l Right      to Work Comm., 459 U.S. 197 (1982).       In 1978, the FEC, reversing an earlier ruling, opened a      seemingly modest loophole in the contribution rules by      allowing corporations, labor unions, and wealthy individuals      to contribute funds directly to a political party free from      the usual restrictions on contributions, as long as the funds      were to be used in connection with local party building,      voter registration or other activity not directly connected      to a federal election. In the years since, the soft money      loophole has become a threat to the integrity of the      regulatory system. Hundreds of millions of dollars pour      through the loophole each year to both major political      parties from contributors who are barred from contributing      directly to a federal campaign. The funds are often solicited      by federal candidates and spent in ways designed to advance      their candidacies. More ominously, the forbidden donors, if      their contributions are large enough, are rewarded by both      parties with preferred access to public officials, creating      precisely the appearance of corruption that justifies      restricting large campaign contributions in the first place.      Thus, unless one accepts the ACLU's premise that      contributions can never be limited no matter what the size      and no matter what the source (and even Justice Thomas has      not gone that far), Congress possesses clear power to close      the soft money loophole by restricting the source and size of      contributions to political parties just as it does for      contributions to candidates.       The ACLU's suggestion that the recent Supreme Court      decision in Colorado Republican Party provides First      Amendment support for a soft money loophole is flatly wrong.      Colorado Republican Party was an ``expenditure'' case, not a      ``contribution'' case, and it involved hard money, not soft.      It held, merely, that when a political party makes an      expenditure attacking the candidate of another party six      months before selecting its own candidate, the expenditure      should be treated as an independent expenditure, as long as      the funds come in small amounts from donors who are eligible      to contribute to a federal campaign. The Court did not hold      that ineligible donors, like corporations, labor unions and      wealthy individuals, have a constitutional right to buy      preferred access to public officials by pouring unlimited      amounts of cash into a political party's coffers.       The most relevant Supreme Court decision is not Colorado      Republican Party, but Austin v. Michigan Chamber of Commerce,      where the Supreme Court held that corporations can be walled      off from the electoral process by forbidding both corporate      contributions and corporate independent expenditures because      they have the capacity to distort the democratic process.      Surely, the law cannot be that Congress has the power to      prevent corporations from giving money directly to a      candidate, or from expending money on behalf of a candidate,      but lacks the power to prevent the corporation from pouring      unlimited funds into the candidate's political party in order      to buy preferred access to him after the election.IV. The Narrow Limits on Coordinated Expenditures By Political Parties                   Imposed by S. 25 Are constitutional       Colorado Republican Party holds that political parties are      entitled to make truly independent expenditures on the same      terms and conditions as other entities. Since the expenditure      at issue in Colorado Republican Party was made six months      before the party's candidate was selected, there obviously      was no coordination between the party and the candidate. The      case says nothing, however, about coordinated expenditures.      Indeed, the critical swing Justices--Justices Breyer, Souter,      and O'Connor--explicitly refused to decide how to treat      coordinated expenditures, noting that if coordinated      expenditures were treated like independent expenditures, the      critical line between contribution and expenditure would be      destroyed, since every forbidden contribution could be      recycled as a coordinated expenditure.       S. 25 attempts to deal with coordinated expenditures by      providing that once a political party makes contributions,      and engages in coordinated activities with its candidate, it      can no longer be said to be making truly independent      expenditures. The provision is merely a common sense effort      to police the distinction between truly independent and      coordinated expenditures. Since the ACLU rejects the critical      distinction between expenditures and contributions put forth      in Buckley, it believes that any restriction on the party's      right to spend money, even a de facto contribution made in      the form of a coordinated expenditure, is absolutely      protected. But, if you accept the Supreme Court's ruling in      Buckley that contributions may be regulated, it becomes      critical to decide when an expenditure is truly independent,      and when it turns into a de facto contribution. Thus, once      again, the ACLU's opinion on the effort in S. 25 to draw a      careful line between truly independent expenditures and      coordinated contributions is an exercise in wishful      thinking, not an accurate description of existing law.     V. the effort in S. 25 to distinguish between an independent  expenditure designed to affect the outcome of an election, and issue        advocacy designed to inform the public, is constitutional       Independent expenditures designed to affect the outcome of      a federal election are subject to one important restriction--     funds contributed to finance the expenditure must come from      sources that would be lawful if contributed directly to the      candidate and in limited amounts. Issue advocacy designed to     inform the public is, on the other hand, subject to no      restrictions, either as to funding or disclosure.       The last election was characterized by numerous groups      purporting to engage in public education outside the reach of      the campaign laws. For example, both major parties spent      substantial sums on so-called ``issue ads'', paid for by      donors who were barred from contributing directly to a      federal election campaign. Numerous private groups targeted      close races and poured funds into them in the guise of issue      education, even though the funds came from forbidden sources      and in amounts that could not be contributed. S. 25 attempts      to close that loophole by setting forth two tests to      differentiate between campaign speech and genuine issue      advocacy. Throughout most of an election cycle, the test is      whether the speaker's purpose and effect was to advocate the      election or defeat of an identified candidate. Within 60 days      of the election, however, the test dispenses with an      examination of the speaker's purpose and looks only to      whether, applying certain enumerated criteria, a reasonable      person would understand the ad to be advocating the election      or defeat of a named candidate.       It is, in my opinion, unclear whether the latter test is      sufficiently precise. I believe that the better approach      would be to apply throughout the election cycle a purpose-     and-effect test along the lines of the first one described      above, but perhaps slightly more demanding. Speech should be      viewed as campaign speech only if the speaker's predominant      intent was to affect the outcome of a specific election, and      the FEC should be required to establish the relevant intent      by clear and convincing evidence, or, even, beyond a      reasonable doubt before labeling speech as campaign-related.      Such an approach would prevent egregious evasion of the rules      governing campaign contributions, while providing ample space      for genuine public education. VI. the effort in S. 25 to enhance the enforcement capability of the                           FEC is long overdue       The FEC is currently powerless to cope with massive      violations of existing law. For example, the last campaign      saw both major parties accept illegal donations, and engage      in blatantly illegal spending activities, like running phony      ``issue ads'', or making phony ``independent'' expenditures      in order to evade contribution restrictions. The FEC stood by      like a helpless spectator while the law was turned into a      mockery. S. 25 provides needed authority to seek injunctive      relief against blatant violations. I would, however, tighten      the enforcement provisions to permit injunctive relief only      for clearly established violations. I would place a      significant burden on the FEC in order to permit action      against egregious violations, while preventing undue      intrusion into the electoral process.       Finally, I would break the FEC's monopoly on enforcing the      campaign funding laws. The FEC's current structure permits      either major party to veto the enforcement activities of the      FEC. The result has been an enforcement history that harasses      minor parties and independents, but rarely challenges the      questionable activities of the major parties. We will, I      predict, never see an FEC proceeding against either or both      major parties for their activities during the last campaign.       The solution is a private cause of action for violating the      FEC. Abuse of such a private right of action could be      minimized by provisions for attorneys fees and Rule 11      sanctions for frivolous claims.       Reasonable people can disagree over the merits of S. 25.      Some believe that efforts to regulate campaign financing are      misguided and doomed to failure. But opposition to the wisdom      of S. 25 should not take the form of distorted descriptions      of existing constitutional law. The complexity of existing      campaign financing law in the Supreme Court makes it      impossible to state with certainty what path the future Court      will follow. But I believe that the best reading of existing      precedent renders the foregoing provisions of S. 25      constitutionally defensible. Only Justice Thomas has embraced      the ACLU's absolutist refusal to permit any regulation of      campaign financing.           Respectfully submitted,                                                    Burt Neuborne,                       Legal Director, Brennan Center for Justice.  Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, the reason I asked that the letter be included in the Record is that he says:       I am writing in response to a letter to Senator Mitch      McConnell, dated February 20, 1997, from the American Civil      Liberties Union, arguing that critical provisions of S. 25,      the Bipartisan Campaign Reform Act of 1997, are      unconstitutional under existing Supreme Court precedent. I am      the John Norton Pomeroy Professor of Law at New York      University and Legal Director of the Brennan Center for      Justice. I served as National Legal Director of the American      Civil Liberties Union during the 1980's, and remain active in      defense of the First Amendment. I continue to serve as an      ACLU volunteer counsel. I believe, however, that the ACLU      letter on S. 25 is simply wrong in a number of assertions,      despite the fact that it was written by an able lawyer whom I      respect and admire.  Mr. President, I think it is an interesting rebuttal to the position that the ACLU has taken on S. 25.  I would also like to point out that I have great respect for the ACLU. But there are very few occasions on which I have agreed with the positions that the ACLU has taken on a broad variety of issues.  We can argue the constitutionality of this issue, and, if we win, we will get into the major debate. But I will have a very large body of constitutional opinion--not just the ACLU--as to the constitutionality of the McCain-Feingold bill.  I also suggest again that we have to clean up this system. It is broken. It is out of control. Almost every American agrees with that. Poll after poll after poll is telling us that the American people are cynical about us, the way we are selected, and the system under which money seems to be the determinant factor in the selection of our public servants.  I will continue to seek support both inside the Halls of Congress and outside the beltway, and I and Senator Feingold fully intend to bring this bill up this year. The ideal way that we would seek to do that would be us all sitting down together and coming up with a package as we did on the gift ban, as we did on lobbying reform, as we did on the line-item veto, as we have on a broad variety of reforms we have enacted by near unanimous if not total unanimous agreement.  My message to those who say I am now in favor of campaign finance reform is, as you know, so am I, so are many others, so are most Americans. So let us sit down adhering to principles and recognize what the problems are and sit down as mature individuals and move forward and reform this system for the benefit not only of those of us who have the honor and opportunity to serve today but provide an opportunity for dedicated and outstanding young men and women to serve this Nation in the future in elected office.  I intend to continue to conduct this debate with respect and appreciation for the views of my colleague from Kentucky, Senator McConnell, who disagrees with me, my colleague from the State of Washington, Senator Gorton, and others. I believe that we can strongly disagree on this issue and respect each other's views, and I think the American people deserve a debate that is conducted in an environment of mutual respect. I am happy to say that at least in my view we have conducted this debate on that level during this period of time, recognizing that it is a very emotional issue on both sides. But I think the American people will be far better off if we continue to conduct this debate on the Hollings bill today as well as our overall debate on campaign finance reform in that vein in the future, and I commit to my colleagues that I will conduct it in that fashion.  Mr. President, I yield the floor.
