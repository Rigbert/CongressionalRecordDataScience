President, throughout his life, the late Senator Paul Simon believed that for the United States to be a true world leader, our country and its citizens needed to strengthen our international understanding. In a 1995 floor speech, he posed the question ``Can someone really be considered educated if, upon graduation as an engineer or physician or teacher or journalist or accountant or architect, he or she does not have the most minimal understanding of the rest of the world?'' At the heart of this question was his aspiration for our country to become more internationally aware.  Following the horrific attacks of September 11, 2001--an event that is now 15 years in our past, Senator Simon shared his vision of a world in which peace and security is fostered through mutual understanding and global awareness. He believed the best way to develop this understanding and awareness was through fulling submerse oneself in another culture. Senator Simon saw that the opportunity for this already existed on college campuses through study abroad programs. Study abroad helps students make a connection with another part of the world and begin to develop insight into the perspectives of other nations. By exposing young adults to study abroad, today's students will become more globally aware future leaders.  Unfortunately, as a country, we are falling short of achieving the great vision set forth by Senator Simon. Currently, less than 2 percent of enrolled post-secondary students in the United States study abroad. Furthermore, the students who do study abroad are not reflective of post-secondary enrollment in the United States. Minority students, first generation college students, and community college students are significantly underrepresented among those who do study abroad. These groups of students disproportionately lose out on the remarkable educational opportunities that come along with studying abroad--engaging with other cultures, enhancing foreign language skills, and expanding international knowledge through firsthand experience.  Further, the students who study abroad do so overwhelmingly in just one part of the world. Of all students who study abroad, 40 percent study in just four countries: the United Kingdom, Italy, Spain, and France. An additional 13 percent study in other European countries, meaning that over half of all U.S. students who study abroad do so in Europe. Europe has many valuable and important educational experiences to offer American students. But, increasing the diversity of study abroad destinations allows students to expand their horizons and make connections that will help them develop a global perspective and deeper understanding of the challenges we face in the 21st Century.  In 2004, Congress took the first step towards expanding study abroad when it authorized the Commission on Abraham Lincoln Study Abroad Fellowship Program to provide recommendations to Congress and the President on expanding study abroad programs.  Today, I am honored to carry on the vision laid out by Senator Simon as Senator Wicker and I introduce the Senator Paul Simon Study Abroad Program Act. This legislation takes an important step towards making the vision of Senator Simon a reality based on the recommendations made by the Abraham Lincoln Study Abroad Commission.  It establishes a competitive grant program for institutions of higher education to encourage the sustainable expansion of study abroad opportunities for students in the United States. Over the next 10 years, this grant program aims to increase the overall number of undergraduate students studying abroad each year to one million students. It will place a special emphasis on increasing opportunities for nontraditional and minority students, so that the demographics of students who study abroad more closely reflect the population of current undergraduate students.  This bill will also emphasize getting students to study abroad in nontraditional destinations particularly in developing countries. We need to send more students to developing nations because these are the places that America needs to better understand--countries in Africa, Asia, Latin America, South America, and the Middle East. This legislation takes important steps toward expanding and diversifying participation in study abroad.  I am pleased that several organizations have endorsed this bill including the American Public and Land-grant Universities, Association of International Educators, Partners of the Americas, American Council on Education, the American Association of Community Colleges, the Forum on Education Abroad, the Hispanic Association of Colleges and Universities, and the Association of American Universities.  In today's global society, an undergraduate education that includes a meaningful study abroad experience is more important than ever. Expanded participation in study abroad is necessary to prepare the next generation of Americans with the global knowledge and skills needed for success in an increasingly interconnected world. I thank Senator Wicker for standing with me in this effort and I hope my colleagues will join us.  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be printed in the Record.  There being no objection, the text of the bill was ordered to be printed in the Record, as follows:                                S. 3390       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of      the United States of America in Congress assembled,     SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.       This Act may be cited as the ``Senator Paul Simon Study      Abroad Program Act of 2016''.     SEC. 2. FINDINGS.       Congress makes the following findings:       (1) To prepare students for success in the modern global      economy, opportunities for study abroad should be included as      part of a well-rounded education.       (2) Study abroad programs provide students with      unparalleled access to international knowledge, an unmatched      opportunity to learn foreign languages, and a unique      environment for developing cultural understanding, all of      which are knowledge and skills needed in today's global      economy.       (3) Less than 2 percent of all enrolled postsecondary      students in the United States study abroad for credit in any      given year, and minority students, first generation college      students, and community college students are significantly      underrepresented in study abroad participation.       (4) Congress authorized the establishment of the Commission      on the Abraham Lincoln Study Abroad Fellowship Program      pursuant to section 104 of the Miscellaneous Appropriations      and Offsets Act, 2004 (division H of Public Law 108-199).      Pursuant to its mandate, the Lincoln Commission submitted to      Congress and the President a report of its recommendations      for greatly expanding the opportunity for students at      institutions of higher education in the United States to      study abroad, with special emphasis on studying in developing      nations.       (5) According to the Lincoln Commission, ``[e]xperience      shows that leadership from administrators and faculty will      drive the number of study abroad participants higher and      improve the quality of programs. Such leadership is the only      way that study abroad will become an integral part of the      undergraduate experience.''. A competitive grant program is      necessary to encourage and support such leadership.     SEC. 3. PURPOSES.       The purposes of this Act are--       (1) to ensure that significantly more students have access      to quality study abroad opportunities;       (2) to ensure that the diversity of students studying      abroad reflects the diversity of students and institutions of      higher education in the United States;       (3) to encourage greater diversity in study abroad      destinations by increasing the portion of study abroad that      takes place in nontraditional study abroad destinations,      especially in developing countries; and       (4) to encourage a greater commitment by institutions of      higher education to expand study abroad opportunities.
