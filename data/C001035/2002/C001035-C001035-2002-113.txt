President, I am pleased to join several of my colleagues in rising in support of increased fuel efficiency standards for cars and trucks. Some people have tried to cast this argument as a choice between trucks and better fuel economy. This is simply a false choice. I am convinced that we can, with America's can-do attitude and technological know-how, provide safer, more efficient cars and trucks that will go further on a gallon of gas and save consumers money at the gas pump. CAFE standards will give us better trucks and more money in our pockets.  OPEC's anticompetitive manipulations have driven the price of oil to a 6-month high. If we don't increase CAFE standards, America will only grow more and more dependent on foreign oil. Already we rely on foreign oil for 60 percent of our supply. That is a dangerous dependency. How much further into OPEC's clutches do we have to let ourselves slide before we decide that there is another way, a better way? CAFE is the American way of sending OPEC a message that we will not stand for their anticompetitive manipulative price increases.  Our proposal will save more than 1 million barrels of oil a day. It will save billions of dollars for consumers. And it will do more to reduce our reliance on foreign oil than any other single measure before us.  I call on my colleagues to join me in supporting the proposal to increase CAFE standards. This proposal is the right thing to do for the environment, for the economy, for consumers, and for America.  I commend Senators Kerry, Bingaman, McCain, and my colleague from Maine, Senator Snowe, for their efforts in coming up with an alternative approach.
