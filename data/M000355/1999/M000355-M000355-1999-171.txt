 President, I rise today to pay tribute to a fine businessman, family man and all-around great Kentuckian, Sherman Henderson.  Sherm is a man who exudes the kind of enthusiasm and spunk everybody wants to possess. He has a genuine zest for life. Sherm's energy has helped him found and run one of the countries top 20 fastest-growing private companies, UniDial Communications, Inc. Sherm founded UniDial just six years ago with six employees and, in that short time, has turned UniDial into a 600-employee operation and an unbelievable success story.  Some of the most successful businessmen become great because they see an untapped market and make it theirs--and that is what Sherm has done with the communications industry in UniDial. Intuitively picking up on emerging opportunities in the communications field after the telephone industry was deregulated, Sherm dove into the business head first. He started by investing in other telecommunications companies, and then founded the now-booming UniDial in 1993.  As well as being a great businessman, Sherm has always been a good friend and family man. He boasts a terrific wife, two wonderful children, and two (soon-to-be-three) much-doted-upon grandchildren. Sherm, on behalf of my colleagues and myself, I express my heartfelt admiration for your accomplishments, congratulate you on your success, and wish you the best in your future endeavors. Thank you for creating hundreds of jobs for your fellow Kentuckians, and for making such a significant contribution to our state's economies and communities.  Mr. President, I ask that a copy of an article that ran in the LouisvilleVoice-Tribune on August 25, 1999, be printed in the Record following my remarks.  The article follows.                          Making a Big Splash                          (By Susan McDonald)       Sherman Henderson says a lot of people have trouble      understanding what he does for a living, but he must do it      pretty well.       UniDial Communications Inc., the company he founded with      half a dozen employees only six years ago, is now among the      20 fastest-growing private companies in the country,      according to Inc. magazine. That's not bad for a company      Henderson conceived over breakfast one August morning at a      local Denny's restaurant.       UniDial is now poised for still more growth. The company,      which built its business primarily as a reseller of long-     distance telephone service and other communications products,      is expanding to meet the growing demand for technology,      Henderson said. UniDial recently announced plans to build its      own nationwide telecommunications network, called xios, to      offer integrated data, voice, Internet and other telecom      services. Its new 75,000-square-foot building at Eastpoint      Business Center will soon be followed by more new facilities.       But although UniDial has become a familiar name, its      business remains a mystery to many, Henderson said.       ``It's hard for people to understand what we do,'' he said.      ``We're a communications company. We communicate, and we have      all kinds of vehicles to do it with, whether it's a fax      machine, a voice over a hard line, data transmission,      videoconferencing, conference calls, or whatever.''                          Embracing technology       Henderson and Unidial have capitalized on people's hunger      for more communication and information, he said. Although      Americans are inundated with mail, voice messages, and e-     mail, they want more, said Henderson who can quote a wealth      of facts, figures and statistics about the fast pace of      technology and the factors that drive it.       Still, Henderson, who is in his 50s, said it's difficult      for members of his generation to keep up with the quick pace      of technological advancements.       ``My generation has two problems,'' he said. ``We're not      educated in the field of technology because we didn't grow up      with it. The second strike against our generation is our      habits. We don't embrace technology because we all have gray      hair. To keep up is tremendously tough, even for me, and I'm      in the business.''       Henderson does keep up, though, making extensive use of the      Internet to conduct business, make travel arrangements, shop      and more.       ``I do a lot of fun things, like seeing where the Rolling      Stones are playing next, or where is Elton John playing, or      get information about golf courses,'' he said.                       from diapers to high tech       Henderson's experience in the telecommunications industry      isn't much older than UniDial itself. Before starting the      company, his varied business experience included real estate      development, sales and marketing, and a stint at Proctor &      Gamble, where he ``was the original Pampers guy,'' he said.       ``I was one of the three guys on the team that actually      developed the product back in the 1960s,'' Henderson said.      ``Actually, we didn't create a product. We created an      industry because there was no disposal diaper at that time.''       Henderson began to see the opportunities that emerged after      deregulation of the telephone industry, and he owned other      telecom companies before starting UniDial in 1993. He has      since become a national leader in the industry and is      currently chairman of the Telecommunications Resellers      Association, a 700-member trade organization for businesses      reselling long distance and other services.       Although UniDial is continuing to grow in national      prominence, Henderson, a native of Louisville, said he is      most proud that the company is a home-grown product.       ``The neat thing about this company is that it was founded      here and it was built here,'' he said. ``It was built by      Louisville employees, and it's turned into a nationwide      deal.''       And although the company could operate from anywhere , its      headquarters will stay in Louisville, he said.       ``The opportunity we have as a company is to lead Kentucky      and this part of the country into a development stage for all      these young kids who are coming out of school,'' said      Henderson. ``We want them to stay here and help us build what      is going to be the future, and the future is in technology      and media.''                            energy to spare       Henderson's energy seems boundless, manifesting itself in      foot-tapping and leg-waggling when he is forced to sit down.      During a recent meeting with a group of local business      leaders, ``They were astounded by my energy,'' Henderson      said. ``They said, `You know, Sherm, you're not a young puppy      anymore,' and it's true, but energy comes from your      environment and from the environment that you allow in your      mind.''       Henderson finds outlets for that energy in golf, spending      time with his wife, two children and two grandchildren (with      another on the way), and promoting his beloved Florida State      University Seminoles. Since attending the school on a      swimming scholarship, Henderson has remained active in alumni      activities, including a recently completed stint as chairman      of the Florida State Seminole Boosters. Football coach Bobby      Bowden is a golf partner and someone from whom Henderson said      he has learned a great deal.       ``He's a winner, and you learn from winners,'' Henderson      said. ``If you keep pushing for whatever your objective is,      if you get 80 to 85 percent of that, you win.''       Judging from UniDial's dramatic success, Henderson has      learned some secrets of winning. He gets to know the      company's nearly 600 employees at monthly small-group      lunches, gives managers plenty of autonomy, and tells      colleagues not to be afraid to make mistakes and ``use both      ends of the pencil,'' he said. He has also developed a simple      personal philosophy to help him keep things in perspective.       ``I wake up every day and say this to myself: God first,      family second, and the rest will happen.''                          ____________________
