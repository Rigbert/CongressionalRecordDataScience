 President, I rise today to commend the bi-partisan leaders of the appropriations subcommittee, Chairman Gregg and Senator Hollings, for providing adequate funding to allow the Census Bureau's census 2000 plan to proceed. The funding will permit the census professionals to continue their plan to guarantee that everyone in every city and rural area will be counted.  I ask that when this Appropriations bill goes to conference with the House that the Senate conferees stand united against any effort to reduce the decennial census funding level or micro-manage the professional census gathering process.  I am very concerned about the critical 2000 census, because I believe Senator Gregg and Senator Hollings will face a difficult conference with the House. Contrary to the Senate plan, the House funds the Census Bureau for only six months, crippling the bureau and denying the census professionals the tools they believe will help them conduct the most accurate 2000 census possible.  The House leadership has also challenged the Census Bureau sampling plan in federal court, asserting it violates the United States Constitution. The federal court should proceed with their review, but the Census Bureau professionals need to proceed with their plan, which represents the best efforts of census professionals and academics to measure the population.  Before we look forward to conference, I would like to briefly look back and put the current sampling dispute in its historical context. Regrettably, the public debate over the 2000 census has been dominated by the use of sampling, a simple, statistical method proposed by the Census Bureau to count the historically ``difficult to count'' populations of the nation's urban and rural poor. The Bureau's sampling plan was developed in direct response to the unprecedented census error rates in 1990, the first census in US history to be both more costly and less accurate than the census that preceded it.  Why is an accurate census important for the nation? The decennial census is the basis for distributing funds throughout the country for more than one hundred federal programs.       Is the local police force eligible for federal grants for      cops on the beat or drug education programs? Check the      census, which sets eligibility for Byrne grants, DARE funds      or community policing grants.       How about education funds for schools? The census      determines title one or title two education grants.       How about funds for homelessness, mass transit or other      transportation funds? Again, the census determines state and      local government eligibility for Social Services block grant      money, highway and mass transit grants.       What about health care for low-income families? Again, the      census helps set state Medicaid reimbursement levels.  The census is instrumental for the effective administration of government at all levels, providing the basis for distributing billions of dollars throughout the country through hundreds of programs. The nation cannot afford the error rates and inaccuracy experienced in the 1990 census.  The General Accounting Office, the investigative arm of Congress, concluded the 1990 census failed to count about 15 million Americans, while an additional 11 million Americans were double-counted. The California population was undercounted by more than 2.7%, representing 20% of the nation's net undercount.  If we squander this opportunity for reform and the 2000 census proves to be equally inaccurate as its 1990 predecessor, between 5 and 6 million individuals, would be ``missed.'' If we do not reform our census plan, 1 to 1.2 million Californians, 3% of the state's population, will fail to be counted. If the census misses 1 million people in California, about 300,000 children will not be counted, depressing state education funding and seriously compromising education in the state.  Mr. President, concerns for undercounting the United States population are as old as the nation itself. Thomas Jefferson, transmitting the first census to President Washington, commented, ``we know in fact that the omissions have been very great.'' However, the Census Bureau sampling plan, which enjoys the support of the National Academy of Sciences, academics and census professionals, is a reasoned response to the unprecedented error rates of the 1990 census. Congress cannot make the same mistake again.  The Census Bureau plan needs to go forward. It's time to allow the census professionals to implement their best plan to improve on the 1990 undercount and deliver the most accurate 2000 census possible.  I thank the chairman, Senator Gregg, and ranking Democrat, Senator Hollings, for their efforts and extend my continuing support.                        iraq war crimes tribunal
