Mr. Chairman, I move to strike the requisite number of words.  Mr. Chairman, there is a lot of information being disseminated by members of this committee that this is a stacked deck against Commonwealth. I would respectfully ask them to read the bill. In fact, it enhances the Commonwealth position. I am a little bit concerned that the type of information being displayed and disseminated by other members of this House to those that did vote in favor of the Young-Miller-McCollum-Burton amendment ought to understand that this bill has been carefully crafted contrary to what people may say, and only the Congress has the right to define what Commonwealth is.                              {time}  1945  Only the Congress. And so, Mr. Chairman, those who will be watching this debate on television should reconsider some of the information they have received in the very few minutes since the last vote. I just ask Members to do that as they watch this debate, to understand that we have crafted this bill very balanced and very straightforward.  Those who say the bill has not seriously considered commonwealth, look at the original text. I did not be even include commonwealth in it. But because supporters of commonwealth came to me, we wrote with the gentleman from California (Mr. Miller) a definition that does give them advantage. I would just like to suggest that we stick to the script.
