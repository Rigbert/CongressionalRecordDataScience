Speaker, I yield myself as much time as I may consume.  Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of H.R. 1104. On this day, it is wise for the House to consider a bill to increase certainty for taxpayers. This bill brings clarity to what has historically been uncertain tax treatment for contributions to social welfare organizations, agricultural associations, labor unions, and trade associations.  With this bill, Mr. Speaker, amounts contributed to such organizations will not be subject to the gift tax.  Mr. Speaker, I urge all of my colleagues on both sides of the aisle to vote ``yes'' for H.R. 1104.  Mr. Speaker, I thank my colleagues, the chairman, the chairs of the subcommittee, and all of the members of the committee for supporting this piece of legislation and the other pieces.  I reserve the balance of my time.
