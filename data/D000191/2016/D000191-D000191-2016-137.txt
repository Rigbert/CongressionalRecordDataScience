Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.  Well, I think this is the fifth time we have debated this issue on the floor, clearly, subject to widely disparate interpretation in terms of where we are and how we best move forward.  I am not going to regurgitate the arguments. They have all been made. Not everybody has said it, but they have all been made.  But, again, I think that the best way forward--I mean, first off, this resolution is going to be vetoed. It will go back to the Senate first because it is a Senate bill, and the Senate showed clearly that they are far, far short of a veto override. So that will be the end of it, unless we want to take it up for the sixth time in the House and pretend that somehow, by overriding a veto in the House, if that could happen, that we are going to compel the Senate to re-re-reconsider its failure to override the veto.  Hopefully we won't go through that charade. We don't have very many legislative days this year. I think that time would be better spent, perhaps, on initiating hearings and looking toward, in the next Congress, Congress exerting its constitutional authority to revisit the Clean Water Act, which hasn't been revisited in 27 years.  We have learned a lot about waters of the United States in the last 27 years, what needs to be protected and what can be exempted. We have certainly learned a lot since the Bush era when a rule was written that indiscriminately covers ditches, and other features of farms and roadwork. That was a mistake.  So we could, I believe, probably, like we did with the WRRDA bill in the last Congress, or the surface transportationbill in this Congress, have a pretty vigorous debate, but come up with a decent way forward, because nobody disagrees over the need for clean water in this country. It is a precious, precious commodity.  I yield back the balance of my time.
