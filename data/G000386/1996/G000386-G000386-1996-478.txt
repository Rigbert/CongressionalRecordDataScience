 President, I rise to support the Harkin amendment. I had filed an amendment virtually identical to this, that I will place in the Record.  Due to the unanimous-consent agreement reached last night between the 2 leaders, the Republicans could offer only 5 amendments, while the Democrats are able to offer 10.  Because of this limitation, I was not able to offer the amendment, so I will lend my support to the Harkin amendment.  The Harkin amendment will lower the caps to determine what livestock producers are eligible for cost-share funds under the new Environmental Quality Incentive Program.  Mr. President, it is good public policy to assist farmers in complying with environmental regulations; the environment benefits, the public benefits, and agriculture benefits. Farmers who grow corn, soybeans, cotton, wheat, and many other crops have for many years received cost-share funds to implement environmental measures.  So, I approve of extending this assistance to livestock producers. However, there needs to be limits on what producers can receive USDA funds.  In the original farm bill, contained in the Balanced Budget Act, the Senate approved limits on what producers can receive funds. Only hog producers with less than 2,500 hogs and cattle producers with less than 1,000 head of cattle were eligible.  But when this provision went into conference, these caps were raised to 15,000 hogs and 10,000 cattle. So now every large livestock continent and every factory hog farm can receive money from the U.S. Department of Agriculture to help them comply with regulations.  The problem is, these type of farmers already have the capital to implement these measures. In fact, the Clean Water Act already requires them to do so.  This may not be a bad thing if Congress had an infinite amend of money to spend on this problem. But we do not.  In fact, under this bill only $100 million is authorized for livestock assistance each year. With this limited amount of money, it is essential that we target assistance to the independent pork producer who is forced to compete with the large factory-type hog farmers.  The independent hog producer can compete in this environment only if they have a level playing field. Providing funds to large factory farmers skews this playing field.  The caps in the originally passed Senate bill were reasonable--as are the caps in the Harkin amendment. I urge my colleagues to support the amendment.  I ask unanimous consent that my amendment be printed in the Record so that you know exactly my intentions.  There being no objection, the text of the amendment was ordered to be printed in the Record, as follows:         amendment to substitute amendment no. 3184 to S. 1541    (Purpose: To target benefits under the Livestock Environmental  Assistance Program to family farmers and to limit the amount any one                           farmer can receive)       Page 3-14, line 25 strike ``10,000'' and replace with      ``1000''.       Page 3-15, line 3 strike ``15,000'' and replace with      ``2500''.       Page 3-27, line 11 insert a period after ``$10,000'' and      strike everything through line 12.
