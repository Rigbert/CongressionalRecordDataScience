Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.  Mr. Speaker, I am pleased to rise today and speak in strong support of H.R. 3409, the Coast Guard Reauthorization Act of 2019. This is genuinely bipartisan legislation which will reauthorize funding for the United States Coast Guard Federal Maritime Commission for fiscal years 2020 and 2021.  The bill also advances other important provisions to help both the economic competitiveness and effective regulation of the U.S. maritime industry.  It is the latest in a long line of major legislation from this committee, reported to the House on a bipartisan basis and underpinning essential functions of government such as, in this case, the United States Coast Guard and the Federal Maritime Commission.  I couldn't have better partners than I had: my ranking member, Sam Graves; the chair of the Subcommittee on Coast Guard and Maritime Transportation, Sean Patrick Maloney; and the ranking subcommittee member, Representative   Bob Gibbs. They worked hard on this legislation, and many of their concerns were included in the final product. Each of them has joined as an original cosponsor, which I appreciate.  We have also worked with other members of the committee on both sides of the aisle and the House to include provisions that address concerns raised by them or their constituents.  We all know that, over the last few years, the Coast Guard budgets have been inadequate, mostly a byproduct of mandatory cuts imposed by the so-called Budget Control Act. This inadequate funding has left the Coast Guard, as Admiral Schultz has said, at a tipping point. This legislation, at long last, begins to reverse that downward spiral.  Mr. Speaker, there is $11 billion for the Coast Guard's discretionary budget for fiscal years 2020 and 2021. This tracks the recently increased appropriations of the last 2 fiscal years and builds in a 2 percent inflation adjustment to arrive at the highest authorized funding levels for the Coast Guard in recent memory.  Is that totally adequate? No, it isn't. But it is at least incremental progress in a time where we aren't seeing a lot of progress on a lot of things these days.  I am particularly please that the top-line numbers for procurement, acquisitions, and improvement have been pushed up to $2.7 billion and $2.8 billion. That means the Coast Guard should be able to maintain its ongoing recapitalization programs, including the critically important offshore patrol cutter; the new fleet of polar security cutters, which will be absolutely vital to deal particularly with the opening of the Northwest Passage; and, also, to continue critical support for our assets and activities in Antarctica.  It wasn't a great year for the Coast Guard when we had the stupid government shutdown. They were continuing to carry out their critical homeland security duties in addition to their daily lifesaving duties and their drug interdiction duties, many in a high-risk profession, and yet they weren't being paid.  They were escorting the subs out of Bremerton. The sailors were being paid on the subs. The Coast Guard, which was providing critical surface support and protection, was not being paid.  I had originally included in this legislation provisions to assure that the Coast Guard would be paid in case of another government shutdown. Unfortunately, the very stupid budget rules we have around here say that we will pretend that they will never be paid--and if that is the case, then we won't have a Coast Guard anymore--therefore, to mandatorily pay them during a shutdown would count as new deficit, like we are never going to pay them.  It is a pretty dumb rule, but those concerns were raised by people above my pay grade, and I reluctantly removed the provision from the bill. I am going to continue to push for that provision as we move forward through the appropriations process and elsewhere. I will look for any opportunity I can to recognize the service of the Coast Guard.  There is also, in this bill, a modest $1.4 million increase in the budget of the Federal Maritime Commission. This will help them implement the most extensive package of amendments to the Ocean Shipping Reform Act since 1998, particularly looking at antitrust oversight of foreign-flag commercial carrier alliances that transport nearly 98 percent of U.S. foreign commerce.  Our overreliance on foreign-flag carriers to move the commerce of the United States is a growing liability and, yet, unintended consequence of our trade policies. Only now are we beginning to recognize and grapple with the implications of this dependence on our national and economic security.  The increased authorized funding of $29 million for the operating budget should provide them with the additional resources they need to actually be a cop on the beat and ensure foreign carriers abide by fair shipping practices and compliance with all U.S. antitrust requirements.  I am also pleased with provisions that would boost coastwise trades and, potentially, our shipbuilding industry.  We are reaffirming, yet again, long-term support for the Jones Act, including clarifications as to how the Jones Act applies to maritime transportation and heavy-lift activities that occur offshore.  I believe the language in this bill strikes a sensible path forward. I look forward to resolving any outstanding questions and concerns in conference with the United States Senate.  Just as important, the bill provides new authorities to address new or emerging ocean technologies, including unmanned systems, to ensure Coast Guard has enough competence to either use, or regulate the use of, said systems; amendments to build on progress made last Congress to improve maritime safety requirements; and it strengthens standards to prevent discrimination, sexual assault and harassment and promote gender equity in the Coast Guard at the U.S. Merchant Marine Academy and across the U.S. maritime industry.  This is vital legislation to the Coast Guard, and the maritime shipyard workers across this country.  Again, I want to thank my colleagues.  Mr. Speaker, I urge an ``aye'' vote, and I reserve the balance of my time.                                         House of Representatives,                               Committee on Homeland Security,                                    Washington, DC, July 16, 2019.     Hon. Peter DeFazio,     Chairman, Committee on Transportation and Infrastructure,          House of Representatives, Washington, DC.       Dear Chairman Defazio: I write to you regarding H.R. 3409,      the ``Coast Guard Authorization Act of 2019.''       H.R. 3409 contains provisions that fall within the      jurisdiction of the Committee on Homeland Security. I      recognize and appreciate your desire to bring this      legislation before the House in an expeditious manner and,      accordingly, I will not seek a sequential referral of the      bill. However, agreeing to waive consideration of this bill      should not be construed as the Committee on Homeland Security      waiving, altering, or otherwise affecting its jurisdiction      over subject matters contained in the bill which fall within      its Rule X jurisdiction.       Further, I request your support for the appointment of      Homeland Security conferees during any House-Senate      conference convened on this or similar legislation. I also      ask that a copy of this letter and your response be included      in the legislative report on H.R. 3409 and in the      Congressional Record during floor consideration of this bill.       I look forward to working with you as we prepare to pass      this important legislation.           Sincerely,                                               Bennie G. Thompson,     Chairman.                                  ____         House of Representatives, Committee on Transportation and            Infrastructure,                                    Washington, DC, July 17, 2019.     Hon. Bennie G. Thompson,     Chairman, Committee on Homeland Security, U.S. House of          Representatives, Washington, DC.       Dear Chairman Thompson: Thank you for your letter regarding      H.R. 3409, the Coast Guard Reauthorization Act of 2019, which      was ordered to be reported out of the Committee on      Transportation and Infrastructure on June 26, 2019. I      appreciate your willingness to work cooperatively on this      legislation.       I acknowledge that by foregoing a sequential referral on      H.R. 3409, the Committee on Homeland Security does not waive      any future jurisdictional claims to provisions in this or      similar legislation. In addition, should a conference on the      bill be necessary, I would support your effort to seek      appointment of an appropriate number of conferees to any      House-Senate conference involving provisions within this      legislation on which the Committee on Homeland Security has a      valid jurisdictional claim.       I appreciate your cooperation regarding this legislation,      and I will ensure that our exchange of letters is included in      the Congressional Record during floor consideration of H.R.      3409.           Sincerely,                                                 Peter A. DeFazio,                                                            Chair.                              {time}  1330
