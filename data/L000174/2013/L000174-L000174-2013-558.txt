President, we are going to vote in a couple minutes, but I would reiterate what I said earlier. This is going to be a vote on the Trafficking Victims Protection Reauthorization Act. It is a bill that was written with the input of victims and service providers. Last year, we had 57 cosponsors, including 15 Republicans.  I do want to thank Senator Rubio, who was on the floor a few minutes ago speaking about it.  I could not help but think, as I said earlier, when I looked at the calendar today, February 12--the day on which Abraham Lincoln was born; and 150 years ago, he delivered the Emancipation Proclamation--wouldn't it be great if the Senate passed the Trafficking Victims Protection Reauthorization Act on President Lincoln's birthday?  I also said earlier today that the Senate should be--often is--the conscience of the Nation. I have to imagine that the conscience of the vast majority of our 300 million Americans--whether they are Republicans or Democrats; liberals, moderates, or conservatives; Independents--their conscience would rebel against the idea of, really, slave trafficking, whether it is people trapped in the sex trade or in factories where they face the possibility, if there is a fire, they are all going to die because they are forced to be there.  Let's speak. Let's speak to the conscience of this country.  Mr. President, have the yeas and nays been ordered on my amendment?
