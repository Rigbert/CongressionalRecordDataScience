Speaker, I rise today to honor my friend, Jack Valenti--a man whose prowess as a lobbyist for the movie industry was outshined only by the passion he brought to his work and the steadfast love he had for our country. Jack was a trusted Presidential advisor, a war hero, an author and a pioneer in the American industry.  As President of the Motion Picture Association of America, Jack was one of the most hardworking and dedicated advocates you would find anywhere on Capitol Hill. When he spoke, people listened--and by inventing the movie industry's rating system, he demonstrated just how vital America's business community can be in providing for the common good.  Jack was a consummate professional, a good friend, and someone that I will never forget. My deepest sympathies go out to his family and friends as we mark his passing and commemorate a life that meant so much to people all across this great land.
