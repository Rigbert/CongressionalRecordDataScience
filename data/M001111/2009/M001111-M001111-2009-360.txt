 President, I thank my colleague Senator Reed for his hard work on this bill. Unfortunately, our homeless shelters and our schools are seeing an increasing number of families and children experiencing homelessness and seeking services. This bill comes at an important time. And I am particularly pleased with the emphasis placed on prevention and rapid rehousing, and efforts to better serve homeless individuals, such as victims of domestic violence.  Mr. President, I would like to inquire of my colleagues Senator Reed andChairman Dodd regarding the definition of homelessness in HEARTH Act and amendment No. 1040.
