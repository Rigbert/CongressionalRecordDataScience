 Lastly, I would ask the gentleman, I have served on the Committee on Appropriations for many years. We have not marked up yet, as the gentleman knows, any bills in subcommittee nor, obviously, in full committee at this point in time. In fact, we have not been given 302(b) allocation, as the leader knows. Would the leader be able to tell us what schedule he now foresees for appropriations bills and when we might do the 302(b) allocations?  Mr. DeLAY. The gentleman is absolutely correct. We are way behind in our appropriations process. I am very concerned about that. We had hoped that this year that the House and the Senate could work out an agreement of allocation so that we could work together more smoothly than we have in the past as two bodies. We are still hopeful that we can get that kind of an agreement. But I anticipate the mark-ups in the subcommittee to begin, and I am very hopeful they can start beginning next week. But it is still probably a little too early to tell.
