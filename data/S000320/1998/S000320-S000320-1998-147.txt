 President, I rise in support of Senate Joint Resolution 42, the resolution of disapproval.  Much has already been said on this issue, and I will make my comments brief.  The United States Government has been working with the Government of Mexico for over a decade on fighting the flow of drugs.  Year after year, we have received promises, commitments, and declarations to reduce the flow of narcotics from Mexico. But we have not seen the concrete actions that are required to block the flow of cocaine, heroin, and marijuana into the United States.  For example, in 1997, Mexico agreed to facilitate the extradition of narcotics traffickers. In fact, no Mexican national has been extradited and surrendered to the United States as a result of that agreement.  In a recent hearing, the Senate Select Committee on Intelligence heard from witnesses from the Justice Department, the Central Intelligence Agency, and the Drug Enforcement Administration on the status of Mexican antidrug efforts.  While I cannot go into detail, their testimony was not at all optimistic and was, in fact, extremely disturbing to me.  Of greatest concern is the endemic corruption that runs rampant at all levels throughout those Mexican institutions tasked with combating narcotics trafficking.  The story on the front page of today's New York Times, describing corruption in the ranks of the Mexican military is, if accurate, especially disturbing, since the military is considered less corrupt than the Federal police force.  While Mexican officials often speak of efforts to prevent this corruption, no definitive steps have been taken to target the illicit drug monies that make this corruption possible. New laws are discussed, debated, in some cases even enacted, but they are not implemented.  And while there have been a few highly publicized prosecutions of corrupt officials, many more are allowed to retire or are simply reassigned.  I wonder whether criminal prosecution is selective and whether such determinations are themselves reflections of such corruption.  Again, actions speak louder than words.  I understand that the Clinton administration and other regional governments are discussing the concept of a regional approach to drug cooperation certification, to replace the current process.  I have serious doubts about replacing the current system with regional certification, since the almost certain result would be that Mexico and others would be given a pass rather than being held accountable for their actions. Simply stated, it would make certification a meaningless process of averaging an array of mediocre and poor performances.  Furthermore, before considering Mexico as a member of such a regional group, we should consider Mexico's participation in current regional counternarcotics efforts. It is hardly encouraging.  For example, the Joint Inter-Agency Task Force located in Key West, FL, is one such organization. It includes representatives from all of the United States armed services, as well as law enforcement agencies, and an equal contribution from our British and Dutch allies.  I urge my colleagues to visit the Task Force and hear their frustrations regarding Mexico. Again, while Mexico says it is using every asset to prevent the transshipment of drugs into the United States, the officials there will tell you this is just not so.  They cite example after example of the detection and tracking of drug-carrying ships and planes.  But when it comes to handing off these targets to the Mexican authorities, there is either no response or such a limited and late response, the traffickers often escape and disappear into Mexico.  When we make informal suggestions that Mexico send its representatives to the multi-national task force to correct this problem, the response is that they are willing to discuss it. But, they have been discussing it for several years now.  Mr. President, for these reasons I strongly support the resolution to decertify Mexico. It is time to judge Mexico on its actions rather than empty promises.                          ____________________
