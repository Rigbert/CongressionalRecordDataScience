President, if the Democratic leader can yield for a question, I ask the Senator from South Dakota--and I am looking around the floor, and I see a number of Senators on the floor. I see only two who have served here longer than I. I ask my question in the form of that context.  In the 24 years I have been here, Democrats have been twice in the majority, twice in the minority. Thus, the Republicans twice in the minority and twice in the majority. Would it not be the experience of the Senator from South Dakota, as it has been mine, that no matter which party was in the majority, the Senate and the Senate rules and those who have led the Senate have always reflected the need of the Senate rules to protect both sides, both the majority and the minority, so that the United States of America would know that there was a full debate on real issues where all voices were heard, not just the voice maybe of temporarily the majority, but all voices would be heard?  And would it not be the experience of the Senator from South Dakota that this procedure, something I have not seen in my 24 years here, this procedure is said to make sure there will not be a vote where all Americans are heard, will make sure there is not a debate where all Americans are heard, but will be done in such a way that only one segment of our country will be heard? Will that not be the experience of the Senator from South Dakota?
