Mr. Speaker, yesterday several of my colleagues on the Helsinki Commission--Representatives Hoyer, Markey, Cardin, and Salmon--joined me in introducing a sense of the Congress resolution with respect to the human rights situation in the Republic of Turkey and that country's desire to host the next Summit Meeting of the Heads of State or Government of the Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe [OSCE]. Turkey--an OSCE country since 1975--first proposed to host the next summit meeting nearly a year ago. Shortly after this proposal surfaced, I wrote to then-Secretary of State Christopher on November 22, 1996, together with the Helsinki Commission's co-chairman, Senator D'Amato, to raise concerns over human rights violations in Turkey and to urge rejection of the Turkish proposal unless the human rights situation improved. We wrote to Secretary Albright on July 15, 1997 expressing concern over the lack of human rights progress in Turkey. Unfortunately, Turkey has squandered the opportunity to demonstrate its determination to improve implementation of Ankara's freely undertaken OSCE commitments over the past 11 months.  Without reciting the lengthy list of Turkey's human rights violations, including the use of torture, it is fair to say that Turkey's record of implementation of OSCE human dimension commitments remains poor. The Committee to Protect Journalists has documented the fact that at least 47 Turkish journalists--the largest number of any country in the world--remain imprisoned. Four former parliamentarians from the now banned Kurdish-based Democracy Party [DEP], including Leyla Zana, remain imprisoned. Turkey has pursued an aggressive campaign of harassment of non-governmental organizations over the past year. The Department of State has found that serious human rights problems persist in Turkey and that human rights abuses have not been limited to the southeast, where Turkey has engaged in an armed conflict with the terrorist Kurdistan Workers Party [PKK] for over a decade.  Last week, Mr. Speaker, the Congress honored His All Holiness Bartholomew, the leader of Orthodox believers worldwide. The Ecumenical Patriarchate, located in Istanbul--the city proposed by Turkey as the venue for the next OSCE summit, has experienced many difficulties. The Ecumenical Patriarchate, has repeatedly requested permission to reopen the Orthodox seminary on the island of Halki closed by the Turkish authorities since the 1970's despite Turkey's OSCE commitment to ``allow the training of religious personnel in appropriate institutions.'' The Turkish Embassy here in Washington viewed the visit, according to its press release, ``as an excellent opportunity to forge closer ties of understanding, friendship and cooperation among peoples of different faiths and ethnicities.'' Unfortunately, this spirit has not characterized the Turkish Government's relations with the Patriarchate and Orthodox believers in Turkey.  Mr. Speaker, the United States should encourage the development of genuine democracy in Turkey, based on protection of human rights and fundamental freedoms. Those who would turn a blind eye toward Turkey's ongoing and serious human rights violations hinder the process of democratization in that important country. Poised at the crossroads of Europe, the Caucasus, Central Asia and the Middle East, Turkey is well positioned to play a leading role in shaping developments in Europe and beyond. But to be an effective and positive role model abroad--as some have suggested Turkey might be for the countries of Central Asia--Turkey must get its house in order. Uncorrected, Turkey's human rights problems will only fester and serve a stumbling block along the path of that country's further integration into Europe.  It is also important to keep in mind, Mr. Speaker, that Turkey is not new to the OSCE process. The Turks are not the new kids on the block. Turkey's current President, Suleyman Demirel, was an original signer of the 1975 Helsinki Final Act. The time has come for Turkey to focus on putting into practice the human rights commitments Ankara has freely accepted over the past 22 years.  The privilege and prestige of hosting an OSCE summit should be reserved for participating States that have demonstrated steadfast support for Helsinki principles and standards--particularly respect for human rights--in word and in deed. Such linkage is not new in the OSCE. When, in the mid-1980's Moscow expressed an interest in hosting a human rights conference of Helsinki signatory states, the United States and several other OSCE countries insisted on specific human rights improvements before they would agree to the Kremlin's proposal. This approach contributed to a tremendous improvement in Russia's human rights record. Should we expect any less from our allies in Ankara?  For starters, the United States should insist that Turkey release the imprisoned DEP parliamentarians, including Leyla Zana, as well as journalists and others detained for the nonviolent expression of their views; end the persecution of medical professionals and NGO's who provide treatment to victims of torture and expose human rights abuses; abolish Article 8 of the Anti-Terror Law, Article 312 of the Penal Code, and other statutes which violate the principle of freedom of expression and ensure full respect for the civil, political, and cultural rights of citizens of Turkey, including ethnic Kurds; and begin to aggressively prosecute those responsible for torture, including members of the security forces.  A key ingredient to resolving these and other longstanding human rights concerns is political will. Developments in Turkey over the past few days underscore the sad state of human rights in Turkey. Last week we learned of the imprisonment, reportedly for up to 23 years, of Esber Yagmurdereli, for a speech he made in 1991. The same day, a three-judge panel backed down after police officers accused of torturing 14 young people back in 1995 refused to appear in court. Frankly, such developments have become almost commonplace in Turkey, dulling the appreciation of some for the human tragedy of those involved in such cases.  A decision on the venue of the next OSCE summit will require the consensus of all OSCE participating States, including the United States.  The resolution we introduced, Mr. Speaker, does not call for an outright rejection of Ankara's bid to host an OSCE summit, but urges the United States to refuse to give consensus to such a proposal until such time as the Government of Turkey has demonstrably improved implementation of its freely undertaken OSCE commitments, including their properly addressing those human rights concerns I have touched on today. Our resolution calls for the President to report to the Congress by April 15, 1998 on any improvement in the actual human rights record in Turkey. We should be particularly insistent on improvements in that country's implementation of provisions of the Helsinki Final Act and other OSCE documents.  Simply put, Mr. Speaker, Turkey's desire to host an OSCE summit must be matched by concrete steps to improve its dismal human rights record. Promises of improved human rights alone should not suffice.  Mr. Speaker, I ask that correspondence between the Helsinki Commission and the State Department be included in the Record.                                        Commission on Security and                                        Cooperation in Europe,                                    Washington, DC, July 15, 1997.     Hon. Madeleine Korbel Albright,     Secretary of State,     Washington, DC.       Dear Madam Secretary: We write to reiterate and further      explain our steadfast opposition to Turkey as the venue for      an Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe (OSCE)      summit meeting and ask the Department, which we understand      shares our view, to maintain the United States' refusal to      give consensus to the Turkish proposal that the next summit      should be held in Istanbul. We also observe that a rigid      schedule of biennial summit meetings of the OSCE Heads of      State or Government appears to be unwarranted at this stage      of the OSCE's development and suggest that serious      consideration be given to terminating the mandate which      currently requires such meetings to be held whether      circumstances warrant them or not.       Last November, the Republic of Turkey--an original OSCE      participating State--first proposed Istanbul as the site for      the next OSCE summit. At that time, we wrote to Secretary      Christopher urging that the United States reject this      proposal. A decision was postponed until the Copenhagen      Ministerial, scheduled for this December, and the Lisbon      Document simply noted Turkey's invitation.       The United States should withhold consensus on any proposal      to hold an OSCE summit in Turkey until and unless Ankara has      released the imprisoned Democracy Party (DEP)      parliamentarians, journalists and others detained for the      non-violent expression of their views; ended the persecution      of medical professionals and NGOs who provide treatment to      victims of torture and expose human rights abuses; and begun      to aggressively prosecute those responsible for torture,      including members of the security forces.       In addition, the United States should urge the Government      of Turkey to undertake additional steps aimed at improving      its human rights record, including abolishing Article 8 of      the Anti-Terror Law, Article 312 of the Penal Code, and other      statues which violate the principle of freedom of expression      and ensuring full respect for the civil, political, and      cultural rights of members of national minorities, including      ethnic Kurds.       Regrettably, there has been no improvement in Turkey's      implementation of OSCE human rights commitments in the eight      months since our original letter to the Department. Despite a      number of changes in Turkish law, the fact of the matter is      that even these modest proposals have not translated into      improved human rights in Turkey.     Ankara's flagrant violations of OSCE standards and norms      continues and the problems raised by the United States      Delegation to the OSCE Review Meeting last November persist.       Expert witnesses at a recent Commission briefing      underscored the continued, well-documented, and widespread      use of torture by Turkish security forces and the failure of      the Government of Turkey to take determined action to correct      such gross violations of OSCE provisions and international      humanitarian law. Even the much heralded reduction of periods      for the detention of those accused of certain crimes has      failed to deter the use of torture. The fact is that this      change on paper is commonly circumvented by the authorities.      As one U.S. official in Turkey observed in discussion with      Commission staff, a person will be held in incommunicado      detention for days, then the prisoner's name will be      postdated for purposes of official police logs giving the      appearance that the person has been held within the period      provided for under the revised law. Turkish authorities also      continue to persecute those who attempt to assist the victims      of torture, as in the case of Dr. Tufan Kose.       Despite revisions in the anti-Terror Law, its provision      continue to be broadly used against writers, journalists,      publishers, politicians, musicians, and students.      Increasingly, prosecutors have applied Article 312 of the      Criminal Code, which forbids ``incitement to racial or ethnic      enmity.'' Government agents continue to harass human rights      monitors. According to a recent report issued by the      Committee to Protect Journalists, 78 journalists were in jail      in Turkey at the beginning of 1997--more than in any other      country in the world.       Many human rights abuses have been targeted at Kurds who      publicly or politically assert their Kurdish identity. The      Kurdish Cultural and Research Foundation offices in Istanbul      were closed by police in June to prevent the teaching of      Kurdish language classes. In addition, four former      parliamentarians from the now banned Kurdish-based Democracy      Party (DEP): Leyla Zana, Hatip Dicle, Orhan Dogan, and Selim      Sadak, who have completed three years of their 15-year      sentences, remain imprisoned at Ankara's Ulucanlar Prison.      Among the actions cited in Leyla Zana's indictment was her      appearance before the Helsinki Commission. The Lawyers      Committee for Human Rights has expressed concern over the      case of human rights lawyer Hasan Dogan, a member of the      People's Democracy Party (HADEP), who, like many members of      the party, has been subject to detention and prosecution.       The Government of Turkey has similarly pursued an      aggressive campaign of harassment of non-governmental      organizations, including the Human Rights Foundation of      Turkey and the Human Rights Association. An Association forum      on capital punishment was banned in early May as was a peace      conference sponsored by international and Turkish NGOs. Human      Rights Association branch offices in Diyarbakir, Malatya,      Izmir, Konya, and Urga has been raided and closed.       As the Department's own report on human rights practices in      Turkey recently concluded, Ankara ``was unable to sustain      improvements made in 1995 and, as a result, its record was      uneven in 1996 and deteriorated in some respects.'' While      Turkish civilian authorities remain publicly committed to the      establishment of a rule of law state and respect for human      rights, torture, excessive use of force, and other serious      human rights abuses by the security forces continue. It is      most unfortunate that Turkey's leaders, including      President Demirel--who originally signed the 1975 Helsinki      Final Act on behalf of Turkey--have not been able to      effectively address long-standing human rights concerns.       Madam Secretary, the privilege and prestige of hosting such      an OSCE event should be reserved for participating States      that have demonstrated their support for Helsinki principles      and standards--particularly respect for human rights--in both      word and in deed. Turkey should not be allowed to serve as      host of such a meeting given that country's dismal human      rights record.       While some may argue that allowing Turkey to host an OSCE      summit meeting might provide political impetus for positive      change, we are not convinced, particularly in light of the      failure of the Turkish Government to improve the human rights      situation in the eight months since it proposed to host the      next OSCE summit. We note that several high-level conferences      have been held in Turkey without any appreciable impact on      that country's human rights policies or practices.       Promises of improved human rights alone should not suffice.      Turkey's desire to host an OSCE summit must be matched by      concrete steps to improve its dismal human rights record.       We appreciate your consideration of our views on this      important matter and look forward to receiving your reply.           Sincerely,                                             Christopher H. Smith,                                                      Co-Chairman.                                                  Alfonse D'Amato,     Chairman.                                  ____                                     U.S. Department of State,                            Washington, DC, 20520 August 13, 1997.     Hon. Christopher H. Smith,     Co-Chairman, Commission on Security and Cooperation in          Europe, House of Representatives.       Dear Mr. Chairman: I am responding on behalf of the      Secretary of State to your July 15 letter regarding your      concerns about the possible selection of Turkey as the venue      for the next summit meeting of the Organization for Security      and Cooperation in Europe (OSCE).       The Department of State shares your concerns about Turkey's      human rights record. All states participating in the OSCE are      expected to adhere to the principles of the Helsinki Final      Act and other OSCE commitments, including respect for human      rights and fundamental freedoms. The U.S. Government has      consistently called attention to human rights problems in      Turkey and has urged improvements. It does not in any way      condone Turkey's, or any other OSCE state's, failure to      implement OSCE commitments.       The OSCE, however, is also a means of addressing and      correcting human rights shortcomings. As you note in your      letter, the issue of Turkey's human rights violations was      raised at the November OSCE Review Meeting, and will likely      continue to be raised at such meetings until Turkey      demonstrates that it has taken concrete measures to improve      its record. Holding the summit in Turkey could provide an      opportunity to influence Turkey to improve its human rights      record.       As you note, the Turkish government has made some effort to      address problem areas, through the relaxation of restrictions      on freedom of expression and the recent promulgation of legal      reforms which, if fully implemented, would begin to address      the torture problem. These measures are only a first step in      addressing the problems that exist, but we believe they      reflect the commitment of the Turkish government to address      its human rights problems. We have been particularly      encouraged by the positive attitude the new government, which      came to power July 12, has demonstrated in dealing with human      rights issues.       As you know, the fifty-four nations of the OSCE will      discuss the question of a summit venue. As in all OSCE      decisions, any decision will have to be arrived at through      consensus, which will likely take some time to achieve. In      the meantime, the Department of State welcomes our views, and      will seriously consider your concerns about the OSCE summit      site. I welcome your continuing input on this issue, and      thank you for your thoughtful letter.       We appreciate your letter and hope this information is      helpful. Please do not hesitate to contact us again if we can      be of further assistance.           Sincerely,                                               Barbara Larkin,                                              Assistant Secretary,                                              Legislative Affairs.                               ____________________
