 President, I rise today to honor the Kentucky Army National Guard for surpassing its recruiting goal for the eighth consecutive year, a feat which appears to be without precedent in the U.S.  This recent achievement is indicative of the Kentucky Army National Guard's strong presence and dedicated service to the Commonwealth and to the Nation. Over 14,000 Kentucky Army and Air National Guard troops havebravely served our country in overseas deployments since September 11, 2011.  Kentucky's National Guard has also been there to assist Kentuckians when disaster has struck. In the last four years alone, the Commonwealth's Guard has been mobilized nine times following disaster declarations in the State. The Guard has protected and served Kentuckians during and after a wide range of disasters that have wreaked havoc on the state, from floods and tornadoes to the 2009 ice storm. Kentucky's citizens owe a great debt of gratitude to the men and women of the Kentucky National Guard.  Today, on the eve of Veterans Day, I wish to honor the Kentucky Army National Guard for its dedication to better serving Kentucky, and Adjutant General Edward W. Tonini on the organization's continued achievements.                          ____________________
