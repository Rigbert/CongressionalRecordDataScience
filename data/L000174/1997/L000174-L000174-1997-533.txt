I close only with this: None of us in this body owns a seat in the U.S. Senate. We are privileged and honored to serve here at the time we are here, and then we go on.

We should never rush pell-mell into an amendment to this Constitution without thinking through the consequences.  Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Roberts). The clerk will call the roll.  The bill clerk proceeded to call the roll.
