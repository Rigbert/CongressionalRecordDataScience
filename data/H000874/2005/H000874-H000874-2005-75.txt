 As you know, a lot of work remains to be done which is supposed to be, as I understand it, may be, I suppose, our last week. Many hope it will be our last week, at least for the month, including the completion of the conference report, as you have said, on Labor-Health and DOD appropriation, the DOD authorization, TRIA, PATRIOT Act.  So for Members' planning purposes, can you tell me when you expect to finish work for the year?
