Speaker, I rise today to honor and pay tribute to an individual whose dedication and contributions to communities of Corona and Norco are exceptional. Our area has been fortunate to have dynamic and dedicated community leaders who willingly and unselfishly give their time and talent and make their communities a better place to live and work. Dr. Kent Bechler is one of these individuals. At a retirement reception on May 23, 2012, Kent will be honored for his work as the Corona-Norco Unified School District Superintendent.  For the last five years, Dr. Kent Bechler has been the superintendent of the Corona-Norco Unified School District (CNUSD), the ninth largest school district in California serving more than 54,000 students. Prior to heading the Corona-Norco Unified School District, he served as superintendent in Walnut Valley Unified and Duarte Unified School Districts. Dr. Bechler has served K 12 education for 32 years.  Since assuming the CNUSD Superintendent position, he has guided the district through many challenges and many accomplishments. With collaboration and problem solving, the district has survived the state budget crisis by successfully implementing a retirement incentive program that eliminated the need to impose layoffs. To address overcrowding, the district opened two new elementary schools, and began expansion of campus facilities as six schools through modernization projects.  Under his leadership, the district has experienced a steady increase in academic scores for students, the development of a planned systemic professional development program, gains in technology including 13 grants, collaborative labor agreements that have not only maintained but enhanced the district fiscally, and leadership development and professional collaboration time.  In March, Corona-Norco Unified School District was named one of four American school districts selected as a 2012 finalist for the one million dollar Broad Prize for Urban Education. The Broad Prize for Urban Education is the largest education prize in the country, honoring school districts that demonstrate the greatest overall performance and improvement in student achievement, while reducing achievement gaps among poor and minority students.  Dr. Bechler has extensive training experience in management, leadership, systems, policies and procedures, strategic planning, labor relations and developing collaboration and teamwork within organizations. He is well known for developing trusting relationships, team building and resolving organizational conflict. His academic work includes teaching adjunct classes at the university level and consulting with educational institutions, business and other organizations. He was recently named the 2012 California State Superintendent of the Year by the Association of California School Administrators.  Dr. Bechler received a Bachelor's Degree in social work from Azusa Pacific University, a Master's Degree in Educational Administration from California State University, Los Angeles and his Doctorate of Education from Claremont Graduate University.  Dr. Bechler was born in Saginaw, Michigan and raised in South Central Los Angeles. He has traveled extensively throughout South America, New Zealand, Australia, and Mainland China playing basketball. He resides in Upland with his wife Karen and together they have three children and two grandchildren.  In light of all Kent Bechler has done for the students, parents and communities of Corona and Norco, it is only fitting that he be honored as he retires from the School District. Dr. Bechler's tireless passion for education and public service has contributed immensely to the betterment of our communities and I am proud to call him a fellow community member, American and friend. I know that many community members are grateful for his service and salute him as he retires and moves onto the next phase of his life.                          ____________________
