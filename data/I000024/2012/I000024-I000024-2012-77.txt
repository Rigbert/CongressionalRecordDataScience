President, Russia's weak rule of law is bad for the people of Russia, of course, but it also harms American citizens. As Congress considers legislation directed at strengthening human rights and the rule of law in Russia, we also should address the economic impact on Americans, including those Americans who are owed $12 billion when Yukos Oil, in which they held 15 percent of its stock, was expropriated by the Russia Government. To date, none of the American owners of Yukos caught up in Russia's renationalization of this company has received any compensation for this unlawful taking. And without a bilateral investment treaty, BIT, with Russia, the only recourse available to U.S. investors is for our State Department to espouse the case of its wronged citizens. I support this course of action, and I ask unanimous consent to have printed in the Record a letter I wrote with Senator Scott Brown to Secretary Clinton last October 27, 2011, that addresses this issue.  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in the Record, as follows:                                                  U.S. Senate,                                 Washington, DC, October 27, 2011.     Hon. Hillary Rodham Clinton,     Secretary of State, Department of State, C Street, NW.,          Washington, DC.       Dear Madam Secretary: We are writing to ask that you seek      compensation from Russia on behalf of hundreds of thousands      of U.S. investors who have lost approximately $12 billion as      a result of Russia's expropriation of Yukos Oil Company. With      all other avenues exhausted for American investors, only      espousal by the United States can help to bring this matter      to an appropriate resolution.       American investors collectively owned approximately 15      percent of Yukos at the time the Russian authorities began      dismantling the company. The American investors in Yukos      included several public pension funds and more than 70      institutional investors in at least 17 States. There also      were over 20,000 individual American investors who owned      Yukos shares directly, in addition to the hundreds of      thousands who owned shares indirectly through mutual funds.       These investors have valid claims against Russia under      international law, but they have no mechanism to assert these      claims because there is no bilateral investment treaty (BIT)      in force between the United States and Russia. Other foreign      owners of Yukos have been able to initiate BIT claims, and a      UK investor recently won such a case. In a unanimous      decision, the arbitrators in the UK case concluded that      Russia had expropriated Yukos and that compensation was due.       In June 2008, American investors formally petitioned the      State Department to undertake government-to-government      negotiations with Russia. We respectfully ask that you      espouse the claims of these Americans and seek payment from      the Government of Russia as soon as possible.       Thank you for your consideration of our concerns. We look      forward to hearing from you.           Sincerely,     James M. Inhofe,       U.S. Senator.     Scott Brown,       U.S. Senator.                          ____________________
