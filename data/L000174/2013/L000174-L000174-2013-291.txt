President, as always, I commend the distinguished majority leader for his words on immigration reform. We are on this bill because he set this time aside, and he, like I, hopes we will soon be voting on amendments. There are a lot of potential amendments, just as we had 300 amendments filed in the Senate Judiciary Committee. We were able to work through them. I know we do not expect that many here on the floor, but I know the leader has set aside time for us, and I know his commitment to get this filed and fulfilled, and I joined him on that. I think the time is right. We either do it now or we are never going to do it.  So I thank the leader again.                          ____________________
