President, it is with pride and pleasure that I take a moment today to recognize the Anti-Cruelty Society of Chicago on the occasion of their 100th anniversary. The society's centennial celebration is entitled ``1999--The Anti-Cruelty Society Centennial: A Legacy of Caring, A Vision of Hope for the 21st Century,'' and is truly an appropriate description of the organization's valuable impact on the lives and treatment of the nation's animals.  One hundreds years ago, the society's founders, led by Illinois resident Mrs. Theodore Thomas, were concerned with inhumane butchery in slaughterhouses, the treatment of old sick workhorses, and hundreds of thousands of malnourished homeless dogs and cats. In their efforts to eliminate cruelty to animals, to educate the public on the humane treatment of animals, and to create a refuge for stray animals until they could be placed in good homes, the society achieved impressive accomplishments in Illinois and across the nation. In fact, the group gave rise to an organization so dynamic that it has impacted and continues to impact public policy and set the standard of humane treatment for animals worldwide.  Once again, I congratulate the Anti-Cruelty Society in Chicago on their remarkable first 100 years of service, and wish them the best of luck as they continue to make a positive impact upon the lives of animals and humans in the many years to come.                          ____________________
