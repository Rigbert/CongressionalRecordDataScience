 President, I will respond to some criticisms of the Finance Committee package.  There is an allegation that the Finance Committee did not pay for this bill. Let me be clear. The Finance Committee adhered to the following principles in carrying out its responsibilities:  The Finance Committee funded the trust fund by increasing the amount of excise tax receipts retained by the trust fund.  The Finance Committee funded the bill at the outlay number--that is the cash flow impact on the trust fund. Some have pointed to obligations and contract authority numbers. Those numbers were not and are not relevant to the Finance Committee role. It is unfair to compare numbers for contract authority or obligation with receipts. That is apples and oranges. The Finance Committee matched receipts and outlays.  In accordance with Finance Committee members' desires, the deficit impact of matching receipts and outlays was offset with general fund revenue raisers. Those numbers match up.  That is the bottom line. The Finance Committee did its job.  I ask unanimous consent to have printed in the Record a summary of the Finance Committees funding title for the highway bill.  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in the Record, as follows:               Summary of Finance Committee Funding Title       Finance Committee jurisdiction extends to the highway use-     related excise taxes, the highway trust fund, and the      expenditure authority of the highway trust fund. The Finance      Committee acted primarily on the cash flow into and out of      the trust fund. Cash flow into the trust fund is represented      by trust fund excise tax receipts. Cash flow out of the trust      fund is represented by trust fund outlays. Matters involving      contract authority and obligation limits are not Finance      Committee subject matter and the committee did not speak to      them.       According to the Congressional Budget Office, CBO, current      law trust fund receipts will total $227.8 billion over the      six year period. CBO projects $196 billion in highway account      receipts and $31.8 billion in mass transit account receipts.       The authorizing committees' actions placed demands on the      trust fund of $231 billion for highways and $36.6 billion for      transit for the six year authorization period. That means a      total of $267.6 billion in demands on the trust fund.       Prior to Finance Committee action, demands on the trust      fund exceeded receipts by $39.8 billion over the 6-year      period. To make up this funding gap, the Finance Committee      developed two categories of proposals. The first category      increased trust fund receipts by tightening compliance. The      second category included accounting changes that raised trust      fund receipts.       The compliance changes raised trust fund receipts by $5.6      billion over the authorization period. These changes were      also scored as revenue raisers by the Joint Committee on      Taxation. These proposals have no impact on the budget      deficit.       The budget resolution assumes that 2.5 cents per gallon of      gasohol receipts, currently held by the general fund, will be      transferred to the trust fund. That transfer raises trust      fund receipts by $5 billion over the authorization period.      The Finance Committee also assumed that trust fund balances      would be spent down by $7.5 billion over the authorization      period. Adding all of these changes together with the      compliance changes, the Finance Committee closed the gap by      $18.1 billion over the authorization period. That left a      funding gap of $21.7 billion.       The Finance Committee proposed to close this gap with a      group of trust fund accounting changes. These proposals raise      trust fund receipts by shifting the burden of tax policies      from the trust fund to the general fund. In the view of      Finance Committee, these tax policy benefits have nothing to      do with highway use and should not burden the trust fund.      Included in these proposals is a repeal of the partial      exemption for ethanol-blended fuels. The tax benefit for      ethanol, like nearly all energy production incentives, is      transferred to the general fund through a tax credit. The      same effect is applied to refunds for special categories of      users such as state and local governments. Finally, the      highway trust fund will earn interest on its balance, so that      the highway and transit programs are not prejudiced. This      second category of proposals closed the funding gap, but,      without revenue offsets, would have increased the budget      deficit by $21.7 billion.       Finance Committee members decided that this second category      of proposals should not have a deficit impact. To this end,      the Finance Committee title includes a group of loophole      closers previously approved by the committee.
