 It is very interesting in that the climate is changing, and the climate has always changed. All evidence out there--all historical evidence, all scriptural evidence--tells us over and over again that the climate is changing. It always has been changing, and it always will change.  The good news is that the world is not coming to an end because of climate change. That is because the climate is always changing. So, for those people who believe the world is coming to an end because of greenhouse gas emissions, the good news is it is not. I am happy to share that good news with you.                     Bipartisan Budget Act of 2019  Madam President, I am here to speak about some other good news, which is that we have an opportunity with a vote that is coming up. Some people call it the budget vote or the budget agreement. I don't refer to it as such. I call it a defense agreement. I think everybody knows where I stand on this. This is a vote that is going to have to come up before too long, and there is a unique group of people in the U.S. Senate who know the reason that we have to pass the defense budget. They are the members of the Senate's Committee on Armed Services. It happens that I chair that committee and that we have done really great work.  I ask unanimous consent to speak as in morning business for such time as I may consume.
