Speaker, I rise today to honor and pay tribute to an individual whose dedication to the community and to the overall well-being of my congressional district of Riverside, California is exceptional. The City of Riverside has been fortunate to have dynamic and dedicated business and community leaders who willingly and unselfishly give time and talent to making their communities a better place to live and work. Cynthia Roth is one of these individuals. On May 31, 2002, Cindy will be honored by the Greater Riverside Chambers of Commerce for 25 years of dedicated service to the Community.  Cindy Roth is president and chief executive officer of the Greater Riverside Chambers of Commerce. Ms. Roth oversees a budget of $1.3 million and 15 employees. Cindy's career has expanded over 25 years at the Greater Riverside Chambers of Commerce. She attended Riverside Community College, and graduated from the United States Chamber of Commerce Institutes for Organization Management at Stanford University.  The first woman to lead the organization, Cindy became the president of the Chamber in 1999. A person with passion and principles who has strived to have a positive effect upon her local community, Cindy's leadership has been instrumental in strengthening the bonds among the communities of Greater Riverside, along with their business and educational communities.  Actively involved in the community, Cindy is currently a member of the Riverside Raincross Club and Western Association of Chamber Executives. She also serves as the vice president for Southern California Association of Chamber of Commerce Executives.  She received the 1996 Community Service Award from the Rotary Club of Arlington, Alumna of Leadership Riverside and is the recipient of the 2000 Athena Award.  Cindy's tireless, engaged actions have propelled the City of Riverside forward in a positive and progressive manner. Her work to promote the businesses, schools and community organizations of Riverside make me proud to call her a fellow community member, American and friend. I know that all of Riverside is grateful for her contribution to the betterment of the community and salute her for her efforts. I look forward to continuing to work with her for the good of our community in the future.                          ____________________
