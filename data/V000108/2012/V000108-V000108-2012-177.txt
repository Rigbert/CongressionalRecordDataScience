Speaker, it is with great pride and the deepest respect that I rise today to honor one of Northwest Indiana's most distinguished citizens, the Mayor of the City of Gary, Indiana, Karen Freeman-Wilson. Born and raised in Gary, Karen is truly one of the most passionate and involved individuals that I have ever known, especially when it comes to serving the people of Gary. Mayor Freeman-Wilson's first term began this year, and in doing so, she took her place in history as the first female mayor of the City.  Karen Freeman was born in Gary, Indiana; her father, a steelworker, and her mother, the coordinator of a local community center. Both took great pride in their city and were heavily involved in their community, and it was through their example that Karen learned the importance of hard work and public service from a young age. Karen credits her parents with teaching her that ``to whom much is given, much shall be required,'' and it is with this ideal in mind that she has accomplished so much throughout her distinguished career.  Following her graduation from Harvard Law School, Karen quickly realized that working in a law firm was not what she was meant to do. Rather, her calling was public service. Throughout her esteemed career, Mayor Freeman-Wilson has held many posts. From 1995 to 2000, she served as a presiding judge for the Gary City Court, during which time she established the first drug treatment court in the State of Indiana. In 2000, Governor Frank O'Bannon appointed Karen to serve as Attorney General for the State of Indiana. After leaving office, Karen continued to work for the public in various capacities. She has served as the Chief Executive Officer of the National Association of Drug Court Professionals, the Executive Director of the National Drug Court Institute, the Director of the Indiana Civil Rights Commission, and as a member of the board of directors for Hythiam, Inc. Mayor Freeman-Wilson has also been involved with numerous other organizations and charitable groups, including: the American Bar Association, the Indiana State Bar Association, Legal Services of Northwest Indiana, the Gary Chamber of Commerce, and the Second Chance Foundation, an organization aimed and combating substance abuse, for which she is a founding member. She is also very active in her church, Israel C.M.E. Church.  For her many contributions to her community, the State of Indiana, and beyond, the Mayor has received countless accolades. To name a few, she was recognized by Ebony magazine as a Leader of the Future, by the Delta Sigma Theta Sorority with the National Award for Achievement in Civil Rights, and is an inductee into the Stanley Goldstein Drug Court Hall of Fame. In addition, she is a recipient of the prestigious Sagamore of the Wabash, awarded by former Indiana Governors Evan Bayh and Frank O'Bannon.  A devoted wife and mother, Karen's passion for serving the people of Gary is matched only by her love for her family. Karen and her husband, Carmen, are the proud parents of a daughter, Jordan. Karen and Carmen have reinforced the same sense of responsibility and civic pride in their daughter that Karen learned from her parents.  Mr. Speaker, I ask that you and all of my distinguished colleagues join me in congratulating Mayor Karen Freeman-Wilson as she begins her first term as the Mayor of Gary. She is to be commended for her leadership, dedication, and her love for the people of Gary. Karen serves as a true inspiration to those she serves, and I look forward working with her in the years to come.                          ____________________
