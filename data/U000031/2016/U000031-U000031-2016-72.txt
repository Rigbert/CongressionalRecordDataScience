Chairman, I want to thank, in particular, Cathy McMorris Rodgers and Loretta Sanchez for their bipartisan work to advance a workable, pragmatic solution that focuses on consumers and small businesses.  As was noted, it did pass in our committee 36-12 with one voting present. I look forward to an even stronger bipartisan vote today.
