Mr. Chairman, reclaiming my time, in determining the amount of fee under this paragraph, the Secretary shall ensure the amount is ccommensurate with the cost of managing the fisheries with respect to the way the fee is collected, including reasonable cost for salaries and data analysis and other costs directly related to fishery management and enforcement.  Mr. Chairman, I am, frankly, not a lawyer, and the gentleman from Massachusetts is, but if there was an exorbitant amount of fee and the money was given to the Treasury, the Secretary would be open to a lawsuit.
