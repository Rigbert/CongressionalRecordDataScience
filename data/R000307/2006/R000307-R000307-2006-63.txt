 I thank especially Senators Burr, Enzi, and Kennedy, and their staffs for their willingness to work with us. Senator Clinton and I strongly believe that the provisions of the bill we discuss today are absolutely relevant and critical to these discussions.  We hope--it is not hope; we are going to insist--that these provisions will be included in any legislation approved by the committee and Senate. As a matter of fact, were it parliamentarily correct, I would ask unanimous consent that the bill be read three times and passed now. We are thankful for all the attention and focus on planning for a pandemic flu, but we also believe a few more steps need to be taken to make sure we are ready. This is why we are urging our colleagues to consider our legislation, the Influenza Vaccine Security Act, and support our efforts on the bioterrorism and BioShield II bills.  I thank Senator Clinton for her hard work, dedication, and leadership on this issue. I urge my colleagues to think about this and to support this legislation.  I yield the floor.
