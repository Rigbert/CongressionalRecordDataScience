Speaker, I rise in support of H.R. 4680, the Medicare Prescription 2000 Act. The bill is a fiscally sound way to help our seniors with a vital need. As co-chair of the bi-partisan Generic Drug Equity Caucus, I am encouraged by the bill's support for generic drug use.  Currently, generics fill over 40 percent of all prescriptions in the United States, and are extremely affordable at only 10 to 15 cents for every dollar spent on brand name drugs. The Congressional Budget Office reported in 1994 that generic drug competition results in a cost savings to consumers of 8 to 10 billion dollars annually.  Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to vote for this sensible bill. I hope that we can include an even more explicit preference for the use of generic drugs when the bill is conferenced with the Senate. This is a good bill, it's right solution at a critical time. We all should vote aye.
