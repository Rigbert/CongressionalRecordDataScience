Speaker, I thank the gentleman for yielding.  I rise in support of this excellent resolution. Since its founding, the people of Poland have been great allies to the United States in our own struggle for freedom, and of course then our working with them in their struggle for freedom.  One of the first and finest Americans who was a great friend to our country was Brigadier General Casimir Pulaski. I want to commend Congressman Dennis Kucinich of Ohio for helping to make history correct today by granting honorary citizenship to this great Pole, whose life stood for freedom.  He was born on March 6, 1745, in Warsaw, Poland, and at the age of 15 he joined his father and other members of the Polish nobility in opposing the Russian and Prussian interference in Polish affairs. He moved to Paris where he befriended Benjamin Franklin and was fascinated by the idea of the American colonies and the new Nation it wished to become. He volunteered his services to fight for our nascent freedom.                              {time}  1415  Benjamin Franklin wrote to George Washington describing the young Pole as ``an officer renowned throughout Europe for the courage and bravery he displayed in defense of his country's freedom.''  Pulaski fought on the side of America against the British in the Revolutionary War and became known as the father of the American Cavalry. The brilliant history of the Polish Cavalry is now being restored at a location called Grudziadz, Poland, and Casimir Pulaski, with this honorary citizenship today, should become a part of those growing collections; and with passage of this bill today, we should seek, as a Congress, additional ways for us to link the history of our cavalry and the Polish cavalry in the world's struggle for freedom. These are works not yet fully represented and remain largely unwritten.  After fighting bravely for our country, General Pulaski was mortally wounded at the Battle of Savannah in Georgia, and died there on October 11, 1779. Casimir Pulaski is a hero in his native country of Poland. He is also a hero in our country, one for which he fought so valiantly to create. This is why his being granted honorary citizenship in our country is so important and why he should be recognized permanently by the Nation that he helped to create and to defend in a singularly noble undertaking.  I urge my colleagues to support honorary citizenship for General Casimir Pulaski.
