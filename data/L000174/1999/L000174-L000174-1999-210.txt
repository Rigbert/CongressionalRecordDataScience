I have gone down with your distinguished colleague, Senator Cochran, in different hearings. I have always enjoyed it. I have always eaten too much, and I have always felt I understood what Southern hospitality means. I tried to reciprocate with his colleague on a visit to Vermont, and it dropped to 30 below zero. He didn't think it was very good reciprocation, so he came back in the summertime.
