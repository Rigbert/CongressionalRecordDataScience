Mr. Speaker, the votes have been tallied, the results are in and the message is clear: Voters across the country have rejected the extremist right-wing Republican agenda. In Kentucky, Maine, Mississippi, Virginia, and New Jersey, Democrats were victorious.  The voters said no to the Republican cuts in Medicare. They said no to Republican tax breaks for the rich. They said no to Republican assaults on our environment. And they said no to Republican cuts in student loans and education.  Mr. Speaker, heed the message of the 1995 elections. America is watching and waiting, waiting for 1996. Waiting to stop Republican attacks on the elderly, the poor, students, and working-class Americans; 1995 is a prelude.                          ____________________
