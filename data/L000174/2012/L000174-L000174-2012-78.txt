President, the distinguished Presiding Officer was a strong supporter of this bill--the Violence Against Women Reauthorization Act, as many of our colleagues were on both sides of the aisle. We tried to keep this a nonpartisan bill--even beyondbipartisan, a nonpartisan bill--because certainly my experience has been that violence occurs not because a woman is a Republican or a Democrat or an Independent. Violence against women occurs in all stratum, in all categories.  Senator Crapo and I put together our bill after listening to victims and the professionals who work with them every day. We did not want provisions in our bill included to score political points. They were there to address the urgent needs of vulnerable victims. That was the one thing we wanted. This wasn't a Democratic or Republican bill, this was to address vulnerable victims.  One key provision in our bipartisan bill would allow tribal courts limited jurisdiction to consider domestic violence offenses committed by non-Indians against Indian women on tribal lands. On this, I relied on the experiences of Senator Crapo and others who come from States where there are tribal lands. As we went into this and talked to the leaders of various tribes from around this country, I heard that violence against Native women is not only appalling, as we knew, but it has become an epidemic. It has been reported that almost three in five Native women have been assaulted by their spouses or intimate partners. Much of the violence is committed by non-Native Americans--non-Indians.  Federal and State law enforcement may be hours away and lack the resources to respond to these cases, while tribal courts lack jurisdiction to consider these cases. So what happens? The perpetrators are, in effect, immune from the law. The worst part about it is they know they are immune from the law. So the jurisdiction provision in the Senate Leahy-Crapo bill would be a significant step toward addressing this horrific problem, but it would also ensure that no abuser is above the law. As the President said yesterday in a speech to the Tribal Nations Conference: ``With domestic violence so prevalent on reservations, we're pushing Congress to restore your power to bring to justice anyone--Indian or non-Indian--who hurts a woman.''  Even though our tribal provision is limited and guarantees comprehensive rights, House Republicans have objected to it. So I come to the Senate floor to report to my colleagues what I hope is a breakthrough on this issue in this important bill. Two conservative House Republicans, with leadership positions in the Republican House majority, have introduced a reasonable, middle-ground position regarding tribal jurisdiction.  Representative Issa of California and Representative Cole of Oklahoma have introduced the Violence Against Indian Women Act, H.R. 6625. Their cosponsors include Republicans from North Carolina, Minnesota and Idaho. They all have tribes within their states and are concerned about the violence our Senate bill is trying to combat. The Issa-Cole bill includes a provision that allows defendants to remove a case to Federal court if any defendants' rights are violated. This modification should ensure that only those tribes that are following the requirements of the law and providing full rights can exercise jurisdiction, and that defendants can raise challenges at the beginning of a case.  Some in the House Republican leadership have expressed a ``just say no'' approach to any grant of tribal jurisdiction, but the House Republican leadership should give serious consideration to this Republican proposal so we can move forward and protect thousands of victims, non-Native Americans and Native Americans.  The National Congress of American Indians has sent a letter and urged Senator Crapo and me to take a serious look at the Issa-Cole provisions. We are. I have consulted with Senators on both sides of the aisle regarding this proposal so we can find a way forward. I urge the House Republican leadership to do so as well.  I ask unanimous consent to have printed in the Record a copy of the NCAI letter.  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in the Record, as follows:                                                 National Congress                                          of American Indians,                                Washington, DC, November 30, 2012.     Hon. Patrick J. Leahy,     Chairman, U.S. Senate Committee on the Judiciary, Dirksen          Senate Office Building, Washington, DC.     Hon. Michael D. Crapo,     Dirksen Senate Office Building, U.S. Senate, Washington, DC.       Dear Chairman Leahy and Senator Crapo: The National      Congress of American Indians (NCAI) is pleased to hear that      serious efforts may be under way to resolve the impasse      between the Senate and the House on the Violence Against      Women Reauthorization Act (VAWA). Enhancing the safety of      Native women is one of NCAI's highest priorities, and we      support immediate passage of a strong, inclusive VAWA bill      that contains key protections for Native women, including      those contained in Section 904 of the bipartisan Senate VAWA      bill that passed earlier this year (S.1925).       Section 904 takes small but historic steps to overcome the      systemic barriers that prevent equal access to justice for      Native women by giving tribes limited authority to prosecute      domestic violence and dating violence at the local level.      NCAI commends the two of you for your leadership on this      provision. We strongly support Section 904 as it stands in      S.1925, but we understand the legislative process. A      reasonably modified version of Section 904 would be vastly      preferable to the current situation on tribal lands.       Tribes understand and support protecting the rights of      criminal defendants. That is why we support reasonable      improvements to Section 904 that would further achieve those      ends. For example, tribes are currently urging consideration      of a removal provision like that in the bill recently      introduced in the House of Representatives by Representatives      Darrell Issa and Tom Cole. The provision in the Issa/Cole      bill would give criminal defendants in tribal court the right      to remove prosecutions to federal court for consideration of      any constitutional infirmities. It is a concept based loosely      on the recently enacted 28 U.S.C. 1455--a federal procedure      currently on the books (and sponsored by House Judiciary      Committee Chairman Lamar Smith) that permits federal removal      of state court criminal cases. We urge you to take a serious      look at the Issa/Cole proposal in the coming days.       It is the strong hope of tribal leaders that Section 904      will rarely need to be used, but there are several reasons      why this provision is so critical. First, it would create a      very important and much needed deterrent that is currently      lacking, given the absence of tribal jurisdiction over non-     Indian domestic violence offenders. Second, serious offenses      will most likely continue to be referred for federal      prosecution because tribes are far from eager to incur the      costs of additional prosecutions and incarcerations. And      third, given the long history of the inadequate federal      response to crime in Indian country--particularly in      misdemeanor-level domestic violence cases--it is imperative      that tribal governments have the tools to intervene early and      often to protect Native women and prevent the escalation of      violence.       Under the current scheme, non-Indian perpetrators in Indian      country are often shielded from accountability at the expense      of the safety of Indian women. Section 904 would help reverse      this trend. This provision is essential to the safety of      Native women, and NCAI cannot support any VAWA bill that does      not contain some form of it (see attached NCAI Resolution      #SAC-12-038). Should you have any questions or need      additional information please contact myself, John Dossett,      or Katy Tyndell at 202-466-7767 or [email protected],      [email protected]           Sincerely,                                                   Jefferson Keel,                                                        President.                 National Congress of American Indians    The National Congress of American Indians Resolution #SAC-12-038 Title: Support for Immediate Passage of the VAWA Reauthorization with              Tribal Criminal Jurisdiction Provision Intact       Whereas, we, the members of the National Congress of      American Indians of the United States, invoking the divine      blessing of the Creator upon our efforts and purposes, in      order to preserve for ourselves and our descendants the      inherent sovereign rights of our Indian nations, rights      secured under Indian treaties and agreements with the United      States, and all other rights and benefits to which we are      entitled under the laws and Constitution of the United      States, to enlighten the public toward a better understanding      of the Indian people, to preserve Indian cultural values, and      otherwise promote the health, safety and welfare of the      Indian people, do hereby establish and submit the following      resolution; and       Whereas, the National Congress of American Indians (NCAI)      was established in 1944 and is the oldest and largest      national organization of American Indian and Alaska Native      tribal governments; and       Whereas, violence directed at American Indian and Alaska      Native women continues at epidemic levels on many Indian      reservations and communities, and is culturally, legally and      morally an impermissible state of affairs; and       Whereas, Alaska Native women are especially vulnerable to      this type of violence and the current system of justice in      Alaska fails to adequately protect Alaska Native victims of      sexual and domestic violence; and       Whereas, the NCAI has consistently supported key changes to      the Violence Against Women Act (VAWA), last authorized by      Congress in 2005 for a six year period, the reauthorization      of which Congress has been considering since 2010; and       Whereas, one of the key provisions of the reauthorization      has been the restoration of     Tribal jurisdiction over non-Indian perpetrators of violence      directed at Native American women that occurs within the      boundaries of an Indian reservation; and       Whereas, this VAWA tribal criminal jurisdiction provision      has bipartisan support in both chambers of Congress; and       Whereas, recent actions in Congress failed to reauthorize      VAWA, with the House citing, among other things, the      restoration of Tribal jurisdiction as a stumbling block to      reauthorization; and       Whereas, the longer the stalemate regarding reauthorization      of VAWA continues, the larger the number of Native American      and other women who will lose their lives and their health      because of acts of violence directed at them by men who do      not believe they will be prosecuted for their criminal acts:      Now therefore be it       Resolved, That the NCAI will not support a VAWA      reauthorization bill that does not contain some form of the      tribal criminal jurisdiction provision that would give tribes      authority to prosecute all persons who commit domestic      violence on tribal lands; and be it further       Resolved, That the NCAI calls on Congress to immediately      pass a final Violence Against Women Reauthorization Act that      includes some form of the Tribal criminal jurisdiction; and      be it further       Resolved, That the NCAI urges Congress to include specific      protections for Alaska Native victims of sexual assault,      domestic violence, dating violence, and stalking in any final      VAWA reauthorization bill; and be it finally       Resolved, That this resolution shall be the policy of NCAI      until it is withdrawn or modified by subsequent resolution.                             CERTIFICATION       The foregoing resolution was adopted by the General      Assembly at the 2012 Annual Session of the National Congress      of American Indians, held at the Sacramento Convention Center      from October 21-26, 2012 in Sacramento, California, with a      quorum present.
