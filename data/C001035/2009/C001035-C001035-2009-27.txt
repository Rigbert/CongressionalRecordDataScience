President, today I am introducing legislation that requires the Secretary of Energy to carry out a program of research, development, demonstration and commercial application to advance offshore wind turbine technology. This bill will advance the goal of the Department of Energy to produce 20 percent of our Nation's electricity from wind resources by 2030.  Mr. President, 61 percent of U.S. wind resources is in deepwater, greater than 60 meters, 197 feet, depth. Winds at these locations are stronger and more consistent than closer to shore or on land. But, it will take technological advances to harness this energy efficiently and cost-effectively.  This bill will focus national efforts to develop offshore wind technologies. This should be a national priority because it can produce clean, renewable energy for major U.S. population centers.
