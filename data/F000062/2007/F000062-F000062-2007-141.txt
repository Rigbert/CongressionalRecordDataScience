 He is absolutely right in what is happening. It is happening to a great extent as well in California. Referring to this chart, I wish to show the Senate what has happened. Agriculture is moving to Baja, Mexicali, and the Nogales regions--more than 20,750 acres of agriculture have moved from the United States to this area here and more than 8,600 employees have moved to this area in Mexico. Over here, more than 25,350 acres have moved to the center of Mexico, with more than 2,460 employees.
