 President, I ask unanimous consent that the Senate immediately proceed to consider the following nominations on today's executive calendar: Calendar Nos. 56, 103, 157, 158, 159, 161, 162, 163, 164, and all nominations on the Secretary's desk in the Army and Marine Corps.  I further ask unanimous consent that the nominations be confirmed en bloc, the motions to reconsider be laid upon the table, the President be immediately notified of the Senate's action, and the Senate then return to legislative session.
