 President, the world is a dangerous place, and the United States is not immune to those dangers. In just the last few days, we have heard warnings that suicide bombers will mount attacks in the United States and that terrorist groups will inevitably obtain weapons of mass destruction from rogue states.  My own greatest concern is that rogue states or terrorist groups may obtain nuclear weapons, or the means to produce them, from the former Soviet Union, where less-than-adequate security and under-employed weapons scientists coexist with the world's largest stockpile of excess fissile material. We know that both rogues and terrorists are attempting to exploit the instability in that region in order to gain weapons of mass destruction.  Some Russians have been caught stealing radioactive, or even fissile, material. And witnesses at two Foreign Relations Committee hearings warned that even modestly capable terrorists could convert stolen highly enriched uranium into enormously destructive improvised nuclear devices.  But I do not share the view that proliferation of nuclear weapons is inevitable. The United States has had real successes in nuclear nonproliferation and there is every reason to think that we can build on that record.  Thanks to the Nunn-Lugar Cooperative Threat Reduction program, the countries of Belarus, Kazakhstan and Ukraine gave up their nuclear weapons.  Thanks to the Materials Protection, Control and Accounting program, many Russian facilities have improved their security for fissile materiel.  Thanks to our fissile material disposition programs, the United States and Russia will each demilitarize 34 metric tons of excess plutonium, and Russia will downblended 500 metric tons of high-enriched uranium into low-enriched fuel for nuclear power reactors.  Thanks to several U.S. programs, thousands of under-employed weapons scientists in the former Soviet Union have obtained at least part-time employment in new, socially useful endeavors.  These programs point the way to how we can speed up the day when rogue states and terrorists will find the doors closed to them when they seek dangerous materials or technology from the former Soviet Union. The administration told many months to review these programs last year, but that review led it to the absolutely correct conclusions that the programs are vital to our national security and that nearly all of them should be expanded. The problem now is that we are still not doing nearly enough. The President's budget request for fiscal year 2003 would maintain our nonproliferation assistance programs, but not significantly increase them.  The Nuclear Nonproliferation Act of 2002 takes important steps to expand these programs, and I am proud to co-sponsor this legislation. Senator Domenici to be both commended and supported for drafting this bill. I am also delighted to be joined by Senators Lugar and Hagel from the Foreign Relations Committee, Senators Landrieu and Bingaman from the Armed Services Committee, and Senator Murkowski, who has paid particular attention to Russian nuclear problems.  The Nuclear Nonproliferation Act of 2002 will lead to greater levels of effort--and, I believe, greater levels of achievement--in several areas. For example, it authorizes $40 million for a new research, development, and demonstration program to help respond to nuclear or radiological terrorism. Some of these funds would also help other nations to better regulate the protection and control of radiological sources, to prevent any diversion to terrorists. Some of the funds will go to new technologies to detect radioactive and fissile materials being smuggled into the United States. And some will support work with the International Atomic Energy Agency to improve international safeguards for nuclear materials and operations.  It authorizes up to $300 million to accelerate and expand current programs to blend down highly enriched uranium (HEU) into reactorgrade material which cannot explode and to dispose of plutonium in Russia. This provision also allows for HEU purchases from other countries.  It authorizes $20 million for work with the international community to develop options for a global program for international safeguards, nuclear safety and proliferation-resistant nuclear technologies. This includes efforts to improve sabotage protection for nuclear power plants and other nuclear facilities overseas.  These are sensible proposals, and very sensibly priced when one considers the magnitude of the threat that they address. Former Senator Howard Baker and former White House Counsel Lloyd Cutler called on us last year to devote at least $3,000,000,000 dollars a year to this effort. Even with last year's congressionally-mandated budget increases and even with this fine bill, we will achieve less than two-thirds of that objective.  But these are important steps, ones that have been vetted with experts inside and outside our government. Theydeserve the support of all of us, and they will help build a safer world for our children and grandchildren.                                 ______                                       By
