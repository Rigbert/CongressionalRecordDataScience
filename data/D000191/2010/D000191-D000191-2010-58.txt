 Simple question before the House today. Should the health insurance industry live under the same antitrust rules and have the same consumer protections as are provided for every other major industry in America without special exception, without carve-outs, without loopholes? No more collusion to get together, to conspire to limit markets, coverage, and drive up rates. The American people want and they need this protection.  Now, they say there is a study throughout that says this won't save money. That study was actually based on the language they are offering. Yes, if we provide these loopholes it well may not bring down rates. But if we don't vote for their loopholes, we will bring down rates. The Consumer Federation of America says we will save $10 billion in ratepayer premiums next year if we adopt this amendment straight up without their loopholes.  With that, I yield to the gentleman from California.
