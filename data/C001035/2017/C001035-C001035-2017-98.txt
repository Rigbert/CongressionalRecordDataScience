This is not a decision that I have made lightly. I have a great deal of respect for Mrs. DeVos. I believe she is a good person. I know she cares deeply about the children of this Nation. But for the reasons that I will explain, I simply cannot support her confirmation.  Later today, the Senate will vote on a motion to proceed to the DeVos nomination. I will vote to proceed to the nomination because I believe that Presidents are entitled to considerable deference for the selection of Cabinet members, regardless of which political party is in power, and that each and every Senator should have the right to cast his or her vote on nominees for the Cabinet. That is why, during President Obama's administration, I voted for procedural motions, including cloture, to allow the President's nominees for Secretary of Defense and for Secretary of Labor to receive up-or-down votes by the full Senate, even though I ultimately voted against those two nominees on the Senate floor. At the time, I stated that it is appropriate for every Senator to have an opportunity to vote for or against an individual Cabinet member, and I still believe that is the right approach.  Let me again make clear what I said at the beginning of my remarks, which explains why this has been a decision that I have not made lightly. I know that Mrs. DeVos cares deeply about children. I recognize that she has devoted much time and resources to try to improve the education of at-risk children in cities whose public schools have failed them. I commend her for those efforts.  I wrote to Mrs. DeVos, seeking her assurances in writing that she would not support any Federal legislation mandating that States adopt vouchers nor would she condition Federal funding on the presence of voucher programs in States. She has provided that commitment, and I ask unanimous consent that the exchange of correspondence with Mrs. DeVos be printed in the Record at the conclusion of my statement.  Nevertheless, like all of us, Mrs. DeVos is the product of her experience. She appears to view education through the lens of her experience in promoting alternatives to public education in Detroit and other cities where she has, no doubt, done valuable work. Her concentration on charter schools and vouchers, however, raises the question about whether she fully appreciates that the Secretary of Education's primary focus must be on helping States and communities, parents, teachers, school board members, and administrators strengthen our public schools.  While it is unrealistic and unfair to expect a nominee to know the detailsof all the programs under the jurisdiction of the Department of Education, I am troubled and surprised by Mrs. DeVos's apparent lack of familiarity with the landmark 1975 law, the Individuals with Disabilities Education Act--known as the IDEA--that guarantees a free and appropriate education to children with special needs.  The mission of the Department of Education is broad, but supporting public education is at its core. I am concerned that Mrs. DeVos's lack of experience with public schools will make it difficult for her to fully understand, identify, and assist with those challenges, particularly for our rural schools in States like Maine.  In keeping with my past practice, I will vote today to proceed to debate on Mrs. DeVos's nomination. But I will not, I cannot, vote to confirm her as our Nation's next Secretary of Education.  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in the Record, as follows:                                                  U.S. Senate,                                 Washington, DC, January 24, 2017.     Mrs. Betsy DeVos,     Education Secretary-Designate,     Washington, DC.       Dear Mrs. DeVos: I am writing to follow up on the questions      posed to you in your confirmation hearing regarding your      position on school vouchers should you be confirmed as      Secretary of Education. I have concerns about the impact of      such a voucher program, especially on rural school districts      with limited budgets and numbers of students.       The needs of public schools in Maine are very different      from those in large urban areas, where some schools have      failed our children. The majority of Maine's schools and      school districts are small and rural, and the constraints on      resources and the realities of distance greatly influence the      policies and practices for delivering high-quality education      in those settings. The concern I hear in Maine from teachers,      administrators, and parents is that school vouchers will      divert scarce resources from public schools.       During my time as a U.S. Senator, I have visited more than      200 schools in Maine. At each visit, I have seen repeatedly      the skilled and dedicated teachers, administrators, and staff      working closely with parents to deliver the best possible      education for their students. Likewise, I have spoken with      students who are vibrant members of their communities and      excited about learning. Our public schools have a tremendous      impact on students and communities, and the U.S. Department      of Education is an important partner in fulfilling the      promise of high-quality public education for all students.       Please respond in writing to the following question: Would      you oppose a federal mandate that would require states to      adopt private school vouchers? I ask that you respond prior      to the Senate Health, Education, Labor, and Pensions      Committee mark-up on January 31.           Sincerely,                                                 Susan M. Collins,     United States Senator.                                  ____                                                 January 25, 2017.     Hon. Susan Collins,     U.S. Senate,     Washington, DC.       Dear Senator Collins: Thank you for the opportunity to      answer your question about my position on federal education      mandates regarding private school vouchers.       As a strong proponent of local control, I believe the      decision of whether to provide vouchers, scholarships, or      other public support for students who choose to attend a      nonpublic school should not be mandated by the federal      government. Rather, this is a state and school district      matter.       The Every Student Succeeds Act made great strides in      returning control over education decisions to states and      local communities, and I applaud your efforts in passing that      important law. Decisions about whether to provide parental      choice will vary from state to state and district to      district, reflecting local needs.       As I stated during my confirmation hearing before the U.S.      Senate Health, Education, Labor, and Pensions Committee on      January 17, while I am a strong supporter of school choice, I      am also respectful of state and local decisions on this      issue. Therefore, if confirmed, I will not impose a school      choice program on any state or school district.       Senator Collins, I look forward to working with you to      support Maine's teachers, schools and districts as they work      to provide a high quality education to every student.           Sincerely,                                                      Betsy DeVos.
