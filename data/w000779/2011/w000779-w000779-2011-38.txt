President, today I want to recognize and honor Glenn Vanselow and wish him well upon his upcoming retirement from his position as executive director of the Pacific Northwest Waterways Association of Portland, OR.  Glenn has served as the executive director of the Pacific Northwest Waterways Association since 1989. His 22 years of service to Oregonians and all the residents of the Northwest have been invaluable. His advocacy on behalf of infrastructure projects in the region has been key to ensuring that Oregon's ports remain a vital component of our economy and laid a foundation for them to grow and flourish in the future.  He has been critical to helping build and maintain the locks, dams, hydropower and irrigation projects on the Columbia/Snake River system that have been so important to commerce in our region. He brought experience, know-how, leadership, and vision to critical navigation projects like the Columbia River Channel Deepening and the lock gate replacements just this past winter. And a few years ago, we were able to celebrate the completion of repairs to the Tillamook north jetty together.  Glenn has made many stops along the way in serving the Northwest. He is on the board of the Lower Columbia River Estuary Partnership, he cochaired the Bi-State Water Quality Study for the Lower Columbia and served as chair of the Lower Columbia River Estuary Program in developing a management plan for ecosystem restoration. Past board memberships have included the Oregon Governor's Council of Economic Advisors, Regional Maritime Security Coalition-Columbia River, and University of Idaho College of Mines Advisory Board.  The legacy of Glenn's time with PNWA will be the permanent and long-term investments in Oregon that he helped move forward, the jobs those projects helped to create, and the families who have benefited from the great work the PNWA has done during his tenure. I know my home State of Oregon owes Glenn a great debt.  I congratulate Glenn on his significant contributions to the growth and development of the economy of the Pacific Northwest, and I wish him well in retirement.                          ____________________
