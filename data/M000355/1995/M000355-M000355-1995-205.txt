 President, I rise here today to pay tribute to Rebekah M. Harleston, a pioneer in the field of documents librarians. Ms. Harleston died on October 14, 1994, after dedicating more than two decades of her life to public service. Her innovative work as a reference and government documents librarian has been widely recognized and appreciated, and today the public still reaps the benefits of her lasting contribution to this field.  Ms. Harleston was a powerful driving force behind improvements to the libraries of Kentucky and the Nation. She worked as a reference and government documents librarian within the University of Kentucky [UK] Library system from July 1, 1958 until her retirement on June 30, 1983. During her time at the University of Kentucky, the UK libraries became both the regional depository library for the Commonwealth of Kentucky and a United Nations depository library. She was a charter member of the Government Documents Round Table of the American Library Association and chaired the Kentucky Library Association's Government Documents Round Table. In addition, she collaborated with Carla Stoffle, currently dean of the University of Arizona libraries, in writing what was then considered the definitive book on depository libraries, ``Administration of Government Documents Collections.''  Mr. President, this woman's dedication and exemplary work are illustrated by the many fond recollections of her colleagues. They speak of her as an excellent teacher who mentored many documents librarians, and they recall her ``infectious enthusiasm for government reference work.'' Her dedication and accomplishments as a professional are truly admirable.  As a public servant, Rebekah Harleston made lasting contributions to the state of Kentucky and the Nation. It is my honor to pay tribute today to this representative of Kentucky--a tireless, dedicated public servant, a woman to be emulated and admired.                          ____________________
