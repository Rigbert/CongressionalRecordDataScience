 President, I rise today to congratulate a successful small business in my State, Telamon Electronics, which will celebrate the opening of its new offices on October 1, 1996 in Chino, CA.  Telamon, Nortel, and Pacific Bell have forged a high technology business alliance in Chino which has shown how large and small businesses can work together effectively. Through their efforts, Telamon has created over 30 new high-technology jobs in one of the southern California communities most affected by the reduction in defense spending. At a time when we are shifting spending to the local level, these partners have made it possible for the California economy to benefit from Telamon's over $1 million in estimated tax revenues. It is the highest sales tax generator out of 2,100 businesses in the city of Chino, which is located 35 miles east of Los Angeles.  To foster employee growth, Telamon Electronics offers its employees profit sharing, rewards for suggestions, scholarships for their children, and education grants for their professional growth.  Telamon is enhancing its community by enhancing its employees.                          ____________________
