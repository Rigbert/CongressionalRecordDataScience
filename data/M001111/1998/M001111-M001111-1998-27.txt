 President, I am pleased to join my chairman, Senator Burns, in bringing to the Senate our conference report on the 1999 military construction appropriation bill.  Favorable action in the Senate today will send this conference report to the President, making it the first of the regular 1999 appropriations bills to be passed by Congress. This is a noteworthy accomplishment, and I hope it will set the stage for swift action on the remaining appropriations bills.  We had to make some very tough choices on this bill. Our conference agreement totals $8.4 billion. This is $760 million less than what was appropriated last year. Given the tight budget confines in which we were operating, there were many worthy projects that we could not fund. Not one Senator or one State was exempt from this belt-tightening--not Senator Burns, not me, and not our leadership. Nevertheless, we held ourselves to a high standard of fairness and equity, and our conference report reflects that effort. This report satisfies to the best of our ability the national and international priorities of our military services as well as the regional priorities that our colleagues conveyed to us. Most important, it provides funding for scores of needed projects throughout the United States and overseas that will support America's military personnel, both active and reserve, as they carry out their mission to defend and protect our Nation.  The State of our Nation's military readiness continues to be a pressing concern. Although we often equate readiness with equipment or troop strength, it is important to remember that basic military construction--troop barracks, family housing, vehicle maintenance centers, and the like--is at the core of military readiness. This bill is the vehicle through which we provide the basic, essential infrastructure necessary to support our troops and advance military readiness.  I urge all of my colleagues to support this conference report and speed it to the President for his signature. This is the product of a smooth, fair, and bipartisan process. I commend Chairman Burns for his swift and skillful handling of this bill. I commend his staff,Sid Ashworth, and my staff, Ben McMakin, Christina Evans, and Emelie East, for their diligence and thoroughness in preparing this bill for our consideration. It is a good bill, and I hope that all of my colleagues will be able to join me in supporting its passage.  Mr. McCain. Mr. President, I stand before the Senate today to express my deep disappointment over the egregious number of low-priority, Congressionally earmarked military construction projects that are contained in the conference report on the Fiscal Year 1999 Military Construction Appropriations Bill.  I am dismayed that, at a time when our nation's military is perilously close to becoming a ``hollow force''--due in great part to a decade of declining defense budgets and increased commitments--members of both bodies have once again directed precious funds away from the services' readiness and modernization needs toward their own parochial interests. I am dismayed, but given the long tradition of egregious member adds, I am not surprised.  This year's Military Construction Appropriations Bill was crafted under the additional stricture of the Balanced Budget Agreement of 1997. The agreement established firm funding limits to the National Defense budget. With these constraints in place, one would think that it would be difficult for members to even consider adding projects of questionable merit. Sadly, the sheer volume of unrequested, low-priority projects present in this bill--142 domestic projects in all, at a cost of some $977 million--betrays an attitude of ``business as usual'' by the members of Congress.  I was encouraged by the fact that there were no new projects added by the conferees as they crafted this compromise legislation. That display of discipline is laudable. However, it pales in comparison to the gross misuse of critical defense dollars to fund members' pet military construction projects.  Recently the Navy announced that its pilot retention rate is at its lowest point since aviation continuation pay was instituted more than a decade ago. The Air Force is currently retaining only 28 percent of its pilots. The pay of service members lags an embarrassing 14 percent behind the civilian sector. We are deploying some of our forces to combat zones that are not meeting established readiness standards. Cannibalization rates are increasing. Mission capable rates are dropping. Nearly 12,000 personnel are eligible for food stamps. The number and scope of training exercises have been curtailed as a result of insufficient funding, resources and manpower. The list indicating the decaying readiness of our armed forces goes on and on. Unfortunately, the congressional response to these critical deficiencies has not been ideal.  In this bill alone, there are 45 additional, unrequested Guard and Reserve projects; five control towers at Air Force bases that currently have operational control towers; twelve child development or physical fitness centers; an $8.3 million fence for Fort Bragg; and many more projects of questionable merit--nearly $700 million worth.  The fact remains that funds for our national defense are limited. We have a duty to ensure our men and women in uniform are ready to fight and win wars decisively, expeditiously, and with minimum loss of life. Robbing from readiness to pay for unadulterated, member sponsored military construction projects does not contribute to that end.  Mr. President, I look forward to the day when the Military Construction Bill will be devoid of low-priority, member-requested pork. I urge my colleagues to exercise the restraint required to make that day a reality. Now, more than ever, the security of our nation depends upon it.  I ask unanimous consent that a list of questionable adds be printed in the Record.  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in the Record, as follows:                    QUESTIONABLE ADDS IN THE FY 1999 MILITARY CONSTRUCTION CONFERENCE REPORT                    ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------                                                                                                       Cost in                   State                              Base                        Facility              thousands ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------Alabama................................
