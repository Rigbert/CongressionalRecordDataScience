Speaker, I rise today along with the entire California Republican Delegation to honor and pay tribute to former California Governor George Deukmejian, who passed away in Long Beach, California on Tuesday, May 8, 2018. Deukmejian served the people of California in many ways throughout his life and he will be deeply missed.  Deukmejian's parents, George Sr. and Alice Gairden, were Armenians who emigrated from the Ottoman Empire in the early 1900s to escape the Armenian Genocide. George Jr. was born on June 6, 1928, in Menands, New York. Deukmejian graduated with a B.A. in Sociology from Siena College in 1949 and then earned a Juris Doctor from St. John's University in 1952. Shortly thereafter he served for two years in the U.S. Army, assigned to the Judge Advocate General's Corps. In 955, Deukmejian moved to California and later met his future wife Gloria Saatjian. They married on February 16, 1957, and had three children.  Following a brief time in private law practice in Long Beach, Deukmejian entered politics and, in 1962, was elected to the California State Assembly. A few years later, Deukmejian was elected to the State Senate, where he would serve for twelve years and rise to become the Majority Leader. With a legacy of advocating for law and order, Deukmejian successfully ran for Attorney General in 1978. In 1982, Deukmejian was elected to his first term as Governor of California. He would later be re-elected to a second term in 1986. Throughout his time as Governor, Deukmejian was known as a fiscal conservative who was tough on crime and helped make the state economically competitive.  Along with the entire California Republican Delegation, I want to extend my heartfelt condolences to the Deukmejian family, his friends, and everyone who had the pleasure of serving with him. Although Governor Deukmejian may be gone, the many life-changing contributions he made in California will have a lasting impact.                          ____________________
