That sounds like a lot and it is, but not compared to the big banks. JPMorgan Chase, one of the largest issuers of debit cards, had $17.4 billion in profits last year. That is more than Walmart, incidentally. And their profit margin wasn't 4 percent like Walmart, it was 15 percent.  This is the same Chase that has said any regulation of interchange fees will force them to raise fees on consumers. One of the most profitable banks in America threatens consumers that if they cannot charge the interchange fees they want to charge, they are going to raise fees on consumers. Isn't that great? ``Your money or your life,'' when it comes to Chase. Chase has more profits than Walmart and a 15-percent profit margin.  For the record, let me go back and discuss a few more of the studies that have already been done on interchange fees. For example, Terri Bradford of the Kansas City Fed published a report entitled ``Developments in Interchange Fees in the United States and Abroad.''  This report, which was published in 2008, said the following:       While regulation of interchange fees is still just a point      of discussion in the United States, regulation abroad is a      reality. In about 20 countries, public authorities have taken      actions that limit the level of interchange fees or merchant      discount fees. Many of these actions require interchange fees      to be set according to cost-based benchmarks, although the      cost categories that are eligible for the benchmarks vary by      country. In several countries, interchange fees are set at      zero.  Federal Reserve researchers are not the only ones who have studied interchange fees.  In 2006 the Antitrust Law Journal published an article by Alan Frankel and Allan Shampine called ``The Economic Effects of Interchange Fees.''  This article found that the interchange fee ``acts much like a sales tax, but it is privately imposed and collected by banks, not the government. It significantly and arbitrarily raises prices based not on technologically and competitively determined costs, but through a collective process.''  And in March 2010, Albert Foer, president of the American Antitrust Institute, published a study that found the following:       Governments around the world have been taking actions to      eliminate or severely reduce interchange fees based on      studies and investigations that clearly establish that these      fees are abuses of market power. Moreover, the results      demonstrate that interchange fee regulation works. Despite      the protests of MasterCard and Visa and their giant card-     issuing banks, mandated interchange fee reductions have      increased competition in foreign payment card markets and      have benefitted consumers through lower prices.  In short, there have been a large number of studies done about interchange fees. And this does not count the enormous amount of research, information collection, and analysis that the Fed has done since my amendment was enacted last July.  The problem from the perspective of Visa, MasterCard and the big banks is that they simply don't like what thesestudies have found. So they pretend these studies never happened and call for new ones where they are guaranteed a more industry-friendly outcome. It is obvious that their calls for more study are an effort to delay reform indefinitely. The big banks will do anything to prolong the status quo and to keep collecting $1.3 billion per month in excessive debit swipe fees.  I want to further address another argument that has been raised recently.  Some have argued that we should not follow through with interchange reform because it will only benefit big box retailers. Of course, this is not true. Swipe fees impact retailers of all sizes, from the smallest mom-and-pop stores to the largest retail chains. They also affect universities, charities, government agencies--everyone who accepts plastic as a form of payment. And they affect all consumers, who pay higher prices at retail because of the cost that swipe fees add to every transaction.  But many still like to portray this debate as a struggle between the banks and card companies versus the big box retailers. Well, let's look at those big box retailers and compare them to the big banks and credit card companies. Some of my colleagues may be surprised to learn that the big banks and card companies are significantly more profitable than the big retailers.  According to Forbes.com, in 2010, Wal-Mart, the largest retailer in the country, had $17 billion in profits and a 4 percent profit margin.  Sounds like a lot, right? Well, not compared to the big banks. Last year, according to Forbes.com, JP Morgan Chase, one of the largest issuers of debit cards, had $17.4 billion in profits--more than Wal-Mart. And Chase's profit margin was a robust 15 percent.  This is the same Chase that has said that any regulation of interchange fees will force them to jack up fees on consumers. Chase has more profits than Wal-Mart and a 15 percent profit margin. Why are they pleading poverty and threatening their customers with higher fees?  Well, what about other giant retailers? How are they doing? Target, the well-known retail chain, had profits of $2.9 billion and a 4.3 percent profit margin last year. Let's compare that to Wells Fargo, another giant debit card-issuing bank. Wells Fargo last year had $12.4 billion in profits and a 13.3 percent profit margin.  Large retailers would love to have the profit margins of the big banks. But they don't. Last year the largest drug store chain, CVS Caremark, had profits of $3.4 billion and a 3.6 percent profit margin. The largest grocery store company, Kroger, had profits of $1.1 billion and only a 1.4 percent profit margin.  Historically we have seen low profit margins and intense competition in the retail sector. According to a June 8, 2009, article in Fortune Magazine, Wal-Mart has only an 11 percent market share of the retail market, and Target has only a 2.3 percent market share. This shows that retail is an intensely competitive sector.  Let's compare that level of competition to the debit card industry. This past Monday, an article on CNBC.com reported that the Visa and MasterCard duopoly now control around 90 percent of the debit card market.  It is pretty profitable to be a duopoly. According to Forbes.com, in 2010: Visa had $3.1 billion in profits and a 37 percent profit margin, and MasterCard had $1.8 billion in profits and a 33 percent profit margin.  It must be nice to be a big bank or a credit card company these days. Big banks and their card network allies are making money hand-over-fist these days while retailers of all sizes are struggling to turn a profit. Rising interchange fees are a key part of this equation.  It doesn't have to be this way. If we can constrain Visa's and MasterCard's price-fixing on behalf of the 1 percent of biggest card-issuing banks, we will reduce the cost of interchange for every merchant and other entity that accepts debit cards. Competition in the retail sector will mean consumers will benefit through discounts and lower prices. Given the large profit margins at the nation's biggest banks, they will be able to stay in business once swipe reform is completed.  In fact, we know that banks and card companies can continue to offer debit cards profitably with lower interchange rates.  They did it before--up until the mid-1990s, banks used to offer debit cards with minimal or no interchange in the United States.  And they are doing it right now in other countries around the world, where there are thriving debit card industries with very low or nonexistent interchange rates.  I am going to reserve the remainder of my time and let my colleagues take the floor. I will return on the subject but I remind my colleagues, this amendment, this effort by the Wall Street banks and credit card companies to repeal interchange fee reform, is a $40 billion amendment--$40 billion that will be transferred to the biggest banks in America and credit card companies from consumers across America. We did the right thing with interchange fee reform. Let's stand by it and say to Wall Street, major card issuers, VISA and MasterCard, they have had enough. They can get a reasonable fee, but not an unreasonable amount out of our economy.                          ____________________
