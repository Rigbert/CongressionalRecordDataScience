Mr. Chairman, I rise in strong support of this legislation. I want to thank the gentleman from Tennessee (Mr. Duncan) and the gentlewoman from Texas (Ms. Eddie Bernice Johnson) for their hard work.  This is a bill that has been from very bipartisan work together, which made it, in fact, a great bill.  And I urge everybody to vote against the Flake amendment. Keep that in mind. The Flake amendment is not a good amendment for this bill. If we want to relieve our congestion on our highways, we have to use our waterways.
