President, this past Sunday--Mother's Day--Barbara Mahany, a reporter for the Chicago Tribune, wrote a touching front-page story about Rosa Trevino, a mother who never gave up on her daughter, Lucy.  Born with a rare genetic degenerative disease, spinal muscular atrophy, Lucy Trevino was determined to win a degree in bio-engineering from the University of Illinois at Chicago.  Her quest would have been physically impossible if her mother had not been by her side for every class, every lab, every study session, and there to turn every page of her daughter's textbooks when Lucy's arms were too weak.  On Saturday, Lucy Trevino overcame the greatest obstacles and earned her degree. And Rosa, in reporter Barbara Mahany's words, taught us ``all a lasting lesson of a mother's love.''  At Lucy's commencement, the dean of UIC's engineering college stopped the ceremony to tell the members of the Class of 2008 about Lucy's persistence and Rosa's devotion. He said hecould barely get the words out without bursting into tears. When he finished, the entire audience rose and delivered a thunderous 2-minute ovation.  Spinal muscular atrophy is a progressive disease that withers the muscles that control the legs, arms and lungs. It can make breathing a struggle and make turning the page of a heavy book nearly impossible. But it leaves the brain and the mind untouched.  Lucy Trevino was 4 years old when she was told she had the disease. She started using a wheelchair when she was 9.  It was during countless visits to neurologists and orthopedic surgeons when she was a child that Lucy first became fascinated by science. During medical tests, she says, she used to wonder, ``How do those devices work?''  During her senior year in high school, she learned about a summer camp in bioengineering at UIC and immediately signed up. And she was hooked.  The following fall, Lucy Trevino became the first person in her family to go to college.  For her major, she chose bioengineering--one of the toughest programs in the engineering college.  Now, the prospect of years of studying such complicated subjects as thermodynamics and circuit analysis would be daunting for almost all of us. For Lucy, college presented special challenges.  You see, Lucy often needs help performing even such simple physical tasks as dressing, brushing her teeth, and cutting her food.  It takes her twice as long as other students to write up her labs because just moving a pen across paper can be hard sometimes.  At first, Lucy wasn't sure she could even go to college because UIC doesn't have a personal assistants program to help students with disabilities.  One day, as the start of Lucy's freshman year grew near, her mother Rosa asked, ``How would you feel if I went with you?''  Rosa had never even attended high school. But she had vowed years earlier that she would do whatever she could to see that her first-born daughter was never held back by her disease.  So every day, every semester for the last 6 years, Rosa was by Lucy's side.  Five days a week, mother and daughter took the CTA train from their home in Cicero to the University of Illinois at Chicago.  They became a familiar sight on campus: Rosa pushing Lucy's purple wheelchair. Rosa ordering for Lucy in the cafeteria line because Lucy's voice is sometimes barely louder than a whisper.  And there was Rosa, sitting a few feet behind Lucy in class, copying recipes or cutting coupons--always watching to see if Lucy needed a drink of water, or help turning a page. She sat through more than 2,100 hours of lectures in 51 different classes.  Pete Nelson, interim dean of UIC's engineering college, told the Tribune's Barbara Mahany, ``Lucy's story is about the sacrifices our mothers make for all of us.''  Michael Cho, who teaches mostly graduate engineering courses at UIC, has come to know Lucy and Rosa and is in awe of them.  Of Rosa's devotion, he says, ``The first thing that comes to my mind is this can't be anything else but a mother's love. It goes beyond commitment. It is sacrificial love. And I am just overwhelmed. It's not just 1 month or one semester. It's every day for 4 years.''  In fact, it took Lucy Trevino 6 years to earn her degree. Serious health challenges forced her to take a break from school in her junior year.  Last year, a student told Lucy that she had felt like skipping class, but she thought of Lucy and told herself, ``There's Lucy, she's always here. There's nothing wrong with me. I'm just lazy.''  Lucy was amazed anyone noticed her.  Another of Rosa's four children, Lucy's younger brother Hugo, also has spinal muscular atrophy--SMA--and uses a wheelchair. He is studying architecture at the University of Illinois Champaign-Urbana.  As much as Rosa would like to see Lucy and Hugo walk, she says she knows that God is good. She explains: One daughter can walk, one can't. It's the same with her two sons. What she can't see in one child, she sees in the other. And she sees in each child special talents.  In a few weeks, Lucy will go back to school to take one more class so she can complete a math minor. After that, she says, she would like to study law and become a patent attorney.  I hope Rosa is ready for law school. Because I suspect that once Lucy makes up her mind to do something, there's no holding her back.  Rosa Trevino is one of our new Americans who came to this country from Mexico 30 years ago, when she was 17.  This past Saturday, the day of Lucy's commencement, was Mother's Day in Mexico.  When Lucy received her cherished degree, she gave her mother a gift she had ordered months earlier: a formal-looking ``Certificate of Gratitude.'' It read: ``Thank you for all your love and support. I would not be where I am today if it wasn't for you. I feel so grateful to have you in my life. Today is my day, but I dedicate it to you.'' It is signed, ``Lucy Trevino.''  And on behalf of the Senate, I want to congratulate Lucy Trevino on her amazing accomplishment, and thank Rosa Trevino for her inspiring example of a mother's love.  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the full text of the Chicago Tribune article about Lucy and Rosa Trevino be printed in the Record.  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in the Record, as follows:                [From the Chicago Tribune, May 11, 2008]                          Lucy's Mom Was There                          (By Barbara Mahany)       Lucy Trevino's mother cuts peanut-butter-on-whole-wheat      into bite-size squares, unscrews a strawberry-kiwi juice and      holds the bottle to her daughter's lips so Lucy can get      through lunch and make it back to class.       She riffles through Lucy's lavender backpack to find the      lab report for BioE 494, bioengineering-based physiology.      When the cell phone rings, she holds it to her daughter's      ear. She zips her coat. Dabs a tissue to her nose.       And before all this, she has slipped her into jeans, tied      her shoes, smeared toothpaste on her toothbrush and combed      her thick black hair into a perfect ponytail. Lucy Trevino's      mother was right behind her firstborn daughter all through      college--sometimes shoving through mounds of snow, or up an      icy ramp if her motorized wheelchair balked. When they got      stuck, her mother pulled out her cell phone to call      maintenance and ask if someone could please come clear the      walks. Over the last six years, Rosa Trevino also became      fluent in the CTA's Blue Line and Pink Line, as the mother      and daughter made their way five days a week from home, a      red-brick two-flat in Cicero, to the University of Illinois      at Chicago.       Lucy Trevino graduated Saturday from UIC with a degree in      bioengineering, and the dean stopped the commencement of the      Class of 2008 to tell of the Trevinos' triumph. He barely      made it, he said, without breaking into tears.       For the six years it took to get through one of the most      rigorous programs in the College of Engineering, it was      Rosa--a tad shy and always thinking two steps ahead--who got      her daughter to every class, lab and study session. She knew      which text and notebook to lay on Lucy's desk. And she turned      the pages when a heavy book tired Lucy's hands.       For two or three hours, as Lucy absorbed lectures in      calculus or thermodynamics or circuit analysis, Rosa sat not      far away, just in case Lucy needed a sip of water or began      choking.       Lucy, who is 24, was told she had a rare genetic      degenerative disease, spinal muscular atrophy, when she was      4. SMA is a progressive disease that withers the muscles that      control the arms, legs and lungs, and can make breathing a      struggle.       Lucy's type of SMA usually takes away your ability to walk      by the time you're in your teens--she began using a      wheelchair at age 9--but unlike some other types, doesn't      necessarily affect life span.       Lucy, who is the oldest of four, has a younger brother,      Hugo, who has the same disease. He, too, uses a wheelchair;      he's a freshman at the University of Illinois at Urbana-     Champaign, studying architecture.                          Parental dedication       ``Lucy's story is about the sacrifices our mothers make for      all of us,'' said Pete Nelson, interim dean of UIC's      engineering college. Trevino's teachers, he said, ``were      pounding down my door'' to ask for some recognition for this      mother-daughter feat of unconditional devotion.       At UIC, where nearly a third of the students are the first      in a family to go to college, Nelson said it's not uncommon      to hear tales of parents working two or three jobs, sending      money from overseas and just plain struggling so their kids      can get what parents weren't afforded.       ``But this is sort of the pinnacle in terms of the amount      of dedication,'' Nelson said. ``This is what makes this      business worthwhile.''       One of the professors pounding on Nelson's door was Michael      Cho, who teaches mostly graduate courses in cell and tissue      engineering, but who has gotten to know--and has been amazed      by--the ubiquitous mother-daughter duo, so often spotted      wending their way up a ramp, on or off an elevator, or tucked      away studying in some secluded corner.       ``The first thing that comes to my mind is this can't be      anything else but a mother's love,'' Cho said. ``It goes      beyond commitment. It is sacrificial love. And I am just      overwhelmed. It's not just one month or one semester. It's      every day for the last four years that I can think of.''       In fact, it's six years, because Lucy had to take time off      when she got really sick her junior year; she suddenly      couldn't lift her arms and was quickly losing memory.       It took months before a sleep test showed she stopped      breathing 30 times an hour when she was asleep. She now      sleeps with a machine that helps her breathe, and, within a      week of using it, she said, she regained her memory, if not      her arm strength.       ``Ever since I was little, I loved science,'' said Lucy,      who shares her mother's deep cocoa-colored eyes and rolls      around campus in a purple wheelchair with back wheels that      sparkle, like fireworks, with tiny neon bits. ``Because I      went to doctors a lot and had a lot of medical exams, I would      always wonder, ``How do those devices work?' ''       In her senior year at Morton West High School in Berwyn,      Trevino learned from a counselor about a summer camp in      bioengineering at UIC, so she signed up, and found her life's      work.       She once dreamed of working to find a cure for her own      disease, but decided ``it would be too stressful if I      couldn't find it.''       The first one in her family to ever go to college, Lucy      Trevino said she was ``too afraid'' to venture down to the U.      of I. in Urbana-Champaign, where there's a whole dorm for      students with disabilities, and the nation's oldest college-     level disabilities-services program provides trained personal      assistants, physical therapy, even wheelchair repairs.       ``I didn't know if I should risk going all the way down      there,'' she said.       Sticking closer to home seemed like a better plan. But      because UIC doesn't have a personal-assistants program, she      was stuck trying to find someone who could help her in a      thousand little ways and be there whenever she needed.       ``In college, you have such a crazy schedule. You stay      after to study with other students. You need to talk to a      professor. I was like, `Oh, my gosh, how am I going to find      someone who's going to put up with all of that?'       ``My mom was like, `Well, I guess I'll just go with you.'       ``And then it was getting closer to the start of the first      semester, and I still hadn't found anybody. She said, `How      would you feel if I went with you?' I was like, `Oh, my gosh,      would you?' ''       Because Rosa Trevino, who is 47 and moved from Mexico when      she was 17, had two children with special needs, she had long      since become a stay-at-home mom, giving up a series of baby-     sitting jobs. Rosa's husband, Hugo, retired last year after      32 years as a CTA bus driver. Rosa herself had never even      been to high school.       On the day back in 1987 when doctors said her little girl      would ``someday need a wheelchair,'' Rosa recalled, crying at      the memory, she promised herself she would do ``everything I      can.''                           Mother keeps busy       Even if that meant sitting through more than 2,100 hours of      51 classes, countless study sessions and hour-long train      rides, back and forth, each day. Most often, Lucy said with a      laugh, her mother spends time cutting recipes and coupons,      because she gets bored with all the bioengineering in a      language she doesn't fully understand.       At first, Lucy admitted, going to college with her mother      wasn't exactly without its bumps.       ``I had never spent so much time together with my mom. We      would sometimes get on each other's nerves,'' she said,      chuckling. ``But then we got to know each other really well.      We're like best friends. Now I tell her everything. Before I      wouldn't tell her everything that happens when you have a      disability. People who aren't in a wheelchair can't      understand. But now, since we do everything together, she      knows.''       Semester after semester, year after year, Lucy and her      mother found a way. She passed 400-level exams. She wrote up      labs that took her twice the time of everyone else, simply      because the pushing of a pen on paper is so hard for her.       Once, a civil engineering professor noticed that because of      Lucy's wheelchair, she couldn't write on her desk. He      challenged her to design a lightweight writing table. Then he      went and built it. She got an A.       Mostly, the Trevinos relied on each other, and on      unflagging faith.       ``One time, I think in the night, almost for an hour, I      cried to on high, `Why me? Why me?' '' Rosa said. ``I heard a      voice, `Why not me?' ''       For those who watched their unswerving perseverance, the      simple fact that the Trevinos never stumbled inscribed a      lasting honor on Lucy's college transcript.       ``One time last year,'' Lucy said, ``a student told me      she'd felt like ditching class, staying home. But then she      looks and says, `There's Lucy, she's always here. There's      nothing wrong with me. I'm just lazy.'       ``Wow, I didn't even think that anyone noticed me.''       In the very end, on a Mother's Day weekend in the red-     carpeted UIC Pavilion, as Nelson saluted a student and a      mother who had taught them all a lasting lesson, a sea of      Lucy's blue-gowned classmates rose and nearly drowned out the      dean with a thunderous two-minute ovation. Chances are Lucy      and Rosa Trevino finally understood how very much a whole      college noticed.                          ____________________
