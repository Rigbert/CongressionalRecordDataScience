  And, by the way, we are not talking about whether we should pay the bills this country is already obliged to pay. We are talking about putting a budget framework forward for the next 10years. We had a terrific debate about that and the Senator from Texas participated in that and offered amendments. He had an opportunity to do that.  The House of Representatives did the exact same thing. At the end of the day, the way a legislative democratic process works is the two bodies come together and it will have to pass whatever our conference agrees to with a majority of Republicans in the House and a majority in the Senate with Democrats. That is going to be where the Senator from Texas will have an opportunity to say yes or no to a conference.  So I don't understand the Senator saying he would not participate. He has a vote. That is how the Senate works.
