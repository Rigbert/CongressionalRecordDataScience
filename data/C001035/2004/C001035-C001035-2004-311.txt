President, I suggest, based on the conversations I have had with all who are present in the Senate now, we first yield to the Senator from California, who is going to discuss her proposal while we are continuing to work at the staff level on the language of her amendment; that we then go to the Senator from Texas, who has two amendments he would like to discuss--again, we are still working with the Senator from Texas--and we then proceed to the amendment Senator Lautenberg has proposed.
