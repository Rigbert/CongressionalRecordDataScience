President, I am pleased that my colleagues on the other side of the aisle have worked out their problems and enabled the Senate, at last, to appoint conferees on S. 761. I co-authored S. 761 as it passed the Senate, and I look forward to working as a conferee to ensure that the final conference report respects the principles that this body endorsed when it passed that legislation by unanimous consent last year. The letter to conferees dated March 28, 2000, signed by all 45 Democratic Senators, reminds us of those principles.  I am only one conferee among 17 but working with the other 6 Democratic Senate conferees and the 10 Republican Senate conferees. I will endeavor to encourage electronic commerce with balance, fairness, and due regard for consumer protection.
