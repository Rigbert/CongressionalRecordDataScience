President, I rise today to speak in support of a resolution that I am offering with my colleagues, Senators Brownback, Menendez, Snowe, and Whitehouse. This resolution condemns the Iranian government's persecution of its own Baha'i community and urges the Obama administration to speak out strongly against this continued injustice.  The Baha'i Faith, the world's youngest independent monotheistic religion, was founded in Iran in 1844. Today, it is practiced by more than 5 million people across the planet, from Bangalore, India to Beaverton, Oregon. Roughly 300,000 of these adherents still live in Iran. Although Baha'i teachings emphasize equality, unity, and peace, Iranian authorities have viewed the religion as an apostasy and have treated it as a threat since the beginning.  The current Islamic Republic has been particularly hostile to Baha'i practitioners since its establishment in 1979. In 1983, Iran's government formally banned all Baha'i religious institutions and criminalized membership in them and service to them. The regime has officially recognized Christians, Jews, and Zoroastrians as religious minorities. It refuses to extend this same status to the Baha'is, even though they make up Iran's largest religious minority. According to the State Department's 2008 International Religious Freedom Report, the regime continues to create ``a threatening atmosphere for nearly all non-Shi'a religious groups, most notably for Baha'is.'' The government routinely seizes personal property from members of the Baha'i community, denies access to education and employment opportunities, and detains Baha'is based solely on their religious beliefs.  Last year, the Iranian regime imprisoned seven leaders of the Baha'i community. In February 2009, Tehran's deputy prosecutor announced that these seven leaders would be tried on charges of ``espionage for Israel, insulting religious sanctities, and propaganda against the Islamic Republic.'' Not surprisingly, the regime provided no evidence to support these preposterous accusations and has refused to allow a lawyer for the seven to even meet with them. These actions are clear and unambiguous violations of Iran's international commitments under the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights. Some in the international community have already condemned this mockery of justice, and rightly so. My colleagues and I believe the time has now come to add the United States Senate to this growing chorus of voices.  Our resolution is simple and straightforward. It denounces the Iranian government's persecution of the Baha'is and calls on the regime to immediately release all prisoners held for their religious beliefs, including the seven Baha'i leaders. It further calls on President Barack Obama and Secretary of State Hillary Clinton to work with the international community in condemning the Iranian regime for its repeated human rights violations.  I hope that colleagues will join me and Senators Brownback, Menendez, Snowe, and Whitehouse in supporting this commonsense resolution.                          ____________________
