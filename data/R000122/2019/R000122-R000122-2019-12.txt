President, I ask that my colleagues join me and Senator Collins in supporting this amendment.  I would also like to take this opportunity to thank the staff members who actually made this Transportation, Housing and Urban Development--T-HUD--bill possible. They did extraordinary work. We all recognize that it is their efforts that make these difficult and complicated legislative initiatives possible. On the majority staff, I thank Clare Doherty, Jason Woolwine, Rajat Mathur, Gus Maples, Courtney Young, and LaShawnda Smith. On my staff, I particularly want to thank Dabney Hegg, Christina Monroe, Jessi Axe, and Elisabeth Coats.  I think I speak for all of my colleagues when I salute all the staff members who make this legislation possible.  I yield the floor.
