Speaker, it is my honor to say a few words about Jocelyn Dorsey.  Jocelyn Dorsey has won some of the highest honors the field of broadcasting has to offer, and, in many categories, she has been the first one to do it. She is an Emmy award-winning journalist and is the first African American woman to appear on a daily news show in Atlanta. She is the first woman and the first African American to receive the Georgia Association of Broadcasters' lifetime achievement award, Citizen of the Year, among many other honors. She has achieved so much. I will not have enough time here to mention it all.  I have known Jocelyn ever since she first came to Atlanta so many decades ago. How do you put into a few short words the gift that is 40 years of one person's life? It is not easy to sum up all we have seen together, all she has done, and what she means to our community, to our city, to our State, and to our Nation. But when you boil it all down, Jocelyn Dorsey stands for trust and credibility, generosity and human kindness.  Jocelyn is a professional who shines in the spotlight, who deserves the fame and the acclaim. But the reason she lasted 40 years in a tough business is that she loved the people and the institution she served. We could feel it, and we loved her back.  Jocelyn wants to touch people. She wants to do something that helps create life-changing outcomes for those around her. Her work was not a job; it was a way of life. She has traveled the length and breadth of America on her motorcycle, even as far away as Fairbanks, Alaska, meeting people as she went.  She served on community boards in Atlanta that help the disabled, that mentor young girls, that support minority businesses, children's shelters, voter empowerment, and many other worthy causes. She gave her time and used her power as a broadcaster, not because it was fashionable but because it was the right thing to do. It was right. Jocelyn Dorsey has won just about every accolade she could have won in her region.  I don't know whether I can offer any words that would surpass what she has already heard. But we brought her here to the House of Representatives to celebrate her retirement because she is committed and dedicated to the citizens of this country--a woman who took her responsibility as an American seriously and did all she could to help others in any way she could.  I know and truly believe that WSB is so sorry to see her go, but, as a community, we are glad to know where she will stay--in our hearts. She will be forever in the hearts of all of our people and at the center of public service in our community.  Thank you, Jocelyn Dorsey, for all of your great and good work, and may the blessing of the Almighty be with you.                          ____________________
