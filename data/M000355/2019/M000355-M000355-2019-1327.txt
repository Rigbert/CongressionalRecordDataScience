 Mary Pauline Fox, a pioneer of public health in the Commonwealth of Kentucky, who passed away earlier this year at the age of 87. Mary's remarkable life included more than four decades of service to eastern Kentucky communities, and the full effect of her legacy will continue to be felt throughout the region for years to come.  Mary began her exceptional career at the age of 19, graduating from Union College in Barbourville, KY. A trailblazer in her time, she then attended the University of Louisville's medical school as one of only five women in a class of 100. Mary also holds the distinction as one of the early women to participate in the Reserve Officers Training Corps.  Soon after beginning her career as a doctor, the Kentucky Department of Health appointed Mary as a regional director, and for the next 7 years she oversaw healthcare delivery in 20 eastern Kentucky counties. Afterward, she served as the director of the Pike County Health Department for more than two decades. Mary only agreed to retire from her position after funding was secured to build the current health department facility located in Pikeville. To this day, that facility continues to operate in the same building, which now bears her name.  Even at the end of her career, Mary refused to slow down. In coordination with the U.S. Department of State, she was part of the first public health group in our country invited to China. She remained committed to her community, giving sought-after lectures on public health issues throughout the Commonwealth.  As a healer and a teacher, Mary made our Commonwealth a better place. Elaine and I commend her for her lifetime of service to others, and we send our condolences to her family and friends.                          ____________________
