President, I only want to be here to thank the Senator from Alaska and Senator Thune for trying to bring to our attention the issue of the endangerment findings. I have been discussing the incoming economic train wreck that can result from these regulations since the case of Massachusetts v. EPA was decided back in 2007. The EPA's regulatory reach could go everywhere. It could go into schools, hospitals, assisted-living facilities, and just about any activity that meets the minimum thresholds of the Clean Air Act.  Despite the attempts to draft an exemption for small businesses by the senior Senator from California, this effort would be hollow at best. Upon issuance of mobile source regulations the EPA has proposed in its light-duty vehicle greenhouse gas emission standards, the farmers and small sources still retain the obligation under the Clean Air Act, and this obligation is enforceable through citizen suits which we have confirmed through environmental groups will follow. So we know that is going to happen.  I would have to say, as the ranking member on the Environment and Public Works Committee, the more we get into this, the more complications we find. In the process of coming up with some type of an endangerment finding, we find that the information science has been suppressed. We know of the case of Dr. Alan Carlin, who claims his assessment of the latest science on global warming wasn't considered in the endangerment proposal. So we have the endangerment proposal. And some people are not aware of how this process works; that ultimately, if the findings are there, that is when they reach into every life in America. However, this Dr. Carlin has been with the EPA for a long period of time, and he was upset that his information was intentionally suppressed.  Then we find out that information concerning the economics, such as we found through the U.S. Treasury's assessment when they were trying to say, during the consideration of, perhaps this modified bill that it would be the cost of a postage stamp a day, that in fact it would have been some $1,761 per family every year--we tried to relate that back to what kind of a tax increase this is. If you remember back in the year 1993, we had the Clinton-Gore tax increase--the largest tax increase in decades. It was the inheritance tax, marginal rates, capital gains, and every kind of tax imaginable. If you add all that up, that was a $32 billion tax increase. This would be almost 10 times that much.  So I think, as we progress along the lines of the endangerment finding, we know how it will be life changing for every element of our society. So I appreciate the efforts of both Senator Murkowski and Senator Thune to bring this issue of endangerment findings to the forefront. I am not sure it is the best idea to try to get a 1-year moratorium because in a way that might suppress some of the activity that is going on to expose how bad this is to the public.  Having said that, I appreciate being yielded a small amount of time, and I yield the floor.                           Amendment No. 2549
