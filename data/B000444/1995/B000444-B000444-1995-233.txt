 President, on June 22, the superior court of my home State held a special session--special not only in the technical sense, but in spirit, in its purpose and its meaning. The court met, with all of its current judges and many of its distinguished alumni present, in appreciation of the services of Albert J. Stiftel.  I am proud today, Mr. President, on behalf of many other of his fellow citizens, to offer another expression of appreciation for Albert Stiftel, who served on the Superior Court of the State of Delaware from 1958 to 1990, including 24 years as presiding judge. The quality and character of Judge Stiftel's service merit not only our attention and appreciation, but also, if we are up to the challenge, our best attempt at emulation.  My colleagues have indulged me before--indeed, some have joined me, in praising the tradition of excellence that has made Delaware's judiciary a standard for the Nation. It is a tradition of excellence not only in the administration and dispensation of justice, but in principled as well as practical bipartisanship, in fun as well as functional collegiality, and in that often neglected cornerstone of democratic society, civility.  Mr. President, Albert Stiftel embodies that tradition.  Albert, as he is by choice most widely known, is pure Delaware: born and raised in Wilmington--raised, in fact, in the house where he still lives--a graduate of Wilmington High School and of the University of Delaware.  He entered law school at the University of Virginia in 1939, an undertaking interrupted when he was called to duty as a second lieutenant in the U.S. Army. As his lifelong friend and longtime colleague on the Delaware bench, retired State Supreme Court Justice William Duffy, remarked, ``Albert was born in Wilmington but, like many of his generation, he grew up in the South Pacific, including a place called Guadalcanal.'' After his military service, Major Stiftel returned to the University of Virginia Law School, graduating in 1947.  Young Albert Stiftel's years of private practice were driven by a public spirit. Before becoming a judge, he was an attorney for the Legal Aid Society, attorney for the Delaware State House of Representatives, and a Deputy Attorney General. And he was also a teacher, a role he wears naturally and with grace.  In 1958, my distinguished predecessor in this body, then-Gov. J. Caleb Boggs, a Republican, appointed Albert to the superior court. In 1966, he was appointed as the court's presiding judge by Democratic Gov. Charles Terry, and he was subsequently reappointed by a Republican Governor, our former colleague in the other Chamber, Pete du Pont.  During his long tenure, Judge Stiftel confronted the challenge of times, both for the community and for the court, that he himself has described as ``change and more change.'' Through it all, his leadership won ever-deepening respect.  In acknowledging his debt to his predecessor, the current presiding judge of superior court, Henry du Pont Ridgely, thanked Judge Stiftel for an example that taught ``the importance of comradeship and demonstrated the work ethic you expect from others, of being even-handed and setting high standards, under-promising, over-delivering, and sharing the credit.'' Lessons we would all do well to learn.  But despite the universal relevance of his example, Judge Stiftel's impact on the court, and on all who have known him, has been distinctly personal. Another longtime Delaware judicial colleague, now-Vice Chancellor Bernard Balick, put it this way: ``All of us are unique, but Albert is more unique than most.''  Albert Stiftel's defining qualities, as a judge and as a person, are humility, kindness, and compassion. In and beyond superior court, he has been truly the best of teachers and the best of friends--welcoming, helpful, encouraging to all. I am told that the superior court's ``Judge Stiftel Award'' is reserved for that employee who does the most to brighten the lives of his or her colleagues. It is aptly named.  As Justice Duffy put it, ``Other judges may have served longer, but I doubt it, or have more entries in Lexis, perhaps, and a few may have been better administrators--but none has been held in higher personal esteem than Albert Stiftel.''  Mr. President, I left one quality off the list of Judge Stiftel's defining characteristics, and it will be a glaring omission to anyone who knows him. And in fact, the reason I left it out is that I wanted to call individual attention to it. ``It'' is His Honor's sense of humor. Let there be no doubt that Judge Stiftel's commitment to fairness is passionate and sure, but its expression has often been punctuated by a one-liner.  Vice Chancellor Balick told this story at the June 22 special session: ``There was the time when Albert was presiding in a criminal trial, and the defendant was on the witness stand, exercising his right to lie in his own defense. Albert was fooling with the microphone, as he always does. He turned the volume up, which caused a loud screech. That startled the defendant, at which Albert said, `Relax, it's just the lie detector'.''  Whether conveyed in wit or wisdom--and usually it is with both--Judge Stiftel's regard for his colleagues and for the court on which he served has been unwavering and inspiring. As Resident Judge Vincent Bifferato said, ``He taught me to love this court as he does.'' And Judge William Quillen said of Judge Stiftel, ``He has been a cheerleader, not only for the court but for each member of the court * * * he has made each of us better than we otherwise would have been.''  At the special court session, Judge Quillen presented a portrait of Judge Stiftel, which will hang in what was known as courtroom No. 1 when Albert was first appointed to the bench. The portrait was commissioned not by the court, not by the State, not by the Bar Association, but personally by the judges, past and present, of the superior court. This public tribute is all the more official coming as it does out of the sincere affection, respect, and gratitude of Judge Stiftel's colleagues.  That affection, respect, and gratitude are felt throughout and beyond Delaware's legal community, Mr. President, and it is my privilege to give voice to them today. We in Delaware honor Judge Albert Stiftel for the achievements and contributions of his public leadership and for his countless acts of personal kindness and courtesy. He leaves good will and good humor, as well as high standards, in his refreshing wake.  It is most appropriate that in the portrait that will now be a permanent physical presence, as its subject is a permanent spiritual presence, in Delaware's Superior Court, Albert Stiftel is doing what he has inspired so many others to do--he is smiling.                          ____________________
