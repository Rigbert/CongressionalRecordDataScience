 President, let me say that there are Members on both sides of the aisle for whom Friday is an exceedingly important day. We are certainly aware of that. That is another good reason for finishing the family friendly tax bill tomorrow night. We will press on and try to complete both Foreign Operations and the family friendly tax bill tomorrow night.                          ____________________
