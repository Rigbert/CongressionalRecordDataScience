 President, I ask unanimous consent that when the Senate completes its business today, it adjourn until 9:30 a.m. on tomorrow, Friday, December 16. I further ask that following the prayer and the pledge the morning hour be deemed to have expired, the Journal of proceedings be approved to date, the time for the two leaders be reserved, and the Senate then proceed to a period of morning business for up to 30 minutes, with the Democrats in control of the first 15 minutes and the majority controlling the second 15 minutes.  I further ask that the Senate then resume consideration of the conference report to accompany H.R. 3199, the PATRIOT Act, and there then be 60 minutes of debate equally divided between the majority and the minority, followed by a vote on a motion to invoke cloture on the conference report.
