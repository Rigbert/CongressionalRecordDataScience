In fact, as I listen to this colloquy, I was wondering what was going on until I read in the Washington Times the Republican fixation on judges is part of an effort to bolster Senator John McCain's standing among conservatives--which is unfortunate; to bring in the judiciary, the independent Federal judiciary, and make them a political tool.  I was reminded once when my children were young, one of them asked me, they said: Dad, what is the expression ``crocodile tears''? I tried to explain to them what crocodile tears are, and I couldn't help but think tonight, listening to our good friends on the other side--if my children were still young, I would say: There, now you understand what crocodile tears are.  We had, last year--and the distinguished leader has referred to this; the Democrats were in charge, me as chairman, Senator Reid as majority leader--we reported 40 judicial nominations to the Senate, and all 40 were confirmed each of the 3 years prior, with a Republican majority, Republican chairman. That is more than they did.  It is interesting, in fact, since President Bush has been in office this is the third time we have been in the majority--one of those times very briefly. Republicans have been in the majority three times. Guess who moved----  Mr. McCONNELL. Did the majority leader yield for a question?
