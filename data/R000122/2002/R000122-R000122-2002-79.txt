President, I would like to bring to the attention of my colleagues the important role that oncology nurses play in the care of patients diagnosed with cancer.  This year alone 1,284,900 Americans will hear the words ``You have cancer''. Everyday, oncology nurses see the pain and suffering caused by cancer and understand the physical, emotional, and financial challenges that people with cancer face throughout their diagnosis and treatment.  Cancer is a complex, multifaceted, and chronic disease, and people with cancer are best served by a multidisciplinary health care team specialized in oncology care, including nurses who are certified in that specialty. Oncology nurses play a central role in the provision of quality cancer care as they are principally involved in the administration and monitoring of chemotherapy and the associated side-effects patients may experience. As anyone ever treated for cancer will tell you, oncology nurses are intelligent, well-trained, highly skilled, kind-hearted angels who provide quality clinical, psychosocial, and supportive care to patients and their families. In short, they are integral to our nation's cancer care delivery system.  The Oncology Nursing Society, ONS, is the largest organization of oncology health professionals in the world with more than 30,000 registered nurses and other health care professionals. Since 1975, the Oncology Nursing Society has been dedicated to excellence in patient care, teaching, research, administration and education in the field of oncology. The Society's mission is to promote excellence in oncology nursing and quality cancer care. To that end, ONS honors and maintains nursing's historical and essential commitment to advocacy for the public good by providing nurses and healthcare professionals with access to the highest quality educational programs, cancer-care resources, research opportunities, and networks for peer support.  The ONS has a chapter that serves the state of Rhode Island and the southeastern Massachusetts areas. This chapter helps them to continue to provide high quality cancer care to those patients and their families. On behalf of the people of Rhode Island, I want to express my appreciation for all that these amazing nurses do to advance the health and well-being of people with cancer and to further the practice of oncology nursing.  Despite significant breakthroughs in the treatment, early detection, and prevention of cancer, two-thirds of new cancer cases strike people over the age of 65 and the number of new cancer cases diagnosed among the elderly is projected to more than double by 2030 as the Baby Boom generation ages. The impact that cancer has on our nation, especially on the Medicare Program, cannot be underestimated or overlooked. In addition, more than 115,000 nursing positions will go unfilled by the year 2015--a factor which--taken with eroding Medicare payment for outpatient cancer care--further exacerbates the challenge of a growing number of cancer cases.  This week more than 5,000 oncology nurses from around the country have traveled to Washington, DC to attend the Oncology Nursing Society's 27th Annual Congress. This year's theme is aptly titled ``The Many Faces of Oncology Nursing.'' The attendees will increase their knowledge of the newest cancer treatments, learn the latest developments in cancer nursing research, and enhance their clinical skills and contribute to their professional development. In addition, approximately 550 of these nurses--representing 49 states--will come to Capitol Hill to discuss issues.  I would like to commend the Oncology Nursing Society for all of its efforts over the last 27 years and to thank the Society and its members for their ongoing commitment to improving and assuring access to quality cancer care for all cancer patients and their families.                          ____________________
