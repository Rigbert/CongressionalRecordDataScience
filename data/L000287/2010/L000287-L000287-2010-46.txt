Mr. Speaker, in closing, I want to thank my good friend and colleague, Dr. Boustany, the ranking member of the subcommittee, and all the members of the committee and all staff on both sides for their help in bringing this bill before the floor.  I fully support H.R. 4994. I urge my colleagues on both sides of the aisle to vote ``yes'' for this bill.
