  Mr. McCAIN. Since the vote would be on our amendment, it is customary that we, the sponsors of the amendment, be allowed to close the debate. I ask if the Senator from Kentucky would agree that I could have the last 5 minutes before the vote.  Mr. McCONNELL. I have absolutely no problem with that. That is perfectly acceptable.  Mr. McCAIN. Does the Senator from Kentucky want to proceed now?  Mr. McCONNELL. Yes. Would you like me to go on to wrap up?  Mr. McCAIN. Yes.  Mr. McCONNELL addressed the Chair.
