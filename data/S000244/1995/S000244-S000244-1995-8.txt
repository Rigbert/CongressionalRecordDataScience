Chairman, we are prepared to accept this amendment. The amendment reserves $2 million of the life and microgravity science budget program specifically for research on the development of early detection systems for breast and ovarian cancers and other women's health issues. Since it is my understanding that NASA has been working toward the aims of the gentlewoman's amendment, and since this reservation of funds would not adversely impact other planned life sciences research by NASA, I would accept the amendment of my colleague, the gentlewoman from Washington, and commend it to my colleagues.  In fact, NASA and the National Institutes of Health have been engaged under 18 separate cooperative research agreements in a variety of fields. Our bill fully funds the $4.2 million already planned for cancer-related research under these NASA-NIH agreements. NASA has developed, using the Hubbell space telescope technologies, a revolutionary new detection system for the early identification of breast cancer. The system uses charged coupled devices developed by NASA for converting light from faint, distant stars into digital imagery. The same sensitive imaging technology is being used to conduct nonsurgical biopsies on women who may or may not have breast cancer, without leaving a scar. This is another example of how spinoffs from the space program are applied to solve very real problems on Earth, and is one of the reasons why the taxpayers' investment in the space program pays dividends, not only in terms of finances, but also in terms of alleviating human suffering and detecting diseases early enough so they can be cured.
