President, I would like to take a few minutes to celebrate a birthday. June 4, 1996, marks the 50th anniversary of the signing of the National School Lunch Act by President Harry Truman. While turning 50 is not a happy occasion for most of us, the celebration of this birthday is one that should make all of us happy.  The link between proper nutrition and a child's ability to grow and to learn is undisputed. The School Lunch Program was founded in part, because President Truman saw the alarmingly large number of World War II draftees who failed their physicals due to nutrition-related problems. President Truman declared it a ``measure of national security to safeguard the health and well being of the nation's children.'' President Truman was right.  Numerous scientific studies have documented the nutritional benefits of the program--children who eat school meals perform better on achievementtests and are late and absent from school less often than children who did not participate in the programs. Any parent or teacher will tell you that a child who has not eaten cannot think and cannot learn.  In speaking at the 1969 White House Conference on Food Nutrition and Health, President Nixon said that ``a child ill-fed is dulled in curiosity, lower in stamina and distracted from learning.''  Over the last year or so the school nutrition programs have been the subject of a lot of debate, with many extreme Republicans in the House supporting a repeal of the School Lunch Act. This is a program that has always enjoyed strong bipartisan support in the Senate.  Agriculture Chairman Lugar and Senators Dole and Cochran have always supported the program, and have really helped make it what it is today. Back in 1981 Senators Dole, Cochran, and Helms wrote, then-White House chief of staff, Jim Baker and urged the Reagan administration not to make cuts to the program.  In 1995, the Vermont School Lunch Program served over 7,663,000 lunches to students in 335 schools in Vermont. For many of these children school meals are their main source of nutrition. School lunches provide one-third to one-half of the recommended daily allowances for key nutrients.  The school nutrition programs have done a fabulous job for the last 50 years of providing American children healthy school meals that prepare them to learn today and to compete tomorrow. This program is an example of what is working and what is good about Government.  Today's school nutrition programs are healthier than ever. As part of the Better Nutrition and Health for Children Act of 1994 that I was able to pass as chairman of the Agriculture Committee, all schools must meet the dietary guidelines for Americans by the 1996-97 school year.  Many schools are ahead of the deadline and are already meeting these guidelines that lower the sodium and fat content of the school meals. For those schools that need help, USDA is working with them.  We in Congress are also working with the schools and asking them what they need. Just last week the President signed H.R. 2066 giving schools maximum flexibility in how they meet the new dietary guidelines. So I think that we have reached a very good medium of Federal support and guidelines while giving the individual schools the flexibility to do what works best for them.  Last year marked a major milestone in the history of the National School Lunch Program--for the first time in 50 years we made historic changes in the nutrition standards for school meals. Under the leadership of Under Secretary Haas we have the School Meals Initiative for Healthy Children.  Then, realizing that change cannot be mandated, Under Secretary Haas undertook one of the most sweeping, innovative programs in the history of the program--Team Nutrition.  Team Nutrition's mission is to improve the health and education of children by creating innovative public and private partnerships that promote food choices for a healthy diet through the media, schools, families, and communities across the country.  For 50 years, the National School Lunch Program has prepared children for a healthier future.  Today, as we move into the 21st century, we are celebrating and bringing together all those who care about the health of our Nation's children. That's what Team Nutrition is all about--local community coalitions joining together to promote nutrition education for children and families. Already Team Nutrition has over 12,000 schools signed up. Team Nutrition is reaching millions of children in thousands of communities and inspiring educators, families, and community leaders to work together to improve the health of our Nation's children.  I am also pleased that one of my former communication directors, Alicia Bambara, is working with the Under Secretary on this effort and doing a wonderful job. She also worked to found a shelter for homeless, pregnant women in the District of Columbia.  I would like to congratulate the School Lunch Program and give a special thanks to a few special people who have helped bring so many healthy meals to Vermont school children: Jo Busha, the head of the Vermont Child Nutrition Program, Marlene Senecal, Connie Bellavance, and Sue Steinhurst at the Vermont School Food Service Association and Rob Dostis with the Campaign to End Childhood Hunger. I also would like to thank all of the wonderful school food service professionals who work so very hard at this important task.  I ask unanimous consent that an article which gives an excellent history of the program's first 50 years be printed in the Record.  There being no objection, the article was ordered to be printed in the Record, as follows:                 Decades of Dedication--The Early Years                      (By Patricia L. Fitzgerald)       Despite all the changes of the past 50 years--technology,      economics, demographics, legislation--the history of school      foodservice is truly remarkable for how much has stayed the      same. The mission hasn't changed since the earliest programs      in the 19th century: Provide meals to children at school to      ensure their health and promote their ability to learn. And      while many faces have changed, the school foodservice      profession has always been composed of individuals who have a      true and dedicated commitment to this mission.       Many of the obstacles that confronted the profession's      pioneers still exist--in different forms--today. These      include managing tight budgets, surviving political      maneuverings, meeting nutritional requirements in the face of      children's tastes and preferences and fighting resistance to      consider school meals an integral and intrinsic part of the      education system.       But where did all of this--the need, the dedication, the      challenge--begin? How did two groups of foodservice directors      find themselves merging together in 1946 to create a      profession dedicated to advancing standards and managing a      new federal program?                                 roots       According to historical records, the first known program to      combine lunch and education began in 1790, in Munich,      Germany. Court Rumford, Benjamin Thompson, established the      Poor People's Institute, which included a program of teaching      and feeding hungry, vagrant children. Half of the day, the      children worked making clothes for the army and the other      half they received an education. Food was primarily a soup      made from potatoes, barley and peas.       Throughout the 19th century, all over Europe, charitable      organizations began to take on the burden of feeding and      educating children in poverty, but as the century wore on,      local governments began to pick up more and more of the      financial burden. By 1877, the Paris government started      school ``cantines,'' providing meals at public expense for      children in need. In England, the Education (Provision of      Meals) Act passed in 1905, after lobbying from 365 private      and charitable organizations. And in Holland in 1900, a royal      decree ordered municipals to supply food and clothing to      needy school children.       These efforts in Europe were paralleled by ones in the      United States. In 1853, the Children's Aid Society in New      York served meals to students attending vocational school,      but it wasn't until 1919 that the Board of Education assumed      full responsibility for all lunch programs in Manhattan and      the Bronx. The movement was similar in other U.S. cities. In      Philadelphia, for example, the Starr Center Association began      serving penny lunches in one school in 1894; in 1909,      responsibility for operating and supporting the lunch program      was transferred to the city's school board.       In smaller cities, ``charitable organizations'' often meant      the mothers of the children at school. In 1904, the Women's      School Alliance of Wisconsin began furnishing lunches to      children in Milwaukee. The meals were prepared in the homes      of women who lived near the schools and were willing to cook      and serve. And in rural areas, the responsibility was often      assumed by the teachers themselves, preparing soups and other      hot dishes from meats and vegetables brought by the children.                          the great depression       The stock market crash of 1929 brought a whole new urgency      and visibility to the issue of hunger in America. As      unemployment skyrocketed, the country's middle class suddenly      became the ``new poor,'' and the country looked to the      government for help.       Unfortunately, President Herbert Hoover's administration      had no answers, and the Depression wore on without relief.      Instead of slowing the expansion of local school lunch      programs, the bleak economics drove home their value. In many      communities, a school meal program was initiated and provided      by a legion of volunteers.       Aid came in the form of new president Franklin Delano      Roosevelt's New Deal, and the establishment of a number of      ``alpha-bet organizations,'' government programs designed to      provide opportunities for employment. In 1933-34, burgeoning      school lunch programs in 39 states found valuable assistance      from the Civil Works Administration and the Federal Relief      Administration. And in 1935, the Work Projects Administration     (WPA) was created; needy women all over the United States      found work under WPA programs to prepare and serve school      lunches. And with much of the labor burden off of school      districts, lunch prices could be kept low, which increased      participation.       Donated commodities were another key to early school lunch      success. While unemployment in the cities was rampant,      America's farmers were having bumper crops. But without a      market to buy, surpluses grew, prices fell and farmers began      to go out of business. In 1935, the government began to      remove price-depressing surplus foods from the market, and      school lunch programs were one excellent outlet for the      goods.       Throughout the 1930s, many states and cities began to adopt      legislation--often including appropriations--that mandated      schools to serve lunch to students. By 1937, 15 states had      passed laws specifically authorizing local school boards to      operate lunchrooms, serving meals at cost or less.       The numbers tell the story. By 1941, WPA school lunch      programs were in all states, the District of Columbia and      Puerto Rico, serving an average of nearly 2 million lunches      daily and employing more than 64,000 people.                         a sense of permanence       When America went to war, it sent its boys overseas and its      women to work in the defense industry. By 1944, the WPA's      payroll was gone, but the demand for continuation of lunch      programs was not. In 1944, Congress earmarked funds to      maintain the programs for the year and repeated this action      in 1945. Behind the scenes, a campaign to establish a      permanent, reliable federal subsidy for school lunch was in      the works.       In 1946, Congress recognized the need to establish a      national, permanent, federally funded school lunch program.      Section 2 of the final law succinctly explains the      legislators' rationale: ``It is hereby declared to be the      policy of Congress, as a measure of national security, to      safeguard the health and well-being of the Nation's children      and to encourage the domestic consumption of nutritious      agricultural commodities and other food, by assisting the      States, through grants-in-aid and other means, in providing      an adequate supply of foods and other facilities for the      establishment, maintenance, operation and expansion of      nonprofit school lunch programs.''       After considerable lobbying by the burgeoning school      foodservice profession and with the support of some heavy      hitters in the Senate, Congress passed the National School      Lunch Act of 1946, which was signed into law by President      Harry Truman on June 4. In addition to defining      appropriations--including those for administrative expenses--     the new law set minimum nutritional requirements for three      types of acceptable lunches.                            a new profession       Although school foodservice began with unskilled      volunteers, it was quick to grow into a bona fide profession      during the 1930s. Cafeteria management and foodservice      direction were new careers. And the early pioneers (see      sidebar, page 50) developed high standards for sanitation,      nutrition and home economics. The Thirties saw the formation      of two national organizations created to further this brand-     new profession: the Conference of Food Service Directors and      the National School Cafeteria Association.       After passage of the National School Lunch Act, these two      groups agreed to a merger conference to join forces and      create a new organization. On October 10-12, 1946, in      Chicago, the School Food Service Association was born (the      word ``American'' wouldn't be added to the name of the      organization until 1951). There were 300 school foodservice      professionals in attendance, representing programs in 34      states, as well as the U.S. Department of Agriculture.      Constance C. Hart, a school foodservice director from      Rochester, N.Y., and a founder of the Conference of Food      Service Directors, was elected ASFSA's first president.       Through the end of the 1940's, the Association concentrated      on getting on its feet, administering the new federal school      lunch program and providing professional development      opportunities for its growing membership. In 1947, member      rolls were 709. Oklahoma became ASFSA's first state      affiliate. The first annual convention was held in Dallas in      November. Attendance at the convention was 478, and there      were 39 exhibitors, including many still-familiar names, such      as American Dietetic Association, The Cleveland Range      Company, Florida Citrus Commission, The Hobart Manufacturing      Company and the National Livestock and Meat Board. In 1948,      membership remained steady, Betsy Curtis was president and      the convention was held in Detroit.       Dr. Mary deGarmo Bryan took the helm in 1948-49, and      ASFSA's first constitution was adopted. That year also saw      the development of the Association's first membership      publication: School Meals. Membership grew to 920. Thelma      Flanagan's term as 1949-50 president say many actions that      gave shape to the infant association. We'll examine these in      the next installment of ``Decades of Dedication.''                              O PIONEERS!       The school foodservice profession owes a debt to all of the      leaders that guided it through the turbulent waters of change      and growth over the past 50 years. In this issue we pay      special tribute to just a few of those who fought for the      establishment of a federal school lunch program and helped      shape a brand-new profession. Their influence is still felt      today.       Dr. Mary deGarmo Bryan. A professional educator, she was      largely responsible for the professional standards of the      program, teaching many of the first generation of school      foodservice professionals. Her 1936 text, The School      Cafeteria, was one of the bases for the school lunch program.      A professor at Columbia University Teachers College for over      20 years, deGarmo was president of ASFSA in 1948-49.       Marion Cronan. Through her regular column, ``The School      Lunch,'' in Practical Home Economics magazine, Cronan was      instrumental in bringing the professional concerns of lunch      programs to the attention of a foodservice audience. She      served as ASFSA president for 1967-68.       Thelma Flanagan. Considered by many to be Florida's ``first      lady of the profession,'' Flanagan also made an indelible      impact on the national association. As ASFSA's 1949-50      president, Flanagan was responsible for giving the fledgling      association some shape, creating specialized departments and      instituting long-range planning. Today, the Thelma Flanagan      Gold Award recognizes states that excel in meeting ASFSA's      Plan of Action.       Constance Hart. Director of Lunchrooms for the Rochester,      N.Y., public school system in 1942, Hart was an early      proponent for nutrition education in the schools. A founder      of the Conference of Food Service Directors in 1935, Hart      became ASFSA's first president, elected at the merger meeting      between the Conference and the National School Cafeteria      Association. She served in 1946-47.       Senator Richard B. Russell (D-Ga.) As chair of the Senate      Agriculture Committee's Appropriations Subcommittee, his      support of the National School Lunch Act was invaluable for      getting the bill through Congress.       John Stalker. In 1935, Stalker headed Massachusetts'      commodity distribution program and became the state's      director of school foodservice programs. Stalker set      nutrition and management standards that were national models.      He designed ASFSA's first emblem and served as a valuable      legislative leader at both the state and national levels.       Frank Washam. Director of Chicago's school lunch program,      Washam was a leader in the National School Cafeteria      Association and a leader in the movement to obtain permanent      federal support for school lunches.                          ____________________
