Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.  I want to thank, in particular, Mr. Allen, Mr. Shimkus, Mr. Dingell, Mr. Barton, obviously Mr. Wynn for helping to manage this bill this afternoon. You know, this bill culminates an agreement that took many weeks of talks between the majority and minority members and their staffs. I want to thank all of the stakeholders that were involved in those discussions. Significant improvements clearly were made as that legislation moved through our committee, Energy and Commerce, as it winds its way to the floor this afternoon.  The bill tackled the serious concern that elemental mercury pollution in other countries will eventually convert to methylmercury pollution in the United States. Methylmercury is themost potent form of mercury poisoning, and a serious, very serious neurotoxin.  And, obviously, as Mr. Wynn indicated, this bans the export of such mercury, elemental mercury in the year 2010.  This legislation directs the Department of Energy, which has experience storing elemental mercury, to set up a domestic storage option.                              {time}  1430  The legislation does not preclude any private storage solutions from occurring. Private entities wishing to take advantage of the DOE-sponsored storage option must pay the Department of Energy for that privilege, but in return they are indemnified against any environmental damage that is caused once DOE takes possession of that mercury.  The bill only covers elemental mercury. It does not cover coal exports. It is not intended to cover fly ash exports, from coal combustion, or small amounts of mercury in manufactured consumer products.  The bill requires that EPA monitor the global implications of a U.S. export ban on elemental mercury. EPA is also required to report back to the Congress on any negative consequences caused by that export ban.  The legislation permits EPA to grant targeted, temporary waivers for individual shipments of elemental mercury to other countries. And I would note that groups that are supporting this bill include the American Chemistry Council; the National Mining Association; the Chlorine Institute; the Environmental Council of the States; and the NRDC, the Natural Resources Defense Council.  Again, I compliment all those Members and staff that worked so hard to make this truly a bipartisan bill. I would like to think that we can pass this with unanimous support this afternoon.  Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time
