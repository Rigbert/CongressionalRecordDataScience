 I believe this amendment should be adopted because it advances our efforts to reach a consensus among dairy producers in this country. It represents a good compromise between those who would want a super low cap and those who have no cap. If we are ever to make any progress on dairy, all of us will have to give a little. So I appreciate the amendment. I urge its adoption.  Mr. Chairman, I reserve the balance of my time.  The CHAIRMAN pro tempore (Mr. Hastings of Washington). The question is on the amendment offered by the gentleman from Louisiana (Mr. Vitter) to the amendment offered by the gentleman from Vermont (Mr. Sanders).  The amendment to the amendment was agreed to.
