I thank Senator Pryor, Senator Collins, Senator Stevens, Senator Inouye, and so many others for their efforts to bring us to this point. We hope to pass it very soon this afternoon. We are waiting for a little paperwork to be finished.  I am going to use this opportunity to speak as in morning business, and I ask unanimous consent to do so.
