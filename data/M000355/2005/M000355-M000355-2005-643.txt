 President, let me point out to all Members of the Senate that in spite of our best efforts to finish the State-Foreign Operations bill last night, right at the end, the amendments began to multiply. That is the bad news. But the good news is I can report that on the Republican side, shortly, we will be down to two amendments, one of which may--I repeat, may--require a rollcall vote. And I hope my friend and colleague Senator Leahy is trying to narrow down amendments likewise on the Democratic side.  In the meantime, Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that Senator Lugar be added as cosponsor to amendment 1299, which the Senate adopted last night.
