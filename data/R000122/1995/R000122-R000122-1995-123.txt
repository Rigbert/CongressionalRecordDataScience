Speaker, I rise in support of protecting Social Security, but I would like Rhode Island's senior citizens to realize that the Flanagan resolution, House Concurrent Resolution 17, is weak, nonbinding, and political cover.  Supposedly, House Concurrent Resolution 17 puts the Congress on record as opposing cuts in Social Security to achieve a balanced budget. However, nothing could be further from the truth.  Unfortunately, House Concurrent Resolution 17 is the same kind of nonbinding resolution that was used in past Congresses to commemorate ``National Pizza Week''--concurrent resolutions are not law and they certainly do not supersede the Constitution of the United States.  If Members truly want to protect Social Security from the cuts needed to achieve a balanced budget, they should vote for the Wise, Gephardt, Owens, or Conyers versions of the balanced budget amendments. These proposals would really protect Social Security because they would prohibit Social Security cuts under the Constitution.  Indeed, if resolutions and laws are enough to protect Social Security, why aren't they sufficient to force Congress to balance the budget. As a wise person once said, ``what's good for the goose is good for the gander.''  Mr. Speaker, I will vote for the Flanagan resolution, but more importantly I will support those versions of the balanced budget amendment which provide constitutional protection for Social Security.
