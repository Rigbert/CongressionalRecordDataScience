Mr. Speaker, I submit for the benefit of the Members a copy of the cost estimate prepared by the Congressional Budget Office for H.R. 2484, a bill to provide that land which is owned by the Lower Sioux Indian Community in the State of Minnesota but which is not held in trust by the United States for the Community may be leased or transferred by the Community without further approval by the United States. The bill was passed by the House of Representatives on February 29, 2000 by voice vote.                                      Congressional Budget Office,                                                U.S. Congress,                                Washington, DC, February 29, 2000.     Hon. Don Young,     Chairman, Committee on Resources, House of Representatives,          Washington, DC.       Dear Mr. Chairman: The Congressional Budget Office has      prepared the enclosed cost estimate for H.R. 2484, a bill to      provide that land which is owned by the Lower Sioux Indian      Community in the state of Minnesota but which is not held in      trust by the United States for the community may be leased or      transferred by the community without further approval by the      United States.       If you wish further details on this estimate, we will be      pleased to provide them. The CBO staff contacts are Lanette      Keith (for federal costs), who can be reached at 226-2860,      and Marjorie Miller (for the impact on state, local, and      tribal governments), who can be reached at 225-3220.           Sincerely,                                            Barry B. Anderson,                                   (For Dan L. Crippen, Director).       Enclosure.               CONGRESSIONAL BUDGET OFFICE COST ESTIMATE     H.R. 2484--A bill to provide that land which is owned by the          Lower Sioux Indian Community in the state of Minnesota          but which is not held in trust by the United States for          the community may be leased or transferred by the          community without further approval by the United States.       CBO estimates that implementing this bill would have no      significant impact on the federal budget. Because enactment      of H.R. 2484 would not affect direct spending or receipts,      pay-as-you-go procedures would not apply. H.R. 2484 contains      no intergovernmental or private-sector mandates as defined in      the Unfunded Mandates Reform Act and would impose no costs on      state, local, or tribal governments.       H.R. 2484 would allow the Lower Sioux Indian Community to      lease, sell, or convey any land held by the community that is      not held in trust by the United States. Current law requires      Congressional approval before tribes may convey land that is      not held in trust.       The CBO staff contacts for this estimate are Lanette J.      Keith (for federal costs), who can be reached at 226-2860,      and Marjorie Miller (for the impact on state, local, and      tribal governments), who can be reached at 225-3220. This      estimate was approved by Peter H. Fontaine, Deputy Assistant      Director for Budget Analysis.                               ____________________
