 Speaker, I would like to congratulate the outstanding performance of Saint Johnsbury Academy from St. Johnsbury, VT in the We the People . . . The Citizen and the Constitution national finals held in Washington, DC, April 26-28, 2003. These outstanding young people competed against 48 other classes from thoughout the Nation and demonstrated a remarkable understanding of the fundamental ideals and values of American constitutional government.  Adminstered by the Center for Civic Education, the program is the most extensive of its kind, reaching more than 26 million students at elementary, middle, and high schools. The national finals competition simulates a congressional hearing whereby high school students testify as constitutional experts before a panel of judges, and the students from Saint Johnsbury Academy performed brilliantly.  I would like to recognize Mr. Henry Eaton, the moderator for this outstanding group from St. Johnsbury Academy, and the students themselves: Ingrid Bengtson, Merril Bent, Alex Camelio, Brent Clayton, Simon Darling, Dave Goreau, John Limberakis, Ross Marklein, Caroline Milne, Monica Montany, Eric Rowe, Susannah Roy, Kelsey Stavseth, Alex Tausanovitch, and Ashley Ward.                          ____________________
