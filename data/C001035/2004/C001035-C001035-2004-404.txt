President, I want to give my colleagues an update on an amendment that was offered yesterday. It is an amendment that was offered by Senator Wyden on behalf of himself, Senator Snowe, Senator Graham, and Senator Lott. I believe we have reached an agreement on a compromise to that amendment, which deals with declassification. Actually, I recall the Presiding Officer, Senator Cornyn, is also a cosponsor of the amendment.  We have been able to work out an alternative to the amendment. We are just waiting for language to come from legislative counsel. It is my hope, and I believe the hope of Senator Lieberman, that we will be able to dispose of that amendment this afternoon.
