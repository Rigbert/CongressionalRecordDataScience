 President, yesterday was a big day before the Senate. We had the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act bill. Today is an even bigger day because the intelligence authorization bill is going to be before the Senate, and today we will grapple with something that I think should be major in our consciousness and major in our deliberations. It is central to who we are as a nation.
