Speaker, reclaiming my time, I am presuming, and there was some discussion about this last week, that at some point in time in the next couple of weeks, we are going to have to do some sort of continuing resolution. Is that the gentleman's belief as well? I yield to my friend.  Mr. DeLAY. Mr. Speaker, I thank my friend for yielding. Yes, the way things look, the gentleman knows that we have passed all of our appropriations bills out of the House and did so before July 4. The Senate does not have the same schedule, and it is quite obvious to all of us that they will not be able to get all of their appropriations bills across their floor in a timely manner. So we do anticipate to do some sort of CR before the end of this month. Whether it is next week or the following week, we do not know yet.
