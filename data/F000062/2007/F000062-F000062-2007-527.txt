 President, Senators Craig, Kennedy, Martinez, Boxer, Voinovich and I are once again introducing legislation that will address the chronic labor shortage in our Nation's agricultural industry. This bill is a priority for me--and for the tens of thousands of farmers who are currently suffering--and I hope we will move it forward early in this Congress.  The Agricultural Job Opportunities, Benefits, and Security Act, or AgJOBS, is the product of more than ten years of work. It is a bipartisan bill supported by growers, farmers, and farm workers alike. It passed the Senate last year as part of the comprehensive immigration reform bill last spring in the 109th Congress. It is time to move this bill forward.  The agricultural industry is in crisis. Farmers across the Nation report a 20 percent decline in labor.  The result is that there are simply not enough farm workers to harvest the crops.  The Nation's agricultural industry has suffered. If we do not enact a workable solution to the agricultural labor crisis, we risk a national production loss of $5 billion to $9 billion each year,according to the American Farm Bureau.  California, in particular, will suffer. California is the single largest agricultural state in the nation. California agriculture accounts for $34 billion in annual revenue. There 76,500 farms that produce half of the nation's fruits, vegetables, and nuts from only 3 percent of the Nation's farmland.  California farms produce approximately 350 different crops: pears, walnuts, raisins, lettuce, onions, cotton, just to name a few.  Many of the farmers who grow these crops have been in the business for generations. They farm the land that their parents and their grandparents farmed before them.  The sad consequence of the labor shortage is that many of these farmers are giving up their farms. Some are leaving the business entirely. Others are bulldozing their fruit trees--literally pulling out trees that have been in the family for generations--because they do not have the labor they need to harvest their fruit.  Once the trees are gone, they are replaced by crops that do not require manual labor. And our pears, our apples, our oranges will come from foreign sources.  The trend is quite clear. If there is not a means to grow and harvest our produce here, we will import produce from China, from Mexico, from other countries who have the labor they need.  We will put American farmers out of business. And there will be a ripple effect felt throughout the economy: in farm equipment, inputs, packaging, processing, transportation, marketing, lending and insurance. Jobs will be lost and our economy will suffer.  The reality is that Americans have come to rely on undocumented workers to harvest their crops for them.  In California alone, we rely on approximately one million undocumented workers to harvest the crops. The United Farm Workers estimate that undocumented workers make up as much as 90 percent the farm labor payroll.  Americans simply will not do the work. It is hard, stooped labor, requiring long and unpredictable hours. Farm workers must leave home and travel from farm to farm to plant, prune, and harvest crops according to the season.  We must come to terms with the fact that we rely on an undocumented migrant work force. We must bring those workers out of the shadows and create a legal and enforceable means to provide labor for agriculture. That realization is what led to the long and careful negotiations creating AgJOBS.  The AgJOBS bill is a two part bill. Part one identifies and deals with those undocumented agricultural workers who have been working in the United States for the past 2 years or more. Part two creates a more usable H-2A Program, to implement a realistic and effective guest worker program.  The first step requires undocumented agricultural workers to apply for a ``blue card'' if they can demonstrate that they have worked in American agriculture for at least 150 workdays over the past 2 years. The blue card entitles the worker to a temporary legal resident status.  The blue card itself is encrypted and machine readable; it is tamper and counterfeit resistant, and contains biometric identifiers unique to the farm worker.  The second step requires that a blue card holder work in American agriculture for an additional 5 years for at least 100 workdays a year, or 3 years at 150 workdays a year.  Blue card workers would have to pay a $500 fine. The workers can travel abroad and reenter the United States and they may work in other, non-agricultural jobs, as long as they meet the agricultural work requirements.  The blue card worker's spouse and minor children, who already live in the United States, may also apply for a temporary legal status and identification card, which would permit them to work and travel.  The total number of blue cards is capped at 1.5 million over a five year period and the program sunsets after 5 years.  At the end of the required work period, the blue card worker may apply for a green card to become a legal permanent resident.  There are also a number of safeguards. If a blue card worker does not apply for a green card, or does not fulfill the work requirements, that individual can be deported.  Likewise, a blue card holder who commits a felony, three misdemeanors, or any crime that involves bodily injury, the threat of serious bodily injury, or harm to property in excess of $500, cannot get a green card and can be deported.  This program, for the first time, allows us to identify those hundreds of thousands of farm workers who now work in the shadows. It requires the farm workers to come forward and to be identified in exchange for the right to work and live legally in the United States. And it gives farmers the legal certainty they need to hire the workers they need.  The program also modifies the H-2A guest worker program so that it realistically responds to our agricultural needs.  Currently, the H-2A program is bureaucratic, unresponsive, expensive, and prone to litigation. Farmers cannot get the labor when they need it. AgJOBS offers a much-needed reform of the outdated system.  The labor certification process, which often takes 60 days or more, is replaced by an ``attestation'' process. The employer can file a fax-back application form agreeing to abide by the requirements of the H-2A program. Approval should occur in 48 to 72 hours.  The interstate clearance order to determine whether there are U.S. workers who can qualify for the jobs is replaced by a requirement that the employer file a job notification with the local office of the state Employment Security Agency. Advertising and positive recruitment must take place in the local labor market area.  Agricultural associations can continue to file applications on behalf of members.  The statutory prohibition against ``adversely affecting'' U.S. workers is eliminated. The Adverse Effect Wage Rate is instead frozen for 3 years, and thereafter indexed by a methodology that will lead to its gradual replacement with a prevailing wage standard.  Employers may elect to provide a housing allowance in lieu of housing if the governor determines that there is adequate rental housing available in the area of employment.  Inbound and return transportation and subsistence are required on the same basis as under the current program, except that trips of less than 100 miles are excluded, and workers whom an employer is not required to provide housing are excluded.  The motor vehicle safety standards for U.S. workers are extended to H-2A workers.  Petitions for admission of H-2A workers must be processed and the consulate or port of entry notified within 7 days of receipt. Requirements are the same as current law.  Petitions extending aliens' stay or changing employers are valid upon filing.  Employers may apply for the admission of new H-2A workers to replace those who abandoned their work or are terminated for cause, and the Department of Homeland Security is required to remove H-2A aliens who abandoned their work.  H-2A visas will be secure and counterfeit resistant.  A new limited federal right of action is available to foreign workers to enforce the economic benefits required under the H-2A program, and any benefits expressly offered by the employer in writing. A statute of limitations of three years is imposed.  Finally, lawsuits in State court under State contract law alleging violations of the H-2A program requirements and obligations are expressly preempted. Such State court lawsuits have been the venue of choice for litigation against H-2A employers in recent years.  AgJOBS is the one part of the immigration bill about which there is uniform agreement. Everyone knows that agriculture in America is supported by undocumented workers. As immigration enforcement tightens up, and increasing numbers of people are prevented from crossing the borders or are being deported, the result is our crops go unharvested.  We are faced today with a very practical dilemma and one that is easy to solve. The legislation has been vetted over and over again. Senator Craig, I,and a multitude of other Senators have sat down with the growers, with the farm bureaus, with the chambers, with everybody who knows agriculture, and they have all signed off on the AgJOBS bill.  This is our opportunity to solve a real problem.  I ask my colleagues to join Senator Craig, Senator Kennedy, Senator Martinez, Senator Boxer, Senator Voinovich and me in supporting this legislation.  I also ask by unanimous consent that the text of this bill be printed in the Record.  There being no objection, the text of the bill was ordered to be printed in the Record, as follows:                                 S. 237       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of      the United States of America in Congress assembled,     SECTION 1.

(c) Terms of Employment.--       (1) Prohibition.--No alien granted blue card status may be      terminated from employment by any employer during the period      of blue card status except for just cause.       (2) Treatment of complaints.--       (A) Establishment of process.--The Secretary shall      establish a process for the receipt, initial review, and      disposition of complaints by aliens granted blue card status      who allege that they have been terminated without just cause.      No proceeding shall be conducted under this paragraph with      respect to a termination unless the Secretary determines that      the complaint was filed not later than 6 months after the      date of the termination.       (B) Initiation of arbitration.--If the Secretary finds that      an alien has filed a complaint in accordance with      subparagraph (A) and there is reasonable cause to believe      that the alien was terminated from employment without just      cause, the Secretary shall initiate binding arbitration      proceedings by requesting the Federal Mediation and      Conciliation Service to appoint a mutually agreeable      arbitrator from the roster of arbitrators maintained by such      Service for the geographical area in which the employer is      located. The procedures and rules of such Service shall be      applicable to the selection of     such arbitrator and to such arbitration proceedings. The      Secretary shall pay the fee and expenses of the arbitrator,      subject to the availability of appropriations for such      purpose.       (C) Arbitration proceedings.--The arbitrator shall conduct      the proceeding under this paragraph in accordance with the      policies and procedures promulgated by the American      Arbitration Association applicable to private arbitration of      employment disputes. The arbitrator shall make findings      respecting whether the termination was for just cause. The      arbitrator may not find that the termination was for just      cause unless the employer so demonstrates by a preponderance      of the evidence. If the arbitrator finds that the termination      was not for just cause, the arbitrator shall make a specific      finding of the number of days or hours of work lost by the      employee as a result of the termination. The arbitrator shall      have no authority to order any other remedy, including      reinstatement, back pay, or front pay to the affected      employee. Not later than 30 days after the date of the      conclusion of the arbitration proceeding, the arbitrator      shall transmit the findings in the form of a written opinion      to the parties to the arbitration and the Secretary. Such      findings shall be final and conclusive, and no official or      court of the United States shall have the power or      jurisdiction to review any such findings.       (D) Effect of arbitration findings.--If the Secretary      receives a finding of an arbitrator that an employer has      terminated the employment of an alien who is granted blue      card status without just cause, the Secretary shall credit      the alien for the number of days or hours of work not      performed during such period of termination for the purpose      of determining if the alien meets the qualifying employment      requirement of section 103(a).       (E) Treatment of attorney's fees.--Each party to an      arbitration under this paragraph shall bear the cost of their      own attorney's fees for the arbitration.       (F) Nonexclusive remedy.--The complaint process provided      for in this paragraph is in addition to any other rights an      employee may have in accordance with applicable law.       (G) Effect on other actions or proceedings.--Any finding of      fact or law, judgment, conclusion, or final order made by an      arbitrator in the proceeding before the Secretary shall not      be conclusive or binding in any separate or subsequent action      or proceeding between the employee and the employee's current      or prior employer brought before an arbitrator,      administrative agency, court, or judge of any State or the      United States, regardless of whether the prior action was      between the same or related parties or involved the same      facts, except that the arbitrator's specific finding of the      number of days or hours of work lost by the employee as a      result of the employment termination may be referred to the      Secretary pursuant to subparagraph (D).       (3) Civil penalties.--       (A) In general.--If the Secretary finds, after notice and      opportunity for a hearing, that an employer of an alien      granted blue card status has failed to provide the record of      employment required under section 101(e) or has provided a      false statement of material fact in such a record, the      employer shall be subject to a civil money penalty in an      amount not to exceed $1,000 per violation.       (B) Limitation.--The penalty applicable under subparagraph      (A) for failure to provide records shall not apply unless the      alien has provided the employer with evidence of employment      authorization granted under this section.     SEC. 103. ADJUSTMENT TO PERMANENT RESIDENCE.       (a) In General.--Except as provided in subsection (b), the      Secretary shall adjust the status of an alien granted blue      card status to that of an alien lawfully admitted for      permanent residence if the Secretary determines that the      following requirements are satisfied:       (1) Qualifying employment.--       (A) In general.--Subject to subparagraph (B), the alien has      performed at least--       (i) 5 years of agricultural employment in the United States      for at least 100 work days per year, during the 5-year period      beginning on the date of the enactment of this Act; or       (ii) 3 years of agricultural employment in the United      States for at least 150 work days per year, during the 3-year      period beginning on the date of the enactment of this Act.       (B) 4-year period of employment.--An alien shall be      considered to meet the requirements of subparagraph (A) if      the alien has performed 4 years of agricultural employment in      the United States for at least 150 work days during 3 years      of those 4 years and at least 100 work days during the      remaining year, during the 4-year period beginning on the      date of the enactment of this Act.       (2) Proof.--An alien may demonstrate compliance with the      requirement under paragraph (1) by submitting--       (A) the record of employment described in section 101(e);      or       (B) such documentation as may be submitted under section      104(c).       (3) Extraordinary circumstances.--In determining whether an      alien has met the requirement of paragraph (1)(A), the      Secretary may credit the alien with not more than 12      additional months to meet the requirement of that      subparagraph if the alien was unable to work in agricultural      employment due to--       (A) pregnancy, injury, or disease, if the alien can      establish such pregnancy, disabling injury, or disease      through medical records;       (B) illness, disease, or other special needs of a minor      child, if the alien can establish such illness, disease, or      special needs through medical records; or       (C) severe weather conditions that prevented the alien from      engaging in agricultural employment for a significant period      of time.       (4) Application period.--The alien applies for adjustment      of status not later than 7 years after the date of the      enactment of this Act.       (5) Fine.--The alien pays a fine of $400 to the Secretary.       (b) Grounds for Denial of Adjustment of Status.--The      Secretary may deny an alien granted blue card status an      adjustment of status under this section and provide for      termination of such blue card status if--       (1) the Secretary finds by a preponderance of the evidence      that the adjustment to blue card status was the result of      fraud or willful misrepresentation, as described in section      212(a)(6)(C)(i) of the Immigration and Nationality Act (8      U.S.C. 1182(a)(6)(C)(i)); or       (2) the alien--       (A) commits an act that makes the alien inadmissible to the      United States under section 212 of the Immigration and      Nationality Act (8 U.S.C. 1182), except as provided under      section 105(b);       (B) is convicted of a felony or 3 or more misdemeanors      committed in the United States; or       (C) is convicted of an offense, an element of which      involves bodily injury, threat of serious bodily injury, or      harm to property in excess of $500.       (c) Grounds for Removal.--Any alien granted blue card      status who does not apply for adjustment of status under this      section before the expiration of the application period      described in subsection (a)(4) or who fails to meet the other      requirements of subsection (a) by the end of the application      period, is deportable and may be removed under section 240 of      the Immigration and Nationality Act (8 U.S.C. 1229a).       (d) Payment of Taxes.--       (1) In general.--Not later than the date on which an      alien's status is adjusted under this section, the alien      shall establish that the alien does not owe any applicable      Federal tax liability by establishing that--       (A) no such tax liability exists;       (B) all such outstanding tax liabilities have been paid; or       (C) the alien has entered into an agreement for payment of      all outstanding liabilities with the Internal Revenue      Service.       (2) Applicable federal tax liability.--In paragraph (1) the      term ``applicable Federal tax liability'' means liability for      Federal taxes, including penalties and interest, owed for any      year during the period of employment required under      subsection (a)(1) for which the statutory period for      assessment of any deficiency for such taxes has not expired.       (3) IRS cooperation.--The Secretary of the Treasury shall      establish rules and procedures under which the Commissioner      of Internal Revenue shall provide documentation to an alien      upon request to establish the payment of all taxes required      by this subsection.       (e) Spouses and Minor Children.--       (1) In general.--Notwithstanding any other provision of      law, the Secretary shall confer the status of lawful      permanent resident on the spouse and minor child of an alien      granted any adjustment of status under subsection (a),      including any individual who was a minor child on the date      such alien was granted blue card status, if the spouse or      minor child applies for such status, or if the principal      alien includes the spouse or minor child in an application      for adjustment of status to that of a lawful permanent      resident.

procedure for acceptance and      approval of applications in which the employer has not      complied with the provisions of this subparagraph because the      employer's need for H-2A workers could not reasonably have      been foreseen.       ``(ii) Job offers.--The employer has offered or will offer      the job to any eligible United States worker who applies and      is equally or better
