 President, I ask unanimous consent that when the Senate completes its business today, it stand in adjournment until 9:45 a.m., Tuesday, June 6. I further ask that following the prayer and the pledge, the morning hour be deemed expired, the Journal of proceedings be approved to date, the time for the two leaders be reserved, and the Senate proceed to executive session for the consideration of the nomination of Renee Marie Bumb, with all the time until 10:20 a.m. equally divided between the two managers or their designees, and that the Senate then proceed to a vote as under the previous order.
