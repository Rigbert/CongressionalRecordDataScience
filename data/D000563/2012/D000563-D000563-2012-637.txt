      Never mind that reams of Congressional testimony, market      analysis and academic research have shown that regulation has      not been an impediment to raising capital. In fact, too      little regulation has been at the root of all of our recent      bubbles and bursts--the dot-com crash, Enron, the mortgage      meltdown. Those free-for-alls created jobs and then imploded,      causing mass joblessness.       The centerpiece of this bill would curb investor      protections in the Sarbanes-Oxley law that require companies      to meet specific disclosure, accounting and auditing      standards before going public. The legislation is promoted as      applying only to small companies, but the parameters would      encompass all but the nation's biggest new companies.  I have been down this path before. I have been in Congress long enough to remember some of these bubbles, remember the victims and the losers when it was all over, the exuberance of deregulation which led, sadly, in many instances, to an unregulated marketplace where greed triumphed.  After each financial crisis, the savings and loan crisis, Enron, the housing and economic crash of 2008, this body has investigated and attempted to learn from the lessons of the past. How many times on this floor have Senators debated measures to ensure that we do not face another Enron, where shareholders lost between $40 and $60 billion in investments and employees lost $2.1 billion in pension plans, not to mention their jobs. We promised that would never happen again. We established standards of regulation, which we are now proposing to waive in this so-called jobs act.  I worked with my colleagues in the wake of the 2008 economic slide to pass the Dodd-Frank Act, to close the loopholes that resulted in millions of families losing their homes and $17 trillion in lost household and personal wealth. We learned from the past and worked together to provide oversight where regulation was just too lax. We passed commonsense rules to ensure consumers and investors were protected.  Just a few years later, after that crisis brought our economy to its knees, it seems some have forgotten those lessons. It was not too much regulation that led to the financial crisis of 2008. We did not get into that mess because agencies such as the SEC had too much power. It was the other way around. It was deregulation of the 1990s and Federal agencies turning a blind eye to activities that precipitated the global financial meltdown.  Regulatory agencies were underfunded, overwhelmed, and often limited in their authority. That does not mean we should do nothing. There are things we can do to ease the burden on companies looking to raise capital and create jobs.  There are commonsense measures to help small businesses access capital. We can exempt employees from counting toward shareholder limits, so these companies can reward their employees with stock options. We can increase the amount of money startups can raise, while still being exempt from SEC registration. There are things we can do to help companies grow and create jobs, while still protecting investors.  But the bill passed by the House does not do that. The House-passed bill says that more than 90 percent of newly public firms do not have to comply with Federal disclosure, accounting, and auditing standards. This means that when an investor is making a decision about which newly public firms to put their hard-earned money in, they will not have access to basic vital information about those firms.  How can investors make good, sound decisions about where to invest their savings and their money when some firms, those that have recently gone public, will not have to comply with new and improved accounting standards but all other firms will? The House-passed bill does not have enough protection for everyday investors who are considered unsophisticated in the financial sector, those who may not fully understand the risks of investing through an online crowdfunding Web site.  At a recent Senate Banking hearing, Professor John Coffee, from the Colombia University Law School, said: The crowdfunding technique is especially open to fraud because the companies that use it are most likely brandnew entities that do not have any operating history and might not even have financial statements.  Professor Coffee said: Those firms would be flying on a wing and a prayer, selling more hope than substance. The House-passed bill would allow firms to advertise and sell their stock through cold calls and other sales tactics. That is an invitation for fraud.  In this situation, someone can promise investments with high return with little risk. The Center for Retirement Research at Boston College calls this ``the magician'' and reports that seniors are three times more likely to be the victims of this type of fraud.  There is room to improve this bill to allow small businesses to grow and create jobs, but we have to do it with an eye toward oversight, transparency, and rules of the road which protect the average investor.  This so-called jobs bill creates a job opportunity for any individual salesman to set up shop with a barstool and a laptop computer. They can be selling worthless stock for phantom companies. This bill invites them to fleece unsuspecting customers of up to $10,000, promising that they will own certain companies. It can turn out that these companies have no assets, no business model, and may not even exist.  In the name of deregulation, these fraudsters could even include those who have been banned for life from the securities industry. That was a point that was raised by Professor Coffee's testimony. This bill is written to allow new salesmen to come on the scene and does not put any provision in there to prohibit those who have been banned by the securities industry from sales of securities.  Why would we invite the thieves back into the marketplace? This half-boiled concoction of ill-conceived ideas skirts, evades, and nullifies investor protection and market transparency standards that were enacted in response to the dot-com crash, the Enron debacle, and the litany of bubbles and bursts that have cost legions of unsuspecting Americans their savings, their jobs, and their retirement.  I requote one paragraph from the New York Times editorial:       The centerpiece of the bill would curb investor protections      in the Sarbanes-Oxley law that require companies to meet      specific disclosure, accounting and auditing standards before      going public. This legislation is promoted as applying only      to small companies, but the parameters would encompass all      but the nation's biggest new companies.  Literally, 90 percent of the new companies would be exempt under this provision. Exempting firms with less than $1 billion in revenue and less than $700 million in traded stock, so-called emerging growth companies, would exempt more than 90 percent of the companies going public, according to testimony before the Senate Banking Committee.  The delay in compliance with Dodd-Frank on executive compensation is particularly cheeky. Do you recall this? We sent billions of dollars to banking institutions as a result of the bailout to save them from their own stupidity and greed, and they turned around and gave executive compensation and bonus awards right and left to the very people who had engineered this disaster. We said when we passed Dodd-Frank, that was the end of that story. We were going to change it.  One of the Dodd-Frank provisions: In February 2009, Senator Christopher Dodd, a Connecticut Democrat who was chairman of the Senate Banking Committee, inserted a rule about pay at bailed-out banks into the economic stimulus. The rule did nothing to change the bonuses that had just been paid a few weeks earlier, but it required that bonuses paid in the future be paid in stock and not exceed one-third of total compensation. The idea was to create the right incentives, the incentives to be a larger owner of the company, into decisionmaking, not take the money and run.  Now comes this so-called jobs bill and exempts executive compensation standards. Firms with $1 billion in revenue certainly have the resources to disclose golden parachutes and insidious good old boy compensation packages.  I ask unanimous consent to have printed in the Record a stunning article from the New York Times this morning, written by Greg Smith, entitled, ``Why I Am Leaving Goldman Sachs.''  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in the Record, as follows:                [From the New York Times, Mar. 14, 2012]                     Why I Am Leaving Goldman Sachs                            (By Greg Smith)       Today is my last day at Goldman Sachs. After almost 12      years at the firm--first as a summer intern while at      Stanford, then in New York for 10 years, and now in London--I      believe I have worked here long enough to understand the      trajectory of its culture, its people and its identity. And I      can honestly say that the environment now is as toxic and      destructive as I have ever seen it.       To put the problem in the simplest terms, the interests of      the client continue to be sidelined in the way the firm      operates and thinks about making money. Goldman Sachs is one      of the world's largest and most important investment banks      and it is too integral to global finance to continue to act      this way. The firm has veered so far from the place I joined      right out of college that I can no longer in good conscience      say that I identify with what it stands for.       It might sound surprising to a skeptical public, but      culture was always a vital part of Goldman Sachs's success.      It revolved around teamwork, integrity, a spirit of humility,      and always doing right by our clients. The culture was the      secret sauce that made this place great and allowed us to      earn our clients' trust for 143 years. It wasn't just about      making money; this alone will not sustain a firm for so long.      It had something to do with pride and belief in the      organization. I am sad to say that I look around today and      see virtually no trace of the culture that made me love      working for this firm for many years. I no longer have the      pride, or the belief.       But this was not always the case. For more than a decade I      recruited and mentored candidates through our grueling      interview process. I was selected as one of 10 people (out of      a firm of more than 30,000) to appear on our recruiting      video, which is played on every college campus we visit      around the world. In 2006 I managed the summer intern program      in sales and trading in New York for the 80 college students      who made the cut, out of the thousands who applied.       I knew it was time to leave when I realized I could no      longer look students in the eye and tell them what a great      place this was to work.       When the history books are written about Goldman Sachs,      they may reflect that the current chief executive officer,      Lloyd C. Blankfein, and the president, Gary D. Cohn, lost      hold of the firm's culture on their watch. I truly believe      that this decline in the firm's moral fiber represents the      single most serious threat to its long-run survival.       Over the course of my career I have had the privilege of      advising two of the largest hedge funds on the planet, five      of the largest asset managers in the United States, and three      of the most prominent sovereign wealth funds in the Middle      East and Asia. My clients have a total asset base of more      than a trillion dollars. I have always taken a lot of pride      in advising my clients to do what I believe is right for      them, even if it means less money for the firm. This view is      becoming increasingly unpopular at Goldman Sachs. Another      sign that it was time to leave.       How did we get here? The firm changed the way it thought      about leadership. Leadership used to be about ideas, setting      an example and doing the right thing. Today, if you make      enough money for the firm (and are not currently an ax      murderer) you will be promoted into a position of influence.       What are three quick ways to become a leader? a) Execute on      the firm's ``axes,'' which is Goldman-speak for persuading      your clients to invest in the stocks or other products that      we are trying to get rid of because they are not seen as      having a lot of potential profit. b) ``Hunt Elephants.'' In      English: get your clients--some of whom are sophisticated,      and some of whom aren't--to trade whatever will bring the      biggest profit to Goldman. Call me old-fashioned, but I don't      like selling my clients a product that is wrong for them. c)      Find yourself sitting in a seat where your job is to trade      any illiquid, opaque product with a three-letter acronym.       Today, many of these leaders display a Goldman Sachs      culture quotient of exactly zero percent. I attend      derivatives sales meetings where not one single minute is      spent asking questions about how we can help clients. It's      purely about how we can make the most possible money off of      them. If you were an alien from Mars and sat in on one of      these meetings, you would believe that a client's success or      progress was not part of the thought process at all.       It makes me ill how callously people talk about ripping      their clients off. Over the last 12 months I have seen five      different managing directors refer to their own clients as      ``muppets,'' sometimes over internal e-mail. Even after the      S.E.C., Fabulous Fab, Abacus, God's work, Carl Levin, Vampire      Squids? No humility? I mean, come on. Integrity? It is      eroding. I don't know of any illegal behavior, but will      people push the envelope and pitch lucrative and complicated      products to clients even if they are not the simplest      investments or the ones most directly aligned with the      client's goals? Absolutely. Every day, in fact.       It astounds me how little senior management gets a basic      truth: If clients don't trust you they will eventually stop      doing business with you. It doesn't matter how smart you are.       These days, the most common question I get from junior      analysts about derivatives is, ``How much money did we make      off the client?'' It bothers me every time I hear it, because      it is a clear reflection of what they are observing from      their leaders about the way they should behave. Now project      10 years into the future: You don't have to be a rocket      scientist to figure out that the junior analyst sitting      quietly in the corner of the room hearing about ``muppets,''      ``ripping eyeballs out'' and ``getting paid'' doesn't exactly      turn into a model citizen.       When I was a first-year analyst I didn't know where the      bathroom was, or how to tie my shoelaces. I was taught to be      concerned with learning the ropes, finding out what a      derivative was, understanding finance, getting to know our      clients and what motivated them, learning how they defined      success and what we could do to help them get there.       My proudest moments in life--getting a full scholarship to      go from South Africa to Stanford University, being selected      as a Rhodes Scholar national finalist, winning a bronze medal      for table tennis at the Maccabiah Games in Israel, known as      the Jewish Olympics--have all come through hard work, with no      shortcuts. Goldman Sachs today has become too much about      shortcuts and not enough about achievement. It just doesn't      feel right to me anymore.       I hope this can be a wake-up call to the board of      directors. Make the client the focal point of your business      again. Without clients you will not make money. In fact, you      will not exist. Weed out the morally bankrupt people, no      matter how much money they make for the firm. And get the      culture right again, so people want to work here for the      right reasons. People who care only about making money will      not sustain this firm--or the trust of its clients--for very      much longer.
