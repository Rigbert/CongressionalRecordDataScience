REID. Mr. President, the distinguished Senator from Illinois knows, as I know, that there isn't a person in the Senate who thinks this has any chance of passing--no chance of passing. It will get 48, 50, 51 votes. I don't know how many votes it will get. If it were a straight up-or-down vote on an amendment, it would get less than that because some Republicans have said: This is a procedural vote, I am going to vote to allow it to go forward, but if it were here, I probably wouldn't vote for it. So you probably have in the Senate 41 or 42 sound votes for this.
