President, during the course of preparing this bill for the floor, I have been working on both sides of the aisle. I hope the vote in a few minutes will evidence that. I have had a constructive conversation with Senator Hutchison of Texas and Senator Martinez of Florida and others about modifications of the DREAM Act. I believe the proposals they have made in principle are positive proposals that move us toward our goal.  I say to the Senator from Texas, and I certainly am going to open this to her comments when I finish, it is my intention to offer a substitute amendment as the first amendment that is brought forward by the majority, a bipartisan amendment with Senator Hutchison which will achieve our mutual goals. I hope we can reach that agreement in the next 30 hours, after this motion prevails. Failing that agreement, the minority is protected because it will require another cloture vote, another 60-vote margin before this bill moves forward.  So they have my word to work in good faith on the substitute bipartisan amendment. Failing that, their protection is a cloture vote which they could join in defeating.  I yield to my colleague from Texas if she has any comment or question.
