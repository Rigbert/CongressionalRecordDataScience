Speaker, it is with great honor and pleasure that I stand before you to recognize Ivy Tech Community College Northwest and South Shore Clean Cities, Incorporated, as they join the National Alternative Fuels Training Consortium in hosting the 2006 National Alternative Fuel Vehicle (AFV) Day Odyssey. They, along with other community leaders, will come together on Thursday, October 12, 2006, at the Westfield Shoppingtown in Hobart, Indiana to explore alternatives to powering cars and trucks with gasoline and diesel throughout many locations across Northwest Indiana.  The National AFV Day Odyssey began in 2002. The mission of the National AFV Day Odyssey, which is vital to the protection of our environment for future generations of our country and the world, is to create awareness of alternative fuel and advanced technology vehicles. The first event reached more than 17,000 people at 51 sites nationwide. In 2004, nearly 25,000 people attended the 54 locations where the Odyssey events were held. Having continually grown in size and interest, this event will once again explore the environmental needs for AFV's in our country, and local participants will learn of alternative fuel options to protect the future of not only Northwest Indiana, but the rest of the nation as well.  On October 12, 2006, Ivy Tech Community College Northwest and South Shore Clean Cities, Incorporated will be educating participants on how alternative fuels can be part of the solution to America's environmental and energy needs. The day's events will include presentations, information, and games, as well as a special appearance by the Lindquist CNGRace Team, a racing team that enhances the goals of National AFV Day by racing alternative fuel vehicles in high-profile races throughout the United States.  Mr. Speaker, at this time, I ask that you and my other distinguished colleagues join me in recognizing and paying tribute to the National Alternative Fuels Training Consortium, Ivy Tech Community College Northwest, and South Shore Clean Cities, Incorporated as they strive to provide the tools and education for protecting our local and national interests in securing both the future of our environment and our Nation's energy independence.                          ____________________[Extensions of Remarks][Pages E1924-E1925]From the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov] TRIBUTE TO IVY TECH COMMUNITY COLLEGE NORTHWEST AND SOUTH SHORE CLEAN                               CITIES, INC.                                 ______                                                         HON.
