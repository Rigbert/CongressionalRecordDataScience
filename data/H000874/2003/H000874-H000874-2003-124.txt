Speaker, I yield to the gentleman from Texas (Mr. DeLay), the distinguished majority leader, for the purposes of informing the House for the following week and perhaps thereafter.  Mr. DeLAY. I appreciate the distinguished whip, the gentleman from Maryland (Mr. Hoyer), for yielding to me.  Mr. Speaker, I would like to make all Members aware that the House has completed voting for the day and for the week. We will take any votes called for on the three pending motions to instruct next week.  Regarding next week's schedule, the House will convene on Tuesday at 12:30 p.m. for morning hour and 2 p.m. for legislative business. At that time we expect to consider several measures under suspension of the rules, and any votes called on those measures will be rolled until after 6:30 p.m.  On Wednesday the House will meet for legislative business at 10 a.m. We expect to begin consideration of H.R. 2557, the Water Resources Development Act of 2003.  Members should also be aware that we may be considering conference reports at any time next week. We have a growing list of bills that could be ready. These include but are not limited to the fiscal year 2004 Homeland Security Appropriations Act, the fiscal 2004 Department of Defense Appropriations Act, and the Department of Defense authorization bill for fiscal 2004.  In addition, I would like to note that despite the great efforts of the House to complete all appropriations bills by the end of the fiscal year, we will have to consider a continuing resolution next week.  Finally, I would like to note for all Members that we do not plan to have votes next Friday, September 26.  Mr. Speaker, I thank gentleman for yielding.
