President, I understand that we have 3 minutes remaining to close debate on my amendment.  I have a hard time keeping a straight face when the Senator from California suggests I have a socialistic amendment. I would invite anyone who is entertaining any kind of joy in that statement to look at our record over the past many years. It is just humorous.  We have gone through listening to the same thing over and over and over again. We went through this yesterday for hours at a time.
