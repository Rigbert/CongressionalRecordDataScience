 President, I would like to thank the Senator from Idaho for those excellent remarks. I think he hit the nail on the head with respect to the rights of local government, and the way in which this Congress is moving. This preemption sets all of our progress regarding the relationship between Federal and local government back, and hurts cities, counties, and States in the process.  So I want the Senator to know how much I enjoy working with him on this. I thank him very much.
