Speaker, I rise this evening to question the fiscal responsibility of the current administration and to question their priorities.  On May 23, I came to this great House floor to vote for positive sweeping changes to our Nation's education programs, along with 384 of our colleagues who passed H.R. 1, the Act to Leave No Child Behind. H.R. 1 passed this House and it also passed the other body and was signed by the President this past January. Members of Congress on both sides of the aisle stood next to the President to sign the legislation we believed would finally make education what it should be, a number one priority.  Mr. Speaker, I come to the floor this evening because the administration's budget, its budget for next year, does not make education a priority. The President's education budget is a broken promise. President Bush has stated that he is the education president. Yet resources in his education budget did not match his rhetoric.  Last month, President Bush visited my home State of Ohio and told a crowd of citizens in Cleveland that we must make sure every child in America gets educated. However, the President's rhetoric does not match the resources in his budget.  President Bush did not mention the education programs that would not receive funding in the State due to his budget cuts. Indeed, the education budget that President Bush sent to Congress falls $7.2 billion, not million, billion short of the funds needed to implement programs that we passed in H.R. 1.  The most troubling aspect of the President's budget to me is that it spends 50 times more on tax cuts for the wealthiest 1 percent of Americans than the total of new education spending, 50 times more for those that already have extremely difficult choices for school districts across this country.  The President's budget cuts 57 education programs authorized in H.R. 1, 57 programs are cut, and his budget will fall short by $4.7 billion needed to support most academically needy students in our country, $4.7 billion short.  So one can rightly ask the question, is President Bush's education budget a broken promise?  Mr. Speaker, education must continue to be a priority. Couple this with the impact of the recession on State budgets which currently have deficits in aggregate of over $40 billion and there is no doubt that our governors are going to be forced to place major cuts on State education and spending at the elementary and secondary levels as well as the post-secondary. We already have seen this in States like Ohio.  State colleges are facing the worst State budget crunch in a decade. Frankly, I cannot understand why the college students across this country are not organizing to impact legislation in their State houses and here at the national level because we are witnessing the largest tuition hikes on our college students in recent history. Why are they so satisfied when, in fact, most of them are graduating with a debt of nearly $17,000 and in medical school over $100,000 debt for a new doctor coming out of med school?  A congressional survey found that 49 States made $1.5 billion in mid-year cuts to higher education funding. Public and private universities share a grim budget outlook indeed as public support dwindles during a faltering economy.  Ohio students will pay prices for higher education because the State of Ohio, as are many other States, is cutting support for higher education. Some State campuses, in fact, are facing increases in tuition of 3 to 15 percent.                              {time}  1700  In the wake of this news, it did not make any sense then for President Bush to propose ending the fixed-rate consolidations of Federal student loans earlier this spring. The administration stated that the funds, once allocated for the student loan program, would be used to cover the current $1.3 billion shortfall this year in the budget for the Pell grant program, so important for our lower-income students. But then the administration, after substantial criticism, rescinded that proposal.  Members of Congress continue to believe that education should be a number one priority. As a member of the Committee on Appropriations, I very much want to keep it a top priority, but we need the cooperation of the White House in this endeavor. And the barbecue tonight will not solve the problems of students and school districts across this country. Seven hundred thousand borrowers consolidate or refinance their total Federal student loans each year.  It is important to ask what other programs are going to be slashed, what other promises are going to be broken. Education should remain a number one priority.                          ____________________
