I have had requests for time on our side of the aisle from the distinguished Senator from Washington State, Ms. Cantwell, for 7 minutes; the distinguished Senator from Massachusetts, Mr. Kerry, for 5 minutes; the distinguished Senator from Minnesota, Mr. Wellstone, for 5 minutes; the distinguished Senator from Michigan, Mr. Levin, for 2 minutes.  I mention that, not to lock that in, because the time is there, but just to give people an idea of where we are.
