 As you may know, I asked CMS Administrator Scully at the Finance Committee markup to further delay implementation of these beneficiary caps. Unfortunately, as a result of the Senate Budget Resolution constraints, I do not have Medicare dollars to repeal the beneficiary cap on therapy services. I agree that this arbitrary limit does not make sense and have sought to address this issue in the past. I will work in conference to enact a therapy cap moratorium and appreciate your hard work and passion on this issue.
