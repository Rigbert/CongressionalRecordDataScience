Speaker, today I am introducing legislation to create a National Military Museum Foundation to provide much-needed support to our Nation's 90 military museums.  These museums, scattered across 34 States, tell the proud history of our armed services. Ever since the Revolution, the Department of War and its successor organizations have preserved historic military artifacts.  But today, many of these invaluable collections are in jeopardy. Museum facilities are deteriorating and there has been inadequate funding to maintain these historic collections.  A 1994 study by the Advisory Council on Historic Preservation found that inadequate staffing and funding has been dedicated to these national assets.  The museums in Maryland, including the one at the Patuxent River Naval Air Station, need additional financial assistance. I am confident that my colleagues will find similar needs in their own States.  My legislation, introduced in the Senate last week by Senator Paul Sarbanes, would allow private sector support to be funneled throughout the country. The Foundation would be governed by a nine-member board chosen by the Secretary of Defense. In order to get it started, I am proposing a one-time $1 million appropriation and shared use of DOD personnel and facilities. After that, the Foundation would be self-sufficient and would actually save the Department money.  I urge support for establishment of a National Military Museum Foundation.                          ____________________
