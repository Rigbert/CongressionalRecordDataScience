 President, the American people recognize the importance of the family farmer to our Nation, and the need to provide an adequate safety net for family farmers. In recent years, however, assistance to farmers has come under increasing scrutiny.  Critics of farm payments have argued that the largest corporate farms reap most of the benefits of these payments. The reality is, over 60 percent of the payments have gone to only 10 percent of our Nation's farmers.  What's more, farm payments that were originally designed to benefit small and medium-sized family farmers have contributed to their own demise. Unlimited farm payments have placed upward pressure on land prices and have contributed to overproduction and lower commodity prices, driving many family farmers off the farm.  The Senate agreed, by an overwhelming vote of 66 to 31, to a bipartisan amendment sponsored by Senators Dorgan and myself to target federal assistance to small and medium-sized family farmers. The amendment would have limited direct and counter-cyclical payments to $75,000. It would have limited gains from marketing loans and LDPs to $150,000, and generic certificates would have been included in this limit. That would have limited farm payments to a combined total of $275,000.  That amendment was critical to family farmers in Iowa. I feel strongly the farm bill failed Iowa when it failed to effectively address the issue of payment limitations. This is our chance to remedy the problem.  This bi-partisan legislation provides a limit of $40,000 for direct payments, $60,000 for counter-cyclical pavement, and $175,000 for LDPs and marketing loan gains. The combined limit is $275,000.  I urge my colleagues to support this bi-partisan legislation and to encourage the development of reasonable, legitimate payment limits.  I ask unanimous consent the text of the bill be printed in the Record.  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the Record, as follows:                                 S. 667       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of      the United States of America in Congress assembled,     SECTION 1.

      (3) by striking ``(d)'' and all that follows through the      end of paragraph (1) and inserting the following:       ``(d) Limitations on Marketing Loan Gains, Loan Deficiency      Payments, and Commodity Certificate Transactions.--       ``(1) Loan commodities.--The total amount of the following      gains and payments that a person may receive during any crop      year may not exceed $87,500:       ``(A)(i) Any gain realized by a producer from repaying a      marketing assistance loan for 1 or more loan commodities      under subtitle B of title I of the Farm Security and Rural      Investment Act of 2002 (7 U.S.C. 7931 et seq.) at a lower      level than the original loan rate established for the loan      commodity under that subtitle.       ``(ii) In the case of settlement of a marketing assistance      loan for 1 or more loan commodities under that subtitle by      forfeiture, the amount by which the loan amount exceeds the      repayment amount for the loan if the loan had been settled by      repayment instead of forfeiture.       ``(B) Any loan deficiency payments received for 1 or more      loan commodities under that subtitle.       ``(C) Any gain realized from the use of a commodity      certificate issued by the Commodity Credit Corporation for 1      or more loan commodities, as determined by the Secretary,      including the use of a certificate for the settlement of a      marketing assistance loan made under that subtitle.'';
