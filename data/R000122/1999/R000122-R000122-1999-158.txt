President, I rise today to express my support for Senator Leahy's amendment promoting peaceful self determination for the peoples of East Timor and bringing the attention of the United States to the long and difficult climb of the East Timorese towards democracy. I am pleased to join Senator Feingold as a cosponsor of this amendment which underscores the importance of the historic opportunity which the East Timorese face, and our duty to support them in their struggle for peace and self determination. The upcoming August vote, or consultation, on East Timorese autonomy is crucial, not only for the East Timorese people, but for America and for every nation that supports democracy and stands against the rule of terror and violence which has shaped twenty years of East Timorese history.  The past year has witnessed extraordinary progress. The efforts of Portugal, the United Nations, the global community and the East Timorese leaders have been impressive. Combined with the willingness of the Indonesian government, these efforts have at last resulted in a plan for the peaceful and democratic determination of East Timor's political destiny. I would like to recognize all those whose courage and commitment have led us towards the August consultation, a consultation which will allow the East Timorese, at long last, to decide for themselves how they are to be governed.  Nevertheless, much remains to be done. As great an achievement as the promised consultation may be, the future is far from certain. East Timor, already troubled by years of bloodshed, has seen even greater escalations in human rights abuses in recent months. Although it has already buried 200,000 people who have died violently since the 1975 Indonesian invasion, East Timor continues to be riven by conflict. Organized campaigns of terror and intimidation have been aimed at East Timorese leaders and journalists who favor autonomy. Some international observers have reported thatEast Timorese have been systematically herded into camps in efforts to provide large blocs of pro-Indonesian votes in the August consultation. Militia activity, violence, and destruction continue unabated.  If the violence in East Timor is to cease, the militias must be stripped of their weapons and disbanded. International observers will play a critical role, both in the course of the consultation and in the implementation of the results that follow. Only subjecting this process to the harsh light of international scrutiny can we hope to prevent East Timor's violent past from serving as prologue to an equally violent future. Without our active participation and support, the hope of a lasting peace in East Timor is in danger of being lost.  Mr. President, this historic opportunity for peace must not be allowed to slip away. The United States has a proud tradition of championing those who seek freedom and democracy across the world. It is my hope that this amendment will encourage the United States to intensify efforts to ensure that the people of East Timor find peace at last.                           amendment no. 716  (Purpose: To allocate funds for scholarships for doctoral graduate study in the social sciences to nationals of the independent states of                         the former Soviet Union)       On page 12, line 6, strike ``$7,000,000'' and insert      ``$5,000,000''.

(2) Condemn, in the strongest possible terms, the recent      arrest of members of Iran's Jewish minority and urge their      immediate release;       (3) Urge all nations having relations with the Islamic      Republic of Iran to condemn the treatment of religious      minorities in Iran and call for the release of all prisoners      held on the basis of their religious beliefs; and       (4) Maintain the current United States policy toward the      Islamic Republic of Iran unless and until that country      moderates its treatment of religious minorities.                                  ____                           amendment no. 725 (Purpose: To amend the reporting requirements of the PLO Commitments                         Compliance Act of 1989)       On page 115, after line 18, insert the following new      section:     SEC. 730.
