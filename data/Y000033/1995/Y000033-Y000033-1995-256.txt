Mr. Chairman, I move that the Committee do now rise.  The motion was agreed to.  Accordingly the Committee rose; and the Speaker pro tempore (Mr. Bunning of Kentucky) having assumed the chair, Mr. Linder, Chairman pro tempore of the Committee of the Whole House on the State of the Union, reported that that Committee, having had under consideration the bill (H.R. 70) to permit exports of certain domestically produced crude oil, and for other purposes, had come to no resolution thereon.                          ____________________
