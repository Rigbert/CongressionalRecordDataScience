 President, we have all seen the HHS bill go down in the Senate. There is a message in this. That is that the people of America are only going to accept so many cuts in health care, in Medicaid, in Medicare, in transportation, and other vital areas.  This amendment directly targets our budget deficit. If the budget is not in balance, tax rates for income, capital gains, and dividends will return to previous levels and deductions for taxpayers earning more than an adjusted gross income of $1 million a year.  According to the Joint Committee on Taxation and the Tax Policy Center, this amendment could increase revenues by more than $100 billion over 5 years. It is a strong step, a first step in helping the budget deficit and also saying to people in this country that millionaires are prepared to forego tax cuts to benefit the very poor of our country.
