 Mr. Speaker, I am pleased to be here today. We are here as the result of the work of some extraordinary staff people, and I want to start by mentioning them.  First of all, I want to congratulate and thank Mr. Miller and his staff. I want to thank the staff of the Banking Committee. Mr. John Hughes of my staff, formerly of the Banking Committee and the Financial Services Committee, has worked tirelessly with an extraordinary policy director, Neil Bradley, who works for Mr. Cantor. We worked on this matter in a bipartisan fashion. This bill comes to the floor as a bipartisan bill, and I am hopeful and believe it will pass with an overwhelmingly bipartisan vote.  Mr. Speaker, today, we are ending the uncertainty for American manufacturers waiting for Congress to act by coming together to reauthorize the U.S. Export-Import Bank. I want to thank the Republican leader, Mr. Cantor, and his staff--and as I mentioned Neil Bradley before--for working with Democrats to find common ground and to reach an agreement that is supported by both business and labor, Democrats and Republicans.  I also want to commend Ranking Member Barney Frank of the Financial Services Committee and those on his staff: Kelly Larkin, Dan McGlinchey, and Kirk Schwarzbach. Carolyn McCarthy, as the ranking member, has done such an extraordinary job on this effort, as well as Mr. Miller, who chairs the International Monetary Policy and Trade Subcommittee. Their hard work has been important in making sure this agreement will help American businesses save and create jobs. I also want to thank Representative Rick Larsen for his tireless advocacy for a long-term reauthorization of the bank.  In addition, I would be remiss if I did not mention my dear and good friend, who is the ranking Democrat on the Appropriations Committee but who has been an extraordinary leader in making sure that America creates jobs and exports products around the world. He is Mr. Norman Dicks. Congressman Dicks, from Washington State, has been working with me every day that we've been at these negotiations. I want to thank him for his contributions to this outcome.  For 2 years, Mr. Speaker, House Democrats have been promoting a comprehensive jobs plan called Make It in America. Mr. Don Manzullo was on the floor, and he has been focused on that. They may not use my phrase of ``Make It in America,'' but so many Republicans have been focused on trying to build jobs here in America. We've been promoting a Make It in America agenda.  The Export-Import Bank financing is and has been a part of our published Make It in America agenda. By financing American companies' efforts to export their products overseas, the Export-Import Bank plays a direct role, as Chairlady McCarthy has pointed out, in helping our businesses expand and hire more employees for well-paying jobs, jobs that will not be shipped overseas.  The Export-Import Bank doesn't cost taxpayers a single penny. In fact, it has generated $1.9 billion--$2 billion rounded, as the chairlady said--in excess revenues for U.S. taxpayers over the past 5 years, and it provides a critical service that our companies need to access foreign markets on a level playing field. I am encouraged that we were able to reach this agreement to increase the Export-Import Bank's exposure limit to $120 billion through the end of this fiscal year and to raise it to $140 billion over the next 2 years.  In 2011, financing from the Export-Import Bank helped to create nearly 300,000 jobs at 3,600 private companies across America. This is a jobs bill, a jobs bill for Americans. Yes, I said 3,600 companies. An undermentioned fact is that over 85 percent of the bank's transactions are for small businesses. We talk a lot about the large businesses, Boeing in particular, which is one of our best exports and job creators--but 3,600 businesses, most of which are small businesses. The products American workers make are the best in the world.                              {time}  1250  American workers and American entrepreneurs can compete with anybody in the world if they have a level playing field. This helps get there. Whenthat happens, our workers succeed, and that means more of our people can make it in America. That's what Americans want to do: they want to make it; they want to succeed; they want to have their kids have opportunities; and they want to make it. One of the ways we're going to Make It in America is to make it in America, manufacture it in America, grow it in America, and sell it here and around the world, and create jobs here, good-paying jobs for our people. They'll feel better about that.  I urge all of my colleagues to support this legislation. I hope this vote is unanimous. It's a vote for America, America's workers, and America's ability to compete globally.

This agreement is an important part of Democrats'      Make It In America plan to create an encouraging environment      for businesses to innovate and make products here in the      U.S., and is supported by everyone from labor to business:       Thomas Buffenbarger, President of International Association      of Machinists and Aerospace Workers: ``The bipartisan bill      H.R. 2072 . . . represents a clear break from the Beltway      politics that have failed to address the real struggles of      ordinary Americans. During this time of intense global      competition and persistent high unemployment, U.S. exporters      need the critical resources of the Ex-Im Bank. I strongly      urge you to support American jobs and to vote for this      important legislation.''       Thomas J. Donohue, President and CEO of the U.S. Chamber of      Commerce: ``This is great news for thousands of American      workers, businesses of all sizes, and taxpayers, who can      cheer the fact that this bill will reduce the deficit by      hundreds of millions of dollars. When other countries are      providing their own exporters with an estimated $1 trillion      in export finance--often on terms more generous than Ex-Im      can provide--failure to reauthorize Ex-Im would amount to      unilateral disarmament and cost tens of thousands of American      jobs. This bill will guarantee a level financial playing      field in export markets and ensure transparency in Ex-Im's      operations. For that reason, the Chamber urges Congress to      swiftly pass this bill to reauthorize Ex-Im.''       R. Bruce Josten, Executive Vice President for Government      Affairs of the U.S. Chamber of Commerce: ``Failure to enact      this bill would put at risk the nearly 300,000 American jobs      at 3,600 companies that depend on Ex-Im to compete in global      markets. Ex-Im is especially important to small- and medium-     sized businesses, which account for more than 85 percent of      Ex-Im's transactions. . . . The Chamber strongly supports      H.R. 2072 and urges the House to consider this issue as      expeditiously as possible. The Chamber will include votes on,      or in relation to, this bill in our annual How They Voted      scorecard.''       Jay Timmons, President and CEO of National Association of      Manufacturers (NAM): ``The bill announced today to      reauthorize the Bank and increase its lending cap brings us a      step closer to protecting these jobs and will be a vital tool      for small manufacturers exporting to new markets. It is      essential to manufacturers' global competitiveness, and we      are pleased that Majority Leader Cantor and Minority Whip      Hoyer have come together on an authorization. . . . We urge      all members of the House to support this jobs legislation,      and we hope the Senate will also move forward quickly. The      Ex-Im Bank means jobs and increased exports, which will help      us grow our economy and remain competitive.''       Doug Oberhelman, Chairman and CEO of Caterpillar Inc., and      Chair of Business Roundtable's International Engagement      Committee: ``The Ex-Im Bank is critical to the ability of      U.S. companies--large and small--to compete on a level      playing field against overseas competitors who have access to      similar export credit programs. . . . Failure to reauthorize      the Ex-Im Bank on a long-term basis and at appropriate credit      levels would disadvantage U.S. businesses competing for sales      in foreign markets, potentially putting thousands of U.S.      jobs at risk.''       Tim Keating, Senior Vice President of Government Operations      of The Boeing Company: ``. . . H.R. 2072 is bipartisan      legislation authorizing EXIM to operate for the next three      years and raising the Bank's lending authority to $140      billion. The legislation also contains a number of      important initiatives and reforms that will strengthen      Congress's ability to oversee the Bank's operations and      improve the transparency of the Bank's transactions. . . .      Reauthorization of the EX-IM Bank is critical to the      ability of U.S. exporters to compete on a level playing      field in a commercial market where current and future      competitors continue to enjoy aggressive support from      their countries' export credit agencies. I urge your      strong support for H.R. 2072.''       Andrew Liveris, Chairman and CEO of The Dow Chemical      Company: ``I am writing to urge you to support the pending      legislation to reauthorize the Export-Import (ExIm) Bank. The      proposed draft three-year reauthorization with a graduated      cap to $140 billion provides certainty and support for      America's exporters. . . . I urge your favorable vote to      support and sustain American jobs, boost small businesses,      and expand export opportunities for U.S. companies.''       Capt. Lee Moak, President of the Air Line Pilots      Association, International: ``This is a positive move toward      leveling the playing field for U.S. airlines and their      workers in the global marketplace. The reauthorization bill      will aid in ending subsidies for widebody airplanes. This      action will help to level the playing field for U.S. airlines      that compete with foreign airlines, including many that are      state-sponsored, that buy U.S.- and European-manufactured      planes at below-market rates unavailable to U.S. and many      European airlines. This subsidized financing gives our      foreign competitors a significant cost advantage, allowing      them to drive U.S. airlines out of international routes and      costing airline workers' jobs.''       Nicholas Calio, President and CEO of A4A: ``We appreciate      the hard work of Republican House Majority Leader Eric Cantor      and Democratic House Minority Whip Steny Hoyer, who      negotiated a bipartisan agreement that ensures increased      transparency in the Ex-Im bank's lending practices, calls for      greater economic impact analysis of loans and would implement      other important reforms, and we urge passage of the      agreement.''       Pete Bunce, President and CEO of General Aviation      Manufacturers Association: ``General aviation jobs will be      put in jeopardy if the Export-Import Bank is not      reauthorized. Furthermore, general aviation manufacturing is      one of the few remaining industries that contribute      positively to the U.S. balance of trade. Our member companies      have dramatically increased their use of Export-Import Bank      financing over the past several years. Continued lending      authority is essential to the success of general aviation      manufacturing to compete globally. . . . We appreciate the      bi-partisan effort in the House to move this legislation and      we urge every House member to support it. We also call on the      Senate to act quickly in order to avoid any lending      disruption.''       Letter from Local Chambers of Commerce: ``Without Ex-Im      reauthorization, our country's exporters won't be able to      compete effectively in the global marketplace. We urge you to      join us in supporting swift Ex-Im Bank reauthorization.''       John Hardy, Jr., President of Coalition for Employment      through Exports (CEE) and William Reinsch, President of      National Foreign Trade Council (NFTC): ``[We] write in      support of H.R. 2072, the Securing American Jobs Through      Exports Act of 2011, and strongly [urge] your affirmative      vote for reauthorizing the Export-Import Bank of the U.S. H.R      2072's three year extension provides assurance of Ex-Im      Bank's continued critical presence in the global export      market, its lending limit provides adequate flexibility for      the Bank to respond to market demands, and it contains      increased taxpayer protections to ensure the continued      viability of the Bank.''       Cass Johnson, President of National Council of Textile      Organizations (NCTO) and Kevin Burke, President & CEO,      American Apparel & Footwear Association (AAFA): ``[We] write      in strong support of H.R. 2072--Securing American Jobs      Through Exports Act of 2011. In addition to re-authorizing      the Export-Import Bank. . . . the legislation contains      provisions that will create important new avenues of      financing for the textile and apparel global supply chain.''
