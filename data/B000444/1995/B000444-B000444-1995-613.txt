  As I understand what the Senator just said, put another way, if New Jersey wanted to pay off its bonds, it would have to take all the money it has in its pension funds. Bingo, that is a great idea, is it not? What does that do? I mean look, this is not real complicated.  The Senator from Idaho just laid it out. He said, look, if you take the money that is in here for the pension funds, all that money that is saved up, and you take the revenues that are coming in on a yearly basis and you look at the money that is being paid out and the indebtedness, you are almost balanced. That is almost balanced if you empty the bank account, the bank account being the pension funds, which means those people do not get paid their pensions. What are we talking about here?
