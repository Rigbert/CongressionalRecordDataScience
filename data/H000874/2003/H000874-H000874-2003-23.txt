Speaker, I thank the majority leader. Last week we passed a continuing resolution until November 21. The gentleman did not indicate in his discussion of the schedule for the next 2 weeks the balance of appropriations bills that are pending, nor did he mention an omnibus appropriation bill. Can he clarify and give us his best thinking at this point in time as to where we are on the CR for November 21 and being able to leave on November 21? I know the gentleman mentioned the possibility of being here on Saturday, November 22. And does the gentleman expect any appropriations bills other than the energy and water, which he did reference would be on the floor either next week or the following week?  I yield to the gentleman.  Mr. DeLAY. Mr. Speaker, as the gentleman knows, we have five conference reports completed. We have three more bills in conference and one more, agriculture, that we could be able to go to conference on next week. It is my understanding that the Senate may attempt to complete additional bills next week. But at some point I would anticipate that the Senate would ask us to consider several of the remaining bills in a larger package.  When, and if, they do, we will try to do our best to maximize the House's position based on the bills that the House has already passed. The gentleman knows that the House has passed all 13 of the appropriations bills, and I would hope that whatever process is necessary to wrap up these appropriations measures we would be able to complete them by November 21, thereby not requiring another continuing resolution that week. However, if all that falls apart, obviously we would be considering a continuing resolution in that week.
