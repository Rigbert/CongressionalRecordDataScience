Leader, we also wanted to give you a substitute, but you didn't want that either, and we didn't give you that substitute, then, I guess.  In any event, your point is well taken, and I don't want to be jocular about the fact. We really do want to make sure that you can come to this floor and think you are being treated fairly and openly and have an opportunity to make your legislative case. That is the way this body ought to work.  I know the first 2\1/2\ weeks now we have been moving on an agenda, rules changes and others, that we wanted to get done. As you know, some of these have involved rules changes, as this particular bill did.  As you know, although Mr. Dreier talked about having hearings on this, rarely does either side have hearings on the rules it presents. The rules package is put together by the majority party and there aren't hearings on it. It is offered on the floor and it is voted up or down. In this case we offered your rules, as you know, as they were in being in the 109th Congress. There were some additions we wanted to make.  But your point is well taken. I share your view that we want to make sure, whether we disagree, that you feel you got the opportunity on your side of the aisle to make your case.
