Speaker, I rise today to honor the inspiring and passionate career of Monsignor Sears, of St. Joseph Parish of Michigan. For the past 20 years, Monsignor Sears has devotedly served the community of St. Joseph and beyond.  Since being assigned to St. Joseph Parish in 1984, Monsignor's contributions to our community have been remarkable. Monsignor has brought guidance, knowledge, and inspiration to all who had the blessed opportunity of meeting with or hearing one of his famous homilies. It is well-known that Monsignor always used story-telling and anecdotes as a way of teaching and inspiring his congregation. His ability to reach and move all those fortunate enough to cross his path has been well-known throughout Southwest Michigan for sometime now.  Highlights of Monsignor Sears' wonderful career include meeting with Mother Teresa in 1979, and speaking with Pope John Paul II during a visit to Rome. Locally, Monsignor was instrumental in starting the church's tithing in1985--the church tithes about $100,000 a year to various local and national needs. Although these accomplishments are extraordinary, Monsignor's greatest achievements may lie in his daily work and prayers with the parish staff and parishioners, as well as implementing influential local programs over the years.  There is no doubt that Monsignor Sears will be greatly missed as the pastor of St. Joseph Parish. However, knowing his passion for the community and devoutness to charity, Monsignor will continue his service to God and will continue to impact the communities of Southwest Michigan.                          ____________________
