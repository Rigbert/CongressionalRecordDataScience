 President, on March 17, 2000, the Irish and the Irish-at-heart around the world celebrated Saint Patrick's Day, a day to remember the spirit of comradery, friendship, and peace the patron saint of Ireland brought to the Emerald Isle. I rise today to pay tribute to the Irish people and the forty million Irish Americans in this country--who are also celebrating Irish-American Heritage Month--and offer my thoughts on an issue close to their hearts and mine: peace in Northern Ireland.  The signing of the Good Friday Peace Accords on April 10, 1998 was an historic achievement in the quest for peace. After 32 years of conflict and bloodshed, the leaders of the principal Unionist and Nationalist parties in Northern Ireland agreed to a new governing structure for the province, one in which Catholics and Protestants would, for the first time, share power in a new assembly and executive.  On May 22, 1998, the people of Ireland, in the North and in the South, voted overwhelmingly in favor of the Accords. Their message was clear: it was time for a new era of peace based on reconciliation, compassion, and respect.  Thanks in no small part to the tireless work of our former colleague, Senator George Mitchell, the power sharing executive finally came into existence on December 1, 1999 and the formal devolution of power from London to the people of Northern Ireland took place. It appeared that the Irish would finally be able to celebrate the true spirit of Saint Patrick's Day.  The quest for peace, however, took a step backwards when--on February 11, 2000--the British government suspended the power sharing institutions and resumed direct rule of Northern Ireland from London. The Good Friday Peace Accords is now hanging by a thread.  As I stated earlier, the people of Ireland, Protestants and Catholics, in the North and in the South, have made their feelings clear. They support the Good Friday Peace Accords. They support the power sharing institutions. They support peace and cooperation. They believe that the people of Northern Ireland should have the ability to govern their own affairs.  Representatives of all parties in Northern Ireland met last week here in Washington with British and Irish leaders in an effort to break this impasse and return home rule to Northern Ireland. I am hopeful that their efforts will prove to be successful.  I strongly support the Accords. They represent the best hope for a lasting peace in Northern Ireland. I urge all parties to stick to the agreement and make it work. They have a responsibility to keep their word to the Irish people and stop Northern Ireland from slipping back to the ways of the ``Hard Men'': intimidation, violence, and death.  On this day, let us reflect on the turmoil the Irish have endured for so many years and commend them for their tremendous hope, persistence, and hard work. Let us remember the true spirit of Saint Patrick's Day and renew our support for the Irish people in the North and the South who desperately want, and deserve, a future of peace and prosperity.                          ____________________
