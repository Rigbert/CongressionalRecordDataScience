 President, I rise today to recognize Mr. Andrew Ivy, an exceptional history teacher and role model from Kirkland, WA. Mr. Ivy has been named Teacher of the Year by the Richard T. Farrell Teacher of Merit Award for outstanding success in teaching history. This national award is presented every year to an educator who develops and uses innovative and creative teaching methods that interest students in history and help them make exciting discoveries about the past. As a teacher at International Community School in Kirkland, WA, Mr. Ivy has shown exemplary commitment to making history education engaging and exciting, while involving his students in the National History Day Program.  National History Day is a yearlong program in which students explore historical topics related to an annual theme. Participants qualify for national competition after competing in several local and State competitions. In preparing his students for the program, Mr. Ivy's work ethic and research skills provided students with the tools necessary to be successful in competition.  Teachers like Mr. Ivy play an important role in education. By teaching about the nations past they keep our history a part of our current lives. When children question, and discuss our history, teachers are doing something profoundly patriotic; they are helping students understand who we are as a nation--the importance of our common heritage and the values that make us unique.  Andrew Ivy has proven exceptional. His drive to offer his students the best education possible has led him to invest a great deal of personal study in his curriculum. He regularly attends training classes to ensure that the material he teaches is accurate and current. Additionally, Mr. Ivy often tries new approaches to his teaching method in order to keep his classroom interested and challenged. His curriculum often changes to meet his very own high standards and his students greatly benefit from all of his efforts.  Mr. President, I find it heartening that there are educators in this country who devote so much time and effort to shaping the minds of our young people. I hope you and our colleagues will join me in recognizing Mr. Andrew Ivy for his dedication to educating the potential leaders of tomorrow.                          ____________________
