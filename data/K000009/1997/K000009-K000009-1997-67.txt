Chairman, I appreciate the gentleman's constructive work in trying to assure that these regional offices actually serve a useful purpose, and would add my support to the gentleman's request for an inquiry to make sure that the offices themselves are not new nor unnecessary levels of bureaucracy which could complicate our efforts to assist farmers and meet our goals of conservation.
