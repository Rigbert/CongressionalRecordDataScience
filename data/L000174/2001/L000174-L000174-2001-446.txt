President, I am delighted that the Senate Judiciary Committee unanimously reported the nomination of Larry Thompson to be Deputy Attorney General to the Senate. The Deputy Attorney General is number two in command at the Department of Justice and plays a key role as a top advisor to the Attorney General. Former Deputies include William Rogers and Byron White, Nicholas Katzenbach and Warren Christopher, Harold Tyler, Jamie Gorelick and Eric Holder.  The Deputy has traditionally assumed responsibility for the day-to-day operations of the Department. The Deputy often has direct oversight of a number of divisions and units within the Department, including the FBI and those with criminal jurisdiction. The Deputy position may assume even greater significance in this Administration, since we have not seen any indication that there will be an Associate Attorney General with whom the Deputy might share those leadership responsibilities.  I know that Mr. Thompson is a strong conservative. I have confidence that we can work together. I believe him when he indicates that he is prepared to have a candid and responsive relationship with the Judiciary Committee, including the Democratic Senators.  I know that Mr. Thompson served previously as a United States Attorney and that he appreciates, as those of us who served as local prosecutors understand, where the front lines of law enforcement are, how they must be supported and that partisan politics have no business in law enforcement.  It was not only his testimony but the testimony of Mr. Thompson's home State Senators that I found compelling. Both Senator Cleland and Senator Miller came to the Committee and gave strong support. Those statements matter. His home state Senators would be expected to know him best and it was clear to me that they know him well.  Senator Cleland's endorsement was without reservation. Senator Miller described him as a consummate professional, quiet yet strong, someone who exercises enormous common sense, a person of great substance and little ego, and one who will put principle ahead of politics every time. We were assured that Larry Thompson comes with no agenda, and will base every decision on what is right, not what is popular or politically expedient.  With those kinds of endorsements and assurances, and with the frank exchanges that we had during the course of the hearing process, I feel confident in supporting the nomination of Larry Thompson. I look forward to working with Mr. Thompson in the days ahead and I congratulate Mr. Thompson and his entire family on his confirmation by the U.S. Senate.                          ____________________
