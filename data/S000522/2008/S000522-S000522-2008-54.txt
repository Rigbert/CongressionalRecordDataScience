Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.  I rise today in support of H. Res. 1124, acknowledging the month of May as an appropriate month to celebrate National Brain Tumor Awareness Month. I'd like to commend the North American Brain Tumor Coalition for its work and efforts in establishing Brain Tumor Action Week in the beginning of May each year.  In the United States, Mr. Speaker, more than 190,000 people are diagnosed with brain tumors each year. Of those 190,000 Americans diagnosed, 40,000 cases are primary tumors, and the remaining 150,000 cases are secondary tumors, where cancer has spread from another part of the body.  My mother suffered and passed away 11 years ago from a secondary brain tumor that began as lung cancer. The pain and the anguish she suffered, the convulsions, despite a major surgical procedure and anticonvulsant drugs like dilantin, were absolutely heartbreaking.  Anything and everything we can do to mitigate brain tumors must be done. Thus, I'd like to applaud the efforts and advocacy for brain tumor awareness by the Childhood Brain Tumor Foundation, the American Brain Tumor Association, the Brain Tumor Society and the National Brain Tumor Foundation, the Brain Tumor Action Network and the many other groups valuable contributions to combating these brain tumors.  I would especially like to thank the author of the resolution, Ms. Jan Schakowsky of Illinois, for her leadership in raising brain tumor awareness and commending the efforts of those groups who have helped educate Americans about the symptoms and the warning signs.  I encourage all of my colleagues to vote in favor of this resolution.  I yield back the balance of my time.
