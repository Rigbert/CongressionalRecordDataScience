  A few weeks ago, I asked folks on my mailing list to tell me what credit card companies are doing to them. Within 3 days, we had over 5,000 responses, and many of these responses were hair-raising. People have seen their interest rates on their credit cards double, triple. People are now paying 25 or 30 percent interest rates, which to my mind is unacceptable.  The issue we are dealing with on credit cards is something I have been involved in for many years. I was a member of the Financial Services Committee in the House of Representatives in 2003. We introduced legislation entitled the ``Credit Bait and Switch Prevention Act,'' which deals with many of the same issues that, in fact, we are going to be dealing with today. So it has taken us a little bit of time to get to where we are, but I think it is a step forward.  What I do wish to say is, while the legislation we are passing today is important--and it is a very good piece of legislation; I congratulate Chairman Dodd for his work on it--it does not go far enough. One of the areas where it is not going anywhere near as far as it should be is finally addressing the issue of usury in the United States of America and making a moral determination whether it is acceptable, whether it is moral for banks to be charging Americans 25 or 30 percent interest rates and, in some cases, in terms of payday lending, significantly higher than that. Is that what we want to be doing as a nation? What I would like to do now is briefly read from what I thought was a very thoughtful article by Arianna Huffington in the Huffington Post, where she touches on the issue of usury, which is an issue we have to address.  This is what she says:       Throughout history, usury has been decried by writers,      philosophers, and religious leaders.       Aristotle called usury the ``sordid love of gain,'' and a      ``sordid trade.''       Thomas Aquinas said it was ``contrary to justice.''       In The Divine Comedy Dante assigned usurers to the seventh      circle of hell.       Deuteronomy 23:19 says, ``thou shalt not lend upon usury to      thy brother.''       Ezekiel 18:10 compares a usurer to someone who ``is a      thief, a murderer . . . defiles the wife of his neighbor,      oppresses the poor and needy, commits robbery, does not give      back a pledge, raises his eyes to idols, does abominable      things.''       The Koran is equally unequivocal: ``God condemns usury.''      And it goes on to say that ``those who charge usury are in      the same position as those controlled by the devil's      influence.''  In other words, throughout history, and in all the major religions, usury has been condemned. What civilization has said is that it is simply wrong and immoral for those people who havemoney to take advantage of those people who need that money by charging them outrageously high interest rates. In my view, interest rates of 25, 30, 35, 50 percent are outrageous and it is usury, and it is time the Senate address those issues.       Up until the late 1970s--  and I am quoting Arianna Huffington again--     America's laws followed suit, keeping interest rates in      check.       Then, in 1979, a Supreme Court ruling allowed banks to      charge the top interest rate allowed by the State where a      bank is incorporated as opposed to the borrower's home State.      Hoping to lure banks' business, States like South Dakota and      Delaware repealed their usury laws--and off we went.       That same year, Congress passed the Depository Institutions      Deregulation and Monetary Control Act which, among other      things, allowed federally chartered savings banks and loan      companies to charge any interest rates they chose--putting us      on the path that led us to today, where banks routinely gouge      their most vulnerable customers.  So here is where we are today. The bottom line is we are going to pass a bill that is long overdue. It is a good bill. I commend Chairman Dodd for his hard work. It is an important step forward in protecting consumers. But I am going to be back on this issue of usury. In the United States of America, we have to finally tell banks and credit card companies it is simply not acceptable to charge people 25, 30, 35 percent interest rates. We have to end that abominable practice, and I intend to be playing an active role in that.  I ask unanimous consent that the article to which I have been referring be printed in the Record.  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in the Record, as follows:                (From the Huffington Post, May 18, 2009)Obama Calls for An Extreme Makeover of Our Culture: Are the Credit Card                           Companies Listening?                        (By Arianna Huffington)       In his masterful commencement speech at Notre Dame this      weekend, President Obama took his campaign theme of Change to      a whole new level, telling the graduates--and the rest of      us--that we find ourselves at ``a rare inflection point in      history where the size and scope of the challenges before us      require that we remake our world to renew its promise.''       So, as we stand at this inflection point and gradually move      from what Jonas Salk called Epoch A (our survival-focused      past) to Epoch B (our meaning-focused future), we have to ask      ourselves what this remade world will look like--and what      steps we need to take to get there.       At Notre Dame, Obama offered a devastating teardown of      Epoch A and its ``economy that left millions behind even      before this crisis hit--an economy where greed and short-term      thinking were too often rewarded at the expense of fairness,      and diligence, and an honest day's work.''       The problem, according to the president: ``Too many of us      view life only through the lens of immediate self-interest      and crass materialism; in which the world is necessarily a      zero-sum game. The strong too often dominate the weak, and      too many of those with wealth and power find all manner of      justification for their own privilege in the face of poverty      and injustice.''       The president should email his speech to Wall Street. And      while he's at it, he should also blast it out to the people      running the giant pharmaceutical companies, the ones who      knowingly allow deadly drugs to remain on the shelves; to the      people running chemical plants releasing deadly toxins into      the water and air; to the factory farmers filling our food      with steroids and additives; to the dentists exposed for      trading their Hippocratic oath for profit by performing      unnecessary surgeries on children.       And he should definitely send it to the credit card      companies, which, faced with customers choking on debt and      forced to use their credits cards to pay for essentials like      food and medical care, respond by jacking up interest rates      and tacking on penalties and fees. Even as credit card      defaults reached record levels in April.       As we move to Epoch B, we need to ask ourselves: do we want      to continue living in a world where banks can gouge their      customers with sky-high interest rates?       The Senate seems to think so. Last week it voted down a      measure introduced by Bernie Sanders that would cap interest      rates at 15 percent. And it wasn't even close. Sanders'      amendment only got 33 votes, with 22 Democrats joining those      who voted against the interests of their constituents (a      shout out to Sen. Grassley, the lone Republican to vote for      the amendment).       ``When banks are charging 30 percent interest rates, they      are not making credit available,'' said Senator Sanders.      ``They are engaged in loan sharking.'' Also known as usury.       Throughout history, usury has been decried by writers,      philosophers, and religious leaders.       Aristotle called usury the ``sordid love of gain,'' and a      ``sordid trade.''       Thomas Aquinas said it was ``contrary to justice.''       In The Divine Comedy Dante assigned usurers to the seventh      circle of hell.       Deuteronomy 23:19 says, ``thou shalt not lend upon usury to      thy brother.''       Ezekiel 18:10 compares a usurer to someone who ``is a      thief, a murderer . . . defiles the wife of his neighbor,      oppresses the poor and needy, commits robbery, does not give      back a pledge, raises his eyes to idols, does abominable      things.''       The Koran is equally unequivocal: ``God condemns usury.''      And it goes on to say that ``those who charge usury are in      the same position as those controlled by the devil's      influence.''       Up until the late 1970s, America's laws followed suit,      keeping interest rates in check.       Then, in 1979, a Supreme Court ruling allowed banks to      charge the top interest rate allowed by the state where a      bank is incorporated as opposed to the borrower's home state.      Hoping to lure banks' business, states like South Dakota and      Delaware repealed their usury laws--and off we went.       That same year, Congress passed the Depository Institutions      Deregulation and Monetary Control Act which, among other      things, allowed federally chartered savings banks and loan      companies to charge any interest rates they chose--putting us      on the path that led us to today, where banks routinely gouge      their most vulnerable customers.       According to Elizabeth Warren, credit card companies ``have      switched from the notion of `I'll lend you money because I      think you'll be able to repay and we'll find a reasonable      rate for doing that' over to a tricks and traps model . . .      The job is to trick people and trap them and that' s how you      boost profits.''       This profit-uber-alles mindset is why the banking industry,      looking at the world through what Obama described as the      ``lens of immediate self-interest and crass materialism,'' is      fighting tooth and nail against the Senate's new credit card      reform bill that is set to come up for a vote this week (the      industry already having spent $42 million on lobbying this      year alone). Although, to hear the bankers' lobbyists tell      it, all they really want is what is best for the consumer.       ``It is vitally important for policymakers to get the right      balance of better consumer protection while not jeopardizing      access to credit and the credit markets,'' said Ken Clayton      of the American Bankers Association. ``We are very worried      that the Senate bill fails to achieve this balance, to the      detriment of American consumers.''       Yes, I'm sure they are losing a lot of sleep worrying about      American consumers. But the problem for most consumers isn't      getting access to credit cards (see the endless credit card      come-ons clogging our mailboxes). It's being hammered with 36      per cent interest rates for missing a single payment or      bombarded with a never-ending array of fees (lenders raked in      over $18 billion on penalties and fees alone in 2007).       In any case, the Senate bill, while definitely a step in      the right direction (and even tougher than the measure the      House passed in April), will, with a few worthy differences,      impose the same limits on the credit card industry as the new      rules passed by the Fed in December. And, like the new Fed      regulations, the Senate legislation won't take effect for      close to a year.       Don't get me wrong: having the president sign the bill into      law will send the right message to the banking industry      (important after the cramdown debacle) and offer added      protection against a future Fed chairman arbitrarily rolling      back the new rules.       But if the new rules are important enough to consumers for      Congress to enshrine them into law, why not make them      effective immediately? As Obama said at last week's town hall      meeting on credit cards, the predatory practices of the      credit industry have ``only grown worse in the middle of this      recession, when people can afford them least.'' Almost a year      is too long to wait when people are struggling--and being      bled dry.       ``Both the politicians and the regulators are riding in      like the cavalry, and the settlers are already dead,'' David      Robertson, publisher of the Nilson Report, a newsletter that      monitors the credit card industry, told the Washington Post.       As HuffPost's Ryan Grim reported, Obama has been much more      involved with the credit card bill than he was with the anti-     foreclosure legislation. But, given the impassioned case he      made at Notre Dame and his call to ``align our deepest values      and commitments to the demands of a new age,'' he should take      it one step further and throw his weight behind Sanders'      effort to limit usurious interest rates.       Just because it didn't pass doesn't mean it's dead. History      is filled with causes that took many battles before they were      victorious (women's suffrage, the Voting Rights Act, the      Clean Air Act, the American with Disabilities Act, etc.,      etc., etc.).       Our deepest values and commitments are certainly being put      to the test. Questions we thought had been settled for      hundreds of years are suddenly back on the table. Are we a      country that tortures or not? Are we a country that      financially tricks and traps millions of vulnerable working      families, binding them to the whims of bankers who have lost      all sight of fairness?       Appearing on Real Time with Bill Maher, Elizabeth Warren      put the question this way:       ``This is really about whether we have a government that      just recedes and says, in effect, `Hey, the strong can take      from everybody, they can write these [rules] however     they want . . .we can have a totally broken market that makes      a few people very rich and robs the rest of them. Or you can      write a set of rules that says, `You know, it's just gotta be      kind of level out there.' . . . Everything we have, your      shoes, your clothes, the water you drink, the air you      breathe, we have basic safety rules in the United States. . .      . But we don't have them for consumer credit products.''       Heading into Epoch B, and seeing the devastation all around      us here at the tail end Epoch A, can anyone--other than the      banking lobby, that is--argue that we shouldn't?       The moment to act is now. Inflection points in history      don't come along very often.
