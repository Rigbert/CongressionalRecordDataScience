 President, I say to my friend from Mississippi, the argument typically made for this type of legislation is that we are interfering with the rights of the States. What we have done in this measure is to give the States an opportunity to act, to, in effect, supercede what we have done to make it less generous or more generous, depending on what they may conclude. A State is given an option to address this crisis in a way that is different from the way we addressed it within certain guidelines. By doing that, we do make an effort to respect the State's right to act.
