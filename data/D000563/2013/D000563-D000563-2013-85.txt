President, if my colleague will yield, through the Chair, for one last point, he raised something that brought to my mind a recent story I read about the new Pope, Pope Francis. What an extraordinary man, this Catholic. I am amazed at this man, his humility and his popularity with Catholics and non-Catholics alike, those of different faiths and those of no faith.
