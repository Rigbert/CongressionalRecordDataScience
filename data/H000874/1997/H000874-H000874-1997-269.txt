Speaker, I just wanted to comment on the gentleman's statement, as I just spoke about Federal employees. Obviously the shutdown of Government which the continuing resolution to which he speaks attempts to preclude that from happening, but I want to join the gentleman in his remarks that getting this disaster relief and getting this bill to the President as soon as possible ought to be our priority. Then he and I and others who want to make sure that the Federal Government does stay in operation so that not only employees but, as important if not more important, those who government serves are not adversely affected, will continue. But I agree with the gentleman that we ought to stop trying to load up this supplemental and move it as quickly as possible. I hope the gentleman's efforts are successful in that regard.
