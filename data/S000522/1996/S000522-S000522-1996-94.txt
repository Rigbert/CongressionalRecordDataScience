Mr. Speaker, as the gentleman from California pointed out, I had misgivings about the consolidation taken as it was originally passed by the House, but we worked with that. There was a spirit of compromise, a spirit of giving and taking, and we got from a consolidation of three agencies down to one, leaving the option to the President of the United States to decide which agency would go. It is my feeling that USIA would not go. It is made up of many more people than ACDA and ACDA was the most likely, which is a relic of the cold war period. I did not know that for sure, but now I have come to that conclusion after much study and research.  So it could be done. We have got to save money.
