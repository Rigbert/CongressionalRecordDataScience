It is wonderful news that that budget is going to do all of those things, I want you to know. And we are pleased that a budget is coming forward. We may not be pleased with the budget, but we are pleased that it is coming forward.  As the gentleman knows, we have already had the budget levels for fiscal year '15. You indicate that the budget will adhere to the Ryan-Murray agreement. I assume that also means that it will adhere to the firewall division between defense and nondefense discretionary spending as well.  Is that accurate, Mr. Leader?
