President, in the fall of 2007, at least nine veterans died at the Marion VA Medical Center as a result of the poor medical care they received. We immediately learned that a VA surgeon, who had operated on some of these veterans, was not qualified to work at the VA but slipped through the hiring process. Later, VA investigations revealed much larger problems in the management of the facility--problems that employees kept secret out of fear for losing their jobs. Today, I am reintroducing legislation to help ensure that incidents like these never take place again at Marion or another VA medical center.  I asked the VA to investigate the circumstances surrounding these unfortunate deaths as soon as they came to light. The VA investigation revealed that Marion hospital management knew that doctors, including the surgeon at issue, were not properly credentialed but failed to act. The surgeon remained employed at the Marion hospital and practiced there for more than a year. Had he not been hired to work at Marion, many of his patients may have survived their surgeries.  The VA investigation revealed additional quality of care issues at the Marion hospital. Management disregarded VA quality care directives in the face of serious patient incident reports and surgical data collected to ensure quality of care. They ignored or failed to recognize warning signs that there were problems in the surgical program.  The investigation also showed many Marion Medical Center employees feared reporting quality of care issues. They worried that quality of care might be suffering at the facility but hesitated to report those concerns for fear of losing their jobs. A primary reason is that such reports were funneled through management at the facility, rather than being handled by an independent and confidential outlet focused solely on quality of care.  The legislation I am introducing would improve quality of care across the VA medical care system.  First, it would improve the process of vetting doctors who apply to or work for the VA and restore accountability to physician hiring and retention practices.  Second, the legislation would expand the quality control programs in the VA health care system. The bill creates new quality assurance officer positions, gives VA employees new forums to raise concerns about the quality of care at a VA facility, without fear of retribution, and establishes strong peer review mechanisms for physicians.  Third, the legislation would create incentives to encourage high-quality doctors to practice at VA hospitals. In return for agreeing to practice in hard-to-serve areas, doctors and medical students could participate in student loan forgiveness and tuition reimbursement programs. Doctors would also be eligible to participate in the federal employee health insurance program.  Fourth, where practical, VA medical facilities would be required to establish affiliations with nearby medical schools. These partnerships would expose medical students to careers with the VA. In return, the VA would benefit from the energy and innovative ideas brought by students working in their facilities. In addition, VA hospitals would benefit from access to experienced medical school faculty members.  Finally, the bill would encourage the VA to increase its recruitment of experienced doctors who are willing to practice for our veterans. The VA must hire and retain only highly qualified doctors as it takes on these tremendous responsibilities.  Every one of the tragic deaths at the Marion VA hospital violated the obligation our Nation owes to its veterans. Each of their lives can never be replaced. The Veterans Health Care Quality Improvement Act is a strong step toward avoiding such tragedies in the future and reestablishing trust in the veterans health care system.                                 ______                                       By
