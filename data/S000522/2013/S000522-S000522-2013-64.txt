I thank my friend for yielding and for raising again another very important point. You know, at several of these hearings, which were covered very scarcely by the news media, unfortunately, we had some powerful witnesses from women who are actually the victims of coercive abortion.  Over the many years we've had such hearings, and when they tell their story, and they talk about the helplessness and almost hopelessness of the situation, trying to evade family planning cadres in China as they hunt them down.  You know, most people are unaware of the fact that it begins with economic coercion. If you have a baby out of plan, you are fined if you do not voluntarily walk into the abortion mill for the child to be destroyed. And many women want those children.  One of the women we had testify, her name was Wuijan. She was a Chinese student attending a U.S. university, and part of her testimony--these are her words--she said, when she was rounded up, literally grabbed by the family planning cadres and thrown into a van, totally against her will, she said:       The room was full of moms who had just gone through a      forced abortion. Some moms were crying. Some moms were      mourning. Some moms were screaming. And one mom was rolling      on the floor with unbearable pain.  Then Wuijan said that it was her turn, and through her tears she described her journey into hell. Here is a woman, just like so many others that we heard from, who were literally trussed, picked up, arrested.  I had a woman back in the 1990s, who was pretty much smuggled out of China, who ran one of the family planning centers in Fujian Province, and she self-described herself: ``By day I was a monster, by night a wife andmother of one.'' And she talked about it, and she got asylum here eventually.  But she talked about how she would use every part of the police state to ensure that women, even if they evaded family planning cadres up to the ninth month--to drag her in and to kill the baby, and if it's very late in the pregnancy, with a poison shot of formaldehyde or some other substance right to the soft part of the brain to kill the baby.  These are crimes against humanity. They are ever-present throughout China. And again, they're missing 100 million girls, maybe more, because of gendercide and the loss of life. There's no precedent. There's no example that even comes close of a government using abortion as a tool of population control and the like. And it came right out of the population control movement and what happened in the early or late sixties and especially into the seventies, right here in the United States.  In 1984, I say to my friend, Mr. Fortenberry, 29 years ago I offered the first amendment on this floor, from this podium, to a foreign aid bill to deny funding to any organization, such as the U.N. Population Fund, that is complicit in China's forced abortion policy and involuntary sterilization. It passed, and it morphed into what became known as the Kemp-Kasten Amendment, offered on the appropriations bill by Congressman Jack Kemp.  After all of these years, it is astonishing to me that we still have so many Members of Congress, we have an administration, in the Obama administration, that is, at best, indifferent, and I would say, at worst supportive of these crimes by giving money to the groups that are on the ground enabling these crimes against women. The Obama administration has enabled this cruel policy by its silence and its financial support to the tune of some $50 million a year to the U.N. Population Fund.  We passed, in this House, a prohibition. They, unfortunately, ignore it, do findings that do not comport with the reality on the ground, and then end up sending this money.                              {time}  1700  And I met with a woman whose name is Peng Peiyun, who ran the family planning program in China, I say to my friend, Mr. Fortenberry, for several hours in a conversation in Beijing. She kept coming back to the fact that the U.N. Population Fund was there on the ground and found nothing but voluntary abortions. Of course, there are a loss of lives, too, but no coercion. So the whitewashing that the U.N. Population Fund has been able to provide to this egregious violation of women's rights in China, and now we today, under the Obama administration, are funding it, Mr. Fortenberry. So it's something that has to end. We should be on the side of life and respect, not enabling such terrible things.
