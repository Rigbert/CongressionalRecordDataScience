 President, for the information of all Senators, the comeback votes on Monday night are on confirmation of Heather Wilson as Secretary of the Air Force, and cloture on the nomination of Scott Gottlieb to head the FDA. We plan to move on the U.S. Trade Representative, Robert Lighthizer, as well, next week.                          ____________________
