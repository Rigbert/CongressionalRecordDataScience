Speaker, I thank the gentleman for yielding me this time.  Mr. Speaker, I want to rise as well and express my admiration and respect for the gentlewoman from Nevada [Mrs. Vucanovich], the chairman of this subcommittee. She has done an outstanding job both as a member of the Subcommittee on Military Construction of the Committee on Appropriations, and as chairman of that subcommittee. I had the privilege of serving with her as a member of that subcommittee for a number of years. Her leaving the House will be a loss not only to the House, but to the men and women of the Armed Services for whom she has done a great deal in terms of quality of life and in terms of assuring ourselves that from a military infrastructure standpoint we have facilities that are adequate not only to protect the quality of life for our men and women in the Armed Services, but also to protect our readiness.  I wanted to rise, Mr. Speaker, and pay tribute to her. This will be probably the last time, at least in terms of a sole bill, and hopefully this bill is going to be signed relatively soon, that she will be presenting this legislation. As one who has had the opportunity to work with her, she has been a credit to this institution and a credit to her State and a credit to our country.  I also want to say, of course, that the gentleman from North Carolina, Bill Hefner, the ranking member, who has been the chairman of this committee, worked very closely with the gentlewoman from Nevada [Mrs. Vucanovich] himself, is someone who has been a leader on behalf of the quality of life of our men and women in the Armed Services. I rise in strong support of this legislation and congratulate both the chairman and the ranking member on their leadership in this effort.
