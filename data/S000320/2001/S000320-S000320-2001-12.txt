 President, I rise today to introduce the Nonconventional Natural Gas Reliability Act. This body has moved forcefully and responsibly since the tragic events of September 11 to address the most pressing and immediate needs of the country. However, action on priorities such as comprehensive energy legislation, has been delayed but remains vitally important. As Congress moves forward to address this pressing issue, it is my belief that any comprehensive energy legislation must include provisions designed to increase access to North American natural gas supplies.  Following the energy crisis of the 1970's, Section 29 of the Internal Revenue Code was enacted to provide a tax credit to encourage production of oil and gas from unconventional sources such as Coalbed Methane, Devonian Shale, Tight Rock Formations, and Tight Gas Sands. This credit has helped the industry invest in new technologies that allow us to recover large oil and gas deposits locked in various formations that are very expensive to develop.  In 1998, the United States consumed 22 trillion cubic feet of natural gas. Over the next fifteen years that number is expected to exceed 31 trillion cubic feet. Significant growth in consumption will be particularly evident in the area of electric generation, where environmental issues make natural gas the fuel of choice. The National Petroleum Council predicts that natural gas production by conventional means will remain relatively constantover the next several years, ultimately falling 7 to 9 trillion cubic feet short of what is needed.  The Gas Technology Institute and the National Petroleum Council estimate that economic incentives may allow nonconventional natural gas to bridge to gap by providing an annual addition of 7 to 9 trillion cubic feet of natural gas to our domestic supply. Section 29 of the Internal Revenue code was designed to provide this economic incentive. For current production, ``section 29'' benefits expire at the end of next year and there are no incentives for new production.  Today I am introducing ``section 29'' legislation which is designed to keep current ``section 29'' wells in production and provide the incentive for new wells to be brought on line. Providing a ``clean'' alternative to conventional natural gas, and keeping all of our existing sources of energy online will continue to be a priority for this great nation in the years to come. My legislation would provide section 29 credits for qualifying new wells and facilities through 2009, and for the continuation of benefits to wells and facilities currently in production through 2006.  Whether it is artificial fracturing of gas bearing formations, extensive dewatering, gas clean-up issues, these nonconventional resources can be significant more expensive to drill, to maintain, and to produce. Thus, it is important to support continued production at existing wells and facilities.  There are few instances where the facts are more compelling and the conclusion so clear. Giving section 29 a new lease on life is a wise investment of taxpayer dollars that will result in lower natural gas prices and greater domestic energy supply. I encourage my colleagues to join with me in support of the Nonconventional Natural Gas Reliability Act.  I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be printed in the Record.  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the Record, as follows:                                S. 1547       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of      the United States of America in Congress assembled,     SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.       This Act may be cited as the ``Nonconventional Natural Gas      Reliability Act''.     SEC. 2. EXTENSION AND MODIFICATION OF CREDIT FOR PRODUCING                    FUEL FROM A NONCONVENTIONAL SOURCE.       (a) In General.--Section 29 of the Internal Revenue Code of      1986 (relating to credit for producing fuel from a      nonconventional source) is amended by adding at the end the      following new subsection:       ``(h) Extension for Other Facilities.--       ``(1) Extension for oil and certain gas.--In the case of a      well for producing qualified fuels described in subparagraph      (A) or (B)(i) of subsection (c)(1)--       ``(A) Application of credit for new wells.--Notwithstanding      subsection (f), this section shall apply with respect to such      fuels--       ``(i) which are produced from a well drilled after the date      of the enactment of this subsection and before January 1,      2007, and       ``(ii) which are sold not later than the close of the 4-     year period beginning on the date that such well is drilled,      or, if earlier, December 31, 2009.       ``(B) Extension of credit for old wells.--Subsection (f)(2)      shall be applied by substituting `2007' for `2003' with      respect to wells described in subsection (f)(1)(A) with      respect to such fuels.       ``(2) Extension period to commence with unadjusted credit      amount.--In determining the amount of credit allowable under      this section solely by reason of this subsection--       ``(A) in the case of fuels sold during 2001 and 2002, the      dollar amount applicable under subsection (a)(1) shall be $3      (without regard to subsection (b)(2)), and       ``(B) in the case of fuels sold after 2002, subparagraph      (B) of subsection (d)(2) shall be applied by substituting      `2002' for `1979'.''.       (b) Effective Date.--The amendment made by this section      shall apply to fuel sold after the date of the enactment of      this Act.                                 ______                                       By
