 President, since the Senate passed the bill the first time, the subject of ``crowd-out'' has become a lot more important in this debate.  Crowd-out is the substitution of public coverage for private coverage. Crowd-out occurs in CHIP because the CHIP benefit is very attractive and there is no penalty for refusing private coverage if you are eligible for public coverage.  On August 17, CMS put out a letter giving States new instructions on how to address crowd-out.  I appreciate the administration's willingness to engage on the issue. I think they have some very good ideas. But I also think there are some flaws in their policy.  States are supposed to cover 95 percent of the low-income kids. But it has been a month since they issued the letter and CMS still cannot explain what data States should be using.  Personally, I think CMS should have answers before they issue policies. And if they still can't a month later, I believe, as the saying goes, they obviously aren't ready for prime time.  So the compromise bill replaces the CMS letter with a more thoughtful, reasonable approach.  The Government Accountability Office and the Institute of Medicine would produce analyses on the most accurate and reliable way to measure the rate of public and private insurance coverage and on best practices by States in addressing crowd-out.  Following these two reports, the Secretary, in consultation with States, will develop crowd-out best practices recommendations for the States to consider and develop a uniform set of data points for States to track and report on coverage of children below 200 percent FPL and on crowd-out.  Next, States that extend CHIP coverage to children above 300 percent FPL must submit to the Secretary a State plan amendment describing how they will address crowd-out for this population, incorporating the best practices recommended by the Secretary.  After October 1, 2010, Federal matching payments are not permitted to States that cover children whose family incomes exceed 300 percent of poverty if the State does not meet a target for the percentage of children at or below 200 percent of poverty enrolled in CHIP.  Simply put, cover your low-income kids or you get no money to cover higher income kids.  Now I know some people are obsessed with the State of New York and their and their efforts to cover kids up to 400 percent of poverty.  It seems to come up in the talking points of every person who speaks out against our bill. This bill does not allow any State to go to 400 percent of poverty.  In fact, the bill makes it very difficult for any State to go above 300 percent of poverty; it will make it very difficult for New Jersey, the only State currently covering kids above 300 percent, to continue to do so if they don't do a better job of covering low-income kids.  If you are concerned about the State of New York, don't waste your time looking at this bill. You will not find answers to New York's fate here.  The answer is where it has always been--in the office of HHS Secretary Mike Leavitt. Only he has the authority to allow any State to cover children up to 400 percent of poverty. This bill does nothing to change that authority. It is up to the Secretary.  I heartily encourage those of you who haven't to read the bill. It is all there in black and white.                          ____________________
