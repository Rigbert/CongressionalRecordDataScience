Mr. Chairman, I thank my friend for that encouraging comment. I appreciate very much the gentleman's commitment to the extraordinary work advanced by the Commission. The Helsinki Commission remains at the forefront of many of the cutting issues in the OSCE region, a region with vital interests to the United States.  From the Balkans to the Baltics, the Helsinki Commission continues to provide important leadership in advancing democracy, human rights, and the rule of law. We do it in a completely bipartisan way.
