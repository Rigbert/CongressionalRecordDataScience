President, today the Senate will complete the consideration of the nomination of Michael Chertoff to head the Department of Homeland Security.  Judge Chertoff currently serves as a Federal judge on the Court of Appeals for the Third Circuit. This is a lifetime appointment that he has held for a relatively short time and that he will be abandoning to return to executive branch service. I helped expedite and voted in favor of Judge Chertoff when his nomination to the third circuit came to the Senate in 2003.  Before that he was the Assistant Attorney General in charge of the Criminal Division at the Department of Justice. I helped expedite and voted in favor of that nomination in 2001.  I have worked with Mike Chertoff and appreciate his background as a prosecutor. He is very capable. He works hard. What one sees when you consider his career is that much of the time he acts as a consummate professional in our best tradition. Although there have been times when he has shown partisanship in an apparent effort to ``earn his spurs'' with those on the extreme right, it is my hope and expectation that he will bring his better angels with him as he embarks on his new role as Secretary of the Office of Homeland Security. That is not a position that needs or deserves even a hint of partisanship. Indeed, one of the moments that marred Secretary Ridge's tenure was when he stepped out of character to make a blatantly partisan pitch during the run-up to the recent presidential election.  I was astonished when President Bush announced that he had chosen Bernie Kerik to replace Secretary Ridge. When newspapers and news magazines began looking at that nomination, it became apparent that the vetting of that nomination was shoddy and that Mr. Kerik was an unacceptable choice on a number of grounds. That misadventure cost us time and led to Judge Chertoff's nomination being made later than it should have been by the administration.  The Senate has expedited consideration of this nomination. In what I hope is a sign of better days to come and of increased responsiveness, I note that this nominee has responded in kind by seeking to answer in one day's time a letter I sent to him. I appreciate that kind of responsiveness.  In light of his effort, I will excuse his missing the point in failing to respond directly to my first question. I raised with the nominee an aspect of his conversations with representatives of the intelligence community while he was serving as a principal law enforcer charged with prosecutions under the anti-torture law. My question to Judge Chertoff was an opportunity for him to reflect on the inappropriateness of the chief prosecutor advising lawyers for possible investigatory targets regarding how he would apply the law and what might provide a safe harbor when it came to torture.  I commend Senator Levin for trying to get to the substance of those conversations during confirmation hearings. Sadly but all too characteristically, the Bush administration has refused to provide him or the Senate with the relevant materials in this regard. I am, likewise, concerned that Mr. Chertoff was not more assertive during discussions with the Office of Legal Counsel as it headed down the wrong road in trying artificially to narrow the definition of torture to provide latitude that contributed to widespread international scandals in our wrongful treatment of prisoners. I wish someone within the Bush administration at the time had stood up for the rule of law and had succeeded in derailing the search directed by Judge Gonzales to create loopholes in our law.  I appreciate that Judge Chertoff has committed to implementing the recommendations of the inspector general with respect to preserving the civil rights of those detained by the Government in his answer to my second question. That inquiry derived from his testimony to the Judiciary Committee in November 2001.  Finally, I asked a series of questions about the so-called ``wall'' between lawenforcement investigations and intelligence. The 9/11 Commission report went a long way toward dismantling the myth that former Attorney General Ashcroft had tried to perpetuate. I recall when even President Bush upbraided Attorney General Ashcroft following his assault upon Commissioner Gorelick at the 9/11 Commission hearings.  I pointed out that during the Clinton administration almost one year before September 11, 2001, the Department of Justice Office of Legal Counsel had issued an official memorandum noting the Government's position on ``Sharing Title III Electronic Surveillance Material with the Intelligence Community,'' which concluded that law enforcement officials may share surveillance information with the intelligence community to obtain assistance in preventing, investigating or prosecuting a crime, or where the information was of overriding importance to national security or foreign relations.  As Judge Chertoff recalls, it was Attorney General Ashcroft who adopted measures on January 21, 2000, and it was the memorandum issued by Deputy Attorney General Thompson on August 6, 2001, that governed information sharing in the days leading to the disaster that was September 11. Indeed, Judge Chertoff notes: ``When it was deemed to be appropriate, additional procedures were put in place in specific cases, or in sets of related cases.'' He proceeds to concede that without any change in the law, in the time between September 11 and enactment of the USA PATRIOT Act: ``With court approval, some of these procedures were modified between 9/11 and October 26, 2001, the effective date of the USA PATRIOT Act.''  The 9/11 Commission established during its investigation that in the days and months before September 11, 2001, information sharing requirements and procedures were misunderstood and misapplied at the Department of Justice. I appreciated Judge Chertoff's offering a glimpse into the inner workings of the Ashcroft Justice Department in the days that led up to 9/11 when he noted that there was a ``vigorous internal debate about the appropriate procedures for sharing information collected in foreign intelligence and counterterrorism investigations with criminal agents and prosecutors.'' That ``internal debate'' was unresolved on September 11, 2001, when terrorists struck in New York and at the Pentagon and were thwarted in the sky over Pennsylvania.  When the Justice Department came forward to work with the Senate in the weeks following the attacks, I worked with Mr. Chertoff to ensure that law enforcement and intelligence efforts were better coordinated, and I urged him, the Attorney General and the Director of the FBI to change the culture that had led to destructive and dysfunctional hoarding of essential security information.  I ask unanimous consent that copies of my letter to Judge Chertoff and his response be printed in the Record.  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in the Record, as follows:                                                      U.S. Senate,                                   Committee on the Judiciary,                                 Washington, DC, February 7, 2005.     Hon. Michael Chertoff,     United States Court of Appeals for the Third Circuit, Martin          Luther King, Jr. Federal Building & U.S. Courthouse,          Walnut Street, Newark, NJ.       Dear Judge Chertoff: Congratulations on your nomination to      head the Department of Homeland Security. While I am somewhat      surprised to be considering your nomination to an Executive      Branch position so soon after your confirmation to the      Federal bench, I respect your commitment to public service.      The work of the Department of Homeland Security is crucial to      the safety and security of the American people, and there are      lingering problems in integrating all of the elements of the      department and in making them as effective as we need them to      be. Managing DHS is one of the toughest assignments in      Washington, and I admire and appreciate your willingness to      take it. I feel confident that the vetting problems we saw      with respect to the Kerik nomination will not plague yours.       It is regrettable that the Judiciary Committee has not held      a hearing and was not even allowed to participate in a      hearing on your nomination. Much of the work of the      Department of Homeland Security remains of importance and      interest to the Judiciary Committee and within its      jurisdiction and expertise.       In connection with our committee's oversight      responsibilities as the Senate prepares to debate and vote on      your nomination, I would ask you to respond regarding three      principal matters.       First, at your confirmation hearing last week, you      acknowledged that while serving as head of the Criminal      Division, you consulted with lawyers for the intelligence      community regarding specific interrogation techniques. I ask      that you reflect upon your conduct in which you were      apparently discussing the possible application of the      criminal anti-torture statute with representatives of      agencies whose personnel might be involved in conduct that      you might later be called upon to evaluate for prosecution.      In hindsight, should you not have refused to engage in those      discussions, or referred the agencies to a non-prosecutorial      office of the government such as the Office of Legal Counsel?       Second, in your testimony before the Senate Judiciary      Committee in November 2001, you stated that the Department of      Justice, in its investigation into the September 11 attacks,      acted in complete accordance with all statutory and      constitutional requirements in place before or after the      attack. With what has come to light since then about the      treatment of detainees, including the Inspector General's      highly critical June 2003 report on that topic, what would      you now say about government practices in the months      following the 9/11 attacks and how they went wrong? Is it not      also true, as indicated in the 9/11 Commission report that      information sharing legal requirements and procedures were      misunderstood and misapplied before September 11, 2001?      Before September 11, 2001, what did you do to improve      information sharing between the law enforcement and      intelligence communities?       Third, what were the policies and practices of the      Department of Justice with respect to information sharing      between law enforcement and intelligence functions during the      period that you headed the Criminal Division? In particular,      what were those policies and practices before September 11,      2001, and how if at all did they change between September 11,      2001, and October 26, 2001, when the USA PATRIOT Act was      signed into law? Is it not true that in 2000 the Department's      Office of Legal Counsel issued an official memorandum on      ``Sharing Title III Electronic Surveillance Material with the      Intelligence Community,'' which concluded that law      enforcement officials may share surveillance information with      the intelligence community to obtain assistance in      preventing, investigating or prosecuting a crime, or where      the information was of overriding importance to national      security or foreign relations?       I look forward to your prompt response.           Sincerely,                                                    Patrick Leahy,     Ranking Democratic Member.                                  ____  Post-Hearing Questions for the Record Submitted by Senator Patrick    Leahy for the Nomination Hearing of Judge Michael Chertoff To Be             Secretary of the Department of Homeland Security       Question: First, at your confirmation hearing last week,      you acknowledged that while serving as head of the Criminal      Division, you consulted with lawyers for the intelligence      community regarding specific interrogation techniques.       I ask that you reflect upon your conduct in which you were      apparently discussing the possible application of the      criminal anti-torture statute with representatives of      agencies whose personnel might be involved in conduct that      you might later be called upon to evaluate for prosecution.      In hindsight, should you not have refused to engage in those      discussions, or referred the agencies to a non-prosecutorial      office of the government such as the Office of Legal Counsel?       Answer: As I stated at my confirmation hearing, I was asked      to provide my views to other attorneys on how the anti-     torture statute would be applied by a prosecutor. My position      in response was not to give advance, speculative advice about      what could be done; rather, it was to make sure that the      lawyers understood that what is likely to be critical to a      prosecutor evaluating a potential charge is the honest, good-     faith assessment by any interrogators of the effects of what      they are doing and how those effects measure against the      statute.       I believe it would have been a dereliction of my duty to      refuse to assist the Office of Legal Counsel and lawyers from      other government agencies. The Office of Legal Counsel, a      component separate and distinct from the Criminal Division,      was the primary Department of Justice Component responsible      for the guidance on the meaning of the anti-torture statute.      I understand that, depending on the legal question under      analysis, OLC or lawyers from other government agencies on      occasion solicit the views of components of the Department      that have expertise in the matter under consideration. I      believe it was appropriate for the Criminal Division to offer      general guidance on application of the law.       Question: Second, in your testimony before the Senate      Judiciary Committee in November 2001, you stated that the      Department of Justice, in its investigation into the      September 11 attacks, acted in complete accordance with all      statutory and constitutional requirements in place before or      after the attack.       With what has come to light since then about the treatment      of detainees, including the Inspector General's highly      critical June     2003 report on that topic, what would you now say about      government practices in the months following the 9/11 attacks      and how they went wrong?       Answer: As explained in the OIG report, I believed that if      individuals linked through investigation to the hijackers or      terrorism were chargeable with violations of our criminal      laws or immigration laws, as enacted by Congress, the      government should seek detention in accordance with the      applicable law while were investigating to determine if the      charged individuals posed an actual threat. In these      discussions, I repeatedly emphasized that this policy applied      only to those properly chargeable with breaking the law and      that detention should be sought consistent with relevant law      and regulations.       My understanding is that those detained in the course of      the 9/11 investigation were detained with an individualized      predicate, meaning, a criminal charge, an immigration      violation, or a judicially-issued material witness warrant.      There was a legal basis for each detention. The top priority      of the Justice Department was preventing another terrorist      attack against the American people, and the lawful detention      of individuals who were known to have violated immigration      laws--like the September 11 attackers themselves--was a      reasonable policy.       I acknowledge that the policy could have been implemented      better and it will be in the future. I believe that the      Government faced an unparalleled challenge on September 11:      How to prevent devastating terrorist attacks that might arise      at any moment from al-Qaeda ``sleepers'' who had been      specifically programmed to disguise themselves, blend into      ordinary life, and to exploit existing networks for obtaining      phony documents and other means of support. That challenge      was compounded by the fact that the September 11 attacks      physically crippled the FBI and U.S. Attorney's Office in New      York (which were the repositories of much of the Department's      antiterrorism expertise at the time) and impaired      communication between New York and Washington for a period of      time. Furthermore, because the 9/11 conspirators operated in      cities and towns across the country, the 9/11 investigation      necessitated following and analyzing many thousands of leads      generated by numerous FBI field offices, some of which had      little previous experience in conducting terrorism      investigations. Looking for a terrorist under these      circumstances was akin to looking for a needle in a      nationwide haystack, but with the needle masquerading as a      stalk of hay.       The OIG report identifies concerns that FBI investigative      delays or lack of precision in turn led to delays in      processing of immigration detainees. In the aftermath of the      surprise attack on September 11, the FBI labored under      physical and resource constraints in the face of an urgent      investigative demand of unprecedented scope. Now, additional      resources, training enhancements and reorganizations within      the Department and the FBI, as well as the Intelligence      Reform Bill--are designed to--and should continue to--     increase FBI expertise and capability and streamline      coordination, so that in any future nationwide terrorism      investigation delays and imprecision will be minimized.      Furthermore, I believe that the FBI and DHS should and will      continue to build upon their experience to develop and firmly      establish appropriate protocols for classifying subjects of      terrorism investigations at the appropriate level of concern,      setting up appropriate deadlines for notification that a      particular detainee is or is no longer a terrorism risk;      sharing information between law enforcement and immigration      agencies; and finalizing a crisis management plan that      clearly delineates each agencies procedures and      responsibilities in the event of a national emergency. These      enhancements would further reduce the potential for      impinging on civil liberties.       Finally, so far as the OIG report identified acts of      misconduct by guards at detention facilities these were, of      course, wrong, and steps should be taken to assure no such      behavior occurs in the future. I believe that DHS and DOJ      have implemented some of these proposals and, if confirmed, I      will work to further increase their successful      implementation.       Question: Is it not also true, as indicated in the 9/11      Commission report that information sharing legal requirements      and procedures were misunderstood and misapplied before      September 11, 2001? Before September 11, 2001, what did you      do to improve information sharing between the law enforcement      and intelligence communities?       Answer: I began at the Criminal Division on approximately      June 1, 2001. My activities date from that point.       Prior to 9/11, the Department--including the Criminal      Division under my leadership--was engaged in a vigorous      internal debate about the appropriate procedures for sharing      information collected in foreign counterintelligence and      counterterrorism investigations with criminal agents and      prosecutors, and the proper role for prosecutors in such      investigations. I understand that the procedures in effect on      9/11 were those that had been adopted by the Attorney General      on July 19, 1995 (including an annex concerning the Southern      District of New York), the interim measures approved by the      Attorney General on January 21, 2000, and the memorandum      issued by the Deputy Attorney General on August 6, 2001.       Question: Third, what were the policies and practices of      the Department of Justice with respect to information sharing      between law enforcement and intelligence functions during the      period that you headed the Criminal Division? In particular,      what were those policies and practices before September 11,      2001, and how if at all did they change between September 11,      2001, and October 26, 2001, when the USA PATRIOT Act was      signed into law? Is it not true that in 2000 the Department's      Office of Legal Counsel issued an official memorandum on      ``Sharing Title III Electronic Surveillance Material with the      Intelligence Community,'' which concluded that law      enforcement officials may share surveillance information with      the intelligence community to obtain assistance in      preventing, investigating or prosecuting a crime, or where      the information was of overriding importance to national      security or foreign relations?       Answer: As discussed above, prior to 9/11, the Department--     including the Criminal Division under my leadership--was      engaged in a vigorous internal debate about the appropriate      procedures for sharing information collected in foreign      counterintelligence and counterterrorism investigations with      criminal agents and prosecutors, and the proper role for      prosecutors in such investigations. The procedures in effect      on 9/11 were those that had been adopted by the Attorney      General on July 19, 1995 (including an annex concerning the      Southern District of New York), the interim measures approved      by the Attorney General on January 21, 2000, and the      memorandum issued by the Deputy Attorney General on August 6,      2001. Where it was deemed to be appropriate, additional      procedures were put in place in specific cases, or in sets of      related cases. With court approval, some of these procedures      were modified between 9/11 and October 26, 2001, the      effective date of the USA PATRIOT Act. On March 6, 2002, the      Attorney General adopted new information sharing procedures      that replaced all of the above-referenced procedures. The      March 6th procedures, however, did not take full effect until      the Foreign Intelligence Court of Review issued a ruling      regarding these matters on November 18, 2002.
