 I thank my colleague.  I want to thank Senator Kassebaum for having conducted fair hearings and allowing the process to move forward. I hope that today's vote is one again of fairness.  A filibuster on nominations has only occurred 24 times. Twenty-two of those times in this body, the body has said the nomination deserves an up-or-down vote; two of those other times they were nominations made by Democratic Presidents and defeated by Republican filibusters.  I hope that fairness prevails as it has 22 times in the past and that this Senate votes today to allow this nomination to come forward so we can finally vote up or down on the nomination of Dr. Henry Foster. He deserves that vote, and he deserves our confidence.
