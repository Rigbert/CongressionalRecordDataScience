 President, I realize this is a good bit of money. I am a member of the Appropriations Committee. I serve on the committee with Senator Gregg. I believe, though, we have been spending pennies as far as transit security is concerned--that is subways, buses, and everything else--as opposed to airline security, which both are important.  We know what happened last week in London. They have over 5,000 cameras for surveillance. It helped them a lot. I think we have to ask ourselves, Are we going to make that big downpayment toward security for our people, the millions who ride buses, subways, and trains every day? This is the first step in that direction.  I ask for your support of this amendment.
