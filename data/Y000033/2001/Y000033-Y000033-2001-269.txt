Mr. Chairman, I want to remind my colleagues this area 1002 is not ANWR. This area was set aside in 1980 for oil exploration by Senator Jackson, Congressman Udall, Senator Stephens, and Senator Bennett. It was supposed to be drilled, explored for the American people.  This is a charade from that side of the aisle. This amendment will deprive ourselves of, in fact, the oil that we must have for this Nation. It is a very small area.  I support the Sununu amendment. Two thousand acres is what we are talking about. I will give an example. After the previous speaker talked about a huge disturbance, this picture shows the alpine field right next to the so-called 1002 area. This is what it looks like in the winter. This looks very intrusive.  This picture shows what it looks like at the end of the exploration development, and this well right now is producing over 100,000 barrels of oil a year. This is less than the size of this small area from which we speak tonight, from the podiums which we have.  The misinformation on this issue by the gentleman from Massachusetts (Mr. Markey) and the gentlewoman from Connecticut (Mrs. Johnson) is so repugnant to me because it is really not the truth of the facts. This oil we have must have for this Nation. It is 1 million barrels of oil a day for the 100 years so that Saddam Hussein cannot control the market, cannot drive the gasoline prices up.  I was remarkably interested in hearing the people argue against this whole bill. If we fail to adopt this bill in total tonight, I can guarantee the public and the people on this House floor that the price of fuel will go up in 2 months' time because they have control of us. How anybody can take and send money abroad to Saddam Hussein and not develop our own oil, I cannot understand that mentality.                              {time}  2145  The mentality to say we are sending our dollars overseas so they can buy weapons of mass destruction, weapons against citizens of other countries, when we have oil in Alaska. Seventy-five percent of the people in Alaska want to drill. We are asking to have a national energy policy, as well as the President is asking.  Those people tonight who spoke on this issue against my position have never been to Alaska. I do not understand how Members can stand here and talk about the pristine area when they do not know what they are talking about. This is an area that is very hostile; but also this area has people who live there that support this.  This is not a pristine area. We must have this area to produce oil for this Nation.  Would Members have oil drilling off the coast of Florida or the Great Lakes or North Carolina? We want to do it. It is right for this Nation and for the people. It is right for my people in the State of Alaska. It is the best thing we have going, and how dare Members talk about something when they have never been there. Shame on them.
