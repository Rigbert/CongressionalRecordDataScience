 President, it was heartening to see so many Democrats joining us yesterday in advancing a good Defense authorization bill by a very large bipartisan margin. It now puts the Senate on the path to bring the bill to final passage tomorrow. Once that happens, the Senate will have taken a significant step by doing right for the men and women who risk everything to protect us. It is certainly good news, but it is not the end of the story either, because while the Defense authorization bill makes promises to our troops, it is the Defense appropriations bill that actually fulfills those promises.  That is the bill we will consider next. I would expect everyone who votes for the Defense authorization bill would also want to support moving to Defense appropriations because I am sure every Democratic colleague who just voted to make promises to our troops will want to help us actually fulfill those promises by voting for the Defense appropriations bill as well.  They might look to the example Democrats just set in the House of Representatives last week. House Democrats appear to understand just how cynical it would have been to make promises and then not fund them, which is why we saw dozens join Republicans to pass Defense appropriations. House Democrats must have known their constituents wouldn't fall for an ``I was for the troops before I was against them'' argument. House Democrats also must have seen how heartless it would have been to deny funding for America's heroes as part of some ridiculous filibuster summer plan to extract more cash for giant bureaucracies such as the IRS.  I have to think Senate Democrats would see things the same way. Judging by what we just saw last week in the Senate Appropriations Committee, there is no reason to think otherwise. Democrats and Republicans came together in the Appropriations Committee to pass the Defense appropriations bill we are about to consider by a huge margin of 27 to 3. Not only did every single Democrat support this bill in committee, but Democrats had some pretty supportive things to say about it too.  One Democratic friend called the appropriations bill ``a key investment in our national security'' that funds ``a number of Hawaii's defense needs.'' Another Democrat noted it would fund a program that is one of her ``top priorities.'' Here is what another Democrat said of the bill: ``It will directly protect and grow Connecticut's defense manufacturing industry and the hundreds of thousands of jobs it supports across our State.'' He went on to say it will ``implement a well-deserved pay raise for our troops who put their lives on the line each and every day.'' He concluded by saying it is a ``victory for Connecticut.''  A victory for Connecticut--now there is a rousing endorsement of the bill we will vote on tomorrow. It is no wonder each of these Democratic colleagues voted to endorse the appropriations bill. It is good news for our troops and their families. It is good news for our country. These Democratic friends must not want to see a ``victory for Connecticut'' squashed or one of their ``top priorities'' sacrificed for the sake of some ploy to funnel a few more dollars to Washington's big bureaucracies.  They must think this filibuster summer idea their party leaders hatched isn't good for America's national security or for job security in their own States. They must know you can't take credit for promises made in a defense authorization bill if you then vote against the appropriations bill that would fund them.  I hope Senators in both parties would join together once more to bring the Defense authorization bill over the goal line tomorrow and then begin debate on the inseparable appropriations bill too.  If Senators want to amend that appropriations bill or strike a rider, then they should vote with us to get on the legislation so we can consider these amendments or those motions to strike. If Senators want to try to increase or reduce the level of funding inthat bill, the only way they will have a chance to try doing that is if they vote with us to get on the bill in the first place.  So bring us your ideas. Bring them on out. Let's debate them. Whether you have a proposal to boost the helicopter industry in Connecticut or a plan to repair naval vessels, amphibious and surface ships in places such as California, Washington, Hawaii, and Virginia, the only way to ensure ideas like these are considered is by voting to open debate on the appropriations bill, and the only way to ensure they will not be heard at all--at all--is by voting to filibuster. That wouldn't be good for anyone.  So let's not kill the opportunity to even have those debates because here is what we know: The young men and women of our volunteer force don't need a summer packed full of Democratic filibusters, and they certainly don't need a Democratic shutdown surprise in the fall. All they ask for are the weapons, the training, and the skills they need to prevail on the battlefield. We can give it to them. We are almost there.  Democrats already joined Republicans to make a promise to the troops, and with just a little more good bipartisan work we will see Democrats join with Republicans to fulfill those promises. I have to think they will because failing to do so would mean making empty promises to both constituents and our troops.                          ____________________
