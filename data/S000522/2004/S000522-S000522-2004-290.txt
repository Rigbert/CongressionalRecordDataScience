Mr. Speaker, today I am introducing a resolution which expresses the sense of the House regarding the recent violence in Kosovo. Supporting the resolution as original co-sponsors are my colleagues on the Helsinki Commission: Mr. Cardin, Mr. Pitts and Mr. Hastings.  Last week, close to 30 people were killed, hundreds were wounded and over 3,000 persons were displaced by renewed ethnic violence in Kosovo. In addition, considerable property was damaged or destroyed, in particular Orthodox Churches. In retaliation, protesters in Serbia damaged or destroyed several mosques.  This violence was noteworthy mostly in its scale. As a practical matter, the situation for minority communities in Kosovo, including Serbs and Roma, has not been good since the United Nations, backed by a NATO-led peace operation, took control in 1999. A few weeks ago, I met with Serbian Orthodox Bishop Artemije, who presented documentation of attacks on churches and monasteries in Kosovo.  As Chairman of the Helsinki Commission, I recall the horrors which Slobodan Milosevic and his regime inflicted on the Albanian population of Kosovo. Attacks on places of worship and the lack of measures to stop these obviously vulnerable sites from being attacked again and again are inexcusable, as are the attacks on innocent people, be they Serbs, Albanians, Roma or anybody else.  This resolution says that the violence must stop. It supports Kosovo achieving benchmarks which, if met, would effectively mean the protection of human rights and democraticdevelopment as well. It support the international community taking greater action, including providing more security, in order to achieve this progress.  I believe this resolution should be able to garner wide support. This House should be on record as condemning the violence and saying that the human rights situation for the people who live there, regardless of their ethnicity, must improve.                               Resolution       Whereas the North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO)      successfully intervened in 1999 to stop the continued, brutal      repression of the Albanian population of Kosovo by the regime      of Slobodan Milosevic;       Whereas NATO has subsequently led a multinational peace      operation in Kosovo, known as KFOR, while the United Nations      has deployed an international civilian police force to      enhance peace and security;       Whereas the Organization for Security and Cooperation in      Europe (OSCE) has deployed a mission to help develop      democratic institutions, including a professional and      multiethnic Kosovo Police Service, and encourage respect for      human rights;       Whereas the United States and the international community      as a whole have called for all parties to respect the terms      of United Nations Security Council Resolution 1244 (June 10,      1999) as the basis for progress in Kosovo;       Whereas the United Nations has developed benchmarks in      Kosovo, progress in the achievement of which would include      increased respect for human rights and adherence to the rule      of law;       Whereas ethnic communities comprising the population of      Kosovo, including an Albanian majority and Serb, Romani, and      several other minority communities, have yet to reconcile      their differences despite efforts by the international      community and several nongovernmental organizations;       Whereas the OSCE has issued several reports critical of the      respect shown in Kosovo for the rights of persons belonging      to minorities;       Whereas ethnic tensions remain high in Kosovo due to the      lack of freedom of movement, the inability of displaced      persons to return to their homes, and sporadic and recurring      attacks on individuals, their property, and particularly      their places of worship;       Whereas separate and tragic incidents in Kosovo led to a      massive outbreak of violence on March 17, 2004, which has      left dozens dead, hundreds wounded, and thousands more      displaced;       Whereas Orthodox churches and monasteries in Kosovo have      often been targeted for attack, and in recent days several      additional churches and monasteries have been severely      damaged or destroyed;       Whereas mosques in Serbia have also been attacked, damaged,      or destroyed, in apparent retaliation for the violence taking      place against minority populations in Kosovo;       Whereas this violence in Kosovo threatens the dialogue      which has just been established on issues of common concern,      such as resolving the cases of missing persons from the      earlier conflict; and       Whereas it should be beneath the dignity of any individual      who was persecuted or otherwise suffered under the repressive      regime of Slobodan Milosevic to violate the human rights of      others, to support the persecution or repression of those      belonging to other ethnic groups, or to encourage or      participate in their ethnic cleansing: Now, therefore, be it       Resolved, That it is the sense of the House of      Representatives that--       (1) the outbreak of violence in Kosovo deserves the      strongest condemnation by the United States and the      international community, and all sides should refrain from      encouraging or engaging in any further violence;       (2) the attacks on places of worship in Kosovo and in      various Serbian cities should be viewed as especially      reprehensible;       (3) those who can be identified as responsible for acts of      violence should be brought to justice;       (4) the elected leaders of Kosovo have a primary      responsibility to take action to stop any continuing      violence, to prevent future violence, and to encourage ethnic      reconciliation and respect for the rights of persons      belonging to minorities in Kosovo;       (5) the presence of additional military forces in the NATO-     led multinational peace operation in Kosovo, known as KPOR,      as decided by NATO with the support of the United States on      March 18, 2004, is warranted and welcomed;       (6) the international community should take necessary      measures to protect people and property facing the threat of      violence in Kosovo;       (7) dialogue on issues of common concern in Kosovo,      including the resolution of missing persons cases, should      continue;       (8) the benchmarks established by the United Nations      parallel the democratic standards established and encouraged      by participating states of the Organization for Security and      Cooperation in Europe (OSCE);       (9) the United States and the international community as a      whole should maintain an active and effective presence in      Kosovo not only until violence subsides but until there is      significant progress in meeting the benchmarks established by      the United Nations, including the return of displaced persons      and greater freedom of movement for all persons throughout      Kosovo; and       (10) authorities in Serbia should maintain efforts to      protect people and property vulnerable to retaliatory      violence.                          ____________________
