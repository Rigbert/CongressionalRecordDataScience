President, it was 2 years ago that I worked to pass and have signed into law by the President the Code Talkers Recognition Act, a bill to give Congressional Medals to the many Native American Code Talkers who served in World Wars I and II. Today, I wish to honor an original Code Talker, Mose Bellmard, a Kaw Indian who bravely served our country during World War I. As a veteran and ardent supporter of the armed services, I always take pride when I have the opportunity to recognize the service of fine Oklahomans like him.  Bellmard, considered by many to be one of the last hereditary chiefs of the Kaw Indians, was born on February 16, 1891, to Josephine and Leonard Bellmard in Indian territory. U.S. involvement in World War I began when Bellmard was 26, and, even though Native Americans were not yet considered full citizens of the United States, he was one of the first to volunteer. He trained at Fort Sill in Lawton, OK, was made a 1st lieutenant with Company E in Oklahoma's 1st Infantry Unit.  After a few weeks of training, he deployed to the frontlines of the war in France. The setting was dangerous, and a number of his men were quickly killed during routine patrols of their area. Upon investigation, Bellmard realized that the Germans had painted sections of barbed wire that allowed them to easily spot his patrolmen's movements. Creatively, he thought to use a large bed mattress--instead of a person--to draw fire so his units could locate and neutralize the enemy. The scheme apparently worked, and in addition to saving lives his unit was able to use the tactic to destroy a number of German gun installations along the Western front.  But this would not be Bellmard's only contribution to the war effort, nor would it be his most impactful. When Bellmard entered the war, the Germans had been able to decipher nearly every one of the Allies' codes, making it difficult for them to operate in secrecy. Bellmard recognized this problem, and as the leader of the Native American unit saw a tremendous asset in his soldiers' diverse languages. These languages were completely foreign to Europeans and had never been written down. They were ideal candidates for new codes.  Lieutenant Bellmard suggested to his superiors that his unit's men be scattered throughout troop dispatch points as communications officers. There, he reasoned, they would be able to disseminate orders in their native tongues and then translate them back into English. His plan was put into practice and quickly proved to be reliable and secure. Bellmard and his original Code Talkers of Oklahoma allowed many Allied forces to move safely through battle zones without fear of interception, and to this date there are no records of the Central Powers ever cracking their ``code.''  Bellmard's suggestion carried over into World War II, during which Code Talkers were widely recruited and were critical to the Allied Forces' victory in the Pacific theater. Bellmard's simple idea to use Native American tongues to thwart and confuse enemies proved a lasting and effective tool for the U.S. military. It is fitting he was promoted to the rank of captain for his role.  Unfortunately, Captain Bellmard died before we could thank him personally for his contribution to our freedom. But our thanks are still important, especially as we remember Independence Day and the cost of securing that freedom. We owe our sincere gratitude to all American heroes like Mose Bellmard, and I pray that more emerge in generations to come.                          ____________________
