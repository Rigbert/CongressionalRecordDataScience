President, today I wish to applaud the Washington Nationals and the Vermont Lake Monsters for extending their player development contract for the next 2 years. This new agreement will keep Vermont as the New York-Penn League affiliate for Washington through at least the 2008 season.  Vermont has been the NY-Penn League affiliate of the Montreal Expos/Washington Nationals since joining the league in 1994, and the Vermont-Montreal/Washington affiliation is now the longest current partnership in the league. The Vermont team's on-field success is highlighted by winning the New York-Penn League championship in 1996.  Since beginning the partnership in 1994, Vermont has seen 46 of its players reach the Major Leagues. Eighteen of those 46 players were on Major League rosters during the 2006 season. On top of that, two players have been part of World Series championship teams--Geoff Blum for the Chicago White Sox in 2005, and Orlando Cabrera for the Boston Red Sox in 2004.  While the teams have struggled on the field of late, I am confident that the new Washington ownership will make a firm commitment to bolstering their player development program. The Lake Monsters' owner Ray Pecor and general manager C.J. Knudsen also should be commended for their hard work and dedication in running a top-notch franchise in Vermont. In short order, the Lake Monsters should get back to its winning ways and fans in Vermont and Washington will benefit.                          ____________________[Page S10645]From the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]                         VERMONT LAKE MONSTERS
