President, today I am pleased to recognize the 50th anniversary of the Chicago Women's Board of the American Cancer Society's Illinois Division.  Since its inception, in 1913, the American Cancer Society has been widely regarded as one of our Nation's leaders in public health. Even as the ACS expanded to become a nationwide community-based volunteer, health organization, they have remain dedicated to eliminating cancer as a major health problem by preventing cancer, saving lives and diminishing suffering from this disease through research, education, advocacy, and service.  Founded in 1953, the Women's Board of the American Cancer Society has served as dedicated volunteers in the fight against cancer. In the beginning, the original members worked diligently canvassing neighborhoods, knocking on doors, requesting donations while also delivering important cancer information.  Today, the board raises over $250,000 each year through their signature fundraising event, the Spring Fashion Show and Luncheon. They have also expanded their fundraising efforts to include pediatric cancer patients through their annual American Girl Fashion Show. Through their Teen-In-Training program, a commitment has been made by the Chicago Women's Board to share their knowledge and experience to enable young girls and women to become aware of cancer issues, philanthropy, and service, paving the way for another 50 years of dedicated service.  The American Cancer Society has set important nationwide goals for the year 2015: to reduce cancer incidence rates by 25 percent, to reduce cancer mortality rates by 50 percent, and to improve the overall quality of life for cancer patients.  Clearly, the Women's Board is critical to achieving these goals, and it is for these reasons that I proudly stand here today, congratulating the Chicago Women's Board on its 50th anniversary. I know my fellow Senators will join me in applauding them for their dedication, and I extend my best wishes for the future.                          ____________________
