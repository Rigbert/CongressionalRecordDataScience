Mr. Chairman, I appreciate the gentleman from California (Mr. Lewis) for yielding me the time. He will discuss the main part of this bill, which is the $317 billion defense package that he and the gentleman from Pennsylvania (Mr. Murtha), the ranking member, have provided for the Committee on Appropriations.  After he does that, I will briefly discuss the $20 billion supplemental that we added in the full committee to explain exactly what the President had requested and what the committee is recommending relative to that $20 billion.  So with that explanation, I will let the gentleman from California (Mr. Lewis) proceed with his bill, and I will take up the $20 billion supplemental. At this point, Mr. Chairman, I would also like to insert a table providing detail on the $20 billion supplemental.[GRAPHIC] [TIFF OMITTED] TH28NO01.001[GRAPHIC] [TIFF OMITTED] TH28NO01.002[GRAPHIC] [TIFF OMITTED] TH28NO01.003[GRAPHIC] [TIFF OMITTED] TH28NO01.004[GRAPHIC] [TIFF OMITTED] TH28NO01.005
