Speaker, I rise today to recognize Morrison R. Waite High School in my District. The school will be celebrating its 100th Anniversary on May 10th, 2014. High upon the east banks of the Maumee River, on a bluff overlooking the very heart of Toledo's downtown, stands historic Waite High School. Established in 1914, Waite High School is an important anchor in the community and has been a proud tradition on Toledo's East Side since its doors first opened a century ago.  Named after Supreme Court Justice Morrison R. Waite who had practiced law in Toledo, Waite High School has lived up to the reputation and success of its namesake. Students achieve academic success, with many going on to post-secondary education or vocational options.  Waite High School has nurtured many of our community leaders including current Toledo Public Schools Superintendent Romules Durant, Toledo's ``Mr. Music'' Samuel Szor, Toledo Public School teacher Lucy Weaver, former Mayor Michael J. Damas who was the first Arab-American mayor elected in the U.S., Judge Joseph Flores, and Judge Robert C. Pollex to name but a few. In 1982, Waite High School began recognizing its Distinguished Alumni and has since honored 122 individuals for their accomplishments. Of these, forty have been educators. From its beginning, Waite High School taught its students to achieve and to lead. Indeed, our community has been the richer for their efforts.  The high school got its nickname, the Indians, from Toledo fire department members on the East Side of Toledo. The fire department used to break up into two teams, East and West, for an annual running and fire truck pulling competition. The East Side fire department members used the nickname ``Indians'' in the annual competition. As the only Toledo Public School on the East Side, Waite High School decided to adopt the name. The school experienced success early on in athletics earning national titles for football in 1924 and 1932. The football team played games from Maine to California. Waite has won more than thirty City League sport titles, with dozens of athletes named to All-City teams. The rich athletic tradition continues today.  Waite High School's dedication goes beyond academic achievements and athletic prowess. The school boasts over thirty clubs and organizations. It is host to three of the largest blood drives in Northwest Ohio. The importance of giving back to the community has always been a tradition at Waite. Its students are in the 80th year of providing holiday baskets for East and South Toledo families. At the end of May, the school will hold its 97th annual Memorial Day program honoring our community's veterans.  For a century, Waite High School has sat nobly on the banks of the East Side of Toledo's Maumee River. Its proud heritage and sterling traditions have held true since its opening day one hundred years ago. As it looks forward to the next century contributing toward our successful future through the education of new generations, we take a moment to reflect on its past glories. I am pleased to join our entire community in celebrating the 100th anniversary of Morrison R. Waite High School, a beacon of learning on Toledo's East Side. Onward!                          ____________________
