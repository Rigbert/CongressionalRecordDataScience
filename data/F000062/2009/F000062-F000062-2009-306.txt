S. District Judge Colleen Kollar-Kotelly completed her service as presiding judge of the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Court. By law, after serving for a maximum of 7 years, judges of the FISA Court, who are designated from the U.S. districts courts by the Chief Justice of the United States to serve on the FISA Court in addition to their regular judicial responsibilities, are not eligible for redesignation.  Now that Judge Kollar-Kotelly has completed her distinguished service on the FISA Court, it is fitting to take note of the admirable service she has rendered as the presiding judge of an institution that is central to our Nation's commitment to conduct foreign intelligence within the rule of law.  Judge Kollar-Kotelly was appointed in 1984 to serve as an associate judge of the Superior Court of the District of Columbia. In 1997, she was appointed by President Clinton to serve on the U.S. District Court for the District of Columbia. In 2002, Chief Justice William H. Rehnquist designated her to be presiding judge of the FISA Court. Her ability to earn the trust of two Presidents and a Chief Justice is noteworthy in itself.  The period of Judge Kollar-Kotelly's service as presiding judge, from 2002 to 2009, has been, of course, a period of enormous challenge for the FISA Court. The work of the court, apart from limited releases of statistical information and the rare case in which a redacted opinion has been released publicly, occurs in secrecy. But while little is publicly known about her service as presiding judge, from the vantage point of the Senate Intelligence Committee I can say with confidence that the American people should be very grateful for her leadership of this most important court.  Congratulations, Judge Kollar-Kotelly, and thanks for a job well done.                          ____________________
