 President, the Senate has now, by a vote of 100-0, moved forward to a time where we can finally go to final passage on the Transportation appropriations bill. I hope that occurs sooner rather than later. All of us have constituents who are waiting in traffic for us to make sure we do the right thing for the infrastructure of this country.  As I have said before, Senator Shelby and I have worked very hard together. I commend him and his staff, and our staff, for the many hours they have worked to get to the point where we have a bill that represents the important needs of our country--whether it is our airports, our waterways, our highways, our infrastructure. I think we have done a good job with that.  There have been a lot of remarks over the last several weeks regarding the Mexico truck provision. I want to submit for the Record a letter from members of the Hispanic caucus in the House.  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to have the letter printed in the Record.  There being no objection, the letter was ordered to be printed in the Record, as follows:                                               Washington, DC,                                                    July 31, 2001.     Hon. Patty Murray,     Hon. Richard C. Shelby,     Senate Appropriations Committee, Subcommittee on          Transportation, Dirksen Senate Office Building,          Washington, DC.       Dear Senators Murray and Shelby: We are writing to express      our disbelief over comments we have read implying that the      truck safety measures that you have included in the      Transportation Appropriations Bill for Fiscal Year 2002 are      somehow ``anti-Hispanic'' or ``anti-Mexican.'' As you know,      when the Transportation Appropriations Bill passed the House,      an amendment was adopted that prohibited any Mexican trucks      from being granted authority to operate in the United States      during Fiscal Year 2002. In a seemingly less extreme      approach, the Senate version of the bill, as drafted by your      subcommittee, includes several provisions intended to address      obvious safety concerns regarding Mexican trucks that have      been voiced by impartial and knowledgeable observes such as      the U.S. Department of Transportation Inspector General.       The issue of safety on our highways is not an ``Hispanic      issue.'' All Americans are equally at risk from unsafe      conditions on our highways for all Americans and we share      that goal.           Sincerely,         Ed Pastor, Grace F. Napolitano, Lucille Roybal-Allard,            Hilda L. Solis, Solomon P. Ortiz, Silvestre Reyes, Luis            V. Gutierrez, Joe Baca, Nydia M.           Velazquez, Ruben Hinojosa, Ciro D. Rodriguez.
