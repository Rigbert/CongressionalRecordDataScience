Reclaiming my time, this goes just for not only issuing the permit but enforcing the permit and all the paperwork. Just one set of IDQ's costs the Government 3 million taxpayer dollars. I never heard anybody object to participating, we are talking about a very small fee here, participating because they have an exclusive right, and, you know, I am still a little bit befuddled here by where this pressure is coming to eliminate the Secretary's right to collect a fee.
