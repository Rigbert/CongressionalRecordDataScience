President, if I may respond, they realize there are not going to be bids on this contract. They realize it is going to be OK'd as soon as they send it in. They have not done any tricks at all. They just say: Here is our bill. There is nobody else bidding, and it gets passed.  Some may say that may be fraud; that may not be. Mine does not say maybe. It just says to do it is a crime.
