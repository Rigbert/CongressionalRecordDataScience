 President, this bill includes a 1.0 percent payment update to physicians for 2006. This was done to maintain beneficiary access to physician services. After all what good are Medicare benefits if you can't get in to see a doctor.  Within the bill, the impact on the part B premium is calculated based on all the provisions that affect Part B. This amendment would only hold the beneficiary harmless from the impact caused by the physician update.  Other provisions included in the bill would increase Part B spending and there are other provisions that decrease Part B spending--so why should we single out physicians?  In June, Senator Baucus and I sent a letter to the Office of Management and Budget calling for removal of Part B drugs from the physician payment formula. This letter was signed by 87 additional Senators from both sides of the aisle. If the administration were to remove Part B drugs from the formula--it would also increase the Part B premium over a number of years.  This letter did not suggest the need for a hold harmless. I wanted to point this out to my colleagues who supported this letter.  Some may feel that the Medicare drug premiums along with the Medicare part B premium may be a significant cost burden to beneficiaries. However, CMS recently announced that Medicare drug premiums will be lower than expected. The average monthly premium will be $32.20. That is $5 less per month than previously estimated.  Even if the part B premium is increased in 2007, the increase is nothing close to the $5 saved in the prescription drug premiums. And keep in mind that the part B premium increase does not affect low-income beneficiaries. Their premiums are paid for by the government. In fact, I worked hard to extend the QI program so Part B premiums would be covered. Currently, 16 percent of beneficiaries enrolled in Part B receive this assistance and more are eligible.  In addition, a MedPAC survey issued earlier this year found that 22 percent of beneficiaries already had trouble getting an appointment with a new primary care physician and 27 percent reported delays in getting an appointment. Payment cuts to physicians will only make these existing access problems worse.  I am also opposed to the provision used to pay for this amendment.  Regarding Medicaid MCO rebate, this amendment would in effect increase the rebate paid by drug manufacturers by making the rebate available to Medicaid managed care plans.  The bill we are considering today increases the rebate paid by drug manufacturers to States through the Medicaid program to 17 percent. The bill also closes a pair of loopholes that have the impact of increasing the rebate.  First, we require the best price of an authorized generic to be considered in the brand name drug's best price calculation. That will have the effect of increasing the rebate.  Second, we require physicians to notify the State Medicaid program of what drugs the physician administers in the office. Under current law, States are permitted to collect rebates on the drugs but nothing in statute requires physicians to disclose that information. As a result, States miss out on the appropriate rebate.  When all these policies are taken into consideration, we have increased the rebate paid by drug manufacturers by $1.7 billion.  Now I understand my colleague might not think that's enough, but I would encourage you to look at a CBO report put out this past June examining the price of name brand drugs. That report shows that the effective rebate being paid by drug manufacturers is actually 31.4 percent not 15 percent.  I am also concerned about the substantive implications of your offset. These Medicaid health plans are private businesses that can negotiate low drug prices. I think it runs contrary to the policy this committee passed in the MMA to allow the plans to negotiate the best deal they can get and then give them a rebate on top of that.  Yes, I do realize the Medicaid Commission accepted your offset in its recommendation, but I am quite certain the Medicaid Commission stamp of approval would not win your support for other proposals we could be considering today. We have looked at this area and come up with responsible policy that addresses loopholes. I don't think we need to further increase the rebate beyond what is already included in the bill.  Therefore, I urge my colleagues to oppose the amendment and the offset that funds it.                          ____________________
