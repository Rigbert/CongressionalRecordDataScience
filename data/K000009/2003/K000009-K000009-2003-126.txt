Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.  Mr. Speaker, I rise in opposition to this legislation with mixed feelings, because the need for environmental remediation along the border is extraordinary; and I wish to express my deepest respect for my colleagues, the gentlewoman from Illinois (Mrs. Biggert), the gentleman from Nebraska (Mr. Bereuter), the gentleman from Texas (Mr. Gonzalez), the gentleman from Texas (Mr. Hinojosa), and those who have worked to bring this matter to the floor.  I rise in opposition because I really do not believe this should come to us under a suspension. I think that the issues concerning us all out of NAFTA, and NADBank in particular, deserve the full engagement of this Congress. And I think Members should pay attention to this legislation that was brought up very quickly and out of a single committee, a committee on which I do not serve, and this is my only way of informing the membership of issues at stake relating to NADBank and adjustment to NAFTA.  As an appropriator in this Congress, I have to express the view that NADBank in and of itself deserves a very, very close look by Congress because if we look back to NADBank's establishment, it had a very curious beginning. It existed only as a side agreement that was tacked on to the original NAFTA trade agreement that was passed by a narrow margin here in Congress in 1993.  NADBank was sort of an afterthought. I can remember the gentleman from California who helped negotiate it, but it never had a separate debate in this Congress. Its functions, its operations have never been separately debated here, and now we are asking for amendments to something we have never had a full debate on in this Congress.  NADBank's shortcomings are vast, and it operates in a most unusual and atypical fashion, outside the normal jurisdictions of our Committee on Appropriations. The gentlewoman from Illinois (Mrs. Biggert) mentioned it has a half a billion dollars of capitalization. Some of it came from the general revenues of the United States, the people of our country, and the remainder from the people of Mexico; but even though it has a half a billion dollars of capitalization, it comes in the form of several pieces that wash through various appropriations subcommittees. It has no real home. Some might say its jurisdiction is segmented. Others might say it truly is haphazard and hard to get your arms around. The American people deserve better.  Indeed, NADBank operationally as a bank is a moving target, looking for a home in the Federal Government. It technically resides in the Department of Treasury. Yet its loan and grant authorities float mysteriously between the U.S. Department of Agriculture, the Small Business Administration, and a growing role for the Environmental Protection Agency, EPA, which all manage to somehow, in ways unknown to Congress, subsidize the activities of NADBank.  What we do not know about NADBank far surpasses what, in fact, any individual Member of Congress might know. I know that Members who live along the border have a horrible environmental problem that they are dealing with. I have seen the cesspools being created by industrial production and agricultural production with no funds for environmental remediation.  We tried to build environmental provisions into the original NAFTA. They were rejected. They were rejected and now, with the billions of dollars of commerce occurring across the border, who is being asked to pay for the environmental remediation? Not the companies creating the damage, but the taxpayers of the United States of America.  This is a chart showing the trade deficit with Mexico. Before NAFTA's signing, we had a positive balance with Mexico, both ways. Since NAFTA's passage, every single year we have moved as a Nation into deeper and deeper trade deficit with the nation of Mexico, as well as Canada. We have lost over three million jobs in this country due to NAFTA; and the people of Mexico have had their wages cut in half, and now 250 million jobs in northern Mexico and those maquiladoras are moving to China where the wages are even cheaper.  We ought to revisit NAFTA. It is 10 years since its passage and millions and millions of people are being harmed. Indeed, the most harmed, in my opinion, are the peasants coming off the ejido system in Mexico who have no voice and no representation, and they deserve it in this highest Chamber of our government.  NADBank should realistically deal with these adjustments and it does not. We should not just have a suspension bill that deals with two or three small provisions. We should deal with the fundamentals of this agreement and the giant holes that are in it.  In the United States, in a State like my own--and here is a current chart of this showing our unemployment--the dark green covers counties in our State with the highest rates of unemployment. One of the five top States in theUnion to lose jobs because of NAFTA, most recently Dixon Ticondaroga Pencil and Crayon Company in Sandusky, Ohio, and also Phillips Electronics, in Ottawa, Ohio, over 2000 more jobs have relocated to Mexico.  We know a lot about NAFTA and its impact, and yet we look at the NADBank regulations and which counties have they helped with all the job loss in Ohio? Well, they picked one here and they picked one here and they picked one here to try to give a minimal amount of assistance. But there is no regularity, frankly no real help. NAFTA's NADBank has no regularity with which it deals with the huge job loss that these trade deficits represent.  The bill that is before us expands the area of eligibility for NADBank, as my colleagues rightly wish to do, by about 200 additional kilometers down into Mexico. But it does absolutely nothing to provide support to the thousands of communities across our Nation that have also lost jobs to Mexico.  My problem is NADBank's reach is not great enough. In fact, the part of the bank with the least staff and support, called CAIP, C-A-I-P, the Community Adjustment and Investment Program, has just experienced the resignation of its director and the Bush Administration has proposed no funding for future grants.  As an appropriator, I want to help the NADBank for all of America. NADBank will not let me help it, and this debate will not let me find an appropriate way in which to pay for the adjustment that is so essential not just in Ohio but in California, in Tennessee, Oregon, south Florida and so many other places that have lost jobs because of NAFTA.  So the problem with NADBank is not the limited area of Mexico where more of our tax dollars will be used to remediate environmental disasters, because NAFTA is silent on the environment, but the fact that NADBank's reach is too limited. It ought to reach to places like Detroit and Sandusky, Ohio, and east Tennessee's and South Carolina's textile belts, in south Florida, in Galesburg, Illinois, where Maytag just announced it is shutting down and moving to Mexico, and south Chicago's loss of Brach's candy and Buffalo, New York, with the loss of Trico corporation.  Indeed, NADBank in the last 2 fiscal years has issued only six direct loans: three in the border area, two in North Carolina, and one in Virginia. Imagine, six loans and thousands of lost companies in this country and millions of lost jobs after 10 years. NADBank has far too little to show for its existence. With half a billion dollars, what has it been doing?  So I would say to my colleagues who have absolutely wholesome and extraordinarily important concerns here today in trying to extend NAFTA's environmental provisions through NADBank to cover a larger proportion of Mexico's to our border countries problems, look at the fundamentals. I think the administration wants to piecemeal with this suspension bill and find ways to try to fix an agreement that fundamentally needs a broader look.  I would urge my colleagues to vote ``no'' on this suspension bill today in order that we can have that broader debate. We need so many adjustments in NADBank and NAFTA.  First, we need an agricultural adjustment provision. Part of the illegal immigration coming into our country is because there are no agricultural provisions under NAFTA, and NADBank is absolutely unrealistic in the manner in which it deals with the exodus in the Mexican countryside. NAFTA is a huge continental disaster for them. Indeed, people's lives are being lost every day because we choose to ignore their pain. Let us be voices for the most powerless people on this continent.  We need a continental labor registration system for agricultural labor. It is wrong what happened to those 14 people in that truck in Omaha dying because they were brought up here as bonded workers. We need a continental solution to that travesty.  In terms of the environment, why should the taxpayers of our country be asked to pay for the damage these corporations are doing? The corporations involved in this border trade, they ought to pay, because they are the ones creating the mess. We have done the very same kind of program here in our own country to let those responsible pay for the environmental damage that they are doing.  In terms of NADBank, to help our communities readjust whether they are Illinois, whether they are Ohio, whether they are California, let us look at a NADBank that can function to meet the reality of the job loss across this Nation and harm across our continent.                              {time}  1400  Today we are being asked with this suspension to just take the tail on the dog. I am asking the Congress to embrace the dog. This is my only opportunity to do it. On the 10th anniversary of NAFTA, can we not finally be adults and recognize the continental situation that we, as elected officials at the highest levels of our government, have a responsibility to remediate? It is time. It is time.  I realize that the bill that is before us technically is much more narrowly cast, but it is our only vehicle. Give a few more weeks, a few more opportunities for Members to weigh in. I think we could create a measure that truly, on NAFTA's 10th anniversary, would help our continent deal with the pain and suffering of workers in our Nation and continent.  And by the way, the Department of Labor has made the decision not to count the workers in our country who are losing their jobs because of NAFTA today. That has now been stopped. What kind of a system is this? What kind of government is this? We have a responsibility to displaced workers to certify their communities for eligibility for programs like NADBank we must know where those jobs are being lost. So many pieces of this continental puzzle need to be put together in a tidy package. We are not presented with that package today.  So I would just for the purposes of colloquy end my formal remarks now, in the event some of my colleagues, such as the gentleman from Texas (Mr. Gonzalez) or the gentleman from Texas (Mr. Hinojosa) or the gentleman from California (Mr. Filner) wish to comment at this point. This is just an awfully important question for our continent. We are the people who can make life better. It is our time. It is our watch. We ought to make it better for people who do not have voice in this Chamber.  Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.
