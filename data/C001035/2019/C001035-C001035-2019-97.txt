President, today I wish to commemorate the 150th anniversary of the town of Grand Isle, ME. As one who was born and raised in Aroostook County, it is a great pleasure to celebrate the generations of industrious and caring people who have made Grand Isle such a wonderful place to live, work, and raise families.  Named for a large and fertile island in the St. John River, Grand Isle is a small town with a rich history. For thousands of years, the river valley has been the home of the Micmac and Maliseet. French explorers, led by Samuel de Champlain, first visited the area in 1604. In the late 1700s, French-speaking Canadians began settling in the area, laying the foundation for the vibrant Acadian culture that is so important in Maine, New Brunswick, Nova Scotia, and as far away as Louisiana.  The Acadian settlers created a vibrant community. They cleared farmland, established lumber and grain mills, railroad roundhouses, and thriving general stores. In the 1870s, as railways expanded in the region, the people of Grand Isle joined with their Canadian neighbors on the opposite shore of the St. John River to build a ferry system that used an 800-foot cable suspended above the river to connect the products of their hard work to faraway markets.  When the World Acadian Congress convened in Aroostook County in 2014, the descendants of those neighbors again came together to build a replica of that historic ferry. The Grand Isle homecoming held during the Congress celebrated the rich Acadian traditions of great food, music, and dance, and of close-knit families and lasting friendships.  Those traditions are preserved and honored at the Cultural Museum of Mount Carmel and its remarkable collection of Acadian artifacts. The museum is located in the former Our Lady of Mount Carmel Catholic Church, one of the few surviving 19th-century Acadian churches in northern Maine. That beautiful architectural gem was lovingly restored by the people of the region and is listed on the National Registry of Historic Places.  The celebration of Grand Isle's 150th anniversary is not merely about the passing of time; it is about human accomplishment. We celebrate the people who pulled together, cared for one another, and built a great community. Thanks to those who came before, Grand Isle, ME, has a wonderful history. Thanks to those there today, it has a bright future.                          ____________________
