Mr. Speaker, from April 30-May 2, 2005 more than 1200 students from across the United States will visit Washington, D.C. to take part in the national finals of We the People: The Citizen and the Constitution, the most extensive educational program in the country developed specifically to educate young people about the U.S. Constitution and Bill of Rights. Administered by the Center for Civic Education, the We the People program is funded by the U.S. Department of Education.  I am proud to announce that the class from West Anchorage High School will represent the state of Alaska in this prestigious national event. These outstanding students, through their knowledge of the U.S. Constitution, won their statewide competition and earned the chance to come to our nation's capitol and compete at the national level.  While in Washington, the students will participate in a three-day academic competition that simulates a congressional hearing in which they ``testify'' before a panel of judges. Students demonstrate their knowledge and understanding of constitutional principles and have opportunities to evaluate, take, and defend positions on relevant historical and contemporary issues. It is important to note that the Educational Testing Service (ETS) characterizes the We the People program as a ``great instructional success.'' Independent studies by ETS have revealed that We the People students ``significantly outperformed comparison students on every topic of the tests taken.''  Congratulations to Elizabeth DeYoung, Monique Eniero, Roberta Gordaoff, Danielle Johnson, Jayme Johnson, Vassar Louis-Bradford, Gareth Olds, Michael Pascual, Courtney Prokosch, Alexander Richert, Gerriane Villanueva, Jeffery Wittsey and their teacher Pamela Orme.  I wish these students the best of luck at the We the People national finals and applaud their outstanding achievement.                          ____________________[Extensions of Remarks][Page E798]From the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov] CONGRATULATING WEST ANCHORAGE HIGH SCHOOL ON ITS PARTICIPATION IN THE                      ``WE THE PEOPLE'' COMPETITION                                 ______                                                              HON.
