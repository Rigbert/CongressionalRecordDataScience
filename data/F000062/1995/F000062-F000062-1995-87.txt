 President, I rise today to support the amendment offered by Senator Graham.  The bill before us creates a Medicaid block grant, a blank check, to States with virtually no rules, no specified benefits, no rules of eligibility.  The amendment would retain the current Medicaid Program, but impose a spending limit per individual recipient, an individual cap. This approach would hold down cost increases without undermining Medicaid as a health insurance program.                         Medicaid in California  Medicaid, called Medi-Cal in my State, pays for health care for 6 million Californians. Out of these 6 million, 38 percent are children. Medicaid pays the bills of over 60 percent of children in California's children's hospitals. At Oakland Children's Hospital, it pays for 70 percent.  Medicaid provides 70 percent of hospital care to the poor in my State. Of total Medicaid dollars, over 59 percent is spent on the elderly and disabled and 41 percent to families.  One million Americans are infected with HIV/AIDS. In California, there are over 150,000. Medicaid provides health insurance for 40 percent of all people with HIV/AIDS, including 90 percent of all HIV-infected children. In California, Medicaid pays for 50 percent of all HIV/AIDS care. Medicaid pays for 55 percent of HIV-related public hospital care and 41 percent of private hospital care.  In my State, Medicaid paid $719 million for emergency services for illegal immigrants, last year, according to the California Department of Health Services.  Medicaid is a fundamental health safety net in California, insuring everything from basic inoculations for poor children to sophisticated advanced treatment for AIDS.                        Medicaid Cost Increases  As a former mayor, I know the difficulty of balancing budgets and keeping costs under control. And there is no doubt that Medicaid costs, along with general health care inflation, have grown at double digits, creating tremendous pressure on government budgets at all levels.  The amendment before us reins in Medicaid's growth, but instead of cutting $187 billion, it cuts $62 billion, one-third of the cut in the Republican bill.         Why the Graham Amendment is Better than the Roth Bill  Why is this approach preferable to the committee bill?  First, it does put restraints on spiraling costs.  Second, it preserves coverage for those who cannot get health insurance on the private market because of costs or the individual's health condition.  Third, a per capita cap can respond to changing conditions--population growth, recessions, base closings, natural disasters, immigration.                      California and Fluctuations  The per capita cap approach in this amendment would enable my State to respond to all the economic fluctuations that we live with daily.  Unemployment in California has not dropped below 7 percent since 1990. While the country added 3 million jobs between 1991 and 1993, California lost nearly 450,000.  Base closures and realignments have erased more than 200,000 jobs, sucking $7 billion out of the State's economy. Defense and aerospace industries are downsizing.  Some 6.5 million or 23 percent of our nonelderly population are without health insurance. In some urban areas, the uninsured rate is as high as 33 percent. Over half, 58 percent of the uninsured, are children and young adults.  Employer-provided health insurance is declining. Two-thirds of Californians employed by firms with fewer than 25 employees do not receive health insurance.  California is home to 38 percent of all legal immigrants in the U.S.  A flat block grant with a fixed pool of money cannot respond to changing needs like this. A formula that is responsive to numbers of beneficiaries, like this amendment, can.                           Nursing Home care  The amendment before us would preserve nursing home standards, standards that S. 1357 eliminates.  Responding to a National Academy of Sciences report, Congress in 1987 enacted nursing home standards to promote quality of life of nursing home residents and to prevent abuse and neglect. This bill repeals those standards, rules designed to prevent bedsores, dehydration, malnutrition, infection; rules designed to protect privacy and human integrity. These standards have reduced injury and cut the use of chemical restraints, which in turn has reduced costs.  In California, 65 percent of our 113,000 nursing home residents rely on Medicaid. This is 113,000 elderly and disabled people, patients with, for example, Alzheimer's, AIDS, and ventilator needs.  Twenty-one percent of nonelderly nursing home residents are disabled. Seventy-five percent of nursing home residents are women. The typical nursing home resident is an 83-year-old widow with multiple chronic conditions, such as crippling arthritis or osteoporosis.  We should not take away these minimal protections for the most frail and make them victims again.                    Medicaid--a Middle-Class Program  Medicaid is health insurance for low-income Americans and the disabled. But it is important to understand the implications Medicaid has for the middle-class. Nursing home standards, which are required as a condition of receiving Medicaid payments, benefit every nursing home resident of whatever income.  By cutting Medicaid, we add to the rolls of the uninsured which means that more people show up in emergency rooms with exacerbated illnesses. We all pay for that.  Medicaid reimbursement to our public hospitals enables these hospitals to have up-to-date trauma centers and emergency rooms which serve Medicaid and non-Medicaid patients. These are critical institutions in many communities on which we all depend. Indeed, these institutions are at the economic core of thousands of communities and they provide jobs.                           A Basic Protection  The committee bill makes drastic cuts in Medicaid and it revamps the program in a way that cannot respond to the growing needs of California and changes a steadfast program of health insurance to an arbitrary, ill-defined block of Federal funds.  The bill purports to transform Medicaid. I'm afraid that it destroys Medicaid.  I oppose the committee bill. I commend my colleague from Florida for his amendment and I support him.
