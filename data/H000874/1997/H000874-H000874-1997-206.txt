Chairman, I move to strike the requisite number of words.  Mr. Chairman, for all the reasons that the distinguished gentleman from Alabama [Mr. Riley] just stated I would urge opposition to his amendment, which is well-intentioned, and support of the full funding for this program.  I do so on the following basis. The gentleman indicates that last year a problem occurred. It is my understanding, I say to my friend, who has much more knowledge on this issue than I, I want to say that out front, but it is my understanding that in fact the applications to which the gentleman refers were in fact reviewed, but there was not the proper paper documentation of that review.  Now that aside, because I do not have nearly as much information as the gentleman does, that issue occurred last year. That issue is properly under investigation by the committee, as it should do, as it has a responsibility to do, to ensure that in fact proper procedures, legal procedures, effective procedures, are pursued for the purposes of granting dollars appropriated by this Congress. I applaud the gentleman for that effort. It is an appropriate effort. I support it.
