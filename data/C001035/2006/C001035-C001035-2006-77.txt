President, I will yield myself 1 minute, and then I will reserve a minute for after Senator Schumer speaks.  Mr. President, I urge my colleagues to join me in voting to table the amendment offered by the Senator from New York, which would require 100-percent scanning of all 11 million cargo containers entering the United States, regardless of whether they are incredibly low-risk containers or high-risk containers.  Now, the amendment that was adopted yesterday, the Coleman amendment, provides for 100-percent scanning of high-risk containers.
