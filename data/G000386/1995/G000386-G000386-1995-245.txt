 President, the unmatched disbursement problem at the Pentagon has been simmering on a back burner for years.  All of a sudden, it is on the front burner, and it is boiling.  The issue is so bothersome right now because it undermines the credibility of the defense budget numbers and the case for pumping up the defense budget.  There is another article on it in the Washington Post on Tuesday.  This one zeros right in on the main problem: the lack of accountability at the Pentagon.  I ask that the article be printed in the Record.  The article follows:                [From the Washington Post, May 23, 1995]                 The Pentagon's Accountability Problem                         (By Coleman McCarthy)       Speaking of welfare abuse--and who isn't--have you heard      about the $13 billion the government handed out over the past      decade but doesn't know where it went or to whom? Then      there's the $6 billion spent in excess of what Congress      authorized.       The welfare recipients who have taken this money and run--     or lazed about or bought Cadillacs, as it is derisively said      of poor people--are in a category of their own. They are      military contractors. Their welfare agency is the largest of      them all, the Department of Defense, which has a defense      against enemies great and small except the one within: fiscal      stupidity and indifference.       Some of the details of this welfare abuse were revealed May      16 before the Senate Armed Services subcommittee on      readiness. It wasn't much of a hearing: just a half-day of      testimony from a Pentagon undersecretary and the head of the      General Accounting Office, a few senators and not much in the      national media that evening or the next day.       If $19 billion in lost or untracked tax money had been      dispensed by the Department of Education on mismanaged      reading programs or if this were $19 billion that vaporized      in the Medicare or food stamp bureaucracy, no hearing room      would have been large enough to hold the media and outraged      public, no time limit on hearings would have been imposed and      no senator's publicist would have passed up the chance to      paper Washington with the boss's deploring of bureaucrats,      welfare cheats and, for sure, liberals.       But this was the Pentagon--the Department of Giveaways--and      its dollar-mates, military contractors and their rent-a-     general execs. Both givers and takers are on permanent      dispensations from standards of competence, accountability      and honesty that apply elsewhere.       At the hearings, Charles A. Bowsher of the GAO ran through      what he called the Pentagon's ``serious problem of not being      able to properly match disbursements with obligations.''      Pentagon overpayments, flawed contracts, duplicative business      practices, shoddy or no record-keeping and multiple payroll      systems have meant that the money might as well have been      thrown out of airplanes for all anyone knew where it went.       On such a routine matter as travel, Bowsher reported that      the Pentagon has ``over 700 processing centers, 1,300 pages      of regulations and some 40      steps to get travel approval and reimbursement. The result:      DOD spent over 30 percent of each travel dollar on      administrative cost. By contrast, companies with the best      travel processes have one disbursing center . . . and 10      or fewer process steps. These companies spend as little as      1 percent of their travel dollar on administrative      costs.''       According to John Hamre, the Pentagon undersecretary and      comptroller, each month the Pentagon deals with 2.5 million      invoices and 10 million paychecks. He spun: ``It isn't that      we have wicked people trying to screw up, it's that we have a      system that's so error-prone that good people working hard      are going to make mistakes.''       In the past 18 months, the hard-working good folk at the      Pentagon have miscalculated Hamre's paycheck six times.       Because no wicked people are involved in the missing      billions, no mention was made of firings, much less possible      indictments. On the issue of ``problem disbursements,'' Hamre      was the model of managerial thoughtfulness. It is too late or      too burdensome to go back and see what or who went awry: ``I      decided to suspend, on a one-time basis, the requirement to      research old transactions.'' To DOD's contractor buddies, the      message, unlike the money, was not lost: Relax, we're good      people, you're good people. It was ``the system.''       Hamre reassured Congress that the era of reform is here:      ``The department has refined and advanced its blueprint to      eliminate its long-standing financial management      problems.'' [[Page S7631]]        Sure. In his 1989 book ``The Pentagonists: An Insider's      View of Waste, Mismanagement, and Fraud in Defense      Spending,'' A. Ernest Fitzgerald wrote that the military's      rote reaction to scandal is to promise reform, pledge self-     policing and spout Caspar Weinberger's favorite cliche about      the ``few bad apples in any barrel.'' And then go back to      writing checks.       Down the hall on the same day from the hearing on the      missing billions was another Senate Armed Services panel      reaching for its appropriations pen--debating a $60 billion      contract to build 30 attack submarines for the Navy. To      attack who? Russia.       It was a day of symmetry: one Senate committee looking for      phantom money and another pondering a phantom enemy.
