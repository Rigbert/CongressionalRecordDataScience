Mr. Speaker, I rise today to announce the introduction of the Netizens Protection Act of 1999. This legislation is carefully tailored to protect consumers and Internet Service Providers (ISPs) from the costs and inconvenience of unsolicited e-mail.  My bill allows Internet Service Providers (ISPs) to take legal action against someone who uses their equipment or facilities--without their permission--to initiate the bulk transmission of unsolicited electronic messages. Equally important, it would also permit consumers to take action against someone who sent them unsolicited e-mail, so-called spam.  The bill is based on a simple principle of fairness: consumers should not have to pay for unwanted messages and neither should their ISP. Spam is not just a nuisance that can be cured by the judicious use of the delete key. Spam literally forces you to pay for the costs of some other person's advertisement--it is like getting a piece of junk mail and then having to pay for the cost of the stamp. Spam exposes you to dangerous viruses that can damage files or harm computer hardware. Spam often consists of illegal pyramid schemes and frequently contains illegal child pornography.  Moreover, even if an Internet user is not paying for the additional time online to retrieve unwanted mail, they are still being charged a higher rate by their ISP for filter services and larger band-widths to combat ``junk e-mail.'' Unwanted e-mail is costly to both the provider and consumer. The problem is that unlike regular junk mail, where the sender pays for the costs, spam shifts the costs from the sender to the recipient.  My legislation would require anyone sending an unsolicited electronic message to provide a name, a physical mailing address, and the electronic mail address of the person who initiated the message, along with a method by which the recipient of the message could contact the transmitter of the electronic mail to request that no further messages be sent. If someone was sent unsolicited e-mail from someone they contacted to request no further mail be sent, they could pursue legal action to recover treble damages.  Along with empowering the consumer to take action against spam, my bill also allows ISP's to seek legal remedies if someone violates their policies against unsolicited electronic mail messaging. Additionally, ISP's would be required to explain their unsolicited e-mail policies in simple terms so spammers could be forewarned and users could make an informed decision about what ISP to use, as well as whether they wanted unsolicited e-mail blocked. Consumers would and should be able to decide whether they want to receive unsolicited e-mail. My bill does that. Furthermore, the consumer would be able to take legal action if a spammer did not respect their wishes under the Netizens Protection Act.  The Netizens Protection Act is directed at the big spammers who tie-up networks with thousands upon thousands of messages. It would not go after someone who just sent a few messages either inadvertently or even intentionally. Language in my bill would allow someone to send up to 50 identical or substantially similar messages to recipients within a seven day period.  My legislation would also not interfere with or affect direct e-mail advertising or marketing. All avenues of legitimate direct marketing would remain. If any previous business relationship existed between the e-mailer and the e-mail recipient, my legislation would not affect the e-mail transaction. For example, if someone made a purchase at a retail store, a business relationship would exist, so that retailer could send e-mail updates to that customer and still maintain compliance with the Netizens Protection Act. Indeed, I believe that unless legislation is enacted to protect consumers from spam, it will discourage the expansion of Internet business and commerce.                          ____________________
