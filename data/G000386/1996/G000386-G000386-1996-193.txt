 President, I would like to respond to General Krulak's letter.  This is the main point in his letter, and I quote General Krulak's own words:       The main thrust of your letter is that the number of      general officers should be reduced consistent with force      structure reductions.  This is General Krulak talking:       The reduction in end strength does not necessarily have a      one-to-one correlation with command billet reduction.  He goes on to say:       This point is key: While the Marine Corps has reduced its      end strength by 24,000 personnel, its three division, three      wing structure has remained essentially unchanged. Those      familiar with the military know that the requirement for      general/flag officers is tied directly to the number of      combat divisions and air wings--and that number has not been      changed.  Mr. President, I would like to respond to General Krulak.  First, the suggestion that the number of generals should be reduced consistent with force structure reductions is not a rule dreamed up by the Senator from Iowa.  The rule was first put forward by the Senate Armed Services Committee years ago.  It has been expressed by the House Armed Services Committee.  It was the guiding principle used in formulating current law.  It is still in current law--section 526 of title 10, United States Code.  That law places a ceiling on the number of generals and admirals allowed on active duty.  This is the rule behind the law:  As the force structure shrinks, the number of generals and admirals should come down.  If the force structure expands, then the number of generals and admirals should go up.  That simple, commonsense logic has guided military planners since time began.  Second, General Krulak agrees that end strength has fallen.  However, he contends that the Marine Corps' combat force remains essentially unchanged.  Let's briefly review the facts.  In fiscal year 1987, Marine end strength was 199,525, including 70 generals.  Today, the fiscal year 1996, there are 172,434 marines, including 68 generals.  While end strength is down and two generals are gone, the Marine Corps still has three divisions and three airwings.  General Krulak is right about that. The force structure is intact.  Unfortunately, it's not whole. Some troops are missing.  The end strength is down by 27,091 Marines.  If the structure is still there, but some people are gone, that's a hollow force, isn't it?  Mr. President, is another hollow force creeping out of the Pentagon fog?  Mr. President, on July 17, I placed a Marine Corps briefing paper in the Record, page S7986.  That paper was entitled ``Making the Corps Fit To Fight.'' It was dated April 1996.  This is what it says:  Marine infantry battalions are at 57 percent of authorized requirements for platoon sergeants.  If that's true, then the Marine Corps structure is already getting hollow.  A Marine platoon can't function without a good sergeant.  Mr. President, do we need more generals to lead a hollow force?  Clearly, a hollow force doesn't demand more generals. Nor does a static force demand more generals.  Only a bigger force demands more generals, and that isn't in the cards right now.  Third, General Krulak introduces another argument to justify his request for more generals.  This one is designed to de-couple the issue from the force structure. This is how he tries to undo the logic.  He says he needs 12 more generals to fill joint billets mandated by the Goldwater-Nichols Act of 1986.  It's a distortion to suggest that Goldwater-Nichols mandates more generals when the force structure is shrinking.  Joint billets--just like service billets--should be squeezed as the force structure shrinks.  This is the message hammered home by Marine Gen. John Sheehan:  ``Headquarters and defense agencies should not be growing as the force shrinks.''  That's General Sheehan, commander in chief of the U.S. Atlantic Command.  All the data points indicate that downsizing is continuing and will continue for the foreseeable future.  So the argument that more generals are needed to fill joint billets doesn't hold much water, either.  A few years back, the Marine Corps had another commandant. His name was Al Gray.  He was tough as nails. He was known as a mud marine.  He didn't look at the Marine Corps' needs like a bureaucrat would. He looked at it like a Marine--from the bottom up, starting with platoons and companies.  In a December 1987 interview with the Chicago Tribune, General Gray talked about his plans to fill his units with people from the bottom up. I quote:       `If the Marines fill their need for officers and troops      before they get to the big headquarters in Washington,' he      said with a grin, `that might be a blessing in disguise.'  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that this interview be printed in the Record.  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in the Record, as follows:               [From the Chicago Tribune, Dec. 13, 1987]                      Marines: Myth Versus Reality         modern corps is big, costly, heavy on supporting cast                            (By David Evans)       Washington--The Marines have a new commandant, Gen. Alfred      Gray, a veteran of     the Korean and Vietnam Wars. He's characterized by marines      who know him as a self-taught thinker and a ``warrior's      warrior.''       He inherits not one, but two Marine Corps. One is the corps      of myth: small, cheap, and mostly fighters. A Marine Corps,      if you will, designed to kick down the door of a defended      coastline and put a lot of grunts on the beach in a hurry and      looking for a fight.       Then there's the real Marine Corps: big, expensive, and      with relatively few fighters but a big supporting cast. This      real corps plans to land ashore where the enemy isn't.       Al Gray isn't very happy with this real corps.       ``We're going to make some changes,'' he growls. ``It's      time for a fresh, simple look.''       People are not his problem. Today's young marines are the      highest quality ever, by any measure. They're enough to make      a hard-boiled commander's eyes water with joy.       The real problems are deeper, and structural. They have to      do with the rising cost of the Marines, a tail-wagging-the-     dog support structure that pulls marines out of fighting      units, and a new-found addiction to costly, exotic equipment.       Gray is already grousing about some of these problems.       ``Americans expect their Marine Corps to put fully manned      infantry battalions into the field,'' he said in a recent      interview, ``not units missing 100 or more troops.''       That's an unusual admission from the man in charge of a      corps of 20,000 officers and 180,000 enlisted marines. But      over the years the corps bought equipment that took more      people to maintain and repair, and it created more and larger      headquarters units. These competing demands for manpower, in      secondary support and headquarters activities, siphoned      marines out of the fighting units.       The slogans remain--``Every marine is a rifleman''--and      ringing speeches are still made about the infantryman as the      corps' ultimate weapon. But in the real Marine Corps, the      infantryman is steadily becoming an endangered species. Of      the 180,000 enlisted marines, about 33,000 are officially      designated as infantrymen.       Throw in the artillerymen, tank crews and combat engineers,      and the total number of enlistees in the ``combat arms''      amounts to barely 51,000. Instead of closing with and      destroying the enemy, the traditional role of marine fighting      men, nearly three out of four enlisted marines are now doing      something else; repairing equipment, hanging bombs on      airplanes, driving trucks.       In this respect, the Marine Corps looks very much like the      U.S. Army, where three out of four active-duty soldiers are      in support functions, too.       Mark Cancian, a Marine Reserve major, sums up recent trends      with this observation: If the corps' structure of 1962 were      in place today, a structure that featured larger infantry      battalions and less logistics support, ``there would be      17,000 more marines in Marine divisions--one entire      division's worth.''       ``Another insight,'' says Cancian, ``is to look at the      number of `trigger pullers' in the division.''       These are the marines who personally deliver fire on the      enemy: the riflemen, artillery cannoneers, tank crews.      Everybody else is helping to coordinate and support that      fire, but the number of trigger pullers amounts to barely      7,500 in a division of 17,500 enlisted marines.       There are barely 22,500 ``trigger pullers'' in all three      active divisions. Add a few hundred pilots flying close air      support, say 500, and there are perhaps 23,000 marines in a      corps of 200,000 whose primary duty is to personally fire on      the enemy.       Most of these ``trigger pullers'' are found in the 27      infantry battalions that represent the cutting edge of the      corps. Those battalions may be short the infantrymen they      need, but they have plenty of headquarters over them: 29      regimental and higher level headquarters, in fact.       If the Marines have grown top-heavy with headquarters      units, they've also become harder to move. Too heavy for easy      deployment, despite Gen. Robert Barrow's warning as      commandant in 1980 that the corps ``should be light enough to      get there, and heavy enough to win.''       Artillery is an instructive example. The Marines ``heavied      up''' their artillery from 105 mm. to 155 mm. howitzers, in      part because the Army was shifting to heavier artillery, and      in part because of the long range of Soviet guns. But the new      howitzer has to be disconnected from the truck that pulls it      before being loaded into the standard medium-size landing      craft. And the truck doesn't have enough power to pull the      gun through sand, so a forklift has to be waiting on the      beach to pull the gun ashore.       Air units are more difficult to move, too. The Marines are      replacing their aging F-4 fighters with new F-18s. According      to the maintenance officer of a fighter group of 60 aircraft,      the number of maintenance vans that must accompany the same      number of F-18s went up 72 percent, from 150 vans to 260.       The Marines have become so heavy that the supplies for a      full-up amphibious force of 50,000 marines fill about 6,800      containers, each as big as a small bus. Landed ashore, the      containers blanket a huge area.       ``About 22 acres of nothing but boxes,'' says a colonel,      who asks: ``Can we afford a target that large?''       ``Amphibious operations by their very nature require      bulldozers and other heavy equipment,'' explains Lt. Col. Ken      Estes, a staff officer at Marine headquarters.       All those support marines, the heavier equipment and the      stacks of supplies cost more money. An E-3 lance corporal in      an infantry squad costs $15,600 a year in pay and benefits;      and E-6 staff sergeant clerking in a headquarters unit costs      $22,800.       The new truck carries the same 5-ton load as the vintage      model it replaces, but costs $31,000 more (in constant 1986      dollars.)       Heavier artillery shells for the new howitzer cost 160      percent more.       These are just a few examples of the thousand different      ways the corps' appetite for money has ratcheted steadily      upward.       The Marines are no longer the K mart of national defense;      they are smack in the mainstream of an upscale defense      establishment where costs are rounded to the nearest tenth of      a billion dollars.       The corps' annual budget now hovers at $9 billion. Since      the Navy buys airplanes for the Marines out of its ``blue      dollar'' budget, the real cost of the corps runs closer to      $13.7 billion a year, according to Pentagon budget experts.       Even the Marines may not realize how expensive they have      become. In 1976 the total cost of equipping, paying and      training each marine was about $37,000. That's in equivalent      1987 dollars. Since then, the per capital cost has rocketed      to $68,000 for each marine--a stunning 83 percent increase.      Part of that jump is the extra pay for more experienced      marines, with the rest driven by the rising price of      equipment and operations.       The cost is still less than the $104,000 the Army spends      for every soldier, but the difference is narrowing, and fast.       If the taxpayers cannot afford the money-rich diet to which      the Marines have grown accustomed, the Navy can't, either. Or      at least it can't afford enough of the kind of highly      specialized amphibious ships the Marines want.       The biggest new class of amphibious ships, for example,      costs more than $1 billion and figures prominently in the      planned expansion of the amphibious fleet from 62 to 76      vessels.       The Marines have rejected cheaper ships as a solution to      the numbers problem. One design concept, known in the      pentagon by the codeword LTAX, would have provided the same      carrying capacity as the large amphibious ships now under      construction, but at one-fourth their billion-dollar cost.       ``LTAX didn't have the built-in survivability or creature      comforts,'' admits a Pentagon naval expert, ``but it would      have provided a way of complementing the limited number of      true amphibious ships we can afford.''       If the Marines have erred by growing too heavy for easy      deployment, they've also strayed from Gen. Barrow's timeless      dictum by not being heavy enough in the right areas to win.      In antitank combat, for example, the Marines' problem is more      than serious--it is critical.       With the exception of the TOW missile, the Marines'      infantry antitank weapons are not up to the job, according to      a recent General Accounting Office report on antitank      weapons. The warhead on the shoulder-launch AT-4 antitank      rocket is too small for assured frontal kills against      attacking Soviet tanks. Critics, including some marines, call      the AT-4 ``the paint scratcher.''       Worse, the Marines probably are not buying enough TOWs.      Their planned consumption rate in combat is one TOW missile      per launcher every two days.       The Marines have had the Dragon medium-weight antitank      missile for a decade, but its accuracy and punch are dismal.      In combat, the GAO estimates the Dragon may hit the target      only 8 out of 100 shots. Although the corps is upgrading the      Dragon with a new warhead and sight, it will be years before      the new weapons are in the hands of troops.       Moreover, the new warhead adds 2\1/2\ pounds to the      missile's weight, which skeptics claim will reduce the      Dragon's range. The first block of ``improved'' missiles may      be less accurate, because the pulse rockets used for guidance      corrections will be used up faster to counteract the added      weight.       Maj. Gen. Ray Franklin, in charge of the Dragon improvement      project, claims initial warhead tests are ``very      impressive.'' He's hoping to field 15,000 new missiles for      $60 million.       Other experts aren't so sure.       ``They're getting super performance from prototype      warheads,'' says an ammunition expert, ``and they're having      nothing but problems trying to produce them in quantity.''       He believes the Dragon costs ``are going to go out of      sight'' even if the production problems are solved, and      Franklin won't get nearly what he hopes for the money.       If Marines on the ground aren't equipped to kill tanks,      they'll need air support to do the job.       At enormous expense--$5 billion--the Marines have equipped      five squadrons with British-designed AV-8B Harrier close air      support jets. The Harrier doesn't have the right weapon for      killing tanks, say a number of weapons experts familiar with      its performance in live-fire tests.       The Harrier's 25 mm. cannon was tested extensively against      tanks at Nellis Air Force Base in 1979. In 24 passes, the      Harrier fired hundreds of shells, getting plenty of hits but      not a single kill. Reportedly all but seven of the shells      bounced off the tanks' armor. Test reports reveal the Air      Force's 30 mm. cannon did much better, killing tanks in 60      percent of the firing passes.       Tom Amlie, a Pentagon weapons expert, says the Harrier's 25      mm. gun ``is too heavy for light work [shooting up trucks],      and it's     too light for the heavy work of killing tanks.''       It may be suicidal for Harrier pilots to press their      attacks to gun range, anyway. There isn't an ounce of armor      on the Harrier, and its engine is wrapped in fuel tanks. A      Naval Air Systems Command briefing reveals the Harrier is 10      times more vulnerable to ground fire, given a hit, than the      Marines' F-18 fighter, and 20 times more vulnerable than the      Navy's A-7 attack jet.       Instead of flying Harriers into the teeth of the thousands      of automatic weapons found in a Soviet motorized rifle      division, the preferred method is to employ so-called      ``standoff'' weapons. These are missiles or bombs that can be      guided to their targets from outside the range of enemy      weapons.       ``That's why they're ga-ga for laser-guided Maverick      missiles,'' concludes E.C. Myers, former director of air      warfare in the Pentagon.       The Maverick is tricky to use against tanks, however. Of      100 Harrier test runs against tank targets in 1985, the      Center for Naval Analysis found the pilots were successful in      finding, locking-on and firing only 6 percent of the time.       The Marines could use their F-18 fighters armed with      Rockeye cluster bombs against tanks. Because the Rockeye      spreads bomblets over a wide area, it cannot be employed      close to front-line marines. Even so, it is not a very      effective weapon. Defense Department munitions effectiveness      manuals indicate that four Rockeyes have less than 50 percent      chance of killing one tank.       The real Marine Corps, it seems, is ill-equipped, both on      the ground and in the air, to defeat massed tank attacks. And      this kind of attack is the Sunday punch of the Soviet army      and Third World armies equipped with Soviet weapons.       ``We're not pleased with what we have for air work against      tanks,'' admits Maj. Gen. Charles Pitman, the assistant chief      of Marine aviation. He hopes improved Mavericks will solve      the problem.       Perhaps the biggest problem is whether the country can      afford the Marines' ambitious plans for the future.       The Marines are touting a new landing concept.       ``We have to come from over the horizon,'' says Gen. Gray,      to avoid exposing the amphibious fleet to shore-based      antiship missiles.       But new equipment is needed to carry troops and equipment      the greater distance to the beach. One is a hovercraft called      LCAC (for Landing Craft Air Cushion,) which can ``fly'' over      underwater and beach obstacles.       The Marines also say they need a new kind of aircraft      called the MV-22 tilt-rotor. The MV-22 will take off like a      helicopter and fly like an airplane, tilting its engines to      again land like a helicopter. The new tilt-rotor would be      used land marines as far as 25 miles inland.       Freed of traditional beach landing restrictions, the      Marines say they can threaten a much wider coastline. The      enemy commander, accordingly, will be forced to choose      between spreading his forces or leaving large areas      undefended.       The Marines plan to exploit either choice by punching      through a weak and overextended cordon defense, or by landing      at undefended spots to quickly build up forces ashore, before      the enemy can move and counterattack.       ``If we're going to land where the enemy isn't,'' observes      one colonel who's skeptical of the new concept, ``why bother      staying way offshore, over the horizon? We have enough      trouble landing at the right spot from 4,000 yards      offshore.''       ``For the actual landing,'' he says, ``we've moved the      mother ships from 4,000 yards offshore to 25 miles. We've      increased the distance more than 12 times, but the hovercraft      is only 5 times faster. We're worse off.''       The speed advantage of the tilt rotor over current      helicopters may be illusory, too. Three out of four tilt-     rotor helicopters making the 50-mile trip from ship to inland      landing zones will be toting loads that are too big and heavy      to be carried inside. They'll be slung underneath, and some      pilots say these ``external'' loads will reduce the tilt-     rotor's speed further.       The experimental tilt-rotor now flying has never carried an      external load.       Ultimately, the marines must use beaches accessible by      conventional landing boats anyway. The new hovercraft and      tilt-rotor aircraft will carry ashore only 12 percent of the      troops, 6 percent of the vehicles and two-tenths of 1 percent      of the ammunition and supplies. Everything else will have to      be moved ashore in conventional landing craft, which will be      restricted to the 17 percent of the world's coastlines where      the water and beach conditions are suitable.       ``The enemy will know the entry points on his own coastline      that lead to meaningful objectives,'' says a former Defense      Department official who questions the new landing concept.      ``That's where he's going to defend, and that's the ground      the marines will have to take.''       ``We delude ourselves by retaining the `assault' label,''      says Col. Gordon Batchellor, a highly regarded tactician,      ``as we quietly build a scenario where movement, but no      assault, occurs.''       This force structure, he maintains, ``will be useless when      a true assault is called for.''       The new landing concept is expensive. Each air-cushioned      hovercraft costs $20 million and can carry a single 70-ton      tank ashore. For the same money, the Navy could buy four      heavy ``utility'' size landing craft, called LCUs, each of      which carries 175 tons.       A study by the House Armed Services Committee concluded the      tilt-rotor aircraft will cost more than $35 million apiece;      the CH-53E helicopter, which can carry twice the payload,      costs $16 million. The extra speed and range being built into      the tilt-rotor make up $15 billion of the total $25 billion      cost of this program.       The Marines are buying into a number of hugely expensive      and technically risky programs like the tilt-rotor. With      these systems, they can range up and down enemy coastlines,      jabbing here and there, but the Marines may well be giving up      the capability to deliver the body blows of serious war      fighting.       Gen. George Patton, no stranger to amphibious operations,      once said: ``A sparrow can outmaneuver an eagle, but he is      not feared. Speed and mobility not linked with fighting      capacity are valueless. Wars are won by killing.''       Yet it seems the sparrow is the Marine Corps look for the      future.       This situation may be perfect for Al Gray. After all, the      warrior is the man of bold decision in the face of adversity,      and Gray, as ``peacetime warrior,'' is facing monumental      problems. His budget is a fiscal Mt. St. Helens, unable to      contain the explosive pressures of bills now coming due for      costly programs started years ago.       ``I don't believe in watering down our requirements,'' he      says, but he's also sending out strong signals that some      requirements may be revised. ``We're going to look from the      bottom up,'' he says, at the entire Marine Corps, ``starting      with platoons and companies.''       Gray plans to fill the units with people from the bottom      up, too. If the Marines fill their need for officers and      troops before they get to their big headquarters in      Washington, he grins, ``that might be a blessing in      disguise.''       He wants to move with breath-taking speed, bringing all the      infantry battalions up to full strength by next summer,      adding a fourth rifle company to each battalion as well.      Those two actions will put almost 6,000 infantrymen back into      the cutting edge.       ``We're going back to everybody being an infantryman,      too,'' Gray promises. And he wants extra combat training for      all marines, regardless of speciality. ``The way we used to      do it,'' he adds.       What else can he do? A number of civilian experts and      Marine officers concerned about the future of the corps      suggest a few basic actions.       Eliminating unnecessary staffs is near the top of the list.      More than half of them are not needed under the most      demanding Pentagon plan for the Marine Corps, which calls for      the simultaneous employment of an amphibious force and four      brigades. Those commitments require only 13 of the 29      regimental and higher-level staffs the Marines now have,      leaving 16 of them unemployed.       At one stroke, Gray could cut the headquarters overhead by      55 percent, saving millions of dollars in manpower costs that      could be applied elsewhere.       With a quick trip to Europe, Gray can get the weapons that      marine infantrymen need to kill tanks. European antitank      weapons are generally heavier than their American      equivalents, largely because they have bigger warheads. The      West Europeans, who live much closer to those 50,000 Soviet      tanks, build weapons to kill them.       The Marines don't have to wait years for an improved      Dragon, which still exists largely as a ``paper'' design. The      West German Panzerfaust III and the French Apilas, two      shoulder-launched rockets now in production, are good for      short-range work. For longer-range antitank engagements, the      Milan missile, combat-proven in Chad, is available.       The Marines could buy 30 mm. gun pods to strap onto their      close support aircraft.       ``The gun is the only way to kill tanks in close,'' says      Rep. Denny Smith (R., Ore.), who is prepared to help Gray get      the pods. They're cheap at roughly $300,000 each.       For the price of half the Maverick missiles the Marines      want to buy, they could buy 30 mm. gun pods for every jet      aircraft in the corps. And they'd still have three times the      800 Mavericks they now possess.       Among the corps' friends and critics, there is a nearly      universal belief that the Marines have lost focus. Instead of      concentrating on the basics, says Smith, ``they're trying to      capture hardware programs for a bigger budget share.''       A number of Pentagon officials, who prefer to remain      anonymous, echo those sentiments, citing the ``over-the-     horizon'' landing concept as little more than a technical      scenario for justifying expensive new programs like the      hovercraft and the tilt-rotor.       The concept that epitomizes what may be the most important      problem Gray inherits: the pervasive failure to separate      tactical needs from technical wants.       Tactically, the Marines needed a close air support      aircraft. Technically, they lusted for the Harrier, a jet      that could take off and land vertically. Now, they've got the      most vulnerable close air support airplane in the world.       Tactically, the Marines needed lots of landing craft to get      to the beach. Technically, they coveted the air-cushion      hovercraft, which is quite literally a ``helicopter with the      roof off.'' Now they've sacrificed the build-up rate ashore.       Gray appears to be sensitive to these problems. While he      remains outwardly committed to the Harrier and the tilt-rotor      program, he worries about the pervasive fascination at the      staff level with ``programmatic forces'' instead of real      ``fighting forces.''       However, Gray is also sending out mixed signals to the      working level marines who have to translate his reformist      zeal into detailed plans and budgets. For example, he wants      to buy an assault gun, a form of light tank, which resurrects      a weapon that failed miserably in World War II.       When the Marines start sorting out their must-have tactical      needs from nice-to-have technical wants, they're likely to      discover a lot they can do without.       They just might figure out a way to produce a Marine Corps      the country can afford.       If Gray is successful in making the real, the heavy and      expensive corps more like the lean, tough, deployable Marine      Corps of myth, the Marines will be restored to what he calls      ``real preparedness.''       ``Anybody can have a bag full of numbers to look good,'' he      says. ``We're going to make sure we have the right people and      organizations for combat.
