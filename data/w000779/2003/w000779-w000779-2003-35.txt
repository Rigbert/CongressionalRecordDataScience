President, maintaining and improving this country's airports and aviation infrastructure is crucial to economic growth and opportunity at both the local and national levels. That is why it is so unfortunate that Congress has not yet been able to pass the Federal Aviation Administration reauthorization legislation.  The fact is, this legislation need not have been controversial. But it was made controversial, because conferees went behind closed doors and made changes that contravene the clearly expressed will of both houses of Congress.  My point today is not to rehash the substantive arguments on the points under dispute. I simply want to stress that in no event should this dispute be allowed to bring important airport and aviation projects screeching to a halt. Instead, the responsible path is to recognize that the controversial elements of the legislation may take some time to resolve. In the meantime, both sides should agree to a short-term extension of FAA funding programs, so that no aviation project is held hostage to politics.  Senator Rockefeller has introduced a bill to provide for a 6-month extension of FAA funding programs, and I am signing on as a cosponsor. I hope that our colleagues will join in supporting this legislation, to ensure thatfunding for local airports projects will not become a victim of political brinksmanship.                          ____________________
