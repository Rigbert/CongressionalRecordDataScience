Chairman, in closing, let me say honestly that I think this issue is of such magnitude that we really ought to work together. We have missed an opportunity to do that. I hope in the future we will be able to do so.  I think the gentleman's experience, matched with the experience of the gentleman from Louisiana (Mr. Tauzin) and the Members on both sides of the aisle can come up with an energy policy of which we can all be proud. I feel we have not done that this day, and I think we have lost an opportunity.
