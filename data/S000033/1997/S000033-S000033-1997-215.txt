 Speaker, today I would like to salute two outstanding young women who are being presented with the Girl Scout Gold Award by the Vermont Girl Scout Council. They are Lori Brown of Rutland, VT and Kathleen Lomedico of Colchester, VT. They were honored on May 29, 1997 for earning the highest achievement award in U.S. Girl Scouting.  The Girl Scout Gold Award symbolizes outstanding accomplishments in the areas of leadership, community service, career planning and personal development. The award can be earned by girls aged 14 to 17, or in grades 9 to 12. To receive the award, these Girl Scouts first earned four interest project patches, the Career Exploration Pin, the Senior Girl Scout Leadership Award and the Senior Girl Scout Challenge as well as designing and implementing a Girl Scout Gold Award project to meet a special need in their communities.  As a member of the Vermont Girl Scout Council, Lori Brown first earned badges in child care, reading, music, games, well being,and understanding yourself and others. She then used these skills to design and implement a series of Lenten workshops for the young children in her parish church. Kathleen Lomedico earned badges in artistic crafts and career exploration among others. After learning leadership skills through Girl Scouting, she served as the editor of her high school yearbook. As her Girl Scout Gold Award project she spent the past year organizing and leading a youth group for teens which meets every other week and a youth band which plays every Sunday night for her parish church. Ms. Lomedico wanted the young people in her parish to ``feel a sense of home in the church.'' Both girls used skills they learned in Girl Scouting to help the church of their faith.  These two Senior Girl Scouts have earned my respect and admiration. I believe both girls should receive the public recognition due them for such significant services to their communities and their country.                          ____________________
