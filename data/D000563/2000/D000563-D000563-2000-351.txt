President, in the time that remains in morning business, which I will share with my colleague from California, we will address several of the issues which still remain before this session of Congress. Many of us are just returning from a Memorial Day break which we spent with our families back in our States, trying to acquaint ourselves with the concerns of people and the concerns about issues we face here in Washington.  One of the concerns in the State of Illinois and in the city of Chicago continues to be gun violence. This is still a phenomenon which is almost uniquely American and which is tragic in its proportion. To think we lose 12 or 13 children every day to gun violence, that is a sad reminder of what happened at Columbine High School in Littleton, CO, a little over a year ago, when some 13 students were killed at that school. It is merely one instance of a situation which repeats itself every single day.  It has been more than a year since that tragedy, but still this Congress refuses to act on sensible gun safety legislation. I remind those who are following this debate, the proposal for this gun safety legislation is hardly radical. If people are going to buy a gun from a gun dealer in America, they are subjected to a background check. We want to know if they are criminals. We want to know if they have a history of violent crime or violent mental illness or if they are too young to buy a gun--basic questions. I understand that, as of last year, over 250,000 would-be purchasers of guns were denied that opportunity as a result of a simple background check.  Did they turn around and buy a gun on the street? It is possible. But we should not make it easy for them. It should not be automatic. In fact, I hope in many instances, having been denied at a gun dealer, they could not find a gun nor should they have been able to. We believe applying the same standard of gun safety legislation to gun shows just makes common sense.  So that is part of the gun safety legislation we passed in the Senate by a vote of 49-49, and a tie-breaking vote was cast by Vice President Al Gore. That bill left the Senate over 8 months ago, went over to the House of Representatives where it was emasculated by the gun lobby, where the National Rifle Association would not accept the basic idea that we should check on the backgrounds of people who buy guns at gun shows.  The National Rifle Association believes those who go into gun shows should be able to buy a gun with no questions asked. That is just fundamentally unfair and ignorant. That position prevailed in the House of Representatives. The matter went to a conference committee where it has languished ever since.  Since Columbine High School, thousands of Americans have been killed by gunfire. Until we act, Democrats in the Senate will, each day, read the names of some, just some, who lost their lives to gun violence in the past year and will continue to do so every day the Senate is in session.  In the names of those who died, we will continue this fight, and in the names of their families who still grieve their losses, we will continue to remember these victims of gun violence.  Following are the names of some of the people who were killed by gunfire 1 year ago today, on June 6, 1999, at a time after the Senate passed gun safety legislation:  Earnest Barnes, 38, Atlanta, GA; Quentin A. Brown, 29, Chicago, IL; Dexter J. Caruthers, 46, Gary, IN; George Cook, 19, Minneapolis, MN; Don Ferguson, 80, Oakland, CA; Juan J. Gonzales, 28, Oklahoma City, OK; Mark S.
