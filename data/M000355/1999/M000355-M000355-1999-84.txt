 I am not prepared to withdraw that yet, as Senator McCain indicated that that could be displaced, in any event, by some substitute, which the Senator from Nevada has already offered. I reject the notion that there is some devious notion at work. Besides, I don't even want to get into that. The only issue before us, I say to the Senator from Nevada, is whether or not we can get consent to have some other Senators take advantage --we have had all this discussion about having an open debate on campaign finance reform. We can't even get amendments laid down for discussion. We are not talking about controversial amendments, I don't think. People do have the option to vote against them.
