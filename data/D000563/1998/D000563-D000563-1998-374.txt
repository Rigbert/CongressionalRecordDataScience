I have warm feelings about Wisconsin, as a southern neighbor in the State of Illinois.  I am happy to report that of my three children, one is a graduate of Marquette, my son; my daughter is a graduate of the University of Wisconsin at Madison; and our third child married a young man from Janesville, the Senator's hometown, so we have our bases covered in Wisconsin.  That does not suggest I will be rooting for the Packers when they play the Bears, but I thank the Senator for his comments on behalf of his great State.
