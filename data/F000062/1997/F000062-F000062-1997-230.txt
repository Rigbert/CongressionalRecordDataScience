 President, I rise today to pay tribute to a trusted colleague and dedicated public servant, Chuck Stevens. During his three-and-a-half-year tenure as the United States Attorney for the Eastern District of California, he compiled an undeniably strong record. However, what may be most impressive about Chuck is his self-effacing demeanor in a position that often requires being pushed into the limelight.  Chuck Stevens' career exemplifies the kind of integrity, dedication and skills essential for anyone who seeks to be an effective public servant. His success at the helm of the Eastern District in California so early in his career undoubtedly will be followed by great accomplishments in the future.  A native of Cranford, NJ, Mr. Stevens moved to California to study law at the University of California, Berkeley where he graduated in 1982. Prior to his current position, he worked as a litigator in complex cases in the private sector and as an Assistant United States Attorney.  Mr. Stevens returned to public service when he was appointed by President Clinton in November 1993 to be the United States Attorney for the Eastern District of California. I had the honor of recommending Mr. Stevens to the President for appointment.  Since then, Chuck has succeeded in prosecuting a multitude of crimes--from hate crimes to political corruption to halting health care fraud--with distinction and diligence. He was also appointed by United States Attorney General Reno to serve on her advisory committee representing United States Attorneys across the nation.  The Sacramento-based Eastern District of California is the tenth largest of the Nation's 94 Federal judicial districts. It covers 34 counties with 6 million residents scattered across 87,000 square miles from Oregon to Los Angeles and Nevada to the coastal range.  Members of the legal community and Federal investigative agents give Mr. Stevens universally high marks for his job performance. He is credited with having ``no ego about himself and his work, unlike most lawyers,'' according to Sacramento based Federal Defender Quin Denvir. As anyone who has worked with Chuck knows, his work speaks for itself.  Recently, Mr. Stevens' office has handled the weighty responsibility of trying the Unabomber case for incidents that occurred in California. Due to Mr. Stevens' leadership, Sacramento was considered as a site for the Federal trial against Ted Kacyzinski. It comes as no surprise that this case has been handled without fanfare, but with the utmost professionalism Mr. Stevens is known for.  Chuck has always been ready and able to provide valuable advice on some of the State's most troubling problems. He is one of the most practical problem solvers in the criminal justice system.  Chuck leaves the United States Attorney's office to form his own law firm in California's capitol with his predecessor, former United States Attorney George O'Connell. I am sure this formidable pair will quickly make its mark in the Sacramento legal community.  Congratulations, Chuck, on the great opportunities that lie ahead and thank you for your outstanding public service to the people of this State and this Nation.                          ____________________
