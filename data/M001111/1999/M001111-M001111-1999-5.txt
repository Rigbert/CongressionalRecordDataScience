 MURRAY. Mr. President, today I introduce legislation on another topic I will be discussing with Chairman Jeffords as we move forward with reauthorization of the Elementary and Secondary Education Act in the Senate Health, Education, Labor, and Pensions Committee.  I am introducing legislation today to fund an innovative book distributionprogram targeted at giving low-income students their own ``first book.''  The ``First Book'' program is a non-profit private organization that has been tremendously successful gathering and distibuting new children's books to needy children throughout the nation. Key to the success of ``First Book'' are local boards called ``First Book Local Advisory Boards.'' Under my legislation, which would provide $5 million a year federal investment to such boards, will help them leverage millions more in funds from other sources. ``First Book'' has been successful because it is locally-driven, and reflects private industry initiative. ``First Book'' provides new books, which the program purchases from publishers at discount rates, to disadvantaged children and families primarily through tutoring, mentoring, and family literacy programs.  This bill builds on successful efforts underway in communities across the country. It takes what has been a successful but very targeted program, and will increase its reach and effect into many more American communities. ``First Book'' makes a very real difference for disadvantaged children and their families, and with this investment, it will make a difference for thousands more.                                 ______                                       By
