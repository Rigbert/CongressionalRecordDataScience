Speaker, there is one exception to free trade. People have to realize who runs this administration. There is one exception to free trade, and it is for the first time in a trade agreement with Australia. It is a prohibition on the importation or the reimportation of FDA-approved, U.S.-manufactured pharmaceuticals from Australia, not because they are unsafe like the phony baloney they are giving us about Canada, but because they are cheaper there. That is in the trade agreement. What is that doing in the trade agreement if this is not all about big business and multinational corporations? It is not about making things cheaper for American consumers. If it was, why did President Bush insist on prohibiting the reimportation of FDA-approved, U.S.-manufactured drugs from Australia at half the price? It is not about making things less expensive and benefiting our consumers and our society. It is all about benefiting a very privileged few.
