 President, I present this amendment on behalf of Senator Kyl, Senator Boxer, and myself. It is a very simple amendment. It maintains a provision from the 2008 farm bill that sets aside $37.5 million for air quality improvement projects.  This program has been used to replace old diesel tractor engines with newer, cleaner ones. This improves efficiency for the farmer and air quality in the region. It has helped thousands of farmers comply with EPA, State, and local air quality regulations.  In California's Central Valley, we have some of the poorest air quality in the country. It is an EPA extreme nonattainment zone, and the EPA and the State have set very strict standards for emissions.  This funding has achieved the equivalent of removing more than 408,000 cars from California highways in the last 5 years. I urge its passage.
