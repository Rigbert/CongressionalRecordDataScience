 Mr. DeLAY. Mr. Speaker, I do not believe there has been any discussion as to what kind of rule we would bring to the floor in order to bring the medical justice bill to the floor.  In the past, we have always, on this kind of legislation, allowed the minority to have a substitute. The chairman of the Committee on Rules obviously, along with the Committee on Rules, will consider amendments that other Members may offer, and as the gentleman well knows, the rule will be written sometime next week, so that we can bring the bill to the floor.
