Chairman, I thank the gentleman from Florida. I appreciate the fact that the committee will delve more deeply into this issue.  Mr. Chairman, I believe the GAO report is a road map talking about perhaps a unified use, a unified command of all of the OSA, operations support aircraft fleet, perhaps under the Air Force and one of the other services. We could meet all of the legitimate travel needs, particularly the urgent travel needs of the Command and Control staff at the Pentagon, and the Uniformed Services for a lot less than we are spending today, and we would avoid embarrassments such as the unfortunate general and his cat who flew back from Italy at a rather extravagant cost.
