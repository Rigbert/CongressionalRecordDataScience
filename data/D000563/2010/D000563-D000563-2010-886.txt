It does two things. First, it requires legal permanent residents in the United States to produce documentary proof of their legality. We tried this under Medicaid and found out that many people in our country, the elderly and others, found it difficult to produce documentation though they were clearly eligible and clearly legal and entitled to basic assistance.  Instead, our bill that we passed, health care reform, verifies that a person is legal by declaration of their Social Security number, which is verified. So we go through a good process here to make sure only those eligible will receive, and, secondly, what Senator Sessions' amendment does, is say to legal permanent residents paying taxes, they cannot use the Tax Code like other citizens for deductions and credits for 5 years.
