Speaker, let us stand up for this institution. Let us stand up for regular order. Let us stand up for not ducking the tough issues. Let us reject this rule, and then let us go back to regular order and hopefully do so in a bipartisan way and do what the American public expects us to do:make tough decisions for them, for our country, for our security, and for our children.  I urge my colleagues to vote against this rule.
