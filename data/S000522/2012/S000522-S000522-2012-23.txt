Mr. Speaker, I would like to thank Chairman Franks for introducing the Prenatal Nondiscrimination Act, also called PRENDA. This legislation prohibits abortions based on the sex of the unborn child.  The bill also prohibits the solicitation or acceptance of funds for such purposes and prohibits the federal funding of abortions based on sex.  As the New York Times has reported, ``There is evidence that some Americans want to choose their babies' sex'' through abortions.  U.S. Census numbers and national vital statistics show that certain communities achieve unnatural sex ratios at birth that are statistically impossible without medically assisted sex-selection, with the cheapest option being abortion.  These sex-selection abortions discriminate strongly against females and are overwhelmingly opposed by the American people. According to a recent Charlotte Lozier Institute poll, 77% of those surveyed support a law that bans abortion in cases where ``the fact that the developing baby is a girl is the sole reason for seeking an abortion.''  Regardless of one's views on abortion generally, everyone should be able to agree that no abortions should occur based on the sex of the unborn child.  It is time to end the practice of using sex as an excuse for abortion. I thank Chairman Franks again for his leadership on this issue.
