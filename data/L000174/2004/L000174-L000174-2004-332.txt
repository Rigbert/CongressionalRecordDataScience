President, government transparency is fundamental to democracy. This well-known truism is a staple of every sermon about democracy. We sometimes take it for granted, but we shouldn't--especially today. For one thing, the world is watching if and how we practice what we preach. For another, during this most partisan of political times, it is essential that citizens be able to judge us not only on what we say, but on what we do.  Therefore, I am particularly pleased to join today with Senators Corzine, Cornyn, Feingold, Bingaman and Lieberman to submit a resolution that will provide citizens with expanded and more easily accessible information about legislation and the legislative process.  In particular, we are calling on the Library of Congress to improve its public website, called ``THOMAS,'' in order to provide as much legislative information as is reasonably practical. In addition, because Internet technology continues to advance so rapidly, we are asking the Library to maintain THOMAS in a manner that reflects current standards of accessibility and usability.  In December of 2003, together with Senator Corzine and others, I wrote to Dr. James Billington, the Librarian of Congress, and asked him to redesign THOMAS to provide, as much as possible, information to the general public that is already available to congressional staff through the congressional Legislative Information System. Dr. Billington and his staff agreed to work with us to improve THOMAS, and the resolution we introduce today is a result of this constructive process. I would like to thank Dr. Billington and his staff for their cooperation and their appreciation of the importance of this effort.  The Library of Congress has a well-known and well-deserved reputation as a source of reliable, unbiased, and comprehensive information. Our resolution will harness the power of the Information Age to allow citizens to see more public records of the Senate in their official form, in context, and without editorial comment.  The taxpayers of this country, who pay millions of dollars a year to fund the Library of Congress, as well as to fund Congress itself, deserve speedy access to this public information. They have a right to see that their money is being spent well. As Thomas Jefferson wrote, ``Information is the currency of democracy.''                                 ______                                 SENATE RESOLUTION 361--SUPPORTING THE GOALS OF NATIONAL MARINA DAY AND URGING MARINAS TO CONTINUE PROVIDING ENVIRONMENTALLY FRIENDLY GATEWAYS                                TO BOATING
