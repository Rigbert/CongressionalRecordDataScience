Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.  Mr. Speaker, I rise in very strong support of the Sudan Peace Act, and I want to especially thank the gentleman from Colorado (Mr. Tancredo) for introducing this very worthwhile legislation.  This bill represents an important cause with strong bipartisan backing. I am particularly grateful to the original cosponsors that include the gentleman from Illinois (Mr. Hyde), the gentleman from California (Mr. Royce), the gentleman from New Jersey (Mr. Payne), the gentleman from Alabama (Mr. Bachus), the gentleman from California (Mr. Lantos), the gentleman from Illinois (Mr. Pence), the gentlewoman from Florida (Ms. Ros-Lehtinen), who chairs the Subcommittee on International Operations and Human Rights, the gentlewoman from California (Ms. Lee), the gentleman from Pennsylvania (Mr. Fattah), the gentleman from Texas (Mr. Armey), and I myself am one of co-sponsors as well.  Mr. Speaker, the nation of Sudan is located in the far eastern corner of Africa. The National Islamic Front is the governing power, albeit a brutal dictatorship, in Sudan's capital city of Khartoum.  In November of 2001, President Bush renewed U.S. bilateral sanctions on the government of Sudan. According to the State Department, the Government of Sudan remains a designated state-sponsor of terrorist organizations around the world today. This government is an Islamic extremist government that has dedicated itself and its regime to manifesting a jihad, or holy war, even against its own citizens.  The war struggles in the southern part of that country have touched the hearts of many Americans in a nationwide grassroots effort to raise awareness about the suffering in Sudan. The Human Rights Caucus, the Congressional Black Caucus, the Church Alliance of a New Sudan, the Holocaust Museum's Committee on Conscience, the Commission on International Religious Freedom, and the NAACP areamong the countless individuals and organizations across this country who give this cause the profile and attention that it deserves.  Sudan civil war, Mr. Speaker, has been waged in the south for more than 4 decades. More than 2 million people have been killed, men, women, and children, to war-related causes and to famine. Four million people have been forced from their homes into temporary shelters. The conflict is Africa's oldest war, born from such complex causes as religion, ethnicity, national identity, and economic disparity.  Religion is a major factor because of the Islamic fundamentalist regimes and agenda of the current government, dominated by mostly Muslims from the Arab north. The National Islamic Fronts Government's practice of holy war is reflected in attacks on civilians in the south. Southerners who are Christian and animist reject the Islamization of their country and favor a secular government that respects fundamental religious freedoms.  Widespread institutionalization of the holy war has resulted in the practice of slavery and the mass dislocation of people in the south. I would just note parenthetically back in 1995, I chaired the first hearing ever on slavery in the Sudan, and at the time we were met with a number of skeptics and disbelievers who did not believe that shadow slavery continued to this day.  Captured slaves are reportedly forced to attended Koranic schools, and we heard that at that hearing then and it continues to this day. They need to change their names as part of this dehumanizing process. They are indoctrinated at times to fight against their own people. Harsh beatings and torture are a reality.  Some of the witnesses we heard of including mothers who saw their sons literally stolen from them, kidnapped and forced into slavery, their daughters as well. It was a horrifying hearing, and we heard about these cases year in and year out as we tried to bring attention to this horrible practice of slavery.  Mr. Speaker, the Government of Sudan has one of the worst human rights records in the world. The United States has repeatedly condemned the government of Khartoum for its abhorrent violations of human rights. According to the 2001 State Department Human Rights Report, there were accounts that during raids on civilian settlements, government allied militias abducted persons, particularly women and children. According to the 2002 ``Country Reports on Human Rights Practices,'' children from Christian and other non-Muslim families have been captured, enslaved, and forced to convert to Islam.  Some people in government-controlled peace camps for the internally displaced persons, IDD, were reportedly subjected to forced labor and at times pressured to convert to Islam.  The Sudanese Government has increased oil mining in areas inhabited by the southern Sudanese, thereby forcibly displacing the people to finance a more lethal and offensive war. I would point out to my colleagues that oil has been facilitating this war, and we have got to be very clear that any way that we help or enable the production of oil in the Sudan means that more innocent people will lose their lives.  Mr. Speaker, I would point out to my colleagues, as well, that Talisman Oil, and there has been a nationwide campaign, I am happy to say, about this, to divest State pensions and other pensions from the holdings of this company, a Canadian company which again has helped to facilitate this horrific war in Sudan.  My own State of New Jersey, to its credit, divested itself from many, many shares of Talisman Oil that it owned; and thankfully other States and municipalities and governments have followed suit.  Mr. Speaker, the Government of Sudan has continued to manipulate to its everlasting shame humanitarian relief efforts of the United Nations-led Operation Lifeline Sudan. In the past 14 years and as recently as September 27 of this year, the regime of the National Islamic Front has imposed flight bans on emergency humanitarian aid to starving civilians. In other words, by having that veto power, they have ensured that more innocent people have died a cruel death from starvation or from lack of medicines.  Many nations, Mr. Speaker, have tried and failed to end this civil war in Sudan. In 1994 heads of state from the frontline states of Ethiopia, Kenya, Eritrea, and Uganda formed a mediation committee under the auspices of the Inter-Governmental Authority for Development. This committee established the Declaration of Principles governing the peace process since 1994. The continuing contrast between word and deed underlines the importance of today's consideration of the Sudan Peace Act. The aerial bombing of civilian targets continues to this day.  The Government of Sudan continues to abandon the peace process at critical stages. As recently as July 2002, the Government of Sudan reached a peace agreement with the opposition forces, known as the Sudan People's Liberation Movement, in Kenya. The United States and its European allies worked with IDAG countries to mediate the agreement. On September 1 of this year, the Government of Sudan abandoned the agreement.  Mr. Speaker, I strongly urge my colleagues of both parties to support this important measure.                              {time}  1630  The Sudan Peace Act condemns the violation of human rights on both sides and denounces the government of Sudan for using food as a weapon of war. It recognizes the important interests of the United States in remaining a key player in the peace settlement among the warring parties. Secretary Powell has described Sudan as the tragedy that would command his full attention, and he has tried his best in this effort.  The bill establishes clear policy guidelines in support of the peace process by directing the U.S. to use all means to pressure and to force the government of Sudan to negotiate in good faith and to use all diplomatic and economic sanctions to further this goal.  The measure directs the President to develop a contingency plan for relief delivery if the government of Sudan imposes further bans on Operation Lifeline Sudan and to their relief transports. It provides the President with authority to reprogram all of the OLS designated funds, if necessary.  The bill authorizes $100 million in humanitarian assistance for each fiscal year of 2003, 2004 and 2005 to prepare the populations in opposition-controlled areas of Sudan for peace and democratic governance.  In sum, the Sudan Peace Act will give the administration some guidance in the peace efforts while leaving enough flexibility to lead the foreign affairs of the nation.  Mr. Speaker, the manager's amendment contains a few modifications, including an emphasis in the findings that credible civil authority institutions play an important role in the reconstruction of postwar Sudan and then a few other minor changes in the text of the bill.  Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.
