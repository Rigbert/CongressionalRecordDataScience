President, I salute the Senator from Oklahoma. We have been in Iraq for over 3 years. We have been asking for investigations of these no-bid contracts to these large companies. We have to have Congress accept its responsibility with oversight hearings. More oversight hearings have been held by party caucuses in the Senate than by actual committees looking at these same companies we think are profiteering and ripping off taxpayers.  Congress has a responsibility, too, not just the Department of Defense. We have a responsibility in the Senate. We ought to bring this message to both of our caucuses and say, When are we going to have oversight hearings on those contracting with the Pentagon and making millions of dollars and not making us stronger as a nation?  I salute the Senator from Oklahoma. It is a delicate subject. He has the courage to bring it before us.                                  Iraq
