 President, today the Senate will vote on two nominees charged with important responsibilities in the enforcement of our Nation's intellectual property laws.  The first is Daniel Marti, who is nominated to become Intellectual Property Enforcement Coordinator in the Executive Office of the President.  The second is Michelle Lee, who is nominated to become the next Under Secretary of Commerce for Intellectual Property and Director of the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office.  The United States is a world leader in the innovation of cutting-edge technologies and products that improve our daily lives. Importantly, the United States' economy, indeed every industry, relies heavily on intellectual property.  Because intellectual property rights are critical to the Nation's economic well-being, we need strong and capable leaders at the helm of the offices that deal with patents, trademarks and copyrights. And because the top positions at the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office and the Office of the Intellectual Property Enforcement Coordinator have been vacant for quite some time, I am pleased that we are able to fill them today with two highly qualified candidates.  Mr. Marti and Ms. Lee have proven track records in the field of intellectual property law and are well respected by the intellectual property community.  Their experience and expertise are of the caliber required for their respective positions. I believe they are excellent candidates for these positions, and I will support their nominations.                        Vote On Marti Nomination  The question now occurs on the Marti nomination.
