Mr. Speaker, the world was shocked as 276 schoolgirls from the northeastern Nigerian town of Chibok were kidnapped by the Islamic militant group Boko Haram. In the days following this event, we learned that the military had four hours' warning of the attack, but failed to mobilize sufficient forces to fight off the attackers, who arrived at this predominantly Christian town in a convoy of vehicles. A military redeployment to find the girls two weeks later resulted in the massacre of at least 300 residents of the town of Gamboru Ngala.   Since that time, the previous Nigerian Government made many announcements about freeing the kidnapped girls, none of which proved to be accurate. Hope had been raised last October by a government announcement of a cease-fire and release of the girls only to be dashed by increasing Boko Haram attacks and the continued captivity of the Chibok girls. In fact, Boko Haram kidnapped more girls in northeastern Nigeria, especially Christian girls.   President Muhamadu Buhari has said he won't make promises about freeing these captives that he can't guarantee, but I expect he will make every effort to free the Chibok girls, as well as the many others taken by Boko Haram.   I have met previously with young women who have escaped from Boko Haram, in Jos and Abuja, Nigeria, and here in the United States. They confirm the abuse of their sisters and mourn their loss as we do. I want to thank Emmanuel Ogebe for all his help in arranging these meetings and the programs allowing some of these young women to come to the United States for an education. An estimated 10,000 other Nigerian youth are prevented from being educated because of disruptions caused by Boko Haram.   My subcommittee has held several hearings on Boko Haram and convinced the administration to declare Boko Haram a Foreign Terrorist Organization, which they announced at our November 13, 2013, hearing.   I have since pressed the administration to use authorities under the FTO designation to investigate and identify for the Nigerian Government those who support Boko Haram. I also have worked to end the current roadblocks preventing U.S. counterterrorism training for Nigerian troops.   During the past year, social media worldwide has exploded with the ``Bring Back Our Girls'' campaign. I must compliment my colleague, Congresswoman Frederica Wilson, who has maintained her efforts to free the Chibok girls and all the others kidnapped by Boko Haram, while others have moved on to different issues.   I have worked with Congresswoman Wilson to update her House Resolution 147, which focuses on bringing to an end the violence unleashed by Boko Haram and bringing material aid to those harmed by their attacks. We also have joined in this legislation to press initiatives I mentioned earlier. I hope my subcommittee and our committee can move this legislation to the floor soon to give a boost to U.S. efforts to help Nigeria end the reign of terror by Boko Haram.                          ____________________
