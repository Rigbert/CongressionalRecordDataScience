More than half the taxpayers claiming the State and local deduction make less than $100,000. These hard-working, middle-class folks are not going to appreciate Congress double-taxing them.  The fact is, the Capito amendment is Washington lingo that would produce a Republican tax plan that hits the middle class, yet again, with more taxes. Under Capito, you could again have one hand giveth and the other hand taketh away. You might have the Republicans say let's double the standard deduction, but then when those middle-class folks lose their deduction for State and local taxes and their personal exemptions, they are in a big hole.  Reject this amendment, reject sleight-of-hand tax policy and those approaches like this that hurt hard-working, middle-class families.  I yield the floor.
