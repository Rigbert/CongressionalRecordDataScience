  I say to the distinguished Senator, I do not want to yield the floor and lose the floor because it is my intention to slow down Senate consideration today in this rushed manner in hopes that we will be able to send it to committee, have a hearing and follow the normal deliberative process, including sending it back to the Senate soon for thoughtful consideration.
