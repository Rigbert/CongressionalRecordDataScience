President, this is a strident voice among some in this country who came out and said he believed that the real threat to America was not terrorism but men and women wearing judicial robes. He thought that was a much greater threat. That gives you an idea of the extreme rhetoric. We cannot let this happen. Whether the Democrats are in control or out of control, whether Republicans control today or tomorrow is secondary. We all swear to uphold the Constitution.  I will yield the floor to my colleague from New Jersey at this point. I hope those following this debate will consider the constitutional issues at stake.  I yield the floor.
