I had the honor of marching in the Wheaton July 4th parade last Friday and viewing the Moving Wall. I was especially impressed by the community's tribute to fallen Vietnam veterans that was delivered at the parade reviewing stand.  The Moving Wall is a half-sized replica of the Vietnam Veterans Memorial here in Washington. The Memorial was dedicated in 1982 in honor of the men and women of the Armed Forces of the United States who served in the Vietnam War. The black granite wall, engraved with the names of those who gave their lives and those who remain missing, serves as a somber reminder of the costs of war in American lives and treasure.  The idea of a moving wall was conceived by Vietnam veteran John Devitt while attending the Vietnam Veterans Memorial dedication in 1982. Devitt's idea was deeply personal. He had been out of work when the wall was dedicated and had made the trip with financial help from family and friends. ``There were millions of people who would never be able to come to Washington,'' he later explained: ``I wantedthem to be able see and feel what I had.'' Mr. Devitt accomplished his mission as millions of people in hundreds of American communities have visited the Moving Wall during its 20 years of existence.  The Moving Wall was built by Devitt, Norris Shears, Gerry Haver and other Vietnam veterans, and was displayed for the first time in Tyler, TX in October of 1984. Currently, there are two Moving Walls, which crisscross the country from April to November each year.  The 462-strong VFW Post 2164, commanded by Korean War veteran Sonny Carson, and the citizens of Wheaton, IL are to be commended for raising the $26,000 required to bring the Wall to Wheaton. The Wall's presence in Wheaton was a particularly poignant event as the names of 14 of its sons are engraved upon the Wall's granite face, including a Medal of Honor recipient, James Howard Monroe.  The goal of bringing the Moving Wall to Wheaton was to help close old wounds, and to educate the community about the war in Vietnam and its profound effect on our Nation and our veterans. It is my pleasure to congratulate the members of VWF Post 2164 and the citizens of Wheaton for achieving that goal, and for helping the rest of us honor and remember those who made the ultimate sacrifice for our country.                          ____________________
