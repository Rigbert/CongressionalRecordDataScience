Speaker, this evening I would like to address the issue of the economy in our country and the dismantling of our manufacturing and economic base.  President Bush owns the worst record of job creation since the Presidency of Herbert Hoover. More than 3.2 million Americans have lost their jobs since this President was installed in office.  The Bush administration's destruction of jobs across our country indeed has spread like wildfire. From Massachusetts to the Carolinas, from the Midwest to California. Now, they have even tried to take away our overtime pay. Isn't enough enough?  Accelerating job loss under this administration is the norm, not the exception. Indeed, in less than 3 years the Republicans have lost 3.2 million jobs and at the same time added $3.3 trillion to our national debt. Today 9 million of our citizens are out of work and cannot find a job.  The gentlewoman from Oregon (Ms. Hooley) has a discharge petition in this House, so that we can extend unemployment benefits to those who simply cannot find work inside the boundaries of this country. That bill should not require a discharge petition. It should come to this floor immediately because it is necessary for those who will lose their benefits by the end of this year.  President Bush has the worst record of job creation, actually he has created no new net jobs, of any President since Herbert Hoover during the great depression. Every President since World War II has created jobs but for this President.  This year, the United States is going to lose more manufacturing jobs. It will mark job loss in the manufacturing sector every single year of his Presidency. And if you look at the accelerating loss of manufacturing jobs, this has never happened since World War II in our country. We have lost 2.5 million manufacturing jobs.  The Great Lakes States are being hollowed out in the steel industry, inthe machine tool industry, in the automotive parts industry. The Carolinas are being hollowed out in furniture, in textiles. Massachusetts has suffered enormously, as much as any other State in our Union.  There seems to be no end to the job killing across our country. More bad news on job losses hit California today. And more people are looking longer to find work. Mr. Speaker, 5 million people are working part time because they cannot find a full-time job.  So the Bush administration's record on jobs is abysmal. But the rich are getting richer thanks to President Bush's massive tax breaks for millionaires. But half of America's families get nothing from his tax package.  And the middle class is getting squeezed as usual. In return for meager tax cuts, they are facing enormous increases in local and State property taxes, gas taxes, special levies. And tuition rate increases for college students are going up across our country and going off the charts. In Ohio, for instance, our State has raised tuition 40 percent. It has recently suspended new entrants into what is called the Ohio Tuition Tax Authority, the 529 program, that allows parents to save for their children's college education. They do not want any more people in the program because there is not any money for it.  Our State is closing libraries on Sundays and forcing the burden of paying for libraries not on the general tax duplicate for the whole State, but they are pushing it down on property taxes.  So the middle class has had a net increase in taxes since this President took office. The middle class is getting squeezed as State and local governments rack up record levels of debt, cut important services, and raise taxes and user fees.  This Congress just approved an enormous amount of money for Iraq and yet not a single dime was approved for our States and localities that are running record deficits and are being forced to cut services. More pressure on our families, more pressure on our workers.  Listen to these numbers. Nine million Americans out of work, the most in a decade. Almost 4 million Americans, 4 million, out of unemployment compensation. That is 13 million Americans right there. 151,800 manufacturing jobs lost in Ohio under this President's watch. 145,300 manufacturing jobs lost in North Carolina. 297,700 manufacturing jobs lost in California. 215,300 more unemployed people in New York since Bush took office.  We witness daily the real and deepening crisis in manufacturing. Between January 1998 and August of 2003, U.S. manufacturing employment dropped by 3 million persons. During the Bush years, the pace of job washout has accelerated dramatically. In fact, manufacturing share of our Gross Domestic Product fell below 14 percent last year. As the Economic Policy Institute notes, the manufacturing sector occupies a special place in U.S. economy because productivity growth in manufacturing has historically outpaced the rest of our economy, driving real increases in our standard of living. We know that well in our part of the country, the Midwest.  Good paying jobs in factories with good benefits are the key to our great middle class, the key to achieving the American dream, to buying a home, to putting your kids through college. Manufacturing fosters supply and demand growth, providing the basis for durable economic growth for the wider economy. But total employment in manufacturing in the United States used to be about 18 million workers, ranging between 16.5 and 19.5 million. However, that has plummeted to 14.6 million workers as of August of this year.  This record low level of manufacturing employment in our country coincides with the largest trade deficits our country has ever recorded. For the first time in almost 40 years, despite an increasing population, we have record low employment in manufacturing. The net result is a lower standard of living, greater economic pressure on our families, a fracturing of communities, a diminished tax base for schools, local governments and angry citizens, among other things.  The jobs did not just disappear like the horse and buggy. They have gone to other countries. Americans are still driving cars, but American workers enjoy less of a market share compared to foreign companies. Americans still use refrigerators, but they are more often made in Mexico or China, rather than Iowa.  I present this particular chart this evening on the U.S. trade deficit, the balance, because every single year it has gotten worse and worse and worse until this past year of 2002 and this year of 2003 we are hovering at half a trillion dollars in more imports coming into our country than exports going out.  And just in that one year alone, that level of trade deficit translates into an additional 1 million lost jobs. Because for every billion dollars of trade deficit, of more imports coming in here than exports going out, you lose 20,000 jobs. So multiply $500 billion by 20,000 and what do you come out with? An additional million lost jobs.  We have never hemorrhaged jobs and income to this extent. Americans still use steel for bridges and buildings and vehicles and appliances, but our steel industry is under siege from dumped steel and foreign competition.  Americans still eat food, but more and more of our food is coming from foreign countries as farmers across this country bite the dust. And the average age of farmers in our Nation is now 58 years of age. Americans still use telephones and electronic equipment. They still watch television, but those products are now made in Mexico or Asia. Our demand has not changed, in fact, it is greater than ever, but the problem is on the supply side. Our factories have lost market share, which translates into fewer orders, which translates into fewer jobs, which translates into greater unemployment and the dismantling of our mighty industrial and agriculture economy.  How long can this go on? Can America regain its competitive edge? The staggering rise in this U.S. trade deficit, particularly with China, claims millions and millions of more jobs. And these are the figures for China. The U.S. trade deficit with China alone this year will rise to over $103 billion. That means 2 million lost jobs just related to China. And it is no surprise if you think about your own experience when you go to the store, look at the tag. Where is it from? That job is being created somewhere else at slave-level wages, but it certainly is not being created in this country. And that creates a siphoning off of income by our citizens somewhere else.  The staggering rise in the U.S. trade deficit with China, I mean look at this, it is absolutely gigantic, never experienced before in our Nation's history, is claiming millions and millions of more jobs every year. It is a product of bad deals, bad deals, bad trade deals such as NAFTA and the World Trade Organization and most favored nation status for China, giveaways on the part of the U.S. Congress, and the Bush and Clinton administrations.  Selling American workers and our companies down the river has been a bipartisan effort by some here in Washington, but the bill is coming due. Between the first quarter of 1995 and the second quarter of 2003, the overall trade deficit skyrocketed to over $411 billion, dominated by over $408 billion in the deficit in manufactured goods.  Since 2000, the year Congress approved permanent normal trade relations with China, a communist country, the largest U.S. trade deficit in American history has been amassed with China. The deficit with China exceeded $100 billion last year alone, and this year shows no sign of slowing.  The manufacturing trade deficit, according to the Economic Policy Institute, alone for all of the nations from which we are importing goods reached $491 billion by the end of 2002. The Bush administration says it wants to solve the problem with China alone by manipulating currency rates, and I can tell them it will not work. Because it never worked with Japan.  I can remember back in the 1980s when they patted me on the head in a very patronizing way as a young Member of Congress and they said, Marcy, do not worry about the trade deficit with Japan. When the yen-dollar relationship reaches maybe 90 yen to the dollar, everything will work out. You know what? It never did. It did not matter whether the yen was 90 to the dollar or 230 to the dollar. When you have a controlled economy and youprohibit imports, and you have Keiretsu supplier chains into which other country's companies cannot bid, you will never balance the trade accounts of this country because other nations do not play by the same rules.  And so Americans still buy cars and trucks, and still drive cars and trucks, and still buy refrigerators and stoves, and televisions and computers and DVD players, and still consume vastly more than any other people in the world, but we are losing manufacturing jobs at a record pace. And it is dragging down our entire economy. Have you noticed?  Mr. Speaker, this is not just a regional issue. It is not just about the Midwest, although we in the Midwest understand the importance of manufacturing to our economy. Earlier this week on Capitol Hill, a Republican polster told a briefing that the jobs in the Midwest are going and they are not coming back, and he explicitly mentioned Ohio. I refuse to accept that. And I know my dear colleague, the gentleman from Ohio (Mr. Brown) refuses to accept that because we know we cannot withstand the loss of millions more of our manufacturing jobs and this type of hemorrhage, and turn this republic over to our children and grandchildren in better condition that we found it.  Mr. Speaker, I have some comments I want to make about when these countries get these dollars from the United States, what they end up doing with our dollars, but I would be very happy to yield to my colleague, the gentleman from Ohio (Mr. Brown) who fought with us so valiantly in our efforts to amend NAFTA before its passage and to deny this kind of trade access to China without getting something on the other end.                              {time}  2130
