 BOND. I would be happy to yield.  Mr. McCONNELL. I ask my friend from Missouri, is it not true that if we do not get this omnibus bill funded, the election reform money, which guarantees that next year it will be easier to vote and harder to cheat, as the Senator from Missouri has said on so many occasions, that that money simply will not be there in time to begin this lengthy process of getting the money out to States and getting the reforms made in time for the 2004 election?
