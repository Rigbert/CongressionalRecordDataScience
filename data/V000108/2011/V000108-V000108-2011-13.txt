Chairman, I rise in very reluctant reservation to the gentleman's amendment.  I do not, speaking for myself as an individual, trust the Chinese Government. Representing the largest fuel-producing district in the United States of America, I have simply seen them eat our economic lunch.  We have had innumerable hearings in this Congress under varied administrations of both political parties, telling us that dialogue with China is going to work and that somehow it is going to lead to miraculous job creation in the United States of America versus the country of China.  I join with the gentleman in urging all of my Members later this morning to vote against Mr. Harris' amendment and that we have no disagreement. And I join with the gentleman of California's concern about how the Department of Energy is going to implement this program with the Chinese because we are told by the Department that this program is going to help U.S. cities develop more cleanly, and it's going to provide market opportunities for U.S. clean-tech companies. We are told further that for wind and solar there will be, in the future, market opportunities.  For just one time I would appreciate the Department of Energy showing me the jobs, the companies, the cities towns, the industries where this type of cooperation with China has led to a job, a job in the United States of America.  So it is with the greatest reluctance I hesitate to support the gentleman's amendment, agreeing with everything he has said.
