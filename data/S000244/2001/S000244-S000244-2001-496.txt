Speaker, today I am introducing a bill to codify and enact certain general and permanent laws, related to public buildings, property, and works, as title 40 of the United States Code. This bill has been prepared by the Office of the Law Revision Counsel of the House of Representatives as a part of the responsibilities of that Office to prepare and submit to the Committee on the Judiciary, for enactment into positive law, all titles of the United States Code. This bill makes no change in the substance of existing law.  Anyone interested in obtaining a copy of the bill and a description of the bill, containing asection-by-section summary, should contact the Office of the Law Revision Counsel, U.S. House of Representatives, H2-304 Ford House Office Building, Washington, D.C., 20505-6711. The Telephone number is (202) 226-2411.  Persons wishing to comment on the bill should submit those comments to the Office of the Law Revision Counsel no later than September 10, 2001.                          ____________________
