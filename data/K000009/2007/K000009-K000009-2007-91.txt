Chairman.  Mr. Chairman, I want to express deep appreciation to Chairman Frank, Ranking Member Bachus and certainly to Congresswoman Maxine Waters of California and Carolyn Maloney of New York, who really fashioned a bill that deals with the prolonged housing market slump, due in large measure to increasing rates of foreclosure.  The State of Ohio welcomes this measure. We have been particularly hard hit. The credit gap in Ohio is estimated between $14 and $21 billion, as over 200,000 more mortgages will reset at higher rates over the next 2 years. We don't need any more vacant units depressing the housing market in our region.  Government-sponsored entities can and should play a major role in reversing this trend. This bill does that. I would oppose any amendments designed to weaken or eliminate the much-needed National Housing Trust Fund. Homeownership is the most important savings account that any American family accumulates.  In passing this legislation, we assure that this Congress understands that as well as the necessity of keeping our housing market strong as fundamental to bolstering the economy of our entire country and helping it grow.  Chairman Frank, I deeply thank you on behalf of the Governor of Ohio and all the people of Ohio who are looking to us for leadership to help them hold on to their most important asset, their home.
