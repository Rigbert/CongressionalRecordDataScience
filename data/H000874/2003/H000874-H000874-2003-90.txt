Speaker, reclaiming my time, I want to assure the majority leader we want a prescription drug bill. We have been fighting for a prescription drug bill, but that does not necessarily mean we want your prescription drug bill. We want a bill that has the support of the majority, the American people, and that we believe we can have. We are fighting for such a bill.  We want an energy bill. We think this country needs an energy bill, certainly in light of the August 14 blackout in the northeast. We think we need to address that issue.  So let me assure the gentleman from Texas (Mr. DeLay) that we want to see these bills passed. But let me also assure the gentleman that if the condition preceding to having a conference in which we are included is saying that we will agree to it as it passed the House, if we oppose it, that is neither a reasonable request on your part, I believe, nor is it the expectation of either side that they be included in a conference only on a condition that they will agree to what the leadership wants to do.  I think we have probably discussed this sufficiently, but it is a real concern that we are not including both sides in these conferences. Because on the energy bill, I do not believe there has been a conference nor does the gentleman from Michigan (Mr. Dingell) as we understand a conference. But we have a different view, perhaps.  Mr. Speaker, unless the majority leader wants to make additional comments, I would yield back the balance of my time.                          ____________________
