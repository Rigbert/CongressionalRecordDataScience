 President, Democrats and Republicans agree that the automatic spending cuts across defense and nondefense investments are terrible policy, and it has to be fixed.  I am proud that the bipartisan budget act that we passed last Congress did exactly that for the past 2 years. It offered us a template for how we can tackle this challenge in a bipartisan way once again. That deal succeeded because it rolled back cuts to defense and nondefense equally, and it did it with a balanced and responsible mix of savings and new revenue.  The amendment before us builds on that deal and extends the sequester relief for 2 more years. We don't need to rely on gimmicks in this budget or the hopes that we are going to solve this later. We need to fix this now.  In 2013, it took a government shutdown to bring both sides to the table to get a deal for this. I am hoping we don't have to wait for another crisis, and I encourage our colleagues who oppose sequestration to support this amendment.
