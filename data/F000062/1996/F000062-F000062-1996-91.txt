  Let me make this point. Under present law, affidavits of support are not legally enforceable. In the immigration bill, that is one of the things that is achieved. It is a binding contract, an affidavit, so that in the future these contracts will be legally enforceable. I support that. I agree with you on this point. But the point that we are trying to make is that at present they are not. Therefore, there has been a kind of a change.  The other point that I want to make to you is that this is not the same as the Daschle bill. This bill is not the same as the Daschle bill on this point. The Daschle bill has certain exemptions. The disabled are exempted. Refugees are exempted. Battered women and children are exempted. Veterans are exempted. That is a point I really appreciate the opportunity to make.
