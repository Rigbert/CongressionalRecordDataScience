President, I thank the distinguished Senator from Pennsylvania for his support of both David Ogden and Thomas Perrelli, both superbly qualified candidates, both of whom will be confirmed this afternoon. I will speak further about Mr. Perrelli after this vote.  Again, I go back to David Ogden. David Ogden has been strongly supported by Republicans and Democrats, those who served in the Bush administration and other administrations. I thought it was a scurrilous attack on him because he and his firm supported libraries, supported perfectly legal publications, and some Republicans saying they could not vote for him because of that.  I note that these same Republicans all voted for Michael Mukasey, a fine gentleman, to be Attorney General, who listed as one of his primary cases his representation of the TV channel that carries ``Dial-a-Porn.''  Now, certainly when a Republican, nominated by a Republican, represented Dial-a-Porn, that seems to be wrong; when a Democrat, nominated by a Democrat, represents libraries and basically a mainstream men's magazine, that is wrong.  I hope we will avoid in the future such double standards. I see a man who has helped children, who has volunteered his time, who has given great charity to children, and who has been supported by the Boys and Girls Clubs, by the Missing and Exploited Children's groups, by the National District Attorneys Association, and by every major law enforcement organization.  So, Mr. President, I know time has expired, and I would ask for the yeas and nays on confirmation of the nomination.  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Bennet). Is there a sufficient second?  There appears to be a sufficient second.  The question is, Will the Senate advise and consent to the nomination of David W. Ogden, of Virginia, to be Deputy Attorney General?  The clerk will call the roll.  The bill clerk called the roll.
