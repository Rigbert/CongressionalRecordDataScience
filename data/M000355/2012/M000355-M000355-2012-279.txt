 President, today I wish to pay tribute to a true American hero who honorably answered the call to serve his country in its dire time of need, Mr. Leonard Gilliam of Laurel County, KY.  Mr. Gilliam was born in McWhorter, KY, in 1919. The 92-year-old has had an incredible life on this Earth thus far. Leonard was a country boy who had lived on his family farm his entire life. He was the first boy from McWhorter to get the call from the U.S. Army in 1941; he was 21 years old.  The newly enlisted men, along with Gilliam, headed to basic training in Fort Thomas, KY. Gilliam was trained in artillery; during training he learned how to man a tank gun. After training ended he was transferred to Fort Benning, GA, where he would reside until December of 1941. The attack on Pearl Harbor led to the declaration of war, which for Gilliam would mean being deployed to the front.  The young Leonard Gilliam knew that going to war would be difficult, and his bringing up had prepared him to face the difficult road ahead. He had spent his childhood working on the farm and walking through fields and creeks, to and from the Twin Branch School, every day. But what the eager Gilliam did not foresee was the opportunities he would be presented with during his time in the service. A chance to see the world and forge a lifelong friendship were not in the then 21-year-old's plans back then.  His much needed experience with tanks landed him a spot on the front lines, and Gilliam entered the war in Casablanca, North Africa. He traveled through Algeria, Morocco, and Tunisia before heading towards Europe. Gilliam was called to invade the island of Sicily on July 10, 1942. He was later awarded the Bronze Arrowhead for his courageous actions during the invasion.  Gilliam spent time in Sicily guarding POWs. He remembers eating with them, talking with them, and even giving them cigarettes. Looking back, he says that the prisoners were some of the finest people he has ever met. He stayed at the prison in Sicily until he was called to go to Normandy. He arrived in France a mere 4 days after the invasion of the beach on June 6, 1944.  The hardships experienced by Gilliam in France were some of the toughest times of the war for him. But in the midst of a dark shadow cast by war, Gilliam met Vayne McCoy, a fellow tank gunner who would soon become his best friend. The two friends helped each other see the end of the war, and then they lost track of each other once they had returned back to the States. It wasn't until 1997--53 years later--when the two would reunite. The two war buddies shared a deep bond, one that they continue to share to this day.  The veteran now recalls the warm welcome he received when he finally made his return trip home in 1945 after 3 years overseas. Mr. Gilliam is a modest man. He feels like he is undeserving of the hero's welcome he received after World War II. He believes that the real heroes were the ones that ``stayed over there,'' the ones who made the ultimate sacrifice for their country and never got the chance to come home.  The former soldier now enjoys life as a full-time family man. He is a husband, father, grandfather, and great-grandfather. Leonard is a remarkable man who has been on a once-in-a-lifetime adventure. Even after all that he has been through, both the good and the bad, he is still grateful he had opportunity. Although he says he wouldn't go on a trip around the world again for $1 million, he doesn't regret getting to see the world for free the first time.  In November 2011, there was an article about Mr. Leonard Gilliam published in the Sentinel Echo Silver Edition, a magazine based in Laurel County, KY. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that said article be printed in the Record.  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in the Record, as follows:          [From the Sentinel Echo: Silver Edition, Nov. 2011]                 World War II: A Trip Around the World                          (By Carrie Dillard)       Leonard Gilliam remembers the days when he and his family      ``didn't have a cable bill, water bill or electric bill.''      The 92-year-old Laurel County native has lived on his family      farm his whole life.       He was born in 1919 in McWhorter. It was a time when, he      said, ``everybody used a mule pair, everybody had a milk cow      and some beef cattle, and everybody had their own hogs.''       You worked hard, he said. Kept your house warm buying coal      for $1 a ton at the mines or a jug of kerosene for 10 cents a      gallon. You cooked on a wood stove, and there were always      chores to do.       He had to ``go through the field and cross the creek      twice'' on his walk to Twin Branch School each day, so when      he joined the U.S. Army in 1941, he was used to walking.       During the course of his military career, Gilliam would      spend approximately three years overseas, engage in six major      battles and one invasion. He would end his days in World War      II in Berlin, Germany, during the Army occupation in July      1945.       Gilliam was drafted. ``They didn't draft until (age) 21 in      those days,'' he said. He was the first one in the McWhorter      community who got the call.       ``There was a busload of us left London early one      morning,'' he said, on their way to Fort Thomas, Kentucky. In      less than two days, a contingent from all across the state      filled a train headed to Fort Bragg, North Carolina, for      basic training.       Gilliam was trained in artillery. He would later man the      tank gun, causing him to lose nearly all of his hearing.       He served in the 2nd Armored Division (Hells on Wheels)      under division commander George S. Patton, who once said the      2nd Armored Division ``could do the impossible'' because he      trained them.       Gilliam was at Fort Benning, Georgia, when the Japanese      attacked Pearl Harbor in 1941.       ``They put more guards out, more security,'' he said, ``as      war was declared.'' Gilliam and his division began more      practices and maneuvers, traveling back and forth from      Georgia and North Carolina, until his deployment overseas. In      total, Gilliam would serve six six-month tours overseas.       As a gunner, he said ``the tanks were needed on the front''      as soon as they arrived in Casablanca, North Africa. They      traveled to Algeria, Morocco, and Tunisia, and on July 10,      they invaded the island of Sicily, for which Gilliam was      awarded a Bronze Arrowhead.       ``Sicily was an interesting place,'' Gilliam said. It was      there he worked as a security officer at an old penitentiary,      guarding POWs.       ``I had a gun and they didn't, but they didn't give me any      trouble,'' he said.       In fact, he said, once they got acquainted, the POWs were      ``some of the finest people I met.''       He said he'd put his gun up and sit down to eat with the      prisoners. They ate the same rations--MREs (meal, ready to      eat) just as the soldiers did, and were even given      cigarettes.       Gilliam said he and his fellow soldiers were put on a boat      in Sicily and weren't told where they were headed.       ``It looked like we was going to the United States,'' he      said, ``but we was going toward England.''       They were on the water at Thanksgiving, and, shortly      thereafter, landed in Liverpool.       The invasion of Normandy took place on June 6, 1944.      Gilliam arrived just four days later.       Although he describes it as some of the roughest times in      the war, it is also where he met a good friend: Vayne McCoy.       McCoy was five years younger than Gilliam, and took to him      like a younger brother. Both Gilliam and McCoy were on tanks.      Gilliam's was called ``Crimson Tide,'' McCoy's ``Churchill.''       The two lost track of one another after the war, but      reunited in 1997, more than 50 years later. Today, they ``get      together pretty often,'' Gilliam said, their families      becoming like family to each other.       Gilliam said the Germans were smart, and without the      combined effort of the U.S. Army and Air Force, they would      not have succeeded in driving them back.       In September 1944, Gilliam crossed the Belgium border, but      it wasn't an easy trek. He said it rained the whole way there      and turned to snow; it was the coldest winter he'd ever felt.       The Battle of the Bulge was upon them. Standing in knee-     deep snow, Gilliam said he and his fellow soldiers would fire      their guns and huddle around the tank to keep warm. He was      nearly overcome by the exhaust fumes from the machine just      trying to get warm. Gilliam suffers from the effects of      frostbite to this day.       For a time, Gilliam and his company stayed in a local      farmer's barn. The owners, he said, knew of their presence,      and he said the owners were overjoyed to help.       Without the protection of that barn, they likely ``would      have frozen to death.'' Gilliam said the group held up in      that barn, sleeping in the hayloft, for three weeks until      temperatures got warmer.       Gilliam said he remembers the faces of young children as      they made the journey across France, Belgium, and Holland.       ``The children were standing and waving at us. If we halted      for some reason, they'd climb the tanks and hug everybody.       ``The look on those little children's faces, you was glad      to have done that for them,'' he said.       In April 1945, Gilliam said his outfit met the Russians on      the Elbe River.       ``For me, the war ended. I didn't fire another shot.''       Gilliam said soldiers returning from World War II got a      hero's welcome, but veterans of other wars, like the Korean      War or Vietnam, did not receive the same respect. ``Soldiers      of the Korean War didn't get that welcome when they came      home,'' he said. ``They could've used a welcome home, too.''      But Gilliam has never considered himself a hero. Those are      the ones who gave the ultimate sacrifice, he said. In 238      days of battle, the 2nd Armored Division suffered 7,348      casualties, including 1,160 killed in action.       ``The heroes didn't come back. They're still there.''       His older brother, Blane, was among them. Blane Gilliam, an      Army radio operator who was serving in the Pacific, was      killed in action/missing in action at age 30. Gilliam      received word of his death around the time he reached      Germany.       Following the war, Gilliam returned home and married Wilma      George, who was 11 years his junior.       ``Here I was a 25-year-old man, been around the world on a      killing spree,'' he said. They were married for 61 years and      had three children--Wanda, Coy and Linda. Today, Gilliam has      three grandchildren and two great-grandchildren. He is a      member of Twin Branch Methodist Church.       ``I wouldn't make that trip (again) for one million      dollars,'' he said. ``But I got to see the world (for      free).''                          ____________________
