 President, I had an opportunity to talk to President Trump a few moments ago and wanted to indicate to our colleagues that he will sign the bill that we have been discussing here to guarantee that government workers who have been displaced as a result of the shutdown will ultimately be compensated. So I want to ease their anxiety about that particular possibility.  With that in mind, I ask unanimous consent that the Senate proceed to the immediate consideration of Calendar No. 3, S. 24.  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Young). The clerk will report the bill by title.  The legislative clerk read as follows:       A bill (S. 24) to provide for the compensation of Federal      and other government employees affected by lapses in      appropriations.  There being no objection, the Senate proceeded to consider the bill.  Mr. McCONNELL. I know of no further debate on the bill.
