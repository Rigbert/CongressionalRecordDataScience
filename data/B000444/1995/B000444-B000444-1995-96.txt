 President, I know that this amendment was accepted by voice vote, but I just want to note for the Record that I oppose it.  This is not the type of micromanagement that the Senate should be engaged in.  The Judiciary is an independent branch of Government and it should be permitted to make reasonable decisions about how to spend the money that Congress appropriates to it without undue interference.                           Amendment No. 2845 (Purpose: To delete funding for the National Endowment for Democracy)
