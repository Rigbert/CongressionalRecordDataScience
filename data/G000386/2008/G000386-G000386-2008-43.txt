 President, everyone, of course, agrees with the Senator from North Dakota that the fiscal situation is unsustainable. So as an alternative--as the minority ought to offer a reasonable alternative--on this side, our leader a few weeks ago offered a deficit-neutral proposal on AMT and on extenders. That proposal would have reduced new above-baseline spending nondiscretionary appropriations for future years. That deficit-neutral proposal was rejected. In its place is this amendment, which insists that AMT relief be conditioned on a tax increase.  A vote for this amendment is a vote to hold AMT relief now, and in the future, hostage to a tax increase. That is not reasonable. I urge my colleagues to reject the amendment.
