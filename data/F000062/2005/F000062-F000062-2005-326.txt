 President, I am a cosponsor of the amendment offered by Senator Byrd and Senator Cochran to establish a Memorial to Martin Luther King, Jr. on the Washington Mall.  A memorial to Martin Luther King, Jr. in the heart of the Nation's Capital is a fitting tribute to a man whose vision and courage transformed the face of our Nation. Only a short distance from us here in the Capitol, Martin Luther King, Jr., delivered his famous ``I Have A Dream'' speech on the steps of the Lincoln Memorial. His inspirational words resonated with many Americans and helped spark the civil rights movement.  Dr. King started as a civil rights leader during the Montgomery bus boycott. Despite the bombings, arrests, and violence that Dr. King faced as a leader of this boycott, he continued to push for change. The Montgomery bus boycott successfully brought the glaring inequities facing African Americans to the fore of the American consciousness. In response to the boycott, the U.S. Supreme Court outlawed racial segregation on intrastate busses. However, as we know, Dr. King did not stop with this one legal victory.  Dr. King continued to tirelessly advocate for the principles of nonviolent protest as a means of addressing the injustices facing African Americans. Even in the face of tremendous opposition and cynicism, Dr. King persevered and helped concentrate the civil right movement's momentum for change. It is largely due to Dr. King's efforts that Congress rightly passed the Civil Rights Act of 1964 and the Voting Rights Act of 1965.  Over 4 decades later, I believe we are coming closer day by day to achieving Dr. King's dream, but still, more progress must be made. To memorialize Dr. King's dream here in our Nation's Capital would serve as a powerful reminder of the strides we have made but the steps we must still take together as a nation to weed out inequity.  I am pleased to have the opportunity to cosponsor this amendment with Senators Byrd and Cochran to honor this great individual with a memorial in Washington, DC. The $10 million authorized by this amendment will help expedite the building of this memorial, which shall serve to remind future generations of Dr. King's sacrifices and his lasting legacy.  I urge my colleagues to support this amendment, and I ask unanimous consent that the full text of this proposed legislation be printed in the Record immediately following this statement.                           Amendment No. 1003
