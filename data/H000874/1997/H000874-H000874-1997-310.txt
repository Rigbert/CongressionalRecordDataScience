Speaker, I rise today in support of the balanced budget agreement recently negotiated between the President and congressional leaders. And, while this agreement is not perfect in the eyes of many, it is an example of the democratic process and the consensus building and compromise that it embodies. It is an agreement which incorporates all of the principles which I believe are essential in a budget agreement. In this legislation, we will achieve a balanced budget for the first time in a generation, invest in our people for the future, and provide substantial middle-class tax relief.  Four and a half years ago, we set out on a course toward economic recovery, striving to get our fiscal house in order. And, as we revel in our accomplishments on this day, to finish the job of balancing the budget, we must not overlook the magnitude and importance of the 1993 budget plan. For it was that historic and courageous vote that cut the deficit from $290 billion in 1992 to a projected $41 billion this year. That comprehensive budget strategy made difficult spending cuts and raised needed revenues by asking our Nation's wealthiest to contribute to our economic recovery. The leadership of the President and the Democratic Congress in adopting that budget plan has contributed to record economic growth, low inflation, the creation of over 12\1/2\ million new jobs in our Nation, and a deficit that has shrunk by more than 80 percent. The bipartisan budget plan that we enact today would not be possible had we not made the tough choices, politically and substantively, that we did in 1993.  Mr. Speaker, there are some today who advocate finishing the job of balancing the budget before we enact tax cuts of any kind. Others in the Congress believe that enacting tax cuts will help spur the economy and contribute to the economic stability we all seek. I believe that this is a sound agreement and a goodcompromise that melds the priorities of Democrats and Republicans in a way that will allow all Americans to prosper.  At the heart of this balanced budget is a historic investment in education--the most significant increase in education funding in 30 years. It includes $40 billion in tax relief to help make a college education a reality for millions of Americans. It includes the largest increase in Pell grant scholarships in three decades and will give communities substantial tax cuts to help build and modernize our schools.  Second, this budget agreement extends health insurance coverage to 5 million children by investing $24 billion in quality medical care. One of our greatest challenges, in this era of budget cutting, is to ensure that we continue to invest in our children and their future and this is a major step toward that goal. At the same time, this agreement honors our commitment to our parents by preserving the Medicare trust fund for a decade and implementing new market-oriented reforms.  This agreement bolsters environmental enforcement by doubling the pace of Superfund cleanups and delivers tax cuts to clean up and revitalize urban areas. It protects the community oriented policing services [COPS] initiative, which will put 100,000 more police officers on the street by 2000. And, it improves upon the welfare reform legislation that enacted last year by protecting our most vulnerable people. While providing $3 million to move willing and motivated Americans from welfare to private sector jobs, the agreement treats 350,000 legal immigrants fairly by restoring their disability and health benefits.  Finally, Mr. Speaker, for the first time in a generation, this agreement provides mainstream, middle-class tax relief while spelling out specific, sufficient spending and entitlement reductions to pay for it and balance the budget at the same time. The final budget deal provides the $500 child tax credit to the Americans most in need: 27 million middle- and low-income, hard-working families; 13 million children from families with incomes below $30,000 will receive the child tax credit, nearly 7.5 million more than the Republican plan would have covered.  Democrats have succeeded in providing tax relief which invests in our children by helping middle-class parents trying to pay for their children's college tuition. The budget plan includes the President's $1,500 HOPE scholarship to make the first 2 years of college universally available. And, it provides for a 20-percent tuition tax credit for college juniors, seniors, and graduate students, and for working Americans trying to upgrade their skills.  I am also pleased to see that the estate tax provisions resemble the President's proposal and legislation which I introduced earlier this year which seeks to provide relief, immediately, to those most in need: small businesses and family farms.  Mr. Speaker, this agreement continues the job started in 1993. It balances the budget by 2002 and puts the budget in surplus at least through 2007. The job is not done, Mr. Speaker. We must never allow ourselves to revert back to the irresponsible policies of Reganomics which today still confront our generation and generations to come in the form of a $5\1/2\ trillion national debt. We must ensure that we follow through with the spending cuts outlined in this agreement while not allowing ourselves to succumb to future pressures to borrow from future generations to pay for what we buy today. And, we must vigorously ensure that the budget deficit goals included in this agreement are enforced and reached.  Mr. Speaker, as we applaud the bipartisan budget plan which we will enact today, let us not forget the 1980's and the fiscal instability which strangled our Nation when President Clinton inherited exploding budget deficits in 1993. A decade of large deficits had weakened the foundation of our economy and challenged our Nation's power and prosperity abroad. In the President's first term he set out to cut the deficit in half. Working with the President, Democrats in Congress enacted the 1993 budget plan which has far exceeded our expectations. The President, who had the courage and vision to reverse this trend, deserves our thanks and praise.  When the President was reelected last year, he was determined to fulfill his goal of balancing the budget, but was unrelenting in his commitment to invest in our Nation's core values of education, health care, and the environment. This bipartisan budget agreement protects our priorities, solidifies the Nation's economic foundation, and bolsters America's position as the greatest economy in the world.  Policymaking is a series of tradeoffs and tough decisions. This bill unfairly targets Federal employees by asking them to pay additional retirement contributions without any increase in benefits. Nevertheless, on balance, this is a good budget and will have a positive effect on the lives of millions of Americans as we head into the next century. It reflects the values and priorities of our Nation and with the enactment of this agreement, our Nation will have taken a historic step toward a vibrant and prosperous 21st century.                          ____________________
