  Mr. DeFAZIO. Well, Mr. Speaker, the numbers are in. ExxonMobil's quarterly profits up 32 percent, Shell, 34 percent, BP, 29 percent. The three largest oil companies made $200 million a day profit by gouging consumers. This is extraordinary, and the Republicans have very little to say about this because they are sharing in the profits. Eighty-five percent of the political contributions from oil and gas companies go to the Republican party.  Now, they are so awash in money that the retired CEO of ExxonMobil, while Americans struggle to fill up their gas tanks and afford that and go on vacation, well, Lee Raymond, the retired ExxonMobil chief who got $400 million for a retirement gift very recently, he is personally buying oil and gas fields. So American workers, people who work for ExxonMobil, can't afford to go on vacation and fill up their tank, and their CEO is personally purchasing oil and gas fields in the Middle East and Africa. It's a great country.                          ____________________[Page H5958]From the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]                          OIL COMPANY PROFITS  (Mr. DeFAZIO asked and was given permission to address the House for 1 minute.)
