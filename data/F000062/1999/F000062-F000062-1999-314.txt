  So I feel very strongly that the linchpin of reform of the public education system is the elimination of social promotion. But if you eliminate it and you do not provide any help for failing students, it will not work. So this is a small authorization, $500 million to help those students and not just leave them languishing. I very much hope that both sides of the aisle will vote for it.  I yield the remainder of my time to the Senator from North Dakota.
