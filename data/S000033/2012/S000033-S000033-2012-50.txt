S. PIRG, the Center for Food Safety, and many others.  This is a very conservative amendment. It says the American people should have the right to know what is in the food they and their children are eating and if that food contains genetically engineered products.  This amendment grants States the authority to label genetically engineered food. It is not a mandate. It grants States that right--something which, by the way, is now taking place in 49 countries throughout the world. If the people in England, Germany, France, and dozens and dozens of other countries have labels allowing their people to know if they are eating food with genetically engineered products, States in the United States should have that right.
