 President, I would like to take this opportunity to recognize an outstanding leader of American industry, Kent Kresa, upon his retirement. For the past 13 years, Mr. Kresa has presided over Northrop Grumman Corporation as its chairman and CEO.  Under his guidance, Northrop Grumman grew from a mid-sized defense company known primarily for aircraft building to a full-spectrum major defense firm. The Northrop Grumman that Mr. Kresa refashioned is home to 120,000 employees located in all 50 States and has operations in 25 foreign countries.  It is my privilege to commend Mr. Kresa for a career that helped modernize our defense industrial base and that significantly bolstered our national security.  Mr. Kresa was born in New York City and raised on Long Island. He received his education at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, earning a bachelor's degree in 1959 and post-graduate degrees in 1961 and 1966, all in aeronautics and astronautics.  Before joining Northrop Grumman, Mr. Kresa served with the Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency, where he was responsible for applied research and development programs in the tactical and strategic defense arena. From 1961-68 he was associated with the Lincoln Laboratory at M.I.T., where he worked on ballistic missile defense research and re-entry technology.  During his distinguished career, Mr. Kresa received many of industry's and the government's most prestigious honors. In January, Forbes Magazine featured him on their cover and named Northrop Grumman the Company of the Year. In 2002, Mr. Kresa was awarded the Ellis Island Medal of Honor for his significant contributions to our nation's heritage. He received the Navy League's Admiral Chester W. Nimitz Award for outstanding support of the U.S. Navy.  Also last year, he was named president for a 1-year term of the American Institute of Aeronautics and Astronautics. And he was presented the California Institute of Technology's Management Association's Excellence in Management Award for demonstrating extraordinary vision and leadership.  In 2001, BusinessWeek magazine selected Mr. Kresa as one of the Nation's Top 25 managers. That same year he received the Private Sector Council's Leadership Award for his commitment to improving governmental efficiency. In May 2000, the Aerospace Historical Society presented Mr. Kresa with the International von Krmn Wings award for his contributions to the industry. And in March of 2000, the California Manufacturers and Technology Association named Mr. Kresa and Northrop Grumman a Manufacturer of the Century.  Other honors include Honorary Fellow by the American Institute of Aeronautics and Astronautics in 1998; California Industrialist of the Year in 1996, by the California Museum of Science and Industry and the California Museum Foundation; the Navy League of New York's Admiral John J. Bergen Leadership Award in 1995; and the Air Force Association's John R. Alison Award for Industrial Leadership in 1994.  During Mr. Kresa's tenure at DARPA, he received the Arthur D. Flemming Award as one of the top 10 people in the U.S. Government in 1975; the Navy's Meritorious Public Service Citation the same year; and Secretary of Defense Meritorious Civilian Service Medal in 1974.  While impressive, this partial list of honors only begins to tell the story of Mr. Kresa's contributions to the defense industry and this country.  After joining Northrop in 1975, he was responsible for innovations in stealth and surveillance aircraft, such as the revolutionary B-2 stealth bomber. He was named president of the company in 1987, and CEO and chairman of the board in 1990.  Within the next few years, he embarked upon a decade-long effort that would not only transform Northrop Grumman but also make the company a major force in changing the nature of the defense business.  He and his staff foresaw that a post-cold war defense establishment would require a very different array of products and services, that America's military of the future would rely on systems and integrated networks to tremendously enhance the capabilities of its platforms. He worked tirelessly to help the Department of Defense achieve this vision of interconnected platforms working together to greatly increase the situational awareness and speed of engagement of our military forces.  To build a company that could better support the new direction of the Department of Defense, Mr. Kresa and his staff acquired 16 other major firms, many of them legends in their own right. These included Grumman, Westinghouse, Logicon, Litton Industries, Newport News Shipbuilding, and, most recently, TRW.  ``This Amalgamation of great companies,'' to quote Mr. Kresa, created a corporate structure that has led to new efficiencies and much creative collaboration. Today, for instance, Navy ships can be built from top to bottom as well as networked with other platforms simply through the joint efforts of Northrop Grumman experts in information technology, avionics, satellite communications and other areas.  Mr. Kresa and was also instrumental in developing and gaining Congressional approval for several key platforms that will help form the backbone of our 21st century military. These include the Joint Strike Fighter, the DDX family of destroyers, cruisers and littoral combat ships, and the new generation of Coast Guard ships and aircraft known as the Deepwater project.  As Mr. Kresa moves on to exciting new challenges I wish him, his wife Joyce, and their daughter Kiren, every success and happiness.  For more than 42 years, Mr. Kresa has worked relentlessly in pushing for greater innovation, efficiency and readiness within our great Nation's defense establishment. My office will remember Mr. Kresa for his loyalty, dedicated service, and accomplishments--and we thank him.                          ____________________
