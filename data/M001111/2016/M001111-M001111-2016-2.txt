 President--and it is a pleasure to say that. Some may know him as ``the guy in the aviators'' deboarding Air Force Two or the man in the 1967 Corvette in the viral Internet video, gleeful, as he had the rare opportunity to drive himself around in his favorite car.  Mr. President, it is so clear that the American public has embraced this grinning, approachable, unstoppable life force known as Vice President Joe Biden, but little do many Americans know of the heart of our Vice President.
