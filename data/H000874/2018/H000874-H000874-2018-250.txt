Speaker, I rise to pay tribute to Scott Fleming, a former House staffer and longtime public servant who is retiring in May after seventeen years working for Georgetown University. Over the years, I've had the opportunity to get to know Scott well, both through his work on Capitol Hill and in the Clinton Administration as well as later during his long tenure as a liaison between Georgetown University, my law school alma mater, and Congress.  Scott's association with Georgetown goes back more than four decades. He graduated from Georgetown's Edmund A. Walsh School of Foreign Service in 1972 with a bachelor's degree. Already, though, he was working for Sen. Stuart Symington, from his home state of Missouri, as a Staff Assistant. After obtaining his master's degree in public policy from the Lyndon B. Johnson School of Public Affairs at the University of Texas-Austin, Scott went to work for Rep. Dan Glickman from Kansas, serving from 1975 to 1988 in the roles of Legislative Assistant, Legislative Staff Director, and Chief of Staff. When Rep. Nita Lowey was elected, she hired Scott in 1989 as her first Chief of Staff and to oversee the opening of her Congressional office.  Leaving the House in 1995 with a wealth of legislative experience and institutional knowledge, Scott joined the Clinton Administration's Department of Education as Deputy Assistant Secretary and Director of Congressional Affairs. Later, he served as Assistant Secretary for Legislation and Congressional Affairs. When President Clinton left office in 2001, Scott left government service but didn't venture too far. He returned to his alma mater to serve as Georgetown's Associate Vice President of Federal Relations. While doing so,Scott has also served on the boards of the National Association of Independent College and Universities and of NAFSA: Association of International Educators Public Policy Advisory Committee.  During his tenure, Scott worked tirelessly to secure federal funding for key educational initiatives benefitting students at Georgetown and at institutions of higher education across the country. He's won accolades for his work to shape the Post-9/11 G.I. Bill and related legislation to increase benefits available to veterans seeking to attend college and graduate school. In recent years, Scott has been at the forefront of efforts by Georgetown and other universities to prevent the deportation of DREAMers studying in this country, which they've called home from a young age, and wishing to be a part of building its future. Throughout his time at Georgetown, he's been a fervent promoter of public service careers, taking time to bring students to Capitol Hill and teaching classes at Georgetown's McCourt School of Public Policy.  Scott has been an advisor, friend, and--in my opinion--the embodiment of the Jesuit principles that make up the `Spirit of Georgetown' throughout his career. I wish my fellow Hoya all the best in retirement and thank him for his service to the Congress, in the executive branch furthering educational opportunities in our country, and to Georgetown University and institutions of higher learning throughout America.                          ____________________
