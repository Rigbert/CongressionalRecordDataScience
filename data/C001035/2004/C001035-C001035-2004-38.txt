President, I do want to clarify apart from this issue that I believe there was an informal--I thought we had made it formal--understanding that Senator Stevens would follow Senator Byrd's remarks, and Senator Warner would follow Senator Stevens' remarks. But all the Senator from Florida is trying to do--and I very much appreciate his endorsement of the bill--is to yield back the remainder of Senator Byrd's time at the request of Senator Byrd.
