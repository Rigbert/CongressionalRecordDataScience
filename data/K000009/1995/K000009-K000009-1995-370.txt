Speaker, I rise today to acknowledge an exemplary citizen who has earned the moniker of Mr. Polka in my northwest Ohio district, Mr. Chester ``Chet'' Zablocki. Chet has been an active leader in our community for many years and in the polka music industry since 1947. Allow me to share with my colleagues just a few of this remarkable and fine gentleman's accomplishments. His voice and name are synonymous with Toledo.  Chet became active in his community at the age of 15 by forming a polka band to entertain his family and friends. After serving in the Air Force, he married his childhood sweetheart, Helen Zdawczyk in 1942. Sharing his love for music, Chet and Helen began the ``Polish Festival'' radio show on the new local radio station, WTOD. In 1951, Chet recorded his first record for Continental Records, which featured him as the vocalist on ``Johnny from Poland.'' In 1963, Chet began a local polka newspaper called the Polka Star to inform the local patrons about the polka music and dance industry.  In 1968, part of the heart of the ``Helen-n-Chet's Polka Party,'' as the show was known then, was lost with the death of Helen. Chet continued to broadcast the show alone the next 5 years, with the occasional assistance of his sister, Carol. Chet was remarried in 1973 and the show became ``Sharon and Chet's Polka Party.'' The show continues to air every week over northwest Ohio's airwaves reaching into the hones of thousands of listeners.  Along with the radio show, Chet unselfishly conducts benefits for the American Cancer Society, the WTOD Penny Pitch, the Diabetes Foundation and the Polish American Festival. He also serves as the executive director of the Central Lagrange Senior Center. In August, Chet was inducted in the International Polka Association's Polka Hall of Fame in Chicago for his extensive work in our community and in the polka industry.  Mr. Speaker, I know my collleagues join me in recognizing the efforts of Mr. Chester Zablocki, a truly devoted individual who has enriched our lives with his love for his community, family, and the music which has lightened our hearts in northwest Ohio for nearly 50 years.                          ____________________
