 My distinguished colleague from the other body, Congressman Michael Castle, has already introduced an identical resolution in the House of Representatives.  Felix Darley was the consummate American artist. He was born in Philadelphia, PA in 1821, but spent much of his later years in Delaware, where he died in 1888. In fact, for the last 29 years of Darling's life he lived in my hometown of Claymont, DE, where he produced many of his most famous and renowned drawings. As a Delawarean, and a resident of Claymont, Felix Darley has special significance for me. But he also has a special significance for the entire Nation.  Mr. Darley has been described as ``one of the most famous illustrators of his time'' and ``the first major American illustrator.'' His works have even been said to have forged our very national identity. Felix Darley was the illustrator of books produced by the legendary writers of his time, including such masterful storytellers and poets as Charles Dickens, Henry Wadsworth Longfellow, Edgar Allan Poe, Washington Irving, Nathaniel Hawthorne, and James Fenimore Cooper. Moreover, he is credited with helping to capture the image of the American frontier, which has become such an integral image of our collective imagination and consciousness. As a testament to his greatness, he was inducted into the Society of Illustrators Hall of Fame last year.  Through his works, Felix Darley commemorated and captured our history and the creative achievements of some of our greatest writers. It is time we commemorate his life and his works for posterity by honoring him with a memorial postage stamp. I urge all of my colleagues to join me in sponsoring this resolution which calls on the Citizens' Stamp Advisory Committee to recommend such a stamp. It is a small, but needed step to recognize an American artist who gave us so much.                          ____________________
