 Speaker, all over the State of Vermont our Federal employees are extremely anxious. Those who are furloughed, those who are working. Our Federal employees should not be held hostage because the Republican Party has a 7-year disastrous budget that they want to push through the White House and this Congress. We have the moral obliation to reopen Government today, put our Federal employees back to work, and then we can debate the 7-year balanced budget.
