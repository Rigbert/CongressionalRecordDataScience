Mr. Chairman, I make a point of order against all of section 310 beginning on page 38, line 23, and ending on page 44, line 2.  This language explicitly directs the Secretary of the Department of Transportation to alter the TEA-21 distribution of funds contrary to existing law. It directs the redistribution of $56.3 million of Federal Highway Revenue Aligned Budget Authority (RABA) to carry out a program for State and Federal border infrastructure construction. This is a clear violation of clause 2 of rule XXI of the Rules of the House of Representatives.
