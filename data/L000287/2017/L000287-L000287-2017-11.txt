Mr. Chairman, each and every one of us has a moral obligation to challenge ourselves to make this little piece of real estate that we call Earth better for generations yet unborn.  USIP does good and great work by teaching people around the world to strive to create a society at peace with itself and its neighbors.  We spend millions and billions of dollars on guns, bombs, and missiles. Can we spend just a few pennies, a few dimes, a few dollars on peace?  This world, this planet is, not ours to hoard, waste, and destroy. Mr. Chairman, I ask you: What is wrong with supporting the way of peace, the way of love, the way of nonviolence? What is wrong with teaching communities to respect the dignity and the worth of every human being? What is wrong with preventing conflict and keeping our military personnel safe and out of harm's way?  Mr. Chairman, on the question of preventing war and on the challenge of keeping peace, there should be no price tag, but USIP does good and great work on a shoestring budget. It is a small agency which teaches the way of peace, the way of love. Their small staff help communities solve problems through dialogue rather than weapons.  Mr. Chairman, this is not the first time that we consider an amendment to abolish the U.S. Institute of Peace, but I hope this will be the last. I urge each and every one of my colleagues to vote against this amendment.  Mr. Chairman, I reserve the balance of my time.
