President, current Federal law prohibits the States from regulating the self-funded, employer-sponsored health plans that cover 48 million Americans. Our legislation, which is intended to protect the unprotected, to reach those consumers in self-funded plans that the States are prohibited from regulating, would extend many of the same rights and protections to the Americans covered by these plans that are already enjoyed by Americans who are under the State-regulated plans.  The States have been ahead of the Federal Government in this area. They have acted over the past 10 years to correct problems in the managed care marketplace by enacting specific consumer protections. Our bill extends those kinds of protections to those plans that the States cannot reach. We go beyond that, though, when it comes to the procedural protections, the all-important internal and external appeal procedures that are in our legislation. We provide that to all plans across the board. Again, another myth perpetuated by those on the other side of the aisle that somehow our appeals process does not cover these Americans.  We have produced a good bill. It builds on, but does not preempt, the good work of the States. It provides protections to those 48 million Americans whom the States cannot protect. It balances carefully the need to have reforms that ensure that essential care is provided, that no one is denied care that an HMO has promised. It holds HMOs accountable for their decisions. It puts decisions in the hands of physicians, not insurance company executives or accountants and not trial lawyers. It carefully strikes a balance of providing important consumer protections without driving up the costs, as the Kennedy bill would do, in a way that would jeopardize, that would undermine health insurance coverage for millions of Americans.  Mr. President, I reserve the remainder of our time.                               Exhibit 1                                           National Association of                                      Insurance Commissioners,                                   Washington, DC, March 16, 1999.     Hon. James Jeffords,     Chair, Senate Health, Education, Labor, and Pensions          Committee, Washington, DC.       Dear Senator Jeffords: We are writing this letter in      response to some concerns raised by your office regarding the      testimony of the National Association of Insurance      Commissioners (NAIC) Special Committee on Health Insurance      (``Special Committee'') before the Senate Health, Education,      Labor, and Pensions (HELP) Committee on March 11, 1999. The      hearing focused on the rule of the states and the federal      government in enacting patient protections for consumers in      group health plans. Specifically, concerns have been raised      over the Special Committee's testimony and whether the      Special Committee now supports a federal floor.       We understand why the members of the Senate HELP Committee      would get the impression from our oral testimony that the      members of the Special Committee are supportive of a federal      floor. During our testimony we may have implied that the      members of the Special Committee would accept a federal floor      in any federal patient protection legislation. The members of      the Special Committee have not made a determination that a      federal floor is acceptable. It is our belief that states      should and will continue the efforts to develop creative,      flexible, market-sensitive protections for health consumers      in fully insured plans, and Congress should focus attention      on those consumers who have no protections in self-funded      ERISA plans.       Rather, the members of the Special Committee are interested      in strengthening the distinction between self-funded ERISA      plans, which are clearly outside the purview of state law,      and fully insured plans. State insurance departments want to      ensure that citizens in their states who are covered by fully      insured ERISA plans can still rely on the state to address      their questions, complaints and grievances and can still      expect the same level of protections already established by      the states. The states have already adopted statutory and      regulatory protections for consumers in fully insured plans      and have tailored these protections to fit the needs of their      states' consumers and health care marketplaces. In addition,      many states are supplementing their existing protections      during the current legislative session based upon particular      circumstances within their own states. We do not want states      to be preempted by Congressional or administrative actions.       During our testimony, we highlighted our Statement of      Principles on Patient Protections (``Statement of      Principles''), which were created to assist Congress in      developing patient protection legislation. The Statement of      Principles highlights the elements that we believe must be      included in any patient protection legislation and reflects      the NAIC's commitment to consumer protection. We suggested      that these principles be used as guidelines in drafting any      federal legislation.       The principles are as follows:       Principle 1: Federal legislation establishing patient      protection laws should reinforce the ERISA saving clause and      not preempt existing state health care consumer protection      laws, particularly as these protections apply to fully      insured health plans.       Principle 2: Federal legislation establishing patient      protection laws should ensure a basic level of protections      for all health care consumers, focusing particular attention      on those consumers in self-funded ERISA plans who do not      currently have such protections.       Principle 3: Federal legislation establishing patient      protection laws should preserve the state infrastructure      already in place.       Principle 4: Federal legislation establishing patient      protection laws should ensure that all health care consumers,      whether under fully insured or self-funded plans, have access      to an appropriate regulatory body for answers to their      questions, complaints and grievances.       Principle 5: Federal legislation establishing patient      protection laws should establish an appeals process to      resolve disputes and enforce decisions for those consumers,      such as those in self-funded plans, without access to such a      process.       The members of the Special Committee appreciate the efforts      of Congress to provide patient protections to all consumers,      and we offer the above principles as guidelines in developing      such legislation. In doing so, we urge Congress to focus its      legislative activity on consumers in self-funded ERISA plans,      which are under the federal government's exclusive      jurisdiction, and to preserve the state protections that      already exist for consumers in fully insured ERISA plans.      Again, we have not endorsed the concept of a federal floor      with regard to patient protections.       On behalf of the members of the Special Committee, we would      like to thank you for the opportunity to testify before the      Senate HELP Committee and for the opportunity to clarify our      position. If any members of the NAIC can be of further      assistance, please feel free to contact Jon Lawniczak at      (202) 624-7790.           Sincerely,     George Reider, Jr.                                                  President, NAIC.     Kathleen Sebelius,                                        Secretary-Treasurer, NAIC.
