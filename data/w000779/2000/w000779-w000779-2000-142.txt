President, before Senator Reed leaves the floor, I wish to commend my colleague from Rhode Island for all of his leadership on this issue. I was proud to join him as one Member of this body on the brief. He has consistently talked about the need to drain the swamp that has become America's system of financing campaigns. I share his view.  I note also Senator Hollings is here as well. Senator Hollings I think is absolutely right as well in saying that we probably ought to have a constitutional amendment to ensure we have comprehensive campaign finance reform. But the good news is that the Supreme Court today opened a window for meaningful reform opportunities and meaningful reform legislation.  I commend my colleague from Rhode Island for all of his leadership.                          ____________________
