Chairman, I yield myself 1 minute.  Mr. Chairman, I have in my hand a letter from Mr. Larry Noble, executive director and general counsel of the Center for Responsive Politics, who was the former general counsel of the Federal Election Commission, and I quote from that letter:       ``It is clear under Federal election law that only hard      money can be used to pay off a loan that was used for hard      money expenditures.''  Constantly, the other side has been using as a windmill that they want to have us quixotically focus on, this incorrect claim that we somehow allow soft money to be used to pay off hard money debt.
