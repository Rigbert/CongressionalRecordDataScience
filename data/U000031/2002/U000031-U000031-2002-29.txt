Speaker, I rise in strong support of this legislation. As a member of both the House Committee on Energy and Commerce and the Committee on Education and the Workforce, two of the three House committees with jurisdiction over welfare reform, I have worked very closely with my colleagues and chairmen to further strengthen this legislation so that so many more families can know the benefits of personal responsibility, work, and stronger family units.  I would like to focus on two components of this legislation today. The first one is the Transitional Medical Assistance. One of the most important items in the welfare reform bill that we passed in the Congress back in 1996 was removing the incentive that folks had which otherwise kept them on welfare rather than trying to seek and gain employment. Transitional Medical Assistance provided that bridge and the safety net to encourage people to look for work rather than stay on welfare.  When we passed reform in 1996, we emphasized work and personal responsibility. Important in this legislation is an abstinence program. Sexually transmitted diseases have reached epidemic proportions in our country. In the 1960s, 1 in 47 sexually active teens were infected with a sexually transmitted disease. Today, it is 1 in 4. Please pass this legislation.
