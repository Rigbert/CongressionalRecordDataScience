Speaker, I rise in support of this rule on H.R. 2203. I thank the gentleman from Pennsylvania [Mr. McDade] for crafting a fiscally responsible bill which will ensure that the United States remains on the forefront in energy research for years to come.  As chairman of the subcommittee that authorizes many of the Department of Energy programs addressed in this legislation, I am encouraged that the chairman fully funded the Large Hadron Collider. There had been some concerns among some members of the Committee on Science that U.S. scientists would not be guaranteed a formal role in managing the operation. Thanks to the work of the gentleman from Pennsylvania [Mr. McDade] and the gentleman from Wisconsin [Mr. Sensenbrenner], the chairman of the Committee on Science, these concerns have been addressed.  Second, although the Committee on Science authorized the fusion program at a level slightly higher than this bill, I am encouraged to see a stabilization in funding for this crucial research effort. The fusion community has responded well to congressional calls to restructure their program, and I look forward to seeing the results of their research.  Finally, just as the Committee on Science authorization bill had, this legislation substantially increases funding for renewable energy. I applaud that move, hoping this money will be used primarily for basic research and that the Department of Energy will not involve itself in corporate welfare and subsidies.  Finally, once again, I look forward back home to the Santa Ana Mainstem project to start construction soon. My friends in Orange County need to be protected from future floods potentially. The Norco Bluffs Project in Norco, CA, is moving ahead. Wetlands protection in Lake Elsinore, CA; the Gunderson project and flood control at Murritta Creek. Again I thank the gentleman from Pennsylvania [Mr. McDade] for this legislation.
