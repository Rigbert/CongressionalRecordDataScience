 Speaker, I rise in strong opposition to this rule. We are now 39 days into the new fiscal year, yet only 2 of 13 spending bills have been signed into law. Today, instead of moving the process along, we will again dawdle over unrelated issues such as the Istook amendment that has nothing to do with the budget and is unconstitutional and un-American. Because they can never get this legislation enacted because of its own demerits, the gentleman from Oklahoma [Mr. Istook] and his supporters are willing to shut this Government down in order to shut the American people up.  But I do not want to be unfair. The Istook language says it is OK to speak if we follow generally accepted accounting principles, subject ourselves to a Federal audit, assume the presumption of guilt, and hold ourselves out to harassing lawsuits by individuals acting as private attorney generals. Then it is OK to speak.  I urge my colleagues strongly to vote against this rule. It represents everything bad in a closed and autocratic system.
