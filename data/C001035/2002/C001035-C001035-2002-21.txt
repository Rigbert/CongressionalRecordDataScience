President, I am pleased to join with Senators Cleland, Hutchinson, Kerry, Snowe and Miller in introducing the David Jayne Medicare Homebound Modernization Act of 2002 to modernize Medicare's outdated ``homebound'' requirement that has impeded access to needed home health services for many of our nation's elderly and disabled Medicare beneficiaries.  Health care in American has gone full circle. People are spending less time in institutions, and recovery and care for patients with chronic diseases and conditions has increasingly been taking place in the home. The highly skilled and often technically complex care that our home health agencies provide have enabled millions of our most vulnerable older and disabled individuals to avoid hospitals and nursing homes and stay just where they belong, in the comfort and security of their own homes.  Under current law, a Medicare patient must be considered ``homebound'' if he or she is to be eligible for home health services. While an individual is not actually required to be bedridden to qualify for benefits, his or her conditions must be such that ``there exists a normal inability to leave home.'' The statute does allow for absences from the home of ``infrequent'' or ``relatively short duration.'' Unfortunately, however, it does not define precisely what this means. It leaves it to the fiscal intermediaries to interpret just how many absences qualify as ``frequent'' and just how short those absences must be. Interpretations of this definition have therefore varied widely.  As a consequence, there have been far too many instances where an overzealous or arbitrary interpretation of the definition has turned elderly or disabled Medicare beneficiaries, who are dependent upon Medicare home health services and medical equipment for survival, into virtual prisoners in their own home. We have heard disturbing accounts of individuals on Medicare who have had their home health benefits terminated for leaving their homes to visit a hospitalized spouse or to attend a family gathering, including, in one case, to attend the funeral of their own child.  Under current law, a Medicare patient must be considered ``homebound'' if he or she is to be eligible for home health services. While an individual is not actually required to be bedridden to quality for benefits, his or her condition must be such that ``there exists a normal inability to leave home.''  The statute does allow for absences from the home that are ``infrequent and of short duration.'' It also gives specific permission for the individual to leave home to attend medical appointments, adult day care or religious services. Otherwise, it leaves it to the fiscal intermediaries to interpret just how many absences qualify as ``frequent'' and just how short those absences must be. Interpretations of this definition have therefore varied widely.  As a consequence, there have been far too many instances where an overzealous or arbitrary interpretation of the definition has turned elderly or disabled Medicare recipients, who are dependent upon Medicare home health services and medical equipment for survival, into virtual prisoners in their own homes.  The current homebound requirement is particularly hard on younger, disabled Medicare patients. For example, I recently met with David Jayne, a 40-year old man with Lou Gehrig's disease, who is confined to a wheelchair and cannot swallow, speak or even breathe on his own. Mr. Jayne needs several skilled nursing visits per week to enable him to remain independent and out of an inpatient facility. Despite his disability, Mr. Jayne meets frequently with youth and church groups. Speaking through a computerized voice synthesizer, he gives inspirational talks about how the human spirit can endure and even overcome great hardship.  The Atlanta Journal Constitution ran a feature article on Mr. Jayne and his activities, including a report about how he had, with the help of family and friends, attended a football game to root for the University of Georgia Bulldogs. A few days later, at the direction of the fiscal intermediary, his home health agency, which had been sending a health care worker to his home for two hours, four mornings a week, notified him that he could no longer be considered homebound, and that his benefits were being cut off. While his benefits were subsequently reinstated due to the media attention given the case, this experience motivated him to launch a crusade to modernize the homebound definition and led him to found the National Coalition to Amend the Medicare Homebound Restriction.  The current homebound requirement is particularly hard on younger, disabled individuals who are on Medicare. The fact is that the current requirement reflects an outmoded view of life for persons who live with serious disabilities. The homebound criteria may have made sense thirty years ago, when an elderly or disabled person might expect to live in the confines of their home, perhaps cared for by an extended family. The current definition, however, fails to reflect the technological and medical advances that have been made in supporting individuals with significant disabilities and mobility challenges. It also fails to reflect advances in treatment for seriously ill individuals, like Mr. Jayne, which allow them brief periods of relative wellness.  It also fails to recognize that an individual's mental acuity an physical stamina can only be maintained by use, and that the use of the body and mind is encouraged by social interactions outside the four walls of a home.  The David Jayne Medicare Homebound Modernization Act of 2002 will amend the homebound definition to base eligibility for the home health benefit on the patient's functional limitations and clinical condition, rather than on an arbitrary limitation on absences from the home. It will provide a specific, limited exception to the homebound rule for individuals who:  One, have been certified by a physician has having a permanent and severe condition that will not improve;  Two, who need assistance from another person with 3 or more of the 5 activities of daily living and require technological and/or personal assistance with the act of leaving home;  Three, who have received Medicare home health services during the previous 12 month period; and  Four, who are only able to leave home because the services provided through the home health benefit makes it possible for them to do so.  We believe that our legislation is budget neutral because it is specifically limited to individuals who are already eligible for Medicare and whose conditions require the assistance of a skilled nurse, therapist or home health aide to make it functionally possible for them to leave the home. Our legislation does not expand Medicare eligibility--it simply gives people who are already eligible for the benefit their freedom.  This issue was first brought to my attention by former Senator Robert Dole, who has long been a vigorous advocate for people with disabilities. Our proposal is also supported by the Consortium of Citizens with Disabilities, the Visiting Nurse Associations of America, the National Association for Home Care, Advancing Independence: Modernizing Medicare and Medicaid, AIMM, and the National Coalition to Amend the Medicare Homebound Restriction.  Moreover, the David Jayne Medicare Homebound Modernization Act of 2002 is consistent with President Bush's ``New Freedom Initiative'' which has, as its goal, the removal of barriers that impede opportunities for those with disabilities to integrate more fully into the community. By allowing reasonable absences from the home, our amendment will bring the Medicare home health benefit into the 21st Century, and I look forward to working with my colleagues to getting it done.                                 ______                                       By
