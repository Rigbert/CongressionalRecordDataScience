Speaker, reclaiming my time, the gentleman is not correct. Let me tell you, Mr. Chairman, why you are not correct. What you do is you take a sum of money and you distribute that by formula pursuant to title VI to every school system in America that may or may not have this particular problem that I think I have identified, my constituents have identified; and what you have turned it into is a revenue-sharing program to be disseminated. Some jurisdictions, frankly, are going to get a paltry sum.
