Chairman, my amendment is simple. It would strike a pilot program that allows teenagers to drive trucks across State lines. Right now this bill mandates that we allow teenagers to become truck drivers. But, Mr. Chairman, it does not ask whether we should give them the keys.  The American public has a strong opinion on this issue. After 92 percent of the comments strongly opposed to this idea, the Federal Motor Carrier Safety Administration denied a request for a similar program in 2003. The vast majority thought it was a bad and dangerous proposal.  My amendment simply asks the Department of Transportation to take another look, a second look, before starting a national program. We need to examine the safety of places where young drivers are already allowed to drive trucks within their own States.  Interstate highways are already dangerous enough. Given the higher and higher accident and fatality rates of younger drivers, it makes no sense to make this change without looking at all of the data.  Mr. Chairman, young drivers may not have the experience needed to handle heavy, dangerous vehicles. Some follow too closely. Others go too fast and don't check their mirrors. Young drivers can use their brakes too much, and that is a real danger when handling an 80,000-pound truck.  Ask any parent. They know. Young drivers do not always listen, even when an experienced driver is in the front seat. My amendment does not say no. It says just let us do the research first. We should study the safety of teen truck drivers before any experiment that might have dangerous results.  I urge my colleagues to support my commonsense amendment.  Mr. Chairman, I reserve the balance of my time.
