 President, today I am introducing a bill to require health insurance plans to cover screening tests for cancer. The bill requires plans to cover screening tests that are currently available and for which there is broad consensus on their value. To address future changes in scientific knowledge and medical practice, the bill allows the Secretary to change the requirements upon the Secretary's initiative or upon petition by a private individual or group. This bill is a companion to H.R. 1285, introduced by Representatives Carolyn B. Maloney and Sue Kelly.  A major way to reduce the number of cancer-related deaths and increase survival is to increase screening rates. The American Cancer Society predicts that the annual cancer death rate this year--563,100 Americans--will equal five Boeing 747 jumbo jets crashing every day for a year. Because early detection can save lives, requiring plans to cover detection tests can decrease the number of people who die each year from cancer.  To put cancer deaths in perspective, the number of Americans that die each year from cancer exceeds the total number of Americans lost to all wars that we have fought in this century. The American Cancer Society estimates that over 1 million new cancer cases will be diagnosed in the United States this year, including 132,500 in California.  Despite our increasing understanding of cancer, unless we act with urgency, the cost to the United States is likely to become unmanageable in the next 10-20 years. The incidence rate of cancer in 2010 is estimated to increase by 29 percent for new cases, and cancer deaths are estimated to increase by 25 percent. Cancer will surpass heart disease as the leading fatal disease in the U.S. by 2010. With our aging U.S. population, unless we act now to change current cancer incidence and death rates, according to the September 1998 report from the Cancer March Research Task Force, we can expect over 2.0 million new cancer cases and 1.0 million deaths per year by 2025. Listen to these startling statistics:  One out of every four deaths in the U.S. is caused by cancer.  This year approximately 563,100 Americans are expected to die of cancer--more than 1,500 people a day.  There have been approximately five million cancer deaths since 1990.  Approximately 12 million new cancer cases have been diagnosed since 1990.  The National Cancer Institute estimates that approximately 8.2 million Americans alive today have a history of cancer.  One out of every two men, one out of every three women will be diagnosed with cancer at some point in their lifetime.  Too many Americans die each year from cancer. The tragedy is that we have tools available which can prevent much unnecessary suffering and death. Early detection--finding cancer early before it has spread--gives a person the best chance of being treated successfully. Early screening for breast, cervical, prostate, and colorectal cancer can increase survival rates. Having insurance coverage for cancer screenings is a major way of encouraging people to get examinations and tests.  Screening examinations, if given on an appropriate schedule by a health care professional, have proven their value. Screening-accessible cancers, such as cancers of the breast, tongue, mouth, colon, rectum, cervix, prostate, testis, and skin, account for approximately half of all new cancer cases. The five-year relative survival rate for these cancers is about 81 percent. According to the American Cancer Society, if all Americans participated in regular cancer screening, this rate could increase to more than 95 percent. For example, people can have colon cancer long before they know it. They may not have any symptoms. Patients diagnosed by a colon cancer screening have a 90 percent chance of survival while patients not diagnosed until symptoms are apparent only have a 8 percent chance of survival.  Finding cancers in their early stages can mean that treatment is less expensive. Treatment of breast, lung, and prostate cancers account for over half of annual medical costs, which by National Institutes of Health estimates is $37 billion annually.  A colon cancer screening costs approximately $125-$300.00. If a patient is not diagnosed with colon cancer until symptoms are apparent, care during the remaining 4-5 years of life can cost up to $100,000. Similarly, the initial average cost of treating rectal cancer that is detected early is about $5,700. This is approximately 75 percent less than the estimated $30,000-$40,000 it costs to treat rectal cancer that is further along in its development.  The cost of lost productivity due to cancer is $11 billion annually, while the cost of lost productivity due to premature death is $59 billion annually. We can't afford not to screen.  Insurance coverage is a major determinant in whether people obtain preventive screenings. In short, when screenings are covered by plans, people are more likely to get them. In California, screening rates for cervical and breast cancer are lower for uninsured women, who are less likely to have had a recent screening and more likely to have gone longer without being screened than women with coverage.  According to a University of California-Los Angeles Center for Health Policy Research study from February 1998, in California women ages 18-64, 63 percent of uninsured women had not had a Pap test during 1997 versus 40 percent of insured women. Additionally, approximately 67 percent of uninsured Californian women ages 30-64 had not had a clinical breast examination during 1997, compared to 40 percent for insured women in the same age group.  In 1997, Congress added cancer screening coverage under Medicare for certain cancers, such as breast and cervical. Medicare beneficiaries now receive cancer screenings without having to pay out-of-pocket for such tests. Americans under the age of 65 who are privately insured deserve the same health care. Under Medicaid, preventive services are optional benefit. States can choose to cover them or not so coverage varies state to state.  All Americans deserve access to cancer screening, regardless of whether one has health insurance because they are an employee of the Department of Defense, a Medicare beneficiary, or a veteran. Certainly individuals who have private health insurance through their employers--56 percent of Californians have private health insurance--should be guaranteed access to life-saving and life-prolonging cancer screenings. Offering coverage for cancer screening simply makes good sense.  The bill requires plans to cover screenings according to current guidelines:  Annual mammograms for women ages 40 and over and for women under 40 who are at high risk of developing breast cancer.  Annual clinical breast exams for women ages 40 and over and for women between the ages of 20 and 40 who are at high risk of developing breast cancer.  Clinical breast exams every three years for women who are between the ages of 20 and 40 and are not at high risk for developing breast cancer.  Annual pap tests and pelvic examinations for women ages 18 and over or women who are under the age of 18 and are or have been sexually active.  Screening procedures for men and women ages 50 and over or under age 50 and at high risk for developing colorectal cancer, including annual screening fecal-occult blood test and screening flexible sigmoidoscopy every 4 years.  Men and women at high risk for colorectal cancer (in any age group) may receive a screening colonoscopy every 2 years.  Annual digital rectal examination and/or annual prostate-specific blood test for men ages 50 and over or males who are at high risk.  The bill authorizes the Secretary of Health and Human Services to modify coverage requirements to reflect changes in medical practice or new scientific knowledge, based both on theSecretary's own initiative or upon petition of an individual or organization.  Cancer touches virtually every American in some way. The Comprehensive Cancer Screening Act can be one way to alleviate the fear and reality of cancer felt by millions of Americans. We all want to believe that when a family member is diagnosed with cancer, he or she will get care of the highest quality and that their medical team will conquer this disease. Early detection, while it does not prevent cancer from occurring, can stop cancer before it spreads, extend life, reduce treatment costs, and improve the quality of life for cancer patients. By requiring private health plans to cover cancer screening as a preventive measure, my bill is cost effective and could ease the cancer burden felt by America due to lost productivity related to cancer deaths and illness.  It is long past due for this Congress to send a strong message to insurance companies. Cancer screening is an important prevention measure and should be covered under all insurance plans. America cannot afford not to screen.                          ____________________
