 His hope was to lift the debate out of the gritty legislative particulars, and we all understand that. Unfortunately, the situation the President described last night bears very little resemblance to the realities on the ground right here in Washington.  I know the President would rather give speeches about our problems than resolve them, but he wasn't elected to talk about the United States; he was elected to lead it. In our system of government, that means working with people and a Congress with which you sometimes disagree. This is not a unique situation. Other Presidents have been in a similar situation where they had to work with a Congress composed of people, many of whom disagreed with them.  Last night, the President rejected not just the only proposal that has passed either House of Congress, he rejected the only plan the Democrats have proposed as well, a plan that would increase the debt limit without raising taxes. Just a few days ahead of a potential default, the President announced that he is the only person in Washington still calling for a massive tax hike, even as his party has dropped their own demands for what we know will make the current unemployment situation even worse.  In short, the President is now clinging to two things we all know Congress can't support: a massive tax hike and the biggest debt limit increase in history aimed, in his own words, at getting himself past the next election. As Speaker Boehner said last night, that is just not going to happen.
