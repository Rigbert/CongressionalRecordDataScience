Chairman, I know that every Member would, if we were going to take the time, rise to express their deep affection and respect and admiration for you, my friend. And I count it a great honor that you have been my friend for every year that I have served in the Congress, and I am looking forward to being with you for a long time to come.                          Honoring Sally Crowe
