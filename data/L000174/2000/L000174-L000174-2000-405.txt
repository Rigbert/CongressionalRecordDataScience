President, nearly 30 years ago, my predecessor, the late Senator George D. Aiken, rose to report to the Senate on a new Vermont initiative called ``Green Up Day.'' He described an effort, then in its second year, in which thousands of Vermont citizen volunteers of all ages combed the streets, highways, back roads, and village greens to pick up litter and beautify their state.  Another distinguished colleague of mine, Senator Robert Stafford, kept these same Vermonters' thoughts in mind when he courageously led this Senate in the fight to build strong national environmental policies--including Superfund--to protect public health, air, water, and land.  The very first Green Up Day was a simple initiative born on April 18 of 1970--a few days before the first Earth Day. Today it is an annual Vermont tradition. On May 6, 2000, thousands of Vermonters will celebrate the official 30th anniversary of ``Green Up Day'' just as they have for so many years--by picking up trash bags and devoting their day to the beautification and clean up of our Green Mountain State.  Over the years, one organization, Vermont Green Up, has diligently coordinated volunteers and spread the ideas of Green Up Day. Vermont Green Up has sponsored annual poster contests for students, cleaned up several illegal dumps, and helped other states--and even other countries--organize their own ``Green Up'' efforts.  In fact, my own daughter, Alicia, thought so much of Vermont Green Up that she served as their Executive Director for a few years. Alicia had the pleasure of serving in that position with Bob Stafford on the board. She also made sure her father was out picking up trash with her on Green Up Day!  I congratulate Vermont Green Up, the financial sponsors supporting Green Up Day, and the thousands of Green Up Day volunteers. These are the people who continue to make the first Saturday in May an extraordinary day for Vermont's environment. The fact that we are now celebrating the 30th anniversary of Green Up Day is a testament to these Vermonters untiring dedication to the environment of our Green Mountain State.                          ____________________
