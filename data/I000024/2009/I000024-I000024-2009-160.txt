President, section 2094 of the bill requires the Secretary to submit written certification if a program is not terminated that states the acquisition program is essential to the national security, that no alternatives meet the joint military requirement, the new estimates are reasonable, and the management structure is adequate to manage and control the program acquisition cost. I concur with the certification process, but no similar requirement is there for the termination of an acquisition program. That is an area in which oversight is required and information critical as we continue to improve the acquisition process, which I believe this legislation will do.  My amendment requires the Secretary of Defense to submit a written report explaining the reasons for terminating the program, alternatives considered to address any problems in the program, and the course of action the Department of Defense plans to pursue to meet continuing joint military requirements intended to be met by the program being canceled. This report will provide Congress with historical documentation of the terminated or failed programs and why they are terminated.  Essentially, the language of the amendment is simply the requirement that if a program is terminated, submit to Congress a written report setting forth three things: One, an explanation of the reason for terminating the program; two, the alternatives considered to address any problems in the program; three, the course the Department plans to pursue to meet any continuing joint military requirements otherwise intended to be met by the program.  In other words, it makes the same requirement on terminated programs as others. This has already been adopted en bloc, and I have no motion to make.  I yield the floor and suggest the absence of a quorum.
