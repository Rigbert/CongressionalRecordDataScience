 President, we are about to vote. I had an opportunity to speak earlier today. Let me conclude and then yield back whatever time remains by saying Mr. Negroponte is a serious diplomat with significant experience. When he appeared before our committee, he impressed me that he was more likely to be straightforward and unequivocal in answering our questions.  I will end where I began. I quite frankly think we owe him and his wife a debt of gratitude for being willing to take on what, without exception, in my view, is the most difficult and, at this moment, most dangerous job in U.S. diplomacy.  I urge my colleagues to vote for Mr. Negroponte, notwithstanding that they may feel, as I do, that this administration's policy on how to handle the circumstance in Iraq has been seriously wanting.  Do not confuse the lack of a coherent policy, from my perspective, anyway, with a lack of competence and ability of Ambassador Negroponte. I urge a yes vote on Ambassador Negroponte.  Mr. President, I yield the remainder of my time.
