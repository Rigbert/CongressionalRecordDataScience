President, thousands of people come to Washington, DC, each year to learn about the history of our country and the legacy left to us by the great men and women that have built the strongest, most powerful nation the world has ever known--the United States of America.  Our country's finest hours have been ones where prejudice and discrimination have been acknowledged and addressed. The key to our overcoming and addressing discrimination has been education and understanding.  The most recent debate over the FDR Memorial is an opportunity for our country to once again beat back discrimination. Discrimination is not always blatant. Discrimination also includes exclusion.  I strongly believe that portraying FDR in a wheelchair in one of the three statues that are being built as part of the memorial would be an incredibly powerful statement to all who visit this tribute to a great, vibrant, forceful leader. The fact that FDR had polio and spent most of his waking hours as President working in his wheelchair does not change any of these truths. In fact, FDR's disability was a great source of his strength.  A main tenet of the Americans with Disabilities Act of 1990 was to ensure that the Federal Government plays a central role in enforcing the standards established in the act on behalf of individuals with disabilities.  In this effort, I hope that the FDR Memorial Commission will depict President Roosevelt as he was--a great, courageous man who had polio and still led our Nation.  I ask unanimous consent that an editorial from the New York Times and a letter from eight of FDR's grandchildren to Michael Deland and Alan Reich of the National Organization on Disability be printed in the Record.  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in the Record, as follows:                [From the New York Times, May 12, 1996]                         The Airbrush of Power       Most Americans are aware, if sometimes vaguely, that      Franklin Roosevelt was stricken by polio in 1921 and was      unable thereafter to stand unassisted. Yet there will be no      visual reminder of this fact in the F.D.R. memorial due to be      dedicated in Washington next spring. On the contrary, he is      to be shown standing tall in one of three sculptures planned      for the seven-acre site on the banks of the Potomac.       This fiction, however benign, is being protested by the      National Organization on Disability, whose chairman, Michael      Deland, urges that at least one bronze image depict F.D.R. as      he often was, in a wheelchair. Logic and sentiment support      Mr. Deland. But alas, the leaden weight of tradition stands      all too squarely behind the memorial commission's penchant      for make-believe.       Through the ages, rulers of every stripe, male and female,      have sought to improve upon or alter nature. The Egyptians      led the way. Ramses II was not content to show himself mowing      down adversaries in scores of battle friezes. His artists had      to depict him twice as big as everyone else. Going further,      Queen Hatshepsut, the first great female ruler known to      history, had herself replicated in stone with a false beard,      thus visually changing her sex.       Roman emperors and their wives were tidied up in marble and      bronze, their faces deftly nipped and tucked on imperial      coins. European rulers in the Middle Ages invoked theology to      justify the lies of art. Every monarch, it was said, is at      once mortal and incorporeal, so that in a higher realm all      were immune to the blemishes of the flesh.     On their death, an image was carved delineating their      idealized features.       We learn through written records, not portraits, of Richard      III's crookback and Henry VIII's terminal corpulence. In art,      Elizabeth I is always the same iconic virgin queen; in life,      she banish mirrors from her palaces as her hair thinned and      her cheeks hollowed. In the same spirit, Elizabeth II, who      has turned 70, has firmly resisted suggestions that she      permit an updating on coins of her youthful profile, as      Queen. Victoria did after her Jubilee in 1887.       By contrast, the Puritan regicide Oliver Cromwell is said      to have told the artist Lely: ``Flatter me not at all. But      remark all these roughnesses, pimples, warts, and everything      as you see me. Otherwise I will not pay a farthing for it.''      Yet this splendid story was printed long after Cromwell's      death and may be apocryphal, according to his biographer,      Anotonia Fraser. More characteristic was Winston Churchill's      response to an unflattering portrait by Graham Sutherland. he      hid it away, Dorian Gray fashion. Some years later his widow,      Clementine, apparently burned it.       Presidential portraits in the White House are a study in      illusionist brushwork. Richard Nixon resembles a scoutmaster,      Lyndon Johnson everybody's kindly uncle, and John Kennedy a      saintly matinee idol. Interestingly, a dark and gloomy      portrait of Lincoln is tucked from sight in the Lincoln      bedroom. It was painted in 1930 by Douglas Volk, whose      father, Leonard, once sculpted Lincoln from life. The son's      haunting portrait, or a copy of it, turns up in Oliver      Stone's film about Nixon, who at one point talks to the      painting.       Official art, in real life, rarely speaks truth to power.      It would indeed be refreshing, even liberating, for the      memorial to show F.D.R. as he was. According to Mr. Deland,      who uses a wheelchair himself, only two photographs are known      to survive showing Roosevelt in the same device. This is the      result of an unwritten protective rule among White House      photographers. Like the kings of old, and most sitting      politicians today, F.D.R. wanted his incorporeal self to      linger in posterity's memory.                                                                    ____                                               Anne Roosevelt,                                                   April 29, 1996.       Dear Messrs. Deland and Reich, Franklin Delano Roosevelt      looms large in the hearts and minds of many, including his      grandchildren who now survive. Some of us knew him      personally, but most of us did not. We hold him in memory, as      families will, as a whole person whose life touched a nation      and whose affection still reaches us. We want him to be      remembered as he was, in all his strength, courage and      humanity.       It is quite clear that FDR developed his strength of      character, determination and discipline most distinctly as a      result of his having polio. He also became a more sympathetic      and modest person. He made a political decision to downplay      his disability because of his understanding of the role of      public perception and the norms of the day. At times he did      not.       But when it came to inspiring and encouraging others who      were disabled--such as at his beloved Warm Springs, Georgia,      or with amputees and wounded soldiers in wartime hospitals--     he freely showed himself in wheelchairs or on crutches, with      braces. He was in no way embarrassed by his disability. Life      was bigger than that.       Were he alive today we are convinced that he would wish to      have the people of this country and the world understand his      disability. He would be comfortable, possibly eager, in light      of current increased understanding of disability issues, to      share awareness of his and other types of disabilities and      others. We firmly believe that more factual knowledge,      particularly about and from public leaders, encourages and      inspires those without disability to accept and support all      people, including people with disabilities to live full,      productive and joyful lives.       FDR's commitment to leadership, to excellence and to life,      with a disability not well understood by many, nor accepted      by some, sustained him and the Nation through one of the most      challenging periods in American history. There is no better      memorial than a complete picture of who he was.       While we wish no delay in the construction of the proposed      memorial we urge an adequate inclusion of all facets of the      man as he was, not as some think he ought to have been.           Sincerely,         Anne Roosevelt, on behalf of Chandler Roosevelt Lindsley,            Christopher D. Roosevelt, Eleanor Roosevelt Seagraves,            Franklin Roosevelt III, Kate Roosevelt Whitney, Nina            Roosevelt Gibson, James Roosevelt, Esquire.                          ____________________
