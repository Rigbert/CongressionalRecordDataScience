Speaker, I wanted to follow on the remarks of our distinguished minority leader here. This is a serious moment for our country. Our congressional office has now been in receipt of phone calls from constituents who are not able to get their passports processed because of the shutdown of the Government. So, in addition to veterans, whose checks are being threatened at this point because this Congress and this Speaker chooses not to move legislation through this body that will keep the various agencies operating, and not inconveniencing the public during this very busy travel season, it is truly a tragedy what is happening here just to make some sort of political point.  Mr. Speaker, I think it is time for people here to grow up or get out, and to deliver the kind of services to the American public that they expect of us. We have thousands of families across this country who have filed for home mortgages that have a relationship to HUD where they insure and process those mortgages. Mr. Speaker, 20,000 of those a month cannot be processed because of this Government shutdown.  We are inconveniencing the American people from coast to coast. We have tourists all around this country that cannot get into the monuments. Think of when in recent history my colleagues ever remember this happening. This does not need to happen, especially during this very important season of the year when so many people are traveling and expecting the goodwill that this season represents to govern our actions toward others.                      yes! toledo wins in overtime  Mr. Speaker, I came to the floor this afternoon on a little bit lighter subject, and I would like to say that my good colleague from the State of Nevada has elected not to join me here this afternoon, but I am compelled to rise to tell my colleagues that if they happened to miss the first college bowl game of the 1995 season, they may have missed the best, most historic bowl game of the year.  Mr. Speaker, in the Las Vegas Bowl, the still undefeated University of Toledo Rockets beat the University of Nevada Wolf Pack 40 to 37 in the first overtime game in the history of post-season college football.  It was a close game, as evidenced by the 34 to 34 fourth quarter score sparkling with flashes of offensive brilliance on both sides. But in overtime, Reno's Wolf Pack defense could not withstand the onslaught of Rocket star Wasean Tate's powerful running game. Tate scored a touchdown and the game, as it is often said and this time never more true, was history.  Mr. Speaker, I want to thank my colleague, the gentlewoman from Nevada [Mrs. Vucanovich], for graciously honoring our friendly wager by awarding our team this Nevada Wolf Pack sweatshirt, which I intend to present to the team at an appropriate moment, for it was they who won it fair and square.  Mr. Speaker, I want to say to the Rockets, because I know many of them are listening, and as this particular T-shirt indicates over here, are undefeated champs of the mid-American conference. Our newspaper had a complete front page headline: ``Toledo Rockets Win Vegas Bowl.'' We are so extremely proud of them and their hard work.  Go Rockets and Go Toledo and thank you, Mrs. Vucanovich.                          ____________________
