Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.  Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of H.R. 2795. In addition to providing for continued water deliveries to irrigators, this legislation will allow work to continue on the environmental impact statement, our plan to improve wildlife habitat in the central Platte region in Nebraska. Endangered Species Act compliance will also continue during the term of the contracted extension. The committee agreed to the amendments suggested by the administration which ensure that the water contracts are not extended indefinitely. It is my understanding the administration has no objection to the enactment of the bill as reported by the Committee on Resources. I thank the chairman of the Subcommittee on Water Power for his cooperation, and I urge my colleagues to support H.R. 2795.
