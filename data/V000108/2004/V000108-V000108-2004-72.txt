Speaker, it is with great honor and enthusiasm that I congratulate the Nativity of Our Savior Church in Portage, IN, as they celebrate their 40th anniversary. During the weekend of September 11, 2004, and September 12, 2004, the Nativity of Our Savior Church will be celebrating their anniversary with an Anniversary Celebration Mass and an All-Parish Anniversary Celebration Family Picnic.  The Catholic faith began in Portage in the 1600's with early settlers and French trappers, and they named the area ``New France.'' In 1882, Joseph Bailly, one of those early settlers, established a trading post which he called ``Bailly-Town.'' This area included a chapel for his family as well as other nearby villagers to worship in. During the early 1960's, the Diocese of Gary purchased the land that is now the Nativity Parish and School.  As the population grew in Portage, Bishop Andrew Grutka along with other parish members, established a larger church, which was called ``The Chapel on the Mall'' because it was located at the north end of the Portage Shopping Mall. In 1964, this 10' by 50' drive-in church was visited by over 450 cars at each Sunday mass. It was in July 1965 that the Nativity of Our Savior Church was officially established with Father Joseph Till as its first pastor. On October 31, 1965, during the Feast of Christ the King, Nativity of Our Savior became a permanent church and it was formally dedicated by Bishop Grutka on Saturday, March 12, 1966.  In September 1975, the Nativity School opened its doors to 95 students in its first year. Since the founding of the Nativity of Our Savior Church in 1964 and the opening of the school in 1975, there have been many influential pastors who have led the congregation. These include: Father Joseph Till, Father William Spranger, Monsignor Carl Mengeling, Monsignor John Morales, Father John Scott, Father Patrick Kalich, and currently Father Walter Rakoczy. Today, the Nativity of Our Savior Church has over 2,200 registered families, over 200 students in their parish school, and over 600 students in their religious education program.  Mr. Speaker, I ask that you and my other distinguished colleagues join me in honoring and congratulating the Nativity of Our Savior Church on their 40th anniversary. They have provided support and guidance for all those in the Portage community, and will continue to serve their community through their selfless dedication and commitment.                          ____________________
