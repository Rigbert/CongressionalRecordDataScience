 President, just a moment ago, the Senate acted to send the President one of the most important policy bills we consider each year--the National Defense Authorization Act.  Not only will this legislation authorize the resources, capabilities, pay, and benefits our men and women in uniform need to perform their missions, but this year's bill also goes further. It takes a notable step toward authorizing the resources needed to start rebuilding our military and restoring combat readiness.  It will help improve our missile defense capabilities and better prepare us to deal with cyber threats. It will authorize a well-deserved pay raise for our men and women in uniform while providing for continued reform of the benefits they and their families rely upon, and it will support the thousands of military servicemembers and families serving at military installations in Kentucky and in the Kentucky National Guard.  Further, this bill strives to bring reform to the Pentagon. As Senator McCain said of the NDAA a few months ago, it will ``[build] upon the sweeping reforms that Congress has passed in recent years.'' He is right, and none of this would have been possible without him, without his leadership.  I think I can speak for everyone in this Chamber when I say that our friend Senator McCain has served with distinction as chairman of the Armed Services Committee. I know the ranking member on his committee, Senator Reed, thinks so as well. I know a lot of Members on both sides of the aisle do too.  Senator McCain's commitment to our men and women in uniform is obvious, and it is unwavering. He respects these brave Americans immensely; he cares about them deeply; and he understands better than just about anyone how important a bill like this is to them, not only on a policy level but on a personal level as well.
