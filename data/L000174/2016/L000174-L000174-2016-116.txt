President, Vermonters have many heroes, among them the original Green Mountain Boy, Ethan Allen. Today marks an important milestone in both Vermont and U.S. history as we remember the many contributions of Ethan Allen. Both a political and military figure in the years leading up to the American Revolution, Ethan Allen played a key role in championing Vermont statehood, setting our State on the path to be the standard bearer it is today on so many issues. Ethan Allen was instrumental in the capture of Fort Ticonderoga from British forces in 1775, which contributed significantly to the success of the new nation in its fight for independence.  Ethan Allen is among the Founders of my home State of Vermont and an original organizer of the Green Mountain Boys--a rough and tumble bunch who did their part in the fight for independence in the Revolutionary War. His legacy lives on in Vermont today. Ethan Allen is celebrated annually by hundreds of people, from Vermont and across the Nation, who visit his historic homestead in Burlington to commemorate his life and to celebrate his contributions to American history.  Understanding our heritage means understanding the achievements and the sacrifices that have been made by so many, in forging the great State and the great Nation that is part of our legacy as Vermonters and as Americans. Looking to heroes like Ethan Allen helps us to appreciate, protect, and build an even brighter future for generations of Americans and generations of Vermonters to come.                          ____________________
