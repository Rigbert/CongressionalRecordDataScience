Sabo), the manager of the Democratic team, is not on the floor, but I know he would want me to congratulate you. As painful as defeat is, we graciously acknowledge that the second inning was devastating in which you scored 9, 10, 11 runs. It is going up, 10 runs, I guess. And it would be not as gracious to observe that other than that second inning, the game was pretty good. But I congratulate the gentleman on behalf of the somewhat gracious losers.
