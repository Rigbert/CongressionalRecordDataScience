 Otherwise, the amendment is the same as what has passed the House of Representatives and the President said he would sign.  I hope we have an opportunity to get 60 votes for cloture on the amendment and that we are able to get that amendment adopted, get the bill to the President for signature, and consequently, then, immediately--not 3 or 4 months down the road when we have a conference committee trying to reach some agreement--get help to stimulate the economy through accelerated depreciation for business, through middle-income-tax reduction, making it permanent the 27-percent bracket down to 25-percent bracket, and tax rebates for low-income people to stimulate the economy on the demand side, consumer spending. All three are meant to create jobs and will create jobs.  Also, this amendment is for the displaced workers; those mostly affected because of what happened on September 11 will get an increase of unemployment compensation of 13 weeks and a 60-percent tax credit for health insurance, and we do it in a way that people can have the option, if they do not want COBRA, to have other insurance, and also to help those who did not have any COBRA insurance where last employed.  It is a well-rounded stimulus package that will get the job done. The fact that it passed the House of Representatives and will be signed by the President is reason enough for this body to adopt it, particularly because in this body nothing gets done that is not bipartisan. This has bipartisan support.  I yield the floor and suggest the absence of a quorum.
