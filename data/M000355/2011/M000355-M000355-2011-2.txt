 President, I rise to pay tribute to a woman who was a dear friend of mine, now sadly departed, who was deeply committed to serving her community in northern Kentucky, and who left everything she touched a little better off than it was before she found it. I'm speaking of Mrs. Mary Middleton of Fort Mitchell, KY, who tragically died in an accident on November 22, 2011. She was 83 years old.  I know northern Kentucky would not be the same if not for the timeless dedication of Mary and her family over more than five decades. A community leader, philanthropist, lifelong adventurer and supporter of public service, Mary Middleton's loss is a great loss for the people of Kenton County and the entire Commonwealth of Kentucky.  Mary grew up in Wisconsin, although there's no doubt that after more than 50 years Kentucky was her home. As a young woman she was keen on traveling the world. Also a frugal woman, she attempted to do so on ten dollars a day. Somewhere in France she ran out of money and had to telegraph her father to send her some more.  Mary also went to work for the YWCA as a way to travel and have someone other than her father foot the bill. On a YWCA assignment in Hawaii, she met a young Naval officer named Clyde Middleton. The couple married, and when Clyde was transferred to Cincinnati by his employer Procter & Gamble, eventually settled in northern Kentucky.  ``They got off the airplane and saw all the beautiful trees and said this is where we want to live,'' says their son, John Middleton, who is the Kenton County circuit court clerk. ``And northern Kentucky is a much better place because she was here.''  Mary was determined to make her mark early. In the 1950s, she ran for a Kentucky State House seat as a Republican, at a time in Kentucky when it was impossible to be elected unless you were a man and a Democrat. Thankfully, times have changed on both counts.  Mary did not succeed in that race, but she didn't let that stop her from having an influence. In 1960, she founded the Kenton County Republican Women's Club, an organization that is still one of the strongest and most active of its type in the State. And Mary continued to be involved with the club until her passing.  Mary also played a critical role in supporting her husband Clyde's political career during his two decades of public service in the Kentucky legislature and as Kenton County judge- executive. And as I already mentioned, her son John is currently the Kenton County circuit court clerk. Public service runs in the Middleton family.  So has compassion for those who are less fortunate. Mary showed that compassion in so many ways--through her volunteer work with the Salvation Army, the Red Cross, Church Women United, and her home church of Gloria Dei Lutheran. Somehow she also found time to dedicate to the Covington Optimist Club and the Florence Woman's Club, as well as the Kenton County Republican Women's Club she founded.  The day before she died, Mary drove a cancer patient to treatment at St. Elizabeth Hospital, something she and Clyde had done for years. Mary was a teacher at the McMillan Center Alternative School. The Cincinnati Enquirer honored her in 1981 as a Woman of the Year.  This Christmas season, as Kentuckians flock to the shopping malls and stores, they will walk by the familiar Salvation Army red kettle and hear the bell. Sadly, one bell ringer who will be missing is Mary Middleton.  It's a testament to the effect she had on others that, within days of her death, dozens of volunteers in Kenton County stepped forward to fill the hole she left behind and ring that bell.  Elaine and I are profoundly saddened by the loss of Mary Middleton, and our deepest condolences go to her family: her husband, Clyde; her sons, John, David, and Richard; her daughter, Ann Schmidt; her eight grandchildren, and many other beloved family members and friends.  Mr. President, I know my colleagues here in the U.S. Senate join me in honoring Mrs. Mary Middleton, mourning her loss, and wishing for comfort for her family. The Cincinnati Enquirer recently published an article celebrating Mary's life. I ask be unanimous consent that it be printed in the Record.  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in the Record, as follows:             [From the Cincinnati Enquirer, Nov. 23, 2011]   Northern Kentucky Matriarch Mary Middleton Killed by Garbage Truck Mary Was An Organizer, A Leader, And An Inspiration To Anyone Who Met                                   Her                          (By Brenna R. Kelly)       Fort Mitchell.--No one was a stranger to Mary Middleton.      Whether it was the people donating money as she rang the bell      for the Salvation Army, the cancer patients she drove to      treatment or the new family who moved onto her street--she      cared.       Middleton, who was the first northern Kentucky Republican      woman to run for office and later became a well-known      philanthropist, was hit and killed by a garbage     truck Tuesday morning in front of the Fort Mitchell Avenue      home where she lived for 52 years. She was 83. ``She loved      making people feel good,'' said her son John Middleton,      Kenton Circuit Court Clerk. ``I think that's what's going to      be the loss, not just for us, but for the whole northern      Kentucky community.''       It was raining Tuesday morning about 10:20 a.m. when Mary      Middleton apparently took a bag of garbage out to a Bavarian      garbage truck on her street. Police were still investigating      how the accident occurred, but the truck hit Middleton in the      street.       Emergency responders called for a medical helicopter but it      was unable to respond because of the weather. Middleton died      at the scene. The driver of the truck was taken to St.      Elizabeth Hospital to be tested for drugs or alcohol, which      is routine after a fatal accident involving a commercial      truck, said Fort Mitchell Police Chief Jeff Eldridge.       The driver, John Boaz, has worked for the company for 15      years, said Bavarian spokesman Rick Bruggemann. ``Our deepest      condolences and prayers go out to the family,'' Bruggemann      said. Boaz, who has an excellent safety record, was      devastated, he said.       Accident reconstruction experts from Erlanger Police and      the Boone County Sheriff's Office are helping Fort Mitchell      investigate the accident.       Middleton's husband, former Kenton County Judge-Executive      Clyde Middleton, was at home when his wife was hit. He called      John Middleton at work and word quickly spread across      northern Kentucky Republican circles. As Mary Middleton's      body lay in the street covered by a sheet and shielded by      yellow tarps, family and friends began gathering at the red      brick home near the Fort Mitchell Country Club.       One of those friends, Shawn Baker, rushed to the home to be      with the family.       ``I admired Mary more than any person I know,'' said Baker,      of Crestview Hills, who was in the Kenton County Republican      Women's Club and several other groups with Middleton. ``She      had so much class. Mary was an organizer, a leader, and an      inspiration to anyone who met her.''       Though she was better known as a political wife, it was      Mary who made the family's first foray into politics. In the      late 1950s she ran for state representative at a time when      the area elected men and Democrats, said family friend and      Kenton County Republican activist Rick Robinson.       She then supported her husband through his two decades in      the Kentucky Senate and more than seven years in Kenton      County's top job before he resigned in 1998 after a      controversy involving the awarding of a courthouse      construction bid.       ``She was the perfect political wife too, she pushed Dad to      do the things and to be nice to people when maybe he didn't      want to be nice,'' John Middleton said.       Mary Middleton grew up in Wisconsin but was adventurous and      left to travel the world. After trying to see the world on      $10 a day, she ran out of money in France and had to      telegraph her father for money, her son said.       She went to work for the YWCA, which sent her to work in      Hawaii where she met Clyde, a Naval officer. She followed him      to Japan and the couple married.       Eventually, Clyde Middleton ended up working for Procter &      Gamble in Chicago. When he was transferred to Cincinnati, the      Middletons settled in northern Kentucky.       ``They got off the airplane and saw all the beautiful trees      and said this is where we want to live,'' John Middleton      said. ``And northern Kentucky is a much better place because      she was here.''       In addition to the Salvation Army, she volunteered for the      Red Cross, Church Women United, Kentucky Symphony and at her      church, Gloria Dei Lutheran. She was also active in the      Covington Optimist Club, the Florence Woman's Club and Kenton      County Republican Women's Club, which she founded 51 one      years ago.       In 1981, she was honored by the Enquirer as a Woman of the      Year. She was also a teacher at the McMillan Center      Alternative School.       ``She was everybody's mother,'' said Kenton County Sheriff      Chuck Korzenborn, a Republican who counted Middleton as one      of his first supporters when he ran for sheriff. ``She was a      person who had only one thing on her mind, what was good for      the community and the people in it.''       ``Mary's fine, she's with her maker and with the Lord.      She's fine, but the people down here are going to miss her      very, very much.''       On Monday, Mary Middleton drove a cancer patient for      treatment at St. Elizabeth Hospital, something that she and      her husband had done for years. On Tuesday, she was planning      her regular visit to a nursing home, where she sat with      friends and strangers alike.       ``She was truly a humble servant,'' said Becky Sittason,      whose grandmother Middleton was planning to visit. ``She      doesn't have to flaunt it or say `here is who I helped.' ''       Sittason, who has known Middleton since she was 6, only      found out she volunteered as a bell ringer when she read it      last year in the newspaper.       Of all the organizations she was involved in, the Salvation      Army was special to Middleton, said both Baker and her son.      She helped organize the charity's annual fashion show and      would line up volunteers to ring the bell along with her.       ``She would never ask anyone to do something that she      wouldn't do herself,'' Baker said.       Middleton rang the bell for more than 20 years and      recruited her entire family for shifts at local stores.       ``It just makes your Christmas to know you've done a little      something for other people,'' she told the Enquirer last      year.       In addition to her husband and son John, of Edgewood, she      is survived by her sons David, of Lexington; Richard, of      Independence; daughter Ann Schmidt, of Orlando; and eight      grandchildren.       ``Each one of the children could say that they felt      special,'' John Middleton said, ``and they were her favorite;      that's because she made you feel that way.''       ``She always went out of her way to do what's right and to      make everybody feel the best about themselves,'' he said.       When she died Tuesday, there was a note on her desk she had      just written welcoming a family that had recently moved onto      the street.       ``She didn't know who they were,'' her son said, ``but she      wanted to make them feel welcomed. People don't do that as      much now days, but she did.''       Funeral arrangements are pending with Linnemann Funeral      Homes.  Mr. McCONNELL. Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.
