 President, once again, I say to my friend from Tennessee, to call an agency of the government for the purpose of implementing a gag order against a company that is speaking freely about the impact of legislation on its business and its employees is an astonishing thing to behold in the United States of America.  I assume the particular industry the Senator from Tennessee is talking about, which has been out running millions of ads in support of what the administration is trying to do, is not getting such threats.
