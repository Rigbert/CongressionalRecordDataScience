 Those of us who have wiled away the time sometimes on long airplane trips reading a bad book, we know a lot of bad books have ghostwriters. Well, a lot of bad bills that come before the Congress also have ghost writers.  If one reads through this 1,100-page Energy bill, they can tell actually who the ghostwriters were: The oil, the gas, the coal, and the ethanol industries that--surprise, surprise--are going to get almost $200 billion in tax subsidies from this bill. The voices of those ghostwriters echo throughout the bill.  The cost to the taxpayers does not stop there. If taxpayers feel their wallets are getting lighter this week, it is because this bill will cost them another $70-plus billion in other subsidies over the next 10 years. Unfortunately, the 1,100 pages of this bill are full of special interest giveaways, but they are empty of innovative and sustainable energy policy, a policy that would ensure Americans a clean, reliable, and affordable policy in the future.  Some of our colleagues are trying to sell this bill to the American public as a balanced energy plan, something that would give our Nation energy security over the decades to come. It is not that. It only increases our reliance on unsustainable petroleum-based energy sources. It undercuts recent progress in developing renewable energy sources and technologies that reduce pollution. It undermines the reliability of our electricity markets by opening the door to more manipulation and mergers in stalling regional efforts to improve the transmission grid.  The Senate sent a decent Energy bill to conference. What did we get back? We got a frog. We went from the prince to the frog, not the other way around. The roster of squandered taxpayers' dollars and squandered opportunities in this bill is breathtaking to behold.  Now the American people might have expected us to learn from this summer's blackout. After all, it should be fresh in our experiences and our minds. It cost governments and businesses billions of dollars. We could have used this bill to address what went wrong. We could have used it to build upon what is right. Incredibly, the bill does the opposite.  New England, where we rely on energy--as all parts of the country do--is also a part of the country where we can get 10, 20, 30 below zero sometimes. We have already created a regional organization to increase reliability of our transmission lines. In fact, that was able to stop the blackout from cascading further into Vermont and other States. Instead of using an organization that we know works as a model, this bill actually discourages utilities in other regions of the country from joining regional organizations. It would also discourage badly needed new investment in the transmission grid.  Apparently, we can only invest in transmission grids if they are in Iraq. We cannot invest in them when they are in our own country.  There is also no prohibition on the price gouging schemes employed by companies such as Enron, even though the Senate, on a wide margin, voted for that.  The bill repeals a 70-year-old law to restrict mergers of utility companies with other companies where they have no expertise. In the past, that has caused financial troubles for utilities and consequently the ratepayers.  One might have hoped the bill could have done more to emphasize technological innovation, promote clean and sustainable energy, but it does not. Instead of working to advance technologies to create jobs and reduce pollution, we have a bill that gives oil, gas, ethanol, and nuclear companies enormous subsidies.  One of the things it does, in my own State of Vermont, is it hands Vermont drivers a double whammy by mandating the use of 5 billion gallons of ethanol by 2012 while threatening deep revenue losses in the highway trust fund. Under this bill, Vermonters and drivers in other States can expect higher prices at the pump due to this mandate and more potholes in the road due to the trust fund cuts.  We have heard talk about MTBE producers. We know this protects producers of the gasoline additive MTBE from liability, but in Vermont and around the country States and communities face multimillion-dollar bills for cleaning up the MTBE that is already in the ground water. And, to stop the cases filed, the Energy bill makes the provision retroactive. It wipes out cases filed in September by several New York communities, cases filed by the State of the distinguished Presiding Officer, New Hampshire. The list goes on and on but so do the echoes of the ghostwriter's voice in this bill.  This turkey would waive environmental analyses for energy projects on public lands, exempt them from the Clean Water Act, Safe Drinking Water Act, open coastal areas to oil and gas development, reduce support for clean coal technology, and this bill will simply mean that more toxic pollutants like mercury will get dumped on Vermont's forests and our lakes and our rivers.  Shortly after the administration entered the White House, it closed the doors to the public and they started to put together the energy industry's wish list of subsidies--environmental and consumer protection rollbacks. If we pass this bill, we are going to say Christmas came before Thanksgiving for these special interests.  I don't see how, at a time when we are justifying drastic cuts to vital social programs, we can push through a $100 billion counterproductive budget buster for the energy industry.  As I said, many a bad book has a ghostwriter, and so do many bad bills. When you read through this 1,100-page energy bill, it is clear who the ghostwriter were: the oil, gas, coal and ethanol industries that--surprise, surprise--would reap almost $20 billion tax subsidies from this bill. The voices of these ghostwriters echo throughout this bill.  But the cost to taxpayers does not stop there. If taxpayers feel their wallets getting lighter this week it's because this bill will cost them another seventy-plus billion dollars in other subsidies over the next 10-years.  Unfortunately, the 1,100 pages are full of special interest giveaways but empty of innovative and sustainable energy policy that will ensure Americans clean, reliable and affordable power in the future.  Some of our Republican colleagues are trying to sell this bill to the American public as a balanced energy plan to give our Nation energy security over the decades to come. It is not.  It will only increase our reliance on unsustainable, petroleum-based energy sources. It undercuts recent progress in developing renewable energy sources and technologies that reduce pollution. It undermines the reliability of our electricity markets by opening the door to more manipulation and mergers and stalling regional efforts to improve the transmission grid.  The Senate sent a decent energy bill to conference, and we got back a frog. The roster of squandered taxpayers' dollars and squandered opportunities in this bill is breathtaking to behold.  The American people could have expected that we could have learned from this summer's blackout--still fresh in our experience and on our minds--and used this bill to address what went wrong and build upon what went right.  Incredibly, this bill does the opposite. In New England, we have already created a regional organization to increase reliability of our transmission liens. It was able to stop the blackout from cascading farther into Vermont and other States. Instead of using this organization as a model, this bill actually discourages utilities in other regions of the country from joining regional organizations. It could also discourage badly needed new investment in the transmission grid.  The bill also does not do enough to protect consumers and ratepayers from manipulation of energy markets. There is no prohibition on the price-gouging schemes employed by companies like Enron, even through the Senate supported such protections by a wide margin.  The bill repeals a 70-year-old law to restrict mergers of utility companies with other companies where they have no expertise. In the past, this practice has caused financial troubles for utilities and consequently, the ratepayers.  The American people could have hoped that this bill would do more to emphasize technological innovation that would promote clean and sustainable energy. Instead, it barely holds on to the status quo in incentives for renewable and energy efficiency. If we are going to avoid future blackouts, we have to decrease demand on the electricity grid as well as make improvements to it.  But instead of working to advance technologies to create jobs and reduce pollution, we have a bill that gives oil, gas, ethanol and nuclear companies enormous subsidies.  At the same time, this bill fails to address one of the biggest energy and environmental issues facing our country: how to improve fuel efficiency standards for cars and trucks. In fact, the bill actually would enlarge a loophole for huge SUVs that will actually encourage more people to buy these gas guzzlers. We all have heard of the SUV dealerships that actually use the existing tax loophole in their TV ads.  The bill also hands Vermont drivers a double whammy by mandating the use of 5 billion gallons of ethanol by 2012, while threatening deep revenue losses to the Highway Trust Fund. Under this bill, Vermonters and drivers in other States could expect higher prices at the pump due to this mandate, and more potholes in their roads due to the Trust Fund cuts.  While the bill fails to take any steps forward on energy policy, it takes a giant step backward on environmental protections. When the Clinton administration strengthened the requirements for reducing smog around cities, it was hailed as a major step toward reducing asthma and other chronic illnesses. Well, by postponing these ozone attainment targets, no one will be breathing easier after this bill except the special interests.  Although you won't be able to see much through the smog when you're looking up, you might see more when you're looking down, and what you see will be unwelcome.  This bill includes several new provisions that let polluters off the hook when it comes to reducing contaminates in groundwater and drinking water. It protects producers of the gasoline additive MTBE from liability if their product is found to be defective. In Vermont and around the country, States and communities face multi-million dollar bills for cleaning up the MTBE that already has leached into the groundwater.  At least one court has already found MTBE producers liable for these cleanup costs because of product defects, and several other cases are pending. To make sure these cases are stopped, the energy bill makes the provision retroactive, wiping out cases filed in September by several New York communities and New Hampshire.  The list goes on and on, and so do the echoes of the ghostwriters' voice in this bill. This turkey would waive environmental analysis for energy projects on public lands. It would exempt oil and gas drilling from requirements of the Clean Water Act and Safe Drinking Water Act. It would open coastal areas to oil and gas development. It also would reduce support for clean-coal technology in favor of the conventional dirty power plants.  This will simply mean that more toxic pollutants like mercury will get dumped on Vermont's forests, lakes and rivers.  Days after this administration entered the White House, they closed the doors to the public and started to put together the energy industry's wish list of subsidies and environmental and consumer protection rollbacks. Well, Christmas came early this year for the special interests.  The energy bill now before Congress is stuffed with everything on that wish list, plus just about everything else that these special interests could dream up when they were given the chance.  The bill before us now costs three times more than the proposal that the administration first put on the table 2 years ago.  When you look at the list of special-interest giveaways, it is no wonder the bill was written behind closed doors.  The President and the Congress had a real opportunity to produce a bill that would lead the Nation toward balanced, sustainable, clean energy production. This bill fails on all counts.  Instead, we have 1,100 pages worth of policies that will increase our dependence on fossil fuels, prop up wealthy energy corporations, repeal consumer protections and threaten environmental and public health. I do not see how my Republican colleagues can any longer justify their drastic cuts to vital social programs while pushing through this $100 billion, counterproductive budget-buster for the energy industry.                   Tribute To John Fitzgerald Kennedy  I would like to talk for a moment about a more personal matter. Here we are today, November 20, 2003, just two days away from November 22. I think back to 40 years ago on November 22, 1963. I was living in Washington, D.C., at that time, as a young law student. My wife, Marcelle, and I were living in a small basement apartment. She was working as a nurse at the VA hospital, then called Mount Alto, up on Wisconsin Avenue, where the Russian Embassy is now. I was going to Georgetown Law School downtown here in Washington.  They say that anybody who was old enough to remember on that November 22 remembers exactly where they were when they heard the news about President Kennedy's assassination. That is true of anybody I have ever spoken with.  I was in the law school library and one of my classmates, who was not a supporter of President Kennedy, came in and told me the President had been shot. I told him this was really not funny, and then I realized he was crying. He was a person who had never voted for President Kennedy but realized the enormity of what had happened. When I saw his tears, I knew it had to be true.  My wife and I did not own a car at the time. I went outside and hailed a cab to head back to our apartment. My wife had worked the whole night before, and she was home asleep. I did not want to call her. I wanted to tell her in person what had happened.  I think I probably got in the only cab in all of Washington that did not have a radio. You can imagine my frustration as we started through the Washington traffic. As we drove down K Street, where many stockbrokers have their offices, we could see the screen that normally displayed stock prices was blank. That was an obvious signal that they had closed the markets in New York.  I saw Mrs. Kennedy's brother-in-law. As he would be chauffeured in a Rolls-Royce to his brokerage house each morning, I would watch with envy from the bus as I went to work. I saw him running into the street, frantic, trying to hail a cab. I saw a police officer directing traffic with tears coming down his face.  When I got to our apartment, I banged on the door and woke up my wife. We turned on the television to see the now famous announcement by Walter Cronkite--taking off his horn-rimmed glasses, announcing the President was dead.  Just a short time before, President Kennedy had given a speech at American University, a speech that I thought laid out his focus for that term and what most people believed would be a second term. That was the speech in which he said, ``We must make the world safe for diversity.'' I would like to include a copy of this speech with my statement.  We should think about this quote these days. President Kennedy said, ``make the world safe for diversity.'' He did not say we should make the world an exact copy of the United States. If everybody knew they could follow their beliefs and they could follow their system of government, it would be a safer world. But that was not to be.  I remember the next day when my wife and I stood on Pennsylvania Avenue with a half a million people watching as the cortege went from the WhiteHouse up to the Capitol. It was silent. It was so silent that as we stood there, we could hear the traffic lights. Even though the street was blocked off, the traffic lights were still operating, and from eight lanes away, you could hear the click of the lights as they changed. This is with half a million or more people on that street.  Where we were standing, near the National Art Gallery, almost from the moment the cortege left the White House, we could hear the noise of the drums and the horses. I remember vividly the riderless horse, the boots turned backwards. It was a very spirited horse. I recall his name was Blackjack. He was skittering, his feet dancing on the pavement. I can still hear the click, click of his hooves. I remember a car going by with then-Attorney General Robert Kennedy in it, his chin on his hand, just staring straight ahead, not seeing any of the crowd. And, of course, I remember the coffin being brought here to lie in state in the Rotunda.  We heard the distinguished majority leader at that time, Mike Mansfield, a very close friend of John Kennedy, give a eulogy. He spoke of President Kennedy's and Jacqueline Kennedy's wedding rings. She took her husband's ring from his finger. It was 40 years ago, but I remember it so well.  I did not meet Senator Mansfield until more than 10 years later when I was the Senator-elect from Vermont. I got to know him well and realized the depth of his affection and his friendship for President Kennedy, with whom he had served in the Senate. It must have been so difficult for him to give that eulogy.  For two days, there were people--not just officials from Washington, D.C., but people from all over the country--who were stretched literally for miles, waiting to pay their respects. I can still see them huddled in their coats with frost from their breath in the air as they stood in line all night.  We stayed at our apartment to watch the funeral, because we were expecting our first child. We felt the crowd would have made it too difficult to go back downtown.  At the funeral, there were heads of state marching from 1600 Pennsylvania Avenue to St. Matthews. There were Prime Ministers, Presidents, Kings, Princes, and dictators. Someone came up with the idea of having the representatives march based on the name of their country. The head of France marched next to head of Ethiopia. Emperor Haile Selassie of Ethiopia marched next to Charles de Gaulle.  The interesting thing about this is the way the world came together. In fact, for a while there was a rumor that Premier Khrushchev might come. Remember, this was the height of the Cold War. This was when President Kennedy and Premier Khrushchev had stared across oceans at each other during the Cuban missile crisis. Khrushchev was dissuaded from coming by security considerations. Instead, he personally went to the American Embassy to sign the book of condolences. This was the kind of unity that was felt around the world.  Actually, I cannot think of any time when we felt that kind of unity and support for the United States, until the tragedy, 38 years later, of September 11.  Everybody watched the television, listened to the radio, or stood downtown to watch the funeral. We saw on television planes fly by in a missing man formation followed by Air Force One tipping its wing in salute. We ran outside just in time to see the planes which we had seen seconds before on television fly over our heads.  Looking around, everybody else had run outside too. We stood there, neighbors and strangers.  At that time, there was so much optimism, so much hope, even though it was at the height of the Cold War, and even though we had just experienced the Cuban missile crisis. After the death of President Kennedy, we felt so much of this optimism was lost.  I saw the unity come back after September 11. I don't know if the optimism will ever came back fully. We were optimistic of many things.  In my lifetime, we have seen so many wonderful advances in science. When I was young, we had to worry about polio. Our children and my two grandchildren will never have to worry about those kinds of things. Our country has had many wonderful advances and much to be optimistic about. There was unity and support from around the world for the United States right after that event, as there was right after September 11. We are now in a time where that unity is missing. I hope it will come back.  I hope this weekend all Members of this body--most of us are old enough to remember that day--I hope we stop and think what is best for this country. It is time to start working together more closely, with more support for each other and the country, and it is time to help restore some of the optimism. We are a great country. We have survived world wars, civil wars, Presidential assassinations, and terrorist attacks. We can survive much more--if not for ourselves, for our children and for our grandchildren.  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to print President Kennedy's 1963 commencement address delivered at American University.  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in the Record, as follows:   Remarks of President John F. Kennedy, Jr. at American University,                      Washington D.C., June 10, 1963       President Anderson, members of the faculty, Board of      Trustees, distinguished guests, my old colleague, Senator Bob      Byrd, who has earned his degree through many years of      attending night law school, while I am earning mine in the      next 30 minutes, ladies and gentlemen:       It is with great pride that I participate in this ceremony      of the American University, sponsored by the Methodist      Church, founded by Bishop John Fletcher Hurst, and first      opened by President Woodrow Wilson in 1914. This is a young      and growing university, but it has already fulfilled Bishop      Hurst's enlightened hope for the study of history and public      affairs in a city devoted to the making of history and to the      conduct of the public's business. By sponsoring this      institution of higher learning for all who wish to learn      whatever their color or their creed, the Methodists of this      area and the nation deserve the nation's thanks, and I      commend all those who are today graduating.       Professor Woodrow Wilson once said that every man sent out      from a university should be a man of his nation as well as a      man of his time, and I am confident that the men and women      who carry the honor of graduating from this institution will      continue to give from their lives, from their talents, a high      measure of public service and public support.       ``There are few earthly things more beautiful than a      University,'' wrote John Masefield, in his tribute to the      English Universities--and his words are equally true here. He      did not refer to spires and towers, to campus greens and      ivied walls. He admired the splendid beauty of the      University, he said, because it was ``a place where those who      hate ignorance may strive to know, where those who perceive      truth may strive to make others see.''       I have, therefore, chose this time and this place to      discuss a topic on which ignorance too often abounds and the      truth is to rarely perceived--yet it is the most important      topic on earth: world peace.       What kind of peace do I mean? What kind of peace do we      seek? Not a Pax Americana enforced on the world by American      weapons of war. Not the peace of the grave or the security of      the slave. I am talking about genuine peace--the kind of      peace that makes life on earth worth living--the kind that      enables man and nations to grow and to hope and to build a      better life for their children--not merely peace for      Americans but peace for all men and women--not merely peace      in our time but peace for all time.       I speak of peace because of the new face of war. Total war      makes no sense in an age when great powers can maintain large      and relatively invulnerable nuclear forces and refuse to      surrender without resort to those forces. It makes no sense      in an age when a single nuclear weapon contains almost ten      times the explosive force delivered by all of the allied air      forces in the Second World War. It makes no sense in an age      when the deadly poisons produced by a nuclear exchange would      be carried by the wind and water and soil and seed to the far      corners of the globe and to generations unborn.       Today the expenditure of billions of dollars every year on      weapons acquired for the purpose of making sure we never need      to use them is essential to keeping the peace. But surely the      acquisition of such idle stockpiles--which can only destroy      and never create--is not the only, much less the most      efficient, means of assuring peace.       I speak of peace, therefore, as the necessary rational end      of rational men. I realize that the pursuit of peace is not      as dramatic as the pursuit of war--and frequently the words      of the pursuer fall on deaf ears. But we have no more urgent      task.       Some say that it is useless to speak of world peace or      world law or world disarmament--and that it will be useless      until the leaders of the Soviet Union adopt a more      enlightened attitude. I hope they do. I believe we can help      them do it. But I also believe that we must re-examine our      own attitude--as individuals and as a Nation--for our      attitude is as essential as theirs. And every graduate of      this school, every thoughtful citizen who despairs of war and      wishes to bring     peace, should begin by looking inward--by examining his own      attitude toward the possibilities of peace, toward the Soviet      Union, toward the course of the Cold War and toward freedom      and peace here at home.       First: Let us examine our attitude toward peace itself. Too      many of us think it is impossible. Too many of us think it is      unreal. But that is dangerous, defeatist belief. It leads to      the conclusion that war is inevitable--that mankind is      doomed--that we are gripped by forces we cannot control.       We need not accept that view. Our problems are manmade--     therefore, they can be solved by man. And man can be as big      as he wants. No problem of human destiny is beyond human      beings. Man's reason and spirit have often solved the      seemingly unsolvable--and we believe they can do it again.       I am not referring to the absolute, infinite concept of      universal peace and good will of which some fantasies and      fanatics dream. I do not deny the values of hopes and dreams      but we merely invite discouragement and incredulity by making      that our only and immediate goal.       Let us focus instead on a more practical, more attainable      peace--based not on a sudden revolution in human nature but      on a gradual evolution in human institutions--on a series of      concrete actions and effective agreements which are in the      interest of all concerned. There is no single, simple key to      this peace--no grand or magic formula to be adopted by one or      two powers. Genuine peace must be the product of many      nations, the sum of many acts. It must be dynamic, not      static, changing to meet the challenge of each new      generation. For peace is a process--a way of solving      problems.       With such a peace, there will still be quarrels and      conflicting interests, as there are within families and      nations. World peace, like community peace, does not require      that each man love his neighbor--it requires only that they      live together in mutual tolerance, submitting their disputes      to a just and peaceful settlement. And history teaches us      that enmities between nations, as between individuals, do not      last forever. However fixed our likes and dislikes may seem      the tide of time and events will often bring surprising      changes in the relations between nations and neighbors.       So let us persevere. Peace need not be impracticable--and      war need not be inevitable. By defining our goal more      clearly--by making it seem more manageable and less remote--     we can help all peoples to see it, to draw hope from it, and      to move irresistibly toward it.       Second: Let us re-examine our attitude toward the Soviet      Union. It is discouraging to think that their leaders may      actually believe what their propagandists write. It is      discouraging to read a recent authoritative Soviet text on      Military Strategy and find, on page after page, wholly      baseless and incredible claims--such as the allegation that      ``American imperialist circles are preparing to unleash      different types of wars . . . that there is a very real      threat of a preventive war being unleashed by American      imperialists against the Soviet Union . . . (and that) the      political aims of the American imperialists are to enslave      economically and politically the European and other      capitalist countries . . . (and) to achieve world domination.       Truly, as it was written long ago: ``The wicked flee when      no man pursueth.'' Yet it is sad to read these Soviet      statements--to realize the extent of the gulf between us. But      it is also a warning--a warning to the American people not to      fall into the same trap as the Soviets, not to see only a      distorted and desperate view of the other side, not to see      conflict as inevitable, accommodations as impossible and      communication as nothing more than an exchange of threats.       No government or social system is so evil that its people      must be considered as lacking in virtue. As Americans, we      find communism profoundly repugnant as a negation of personal      freedom and dignity. But we can still hail the Russian people      for their many achievements--in science and space, in      economic and industrial growth, in culture and in acts of      courage.       Among the many traits the peoples of our two countries have      in common, none is stronger than our mutual abhorrence of      war. Almost unique, among the major world powers, we have      never been at war with each other. And no nation in the      history of battle ever suffered more than the Soviet Union      suffered in the course of the Second World War. At least 20      million lost their lives. Countless millions of homes and      farms were burned or sacked. A third of the nation's      territory, including nearly two thirds of its industrial      base, was turned into a wasteland--a loss equivalent to the      devastation of this country east of Chicago.       Today, should total war ever break out again--no matter      how--our two countries would become the primary targets. It      is an ironical but accurate fact that the two strongest      powers are the two in the most danger of devastation. All we      have built, all we have worked for, would be destroyed in the      first 24 hours. And even in the Cold War, which brings      burdens and dangers to so many countries, including this      Nation's closest allies--our two countries bear the heaviest      burdens. For we are both devoting massive sums of money to      weapons that could be better devoted to combating ignorance,      poverty and disease. We are both caught up in a vicious and      dangerous cycle in which suspicion on the other, and new      weapons beget counter-weapons.       In short, both the United States and its allies, and the      Soviet Union and its allies, have a mutually deep interest in      a just and genuine peace and in halting the arms race.      Agreements to this end are in the interests of the Soviet      Union as well as ours--and even the most hostile nations can      be relied upon to accept and keep those treaty obligations,      and only those treaty obligations, which are in their own      interest.       So, let us not be blind to our differences--but let us also      direct attention to our common interests and to means by      which those differences can be resolved. And if we cannot end      now our differences, at least we can help make the world safe      for diversity. For, in the final analysis, our most basic      common link is that we all inhabit this plant. We all breathe      the same air. We all cherish our children's future. And we      are all mortal.       Third: Let us re-examine our attitude toward the Cold War,      remembering that we are not engaged in a debate, seeking to      pile up debating points. We are not here distributing blame      or pointing the finger of judgment. We must deal with the      world as it is, and not as it might have been had history of      the last eighteen years been different.       We must, therefore, preserve in the search for peace in the      hope that constructive changes within the Communist bloc      might bring within reach solutions which now seem beyond us.      We must conduct our affairs in such a way that it becomes in      the Communists' interest to agree on a genuine peace. Above      all, while defending our vital interest, nuclear powers must      avert those confrontations which bring an adversary to a      choice of either a humiliating retreat or a nuclear war. To      adopt that kind of course in the nuclear age would be      evidence only of the bankruptcy of our policy--or of a      collective death-wish for the world.       To secure these ends, America's weapons are non-     provocative, carefully controlled, designed to deter and      capable of selective use. Our military forces are committed      to peace and disciplines in self-restraint. Our diplomats are      instructed to avoid unnecessary irritants and purely      rhetorical hostility.       For we can seek a relaxation of tensions without relaxing      our guard. And, for our part, we do not need to use threats      to prove that we are resolute. We do not need to jam foreign      broadcasts out of fear our faith will be eroded. We are      unwilling to impose our system on any unwilling people--but      we are willing and able to engage in peaceful competition      with any people on earth.       Meanwhile, we seek to strengthen the United Nations, to      help solve its financial problems, to make it a more      effective instrument of peace, to develop it into a genuine      world security system--a system capable of resolving disputes      on the basis of law, of insuring the security of the large      and the small, and of creating conditions under which arms      can finally be abolished.       At the same time we seek to keep peace inside the non-     communist world, where many nations, all of them our friends,      are divided over issues which weaken western unity, which      invite communist intervention or which threaten to erupt into      war. Our efforts in West New Guinea, in the Congo, in the      Middle East and in the Indian subcontinent, I have been      persistent and patient despite criticism from both sides. We      have also tried to set an example for others--by seeking to      adjust small but significant differences with our own closest      neighbors in Mexico and in Canada.       Speaking of other nations, I wish to make one point clear.      We are bound to many nations by alliances. These alliances      exist because our concern and theirs substantially overlap.      Our commitment to defend Western Europe and West Berlin for      example, stands undiminished because of the identity of our      vital interests. The United States will make no deal with the      Soviet Union at the expense of other nations and other      peoples, not merely because they are our partners, but also      because their interests and ours converge.       Our interests converge, however, not only in defending the      frontiers of freedom, but in pursuing the paths of peace. It      is our hope--and the purpose of Allied policies--to convince      the Soviet Union that she, too, should let each nation choose      its own future, so long as that choice does not interfere      with the choices of others. The communist drive to impose      their political and economic system on others is the primary      cause of world tension today. For there can be no doubt that      if all nations could refrain from interfering in the self-     determination of others, then peace would be much more      assured.       This will require a new effort to achieve world law--a new      context for world discussions. It will require increased      understanding between the Soviets and ourselves. And      increased understanding will require increased contact and      communications. One step in this direction is the proposed      arrangement for a direct line between Moscow and Washington,      to avoid on each side the dangerous delays,      misunderstandings, and misreadings of the other's actions      which might occur at a time of crisis.       We have also been talking in Geneva about other first-step      measures of arms control, designed to limit the intensity of      the arms race and to reduce the risks of accidental war. Our      primary long-range interest in Geneva, however, is general      and complete disarmament--designed to take place by stages,      permitting parallel political developments to build the new      institutions of peace which would take the place of arms. The      pursuit of disarmament has been an effort of this Government      since the 1920's. It has been urgently sought by the past      three Administrations. And however dim the prospects may be     today, we intend to continue this effort--to continue it in      order that all countries, including our own, can better grasp      what the problems and possibilities of disarmament are.       The one major area of these negotiations where the end is      in sight--yet where a fresh start is badly needed--is in a      treaty to outlaw nuclear tests. The conclusion of such a      treaty--so near and yet so far--would check the spiraling      arms race in one of its most dangerous areas. It would place      the nuclear powers in a position to deal more effectively      with one of the greatest hazards which man faces in 1963, the      further spread of nuclear arms. It would increase our      security--it would decrease the prospects of war. Surely this      goal is sufficiently important to require our steady pursuit,      yielding neither to the temptation to give up the whole      effort nor the temptation to give up our insistence on vital      and responsible safeguards.       I am taking this opportunity, therefore, to announce two      important decisions in this regard.       First: Chairman Khrushchev, Prime Minister Macmillan and I      have agreed that high-level discussions will shortly begin in      Moscow looking toward early agreement on a comprehensive      test ban treaty. Our hopes must be tempered with the      caution of history--but with our hopes go the hopes of all      mankind.       Second: To make clear our good faith and solemn convictions      on the matter, I now declare that the United States does not      propose to conduct nuclear tests in the atmosphere so long as      other states do not do so. We will not be the first to      resume. Such a declaration is no substitute for a formal      binding treaty--but I hope it will help us achieve one. Nor      would such a treaty be a substitute for disarmament--but I      hope it will help us achieve it.       Finally, my fellow Americans, let us examine our attitude      toward peace and freedom here at home. The quality and spirit      of our own society must justify and support our efforts      abroad. We must show it in the dedication of our own lives--     as many of you who are graduatng today will have a unique      opportunity to do, by serving without pay in the Peace Corps      abroad or in the proposed National Service Corps here at      home.       But wherever we are, we must all, in our daily lives, live      up to the age-old faith that peace and freedom walk together.      In too many of our duties today, the peace is not secure      because freedom is incomplete.       It is the responsibility of the Executive Branch at all      levels of government--local, state and national--to provide      and protect that freedom for all of our citizens by all means      within their authority. It is the responsibility of the      Legislative Branch at all levels, wherever that authority is      not now adequate, to make it adequate. And it is the      responsibility of all citizens in all sections of this      country to respect the rights of all others and to respect      the law of the land.       All this is not unrelated to world peace. ``When a man's      ways please the Lord,'' the Scriptures tell us, ``he maketh      even his enemies to be at peace with him.'' And is not peace,      in the last analysis, basically a matter of human rights--the      right to live out our lives without fear of devastation--the      right to breathe air as nature provided it--the right of      future generations to a healthy existence?       While we proceed to safeguard our national interests, let      us also safeguard human interests. And the elimination of war      and arms is clearly in the interest of both. No treaty,      however much it may be to the advantage of all, however      tightly it may be worded, can provide absolute security      against the risks of deception and evasion. But it can--if it      is sufficiently effective in its enforcement and if it is      sufficiently in the interests of its signers--offer far more      security and far fewer risks than an unabated, uncontrolled,      unpredictable arms race.       The United States, as the world knows, will never start a      war. We do not want a war. We do not now expect a war. This      generation of Americans has already had enough--more than      enough--of war and hate and oppression. We shall be prepared      if others wish it. We shall be alert to try to stop it. But      we shall also do our part to build a world of peace where the      weak are safe and the strong are just. We are not helpless      before that task or hopeless of its success. Confident and      unafraid, we labor on--not toward a strategy of annihilation      but toward a strategy of peace.  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Alexander). The Senator from Kentucky is recognized.
