 President, the Bipartisan Budget Act of 2013, which Congress passed a year ago this month, not only provided relief to families, servicemembers, and the economy from the harmful effects of sequestration, but also put an end to the recent fiscal crises and uncertainty by establishing a bipartisan budget for two years.  Pursuant to section 116 of the Bipartisan Budget Act, I previously filed budgetary aggregates and committee allocations for budget year 2015. Today, I am adjusting those levels to account for H.R. 83, the Consolidated and Further Continuing Appropriations Act, 2015.  Section 251 of the Balanced Budget and Emergency Deficit Control Act of 1985 establishes statutory limits on discretionary spending and allows for various adjustments to those limits, while sections 302 and 314(a) of the Congressional Budget Act allows the Chairman of the Budget Committee to establish and make revisions to allocations, aggregates, and levels consistent with those adjustments. H.R. 83, which has passed the House, is eligible for the following adjustments:  Division A. the Agriculture, Rural Development, Food and Drug Administration, and Related Agencies Appropriations Act, which includes $91 million in budget authority and $40 million in outlays that is designated as disaster funding, and $25 million in budget authority and $7 million in outlays designated as an emergency.  Division C, the Department of Defense Appropriations Act, which includes $64 billion in budget authority and $30.476 billion in outlays that is designated as Overseas Contingency Operations funding, and $112 million in budget authority and $119 million in outlays that is designated as emergency funding  Division G, the Departments of Labor, Health and Human Services, and Education, and Related Agencies Appropriations Act, which includes $1.484 billion in budget authority and $1.277 billion in outlays for program integrity initiatives, and $2.742 billion in budget authority and $933 million in outlays designated as an emergency.  Division I, the Military Construction and Veterans Affairs and Related Agencies Appropriations Act, which includes $221 million in budget authority that is designated as Overseas Contingency Operations.  Division J, the State, Foreign Operations, and Related Agencies Appropriations Act, which includes $9.258 billion in budget authority and $2.233 billion in outlays that is designated as Overseas Contingency Operations funding, and $2.526 billion in budget authority and $468 million in outlays designated as an emergency.  Because I previously filed adjustments for most of these bills after they were reported by the Committee on Appropriations, the adjustments I am making today takes into account those existing adjustments and reflect only the net difference.  In total, I am revising the budgetary aggregates for 2015 by a total of $11.351 billion in budget authority and $3.983 billion in outlays. I am also revising the budget authority and outlay allocations to the appropriations committee for 2015 by a total of $6.048 billion in revised nonsecurity budget authority, $5.967 billion in revised security budget authority, and $4.567 billion in total outlays.  I am pleased to note that the funding in the omnibus appropriations bill is fully consistent with the bipartisan limits on discretionary spending agreed to in the Bipartisan Budget Act.  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the following tables detailing the changes to the allocation to the Committee on Appropriations and the budgetary aggregates be printed in the Record.  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in the Record, as follows:  DETAIL BY CATEGORY ON ADJUSTMENTS TO FISCAL YEAR 2015 ALLOCATIONS TO COMMITTEE ON APPROPRIATIONS PURSUANT TO                             SECTIONS 302 AND 314(a) OF THE CONGRESSIONAL BUDGET ACT                                                [$s in billions]----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------                                                                                                    Changes to                                                                    Adjustments    Total Funding     Existing                                                                     Made for      Eligible for   Adjustments to                                                                    Committee-    Adjustments in    Match Total                                                                     Reported         H.R. 83         H.R. 83                                                                      Bills*                        Adjustments----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------Overseas Contingency Operations    BA..........................................................          68.344          73.479           5.135    Outlays.....................................................          30.868          32.709           1.841Emergency    BA..........................................................           0.000           5.405           5.405    Outlays.....................................................           0.075           1.527           1.452Program Integrity Initiatives    BA..........................................................           0.000           1.484           1.484    Outlays.....................................................           0.000           1.277           1.277Disaster    BA..........................................................           0.100           0.091          -0.009    Outlays.....................................................           0.043           0.040          -0.003    Total        BA......................................................          68.444          80.459          12.015        Outlays.................................................          30.986          35.553          4.567----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------* Excludes adjustments made for the Department of Homeland Security Appropriations bill, which is funded in H.R.  83 on a temporary basis through February 27th, 2015, and therefore no further adjustments are appropriate at  this time.
