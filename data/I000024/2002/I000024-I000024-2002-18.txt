President, today I pay tribute to a great Army officer, and a great soldier. This month, Major General Joe G. Taylor, Jr. will depart the Pentagon to assume new duties as the Commanding General, U.S. Army Security Assistance Command in Alexandria, VA. For over two years, he has served as first the Deputy then the Chief of Army Legislative Liaison where he has proven himself to be a trusted advisor to the Secretary of the Army and the Chief of Staff.  During his tour as the Chief of Army Legislative Liaison, he guided the Army's relationship with Congress, wielding a deft and skillful touch during a period of tremendous change. Throughout this period, Joe Taylor ably assisted the Army's senior leadership in dealings with Members of Congress and their staffs in helping them to understand the needs of the Army as it faces the challenges of a new century. His leadership resulted in cohesive legislative strategies, responsiveness to constituent inquiries, well-prepared Army leaders and a coherent Army message to Congress.  Joe Taylor's career has reflected a deep commitment to our Nation, which has been characterized by dedicated selfless service, love for soldiers and a commitment to excellence. Major General Taylor's performance over twenty-seven years of service has personified those traits of courage, competency and integrity that our Nation has come to except from its Army officers. The Pentagon and the Army Secretariat's loss will be the Army Security Assistance Commands gain, as Major General Taylor continues to serve his country and the Army. On behalf of the United States Senate and the people of this great Nation, I offer our heartfelt appreciation for a job well done over the past two years and best wishes for continued success, to a great soldier and friend of Congress.                          ____________________
