President, one of our colleagues from Illinois was talking about their desire to have these detainees from Guantanamo Bay come into the United States for trial. Let me just suggest--I am not a lawyer, but I do know this: I have spent a lot of time down there. I know the situation. I know it is a resource that we have to have, that we have to keep. There is no justification at all for closing Guantanamo Bay. No justification. All we hear is: Well, this came at a time when there was suspected terrorism or torture of prisoners in other areas. But never at Gitmo. There hasn't been a documented case of torture that went on there. This is a resource we need.  My friend from Illinois suggests bringing them to this country. The rules of evidence are different. These are not criminals, these are detainees. The proper place for them to be adjudicated is in the tribunals. The only place available right now is the tribunal that is set up in Gitmo.  If we bring them to this country, under our laws, quite a few of those would actually be released. When they are released, they could be released into society. For those who say we need to use some 17 areas for incarceration in the United States, as opposed to using Gitmo, to incarcerate these people, that would become 17 magnets for terrorist activity in the United States.  We have to get over this thing of everybody lining up and saying we have to close it. Guantanamo Bay is something we need, and we have to have it. There is not a pleasant alternative. It would cause the release of terrorists in the United States. If that is what the Senator from Illinois and the Democrats and the President want, they are going to find that virtually all Americans disagree with them.  With that, I yield the floor.
