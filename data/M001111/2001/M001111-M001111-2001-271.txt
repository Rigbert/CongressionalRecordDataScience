 President, it is very clear that as we have listened to this debate in the Senate, Senators on both sides of the aisle believe that the key to the success of the Elementary and Secondary Education Act is accountability, and a part of that is testing. The voucher system would mean that students could take public taxpayer dollars to a private school that has no testing requirements similar to the public schools, has no accountability, requires no accountability, and thus we are just sending taxpayer dollars to private schools that don't live by the same rules.
