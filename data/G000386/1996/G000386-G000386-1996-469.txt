 While Ibelieve the Appropriations Committees has provided sufficient funding for the Corporation, I recognize the desire of the administration and Senator Mikulski to see a small increase in the amount of funds provided by the committee.  I believe this amendment is a good compromise that will allow the VA/HUD bill to proceed and be signed by the President.  The amendment contains a sense of the Senate that I have worked on with Senator Kassebaum stating that the President should expeditiously nominate a CFO for the Corporation and that the Corporation should make implementation of financial management reforms a top priority.  In meeting with accountants from Arthur Anderson, who conducted the independent audit of the Corporation, they stated that the appointment of a CFO was the single most important thing that needs to be done to begin the effort to get the Corporation's financial house in order.  The amendment also allows the Corporation to spend up to $3 million for implementing financial management reforms.  Finally, I am pleased that in conjunction with this amendment, the Corporation has agreed that they will set aside $10 million for an education-awards only program that I have advocated. Under this new program, the Corporation will provide only educational awards to young people who perform community service. These funds could help up to 4,000 young people pay for college.  Madam President, I want to recognize Senator Barbara Mikulski for her work. She has been a strong advocate for AmeriCorps. Earlier this fall, I said that I thought there would be funding for this program. I made that statement in part because of the confidence I had that Senator Mikulski's determination would win the day. Certainly, she deserves a great deal of the credit for the funding contained in this bill already and all the credit for the passage of this amendment.
