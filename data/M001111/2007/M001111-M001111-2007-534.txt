 President, I rise today to introduce the Honor Our Commitment to Veterans Act.  More than four years ago, the Bush Administration cut off enrollment of Priority 8 veterans in the VA healthcare system. Priority 8 veterans are those veterans without service-connected disabilities whose income is above a means tested level that varies across the country. Many of these so-called ``high-income veterans'' have annual incomes as low as $26,902.  When the Administration announced its intention to suspend healthcare enrollment for new Priority 8 veterans, they said that they were doing so in order to reduce the backlog and alleviate a longstanding funding crisis within the VA.  There is no doubt that the VA has problems. Nearly five years into this war, our veterans are facing lengthy waits just to get in the door to see a primary care physician. They are having trouble accessing critical mental health services, and some are waiting up to two years for benefits claims to be processed. These are real problems facing real people, and they deserve real solutions.  But instead of cutting off enrollment to veterans of modest means four years ago, the Bush Administration should have asked Congress for the resources necessary to address its shortcomings and increase access to this high quality health care system.  It is absolutely unacceptable that veterans in need of care are being prohibited from enrolling in the system that is supposed to serve them. Veterans who have fought hard to secure our freedoms shouldn't have to fight for access to health care at home. Our veterans deserve better.  That is why I am introducing the Honor Our Commitment to Veterans Act today, which would permit new Priority 8 veterans to enroll in the VA healthcare system.  According to a recent Congressional Research Service report, the VA estimates that if the enrollment freeze was lifted, approximately 273,000 Priority 8 veterans would have been eligible to receive medical care from VA in FY2006, and 242,000 Priority 8 veterans would be eligible in FY2007.  This legislation, which has been introduced in the House by Congressman Steve Rothman of New Jersey, would correct the injustice perpetrated in 2003 by allowing all new Priority 8 veterans to enroll in the VA healthcare system.                                 ______                                       By
