President, I appreciate what the Senator from Mississippi has said. I do compliment the Senator from Kentucky and the Senator from Michigan. I know from various phone calls that went back and forth they have done yeomen's service here today in reaching this area of agreement. Obviously, had they not, we could be here much, much longer than we have.  The question I have again, for some of us who have families, is there going to be either a window or shall we tell them to all go to bed and get up at 1 tomorrow morning to see us? I do not mean to question facetiously, but we are falling into this trend of almost Dracula voting--we only vote when the Sun goes down. But some of us do have families and would like to see them.  I ask the question in all seriousness, will there be a window? Will there be time? Shall we make any plans to see our families?
