  Mr. DeFAZIO. How can the Republicans spend $400 billion on a prescription drug benefit that will impose costs without benefits on many seniors and a totally inadequate benefit for those most in need? We start with the premise that, first and foremost, the plan is designed to protect and enhance the profits of the pharmaceutical industry and the private insurance industry. Yes, seniors will be pushed into a confusing maze of PPO, HMO, discount card, private insurance plans, no limit on premiums, no limit on profits, and no required benefits. Very expensive. The pharmaceutical industry will prevent the reimportation of their manufactured U.S. drugs from Canada, and they are going to protect the obscene prices they get for their drugs.  This plan will do a great job protecting the profits of the pharmaceutical industry and the insurance industry but pitifully little for our Nation's seniors, those so much in need. But so it should be. The insurance and pharmaceutical industries are the number one and number two campaign contributors to the Republican Party.                          ____________________
