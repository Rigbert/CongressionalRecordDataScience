Speaker, it is with great pride and respect that I pay tribute to Army Reserve Private First Class Lowell W. Bellar for his bravery in the field of battle and his willingness to fight for his country. Private First Class Bellar lost his life on December 1, 1950 in North Korea. Almost 55 years later, his sacrifice will be remembered at funeral services on Friday, July 15, 2005, on his birthday.  A native of Gary, Indiana, Private Lowell Bellar graduated from Horace Mann High School. It came as no surprise to those who knew Private Bellar that he would serve his country. A true patriot, his love for his country was evident from the time he was a child. He wanted to help make a difference in the world. Private Bellar entered active duty on his 17th birthday in 1948. He was one of more than 1,000 soldiers who had to be left behind in the Battle of Chosin Reservoir as enemy troops from the People's Republic of China overran the region.  Private Bellar was reportedly killed on December 1, 1950, during the Korean War. He was among more than 8,000 United Nations soldiers that never returned home. Private Bellar was classified as missing in action until recently. In April 2005 his family was notified that his remains were recovered. Private Lowell Bellar will finally be buried with full military honors on his birthday, more than a half-century after he was declared missing in action in North Korea. His courage and heroism will always be remembered, and his sacrifice will forever live in the hearts and minds of those for whom he battled. He gave his life so that the freedoms and values that he treasured could be enjoyed by those around the world.  Although he loved his unit and his country, Private Bellar treasured his family above all else. He is survived by his brother, George Bellar, also an Army veteran, his wife Pat, their children and grandchildren. These individuals were the heroes to a man that we will forever call a hero, and we should honor them in this tumultuous moment as well.  Mr. Speaker, at this time I ask that you and my other distinguished colleagues join me in honoring a fallen hero, United States Army Private Lowell W. Bellar. He will forever remain a hero in the eyes of his family, his community, and his country. Let us never forget the sacrifice he made to preserve the ideals of freedom and democracy.                          ____________________[Extensions of Remarks][Page E1493]From the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]     A TRIBUTE TO ARMY RESERVE PRIVATE FIRST CLASS LOWELL W.
