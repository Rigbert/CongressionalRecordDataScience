Speaker, it is truly my distinct honor to pay tribute to one of Northwest Indiana's hidden treasures, Jerald T. Mahshie, of Schererville, Indiana. Jerry is one of the most dedicated, distinguished and creative citizens of Indiana's First Congressional District.  For the past 3\1/2\ years, Jerry has been the Director of Food and Beverage at the Radisson Hotel at Star Plaza in Merrillville, Indiana. While Jerry has been a resident of the First Congressional District for only a short time, Northwest Indiana has certainly been rewarded by the true service and uncompromising dedication he has displayed to both its citizens and communities, as well as his employer.  During his tenure at the Radisson Hotel, Jerry's consummate professionalism and attention to detail enabled the facility to become one of the premier meeting and dining locations in the First Congressional District.  When I think of Jerry, the first image that comes to my mind is not his successful professional career, but his extraordinary leadership and care for others. Whenever a project has needed a leader or an issue has needed to be addressed, Jerry has stepped forward to accept the challenge. Unfortunately, Northwest Indiana will be losing this hidden treasure, as Jerry has accepted a position in the Indiana's capitol, Indianapolis.  Jerry is truly a remarkable man. His hard work has earned him a number of accomplishments and awards. Such achievements include: Member of the American Academy of Chefs, President of the American Culinary Federation Chefs of Northwest Indiana, Certified Executive Chef, 1999 Lake County Convention and Visitors Bureau Hospitality and Professional of the Year. In addition to his devotion to his job, Jerry finds time to serve his community. He is a past member of the Hammond Area Career Center Advisory Board and the Ivy Tech Gary Campus Advisory Board, as well as the Chairman for the 2001 Taste of Northwest Indiana.  Mr. Speaker, I applaud Jerry Mahshie for his remarkable accomplishments, enduring service, and the unforgettable effect he has had on the people of Northwest Indiana. We will surely miss him. May the future continue to hold great things for this outstanding professional.                          ____________________
