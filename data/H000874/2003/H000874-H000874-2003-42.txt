I think it is helpful that Members can be confident they can schedule events for the eleventh, Veterans' Day. I think that will be very helpful for Members.  The gentleman did not mention the FSC bill, the Foreign Sales Corporation bill. Can the gentleman tell us when you might expect that bill to be on the floor?  I yield to the gentleman.  Mr. DeLAY. It is very difficult to say. Unfortunately, as these things happen, a lot of work is coming out of our Committee on Ways and Means. As the gentleman knows, the Committee on Ways and Means is very wrapped up in negotiations on the Medicare bill. They are also heavily involved in the energy conference, and they are just having a tough time getting all of this done. So we would hope we could do that bill some time next week, but we cannot predict that at this particular time, because next week is going to be heavily involved in the energy bill and the Medicare bill.
