Speaker, 3:10 a.m. The Republicans do all their best worst work at this time in the dark of night.  Well, they have done a new thing here. They have bifurcated Santa Claus. We have two Santa Clauses. We have Santa thief who is going to wriggle down the chimney and he is going to steal from the least among us. He is going to take $16 billion out of student loans, kids struggling to get ahead. Why? So we can finance tax cuts on dividend paying stocks.  He is going to take money from struggling families in the form of Medicaid, seniors on Medicare. Oh, he is going to give another $1 billion to the LIHEAP program, thank you to Santa thief.  He has also given $9 billion in subsidies to the oil, coal and gas industry in the so-called travesty of an energy bill that passed this House.  But that old St. Nick, he is still alive, thank God. Republicans have kept him alive, but he is in the Bahamas with the expatriate people who are avoiding taxes, clinking champagne glasses, hopefully not French, owing to the sensibilities of the Republicans here and those French, and he is giving them wonderful benefits.  We are going to reduce taxes on people who earn over $300,000 a year so their tax rate on dividends or capital gains is less than the tax rate paid by the checkout clerk at the supermarket. Now, that is fair. That is equitable. By God, because those people are going to trickle down on the rest of America, as they trickle we are actually creating a sea of red ink and their yachts float higher and their mansions get bigger. A few lucky folks will get to wash the decks of the yachts and to cut their lawns.  Now, this is what the Republicans say. We do not have a revenue problem. We are hemorrhaging revenue. If we just restored the tax rates of the booming 1990s, when the wealthy were doing quite well, the yachts and mansions and increasing incomes, we would gain $386 billion if they just paid the same rate of taxes they did before you took over everything.  That is 10 times the cuts here, 10 times what Santa thief is stealing from the students, the old folks and the poor, 10 times as much. We do not have a revenue problem. No, your contributor wealthy investor class is doing very well. They just have to wait until next year for their gratification, but we are going to stick it to the most suffering among us here early this morning.                              {time}  0315
