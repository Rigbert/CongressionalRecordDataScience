President, I want to thank the chairman of the Defense Appropriations Subcommittee, Senator Stevens, and the ranking minority members, Senator Inouye, for accepting this very crucial amendment which I have proudly cosponsored with Senator Snowe.  With the recent proliferation of chemical weapons and the increasing uncertainty of rogue nations' ability to wage chemical and biological war, I strongly believe that this additional $2 million in funding is essential to properly address this very serious threat.  A joint service core research program will make possible the development of a prototype hybrid integrated sensor array for chemical and biological point detection for personnel use on the battlefield. While it is my hope that some day sensors of this type are not necessary, until such time, I will continue to ensure that our service men and women are not left unaware or unprotected.  Again, I extend my sincere thanks to Senator Stevens and Senator Inouye for supporting this critical amendment and I thank my fellow Maine colleague, Senator Snowe, for her leadership on this matter as well.                           Amendment No. 843    (Purpose: To earmark $6.0 million of the funds appropriated in     Research, Development, Test and Evaluation, Defense-Wide for a             conventional munitions demilitarization program)
