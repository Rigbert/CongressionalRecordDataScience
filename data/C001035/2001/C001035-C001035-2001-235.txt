President, I rise today to introduce the Rural Education Improvement Act. I am pleased to be joined by my colleagues, Senators Conrad, Gregg, Hutchinson, Enzi, Hagel, Roberts, Dorgan, Thomas, Allard, Burns, and Johnson, as original cosponsors of this common sense, bipartisan proposal to help rural schools make better use of federal education funds. I also want to acknowledge the valuable assistance provided over the past two years by the American Association of School Administrators.  Last Congress, I introduced the Rural Education Initiative Act--the foundation for today's legislation. I am pleased that the REIA was largely incorporated into the final appropriations bill, thus allowing small, rural school districts to combine funds from four formula grant programs, giving them the flexibility to target funds toward their students' most pressing needs. While the passage of this bill represented substantial progress, it was a one-year authorization only, and no appropriations were provided for the supplemental grant program authorized by the new law.  Mr. President, the bill we introduce today strengthens the legislation enacted last year. The Collins-Conrad bill would provide a 5-year authorization of the rural education provisions enacted last year and authorize $150 million annually for the supplemental grant program.  Our legislation would benefit school districts with fewer than 600 students in rural communities. More than 35 percent of all school districts in the United States have 600 or fewer students. In Maine, the percentage is even higher: 56 percent of our 284 school districts have fewer than 600 students. Our legislation would help them overcome some of the most challenging obstacles they face in participating in federal education programs.  By way of background, the Elementary and Secondary Education Act authorizes formula and competitive grants that help many of our local school districts to improve the education of their students. These federal grants support such laudable goals as the professional development of teachers, the incorporation of technology into the classroom, gifted and talented programs, and class size reduction. Schools receive categorical grants, each with its own authorized activities and regulations, each with its own red tape and paperwork. Unfortunately, as valuable as these programs may be for many large urban and suburban school districts, they often do not work well in rural areas for two major reasons.  First, formula grants often do not reach small, rural schools in amounts sufficient to achieve the goals of the programs. These grants are based on school district enrollment, and, therefore, smaller districts often do not receive enough funding from any single grant to carry out a meaningful activity. One Main district, for example, received a whopping $28 to fund a district-wide Safe and Drug-free School program. This amount is certainly not sufficient to achieve the goal of that federal program, yet the school district could not use the funds for any other program.  To give school districts more flexibility to meet local needs, our legislation would allow rural districts to combine the funds from four categorical programs and use them to address the school district's highest priorities.  The second problem facing many rural school districts is that they are essentially shut out of the competitive programs because they lack the grant-writers and administrators necessary to apply for, win, and manage competitively awarded grants. The Rural Education Improvement Act would remedy this program by providing small, rural districts with a formula grant in lieu of eligibility for the competitive programs of the ESEA.  A district would be able to combine this new supplemental grant with the funds from the formula grants and use the combined monies for any purposes that would improve student achievement or teaching quality. Districts might use these funds to hire a new reading or math teacher, fund professional development, offer a program for gifted and talented students, or purchase computers or library books.  Let me give you a specific example of what these two initiatives would mean for one school Maine School District in Northern Maine with 400 students from the towns of Frenchville and St. Agatha receives four separate formula grants ranging from $1,904 for Safe and Drug Free Schools to $9,542 under the Class Size Reduction Act. You can see the problem right there. The amounts of the grants are so small that they really are not useful in accomplishing the goals of the program. The total for all four programs is just under $16,000. Yet, each must be applied for separately, used for different--federally mandated--purposes, and accounted for independently.  Superintendent Jerry White told me that he needs to submit eight separate reports, for four programs, to receive this $16,000. Under our bill, this school district would be freed from the multiple applications and reports and would have $16,000 to use for its educational priorities.  Moreover, since this district does not have the resources to apply for the competitive grant programs, our legislation would result in a supplemental grant of $34,000 as long as the District foregoes its eligibility for the competitively awarded grants. Under the Rural Education Improvement Act, therefore, the District will have $50,000 and the flexibility to use these funds for its most pressing needs.  But with this flexibility and additional funding come responsibility and accountability. In return for the advantages our bill provides, participating districts would be held accountable for demonstrating improved student performance over a 3-year period. Schools will be held responsible for what is really important--improved student achievement--rather than for time-consuming paperwork. As Superintendent White told me, ``Give me the resources I need plus the flexibility to use them, and I am happy to be held accountable for improved student performance. It will happen.''  Mr. President, we must improve our educational system without requiring every school to adopt a plan designed in Washington and without imposing overly burdensome and costly regulations in return for federal assistance. Our bill would allow small, rural districts to use their own strategies for improvement without the encumbrance of onerous federal regulations and unnecessary paperwork.  Congress took an important step last year by recognizing that small, rural districts face challenges in using federal programs to help provide a quality education for their students. Due to our efforts last year, the law now reflects Congress's intention to provide these districts more flexibility and additional funding. This legislation will move us from intention to implementation by providing sustained support, flexibility, and funding for our rural schools.  I am pleased that this legislation has been endorsed by the American Association of School Administrators, National Rural Education Association, the Association of Educational Service Agencies, and the National Education Association, and I ask unanimous consent that endorsement letters be printed in the Record.  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in the Record, as follows:                                                    National Rural                                        Education Association,                                  Arlington, VA, February 5, 2001.     Senator Susan Collins,     U.S. Senate,     Washington, DC.       Dear Senator Collins: The National Rural Education      Association would like to applaud your recognition of the      unique hardships that face small, rural schools in respect to      their federal funding. Along with U.S. Senators Kent Conrad,      D-ND; Judd Gregg, R-NH; Conrad Burns, R-MT; Chuck Hagel, R-     NE; Michael Enzi, R-WY; Pat Roberts, R-KS; and Tim Johnson,      D-SD; and Byron Dorgan, D-ND, you have reintroduced      legislation that would ensure that small rural schools get a      baseline amount of federal funding.       Currently, many small and rural schools are at a      disadvantage when they receive their ESEA funding. Federal      funding formulas are based on enrollment, which prevent small      schools from receiving adequate resources. Due to the small      numbers of students, these schools rarely receive enough      combined funds to hire a teacher. Small schools also lack the      administrative capacity to apply for competitive grants. This      puts small rural schools on unequal federal footing with many      of their urban and suburban counterparts.       Last December, your Rural Education Initiative was included      in the omnibus appropriations bill. The new law allows      districts to commingle some of the federal funds they receive      and use them in areas to improve student achievement and      professional development. In addition, it included      legislation that would provide a minimum of $20,000 to      schools of 600 or less. These are the same schools are      typically receiving approximately $5,000 from the federal      government.       By setting a baseline amount and allowing schools to      commingle the funds, the local school district will have the      opportunity to hire a specialist, provide signing bonuses to      teachers, extend after school opportunities and enhance many      other aspects of the small school budget. Most of all, it      would enable the school to provide an education consistent      with local needs.       Once again, we would like to extend our grateful thanks for      your leadership on this issue. We urge the full Senate to      reauthorize and fully fund this legislation on behalf of      those schools who are too small to be heard.           Sincerely,                                                        Mary Conk,     Legislative Analyst.                                  ____                                              American Association                                     of School Administrators,                                  Arlington, VA, February 5, 2001.     Hon. Susan Collins,     U.S. Senate,     Washington, DC.       Dear Senator Collins: On behalf of the American Association      of School Administrators, representing more than 14,000      school system leaders, we would like to express our support      for your bill reauthorizing the Rural Education Initiative.      Your hard work and commitment to rural schools last congress      improved federal education programs for all of the small      isolated schools throughout rural America. The changes      proposed in your reauthorization bill would improve upon last      year's effort by providing more flexibility and increased      funding for small isolated schools. Thank you for your      continuing advocacy on behalf of rural schoolchildren and      rural communities.       Currently small and rural school districts find it      difficult to compete with larger districts for hundreds of      millions of dollars in federal education competitive grants.      Small, isolated districts receive well below their share of      competitive grants, usually because they lack the      administrative staff to apply for grants. The problem is      compounded by shortcomings of federal formula programs.      Federal education programs allocate funds based on      enrollment, typically providing very little revenue to the      smallest schools. The Collins-Conrad Rural Education      Initiative would level the playing field by ensuring that      each small district receives at least enough funding to hire      a teacher or a specialist.       Studies in individual states and the National Assessment of      Educational Progress document the difficulties of small,      rural school districts:       Difficulty attracting and retaining quality teachers, and      administrators,       Inability to offer advanced academic or vocational courses,       Disproportionate spending on transportation,       Loss of a sense of community when schools are consolidated,      and       Inability to process all the federally required paperwork      normally required of recipients.       The Rural Education Initiative would help small/rural      districts by providing enough school improvements funds to      implement real change. Rural and small school districts would      be eligible for grants of $20,000 to $60,000 depending upon      enrollment. Although the program was passed into law last      year, it has not yet been funded. More than 4,000 small and      rural school districts benefit from the flexibility provided      in last year's program; those same 4,000 districts will be      able to advance even greater improvements when the program is      reauthorized and appropriated.       The funds would be used to enhance the reading and math      proficiency of students; to provide an education consistent      with local needs; and to enable small/rural communities to      prepare young people to compete in the emerging knowledge-     based economy.       The Association is grateful to you, Kent Conrad, R-ND; Judd      Gregg, R-NH; Conrad Burns, R-MT; Chuck Hagel, R-NE; Michael      Enzi, R-WY; Pat Roberts, R-KS; Tim Johnson, D-SD; and Byron      Dorgan, D-ND for their advocacy on behalf of rural school      children. We urge the full Senate to embrace and fund this      important legislation.           Sincerely,                                                     Jordan Cross,     Legislative Specialist.                                  ____                                                    Association of                                 Educational Service Agencies,                                  Arlington, VA, February 5, 2001.     Hon. Susan Collins,     U.S. Senate,     Washington, DC.       Dear Senator Collins: On behalf of the Association of      Education Service Agencies, we would like to express our      gratitude for your work on the Rural Education Initiative.      Your efforts during the 106th Congress helped rectify many of      the inequalities that disadvantage small school districts. By      increasing the flexibility of federal education programs,      local districts can now make better use of federal dollars.      This year, you have taken that effort one step further with      the reauthorization of the Rural Education Initiative. The      Collins-Conrad reauthorization proposal would complete last      year's goal by ensuring that small rural schools are treated      fairly by federal formula programs and funded at an adequate      level.       Educational Service Agencies (ESAs) are intermediate units      that frequently provide assistance to small and rural schools      that do not have the administrative staff to operate some      education programs in-house. When a small rural school      district receives a tiny federal education, ESAs often      facilitate consortia to make better use of federal funds.      ESAs are the primary source of professional development and      technology assistance to rural schools. The members of our      association understand first-hand the particular needs of      rural districts; your proposal offers the best hope for      accommodating those needs and the best means for improving      rural education.       Rural schoolchildren deserve to benefit from the federal      education programs enjoyed by urban and suburban students. We      thank you for your work on the Rural Education Initiative,      and we offer our full support.           Sincerely,                                                     Bruce Hunter,     Legislative Specialist.                                  ____                               National Education Association,                                 Washington, DC, January 31, 2001.Statement of the National Education Association in Support of the Rural                           Education Initiative       The National Education Association's (NEA) supports the      concepts included in the Rural Education Initiative (REI),      introduced today in the United States Senate by Senators      Collins and Conrad.       NEA research demonstrates the need for increased emphasis      on meeting the needs of rural schools. For example, 49      percent of the nation's public schools, teaching 40 percent      of the nation's students, are located in rural areas and      small towns. Yet, schools in rural and small towns receive      only 22 percent of total federal, state, and local education      spending. In addition, federal funding formulas often provide      rural and small towns with small allotments that afford      little or no actual assistance but require significant      paperwork.       The Rural Education Initiative represents an important step      toward addressing the unique problems associated with      education in small towns and rural areas. We encourage its      passage into law.
