 President, I rise today with Senator McConnell and 54 of our colleagues to introduce a joint resolution renewing the ban on all imports from Burma for another year.  Simply put, the ruling State Peace and Development Council--SPDC--has not taken the necessary actions to warrant a lifting of the sanctions at this time.  Indeed, Burma represents one of the most critical human rights situations in the world today.  Aung San Suu Kyi, Nobel Peace Prize recipient and leader of the National League for Democracy, is confined to her home by orders of the military junta.  She has spent the better part of the past 17 years imprisoned or under house arrest and on May 25, 2003 her sentence was extended for another year.  There is no indication that the regime will free her anytime soon.  This is simply unacceptable. She should be released immediately and unconditionally and the regime should begin real and substantive national reconciliation talks with Suu Kyi's National League for Democracy--NLD.  The NLD, the winning party in Burma's last free elections in 1990 with 82 percent of the seats in parliament, is forbidden from participating in public life. For over 20 years, the military junta has been unwilling to take meaningful steps towards political reconciliation.  And let us not forget: 4 years ago government sponsored thugs attempted to assassinate Suu Kyi and other members of the National League for Democracy by attacking her motorcade in northern Burma.  Indeed, the human rights situation in Burma is deplorable and demands a clear, unified response from the international community: 1,300 political prisoners are still in jail; according to the U.N. Special Rapporteur, over 3,000 villages have been destroyed by the military junta; 70,000 child soldiers have been forcibly recruited; over 500,000 people are internally displaced in Burma today, and over 1 million people have fled Burma over the past two decades, destabilizing Burma's neighbors. Also, the practice of rape as a form of repression has been sanctioned by the Burmese military; use of forced labor is widespread; human trafficking is rampant; Burma is the world's second-largest opium producer after Afghanistan and increasingly a source of trafficking of synthetic narcotics.  Some may argue that while the human rights situation is indeed deplorable, sanctions are not the proper solution and we should try a new course.  I agree that sanctions are not a panacea for every foreign policy concern. I am disappointed that Aung San Suu Kyi remains under house arrest and we still have not realized our goal of a free and democratic Burma.  Yet now is not the time to lift the import ban on Burma. First, the military junta has not fulfilled any of the obligations of the ``Burmese Freedom and Democracy Act of 2003'' that would allow a lifting of the ban. It has not made ``substantial and measurable progress'' towards: ending violations of internationally recognized human rights; releasing all political prisoners; allowing freedom of speech and press; allowing freedom of association; permitting the peaceful exercise of religion and; bringing to a conclusion an agreement between the SPDC and the National League for Democracy and Burma's ethnic nationalities on the restoration of a democratic government.  If we were to allow the import ban to expire, we would reward the military junta for its inaction, its failure to fulfill these basic obligations, and its continued brutal crackdown on the human rights of the citizens of Burma.  We simply cannot afford to send that message to those who bravely stand up to the SPDC and reject their abuses.  I remind my colleagues that we are not voting to enact the import ban in perpetuity.  We are renewing it for one more year and we will have another opportunity to review its effectiveness next year.  Second, Aung San Suu Kyi and the democratic opposition continue to support the import ban.  They recognize that it is not directed at the people of Burma, but at the military junta that dominates economic and political activity in their country and denies them their rights.  Third, we are seeing progress in the international community in putting additional pressure on Burma.  In a recent letter addressed to the State Peace and Development Council, a distinguished group of 59 former heads of state--including former Filipino president Corazon Aquino, former Czech president Vaclav Havel, former British prime minister John Major and former Presidents Bill Clinton, Jimmy Carter, and George H.W. Bush--called for the regime to release Aung San Suu Kyi.  They correctly noted that ``Aung San Suu Kyi is not calling for revolution in Burma, but rather peaceful, nonviolent dialogue between the military, National League for Democracy, and Burma's ethnic groups.''  The calls for Suu Kyi's release are also coming from Burma's neighbors.  The Association of Southeast Asian Nations--ASEAN--now recognizes that Burma's actions are not an ``internal matter'' but a significant threat to peace and stability in the region.  At a meeting of senior diplomats last month, ASEAN made a clear call for Aung San Suu Kyi's release.  As Philippine foreign under secretary Erlinda Basilio said: ``It's a consensus that we want to see her early release.''  An editorial in the Jakarta Post recently commented that the regime's refusal to heed these calls ``shows its complete disregard for the growing values of ASEAN.'' That is from the Jakarta Post, May 29, 2007.  We are also seeing progress at the United Nations. In January, for the first time, the United Nations debated a binding, non-punitive resolution on Burma.  Among other things that resolution called on the military junta:     . . . to take concrete steps to allow full freedom of      expression, association, and movement by unconditionally      releasing Daw Aung San Suu Kyi and all political prisoners,      lifting all constraints on all political leaders and      citizens, and allowing the National League for Democracy      (NLD) and other political parties to operate freely.  While nine countries voted in favor of the resolution, I am extremely disappointed that China and Russia exercised their veto.  A report by former Czech President Vaclav Havel and retired archbishop Desmond Tutu of South Africa--``Threat to Peace: A Call for the U.N. Security Council to Act on Burma''--confirms the need for U.N. intervention. It details how the situation in Burma fulfills each of the criteria used for past intervention by the Security Council: overthrow of an elected government; armed conflicts with ethnic minorities; widespread human rights violations; outflow of refugees--over 700,000; and drug production and trafficking and the spread of HIV/AIDS.  I firmly believe that momentum for United Nations Security Council action is on our side and I am confident that body will revisit this resolution again this year.  I am also hopeful that the new United Nations Secretary General Ban Ki-moon will personally get involved in putting pressure on the military junta to respect the wishes of the people of Burma and the international community by releasing Aung San Suu Kyi and restoring democratic government.  In a letter signed by myself, Senator McConnell and a bipartisan group of 43 other U.S. Senators we wrote:       We urge you to personally intervene with the regime on a      regular basis to establish concrete benchmarks and timetables      for democratic progress in Burma. We also urge you to hold      the Burmese government accountable for achieving those goals.      The Burmese people deserve more than talk--they deserve      action.  We can demonstrate to the Secretary General that we too are committed to action by passing this joint resolution promptly.  In conclusion, let me say that I believe the women of the U.S. Senate have a special obligation to speak out on this issue. Last month we came together to form the United States Senate Women's Caucus on Burma and hold our inaugural event with First Lady Laura Bush. I am proud to cochair that caucus with my friend and colleague from Texas, Senator Kay Bailey Hutchison. Together we expressed our solidarity with Aung San Suu Kyi and called for her immediate and unconditional release so that a peaceful transition to a democratic government may begin.  It is my great hope that one day the United States Senate Women's Caucus on Burma will welcome Aung San Suu Kyi to Washington, DC, as the woman who led her nation from repression to freedom.  Archbishop Desmond Tutu has rightly said, ``As long as [Suu Kyi] remains under house arrest, not one of us is truly free.''  Today, I urge the State Peace and Development Council to release Aung San Suu Kyi immediately and unconditionally.  I urge the United Nations Security Council to pass a binding resolution on Burma.  And I urge the U.S. Senate to pass this joint resolution to renew the import ban on Burma for another year.                          ____________________
