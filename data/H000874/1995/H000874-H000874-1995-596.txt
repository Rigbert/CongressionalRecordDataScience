Speaker, I share the Chairman's view that this is a very appropriate resolution, and that the use of the rotunda has historically been set aside for occasions of high moment and importance, and clearly, there is no occasion more important for the international community and humanity than to remember the tragedy that occurred in the thirties and forties, the massive loss of life, and the reality and possibility of man's inhumanity to man.  Further reserving the right to object, Mr. Speaker, I yield to the gentleman from California [Mr. Thomas] for the purpose of offering his amendments.
