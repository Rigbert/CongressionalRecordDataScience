President, I understand that when the Senate reconvenes in the morning, the Leahy amendment be the pending amendment with 1 hour equally divided with no other amendments in order. Mr. President, I understand this will be agreed to by unanimous consent in closing tonight.  I ask unanimous consent the pending amendment now be set aside.
