Dr. Roe, thank you so very much for your kind remarks, and you have been a leader, as have the Members that have been speaking. There's no single leader, except for maybe Henry Hyde when he was the leader here in the House. But this is a group leadership of men and women who are just passionately in favor of life.  I mentioned doctors who are strongly members of this Pro-Life Caucus. Well, one of those is Dr. Fleming from Louisiana, and I would like to yield to him.  And I just point out that the Obama administration has declared war on conscious protections. He has done it in a repeated fashion, most recently in ordering all health insurers, including faith-based institutions, to pay for all means of preventing pregnancy, including subsidizing abortifacients like Ella and Plan B. Everyone must comply regardless of moral objection or religious tenets simply because Obama says so.  The United States Catholic Conference of Bishops recently had a grant to assist human trafficking victims under a law I wrote called the Trafficking Victims Protection Act. They did a great job. The reviewers said so and gave it very high marks. But that wasn't enough for the Obama administration. This past fall, the USCCB was blatantly discriminated against and thrown out of the program simply because they would not refer for abortions.  And Mr. Lankford, who will speak shortly as well, did a wonderful job in a hearing in bringing out, as did Chairman Issa, how discriminatory this really is.  Leading the effort on conscience protection, prime sponsor of the Abortion Nondiscrimination Act, is Dr. Fleming.
