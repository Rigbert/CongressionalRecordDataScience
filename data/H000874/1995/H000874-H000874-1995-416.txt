Speaker, we shoot at one another across this aisle. We do it verbally. There is a holocaust abroad in the world, and it is on the front page of the Washington Post, the Washington Times, the New York Times, and on every major network: Thirty thousand new refugees yesterday.  And what do we see on the front page of the Washington Post? a Dutch general, our general, the United Nations' general, having a drink with Ratko Mladic, an international terrorist, an international war criminal, an international thug.  Shame on the United Nations. Shame on the international Western community. Shame on America. We have imposed an arms embargo on the Bosnian people so they cannot defend themselves adequately. Shame on us.  Mr. Speaker, a holocaust goes on. Let us stand up, speak up, and vote to let the Serbian aggressors know that the West will not stand for international thuggery.                          ____________________
