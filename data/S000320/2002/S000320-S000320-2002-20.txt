 This fraud has cost American investors massive amounts, perhaps hundreds of billions of dollars, perhaps more. Beyond the tangible losses, investor confidence in the integrity of our capital markets has also taken a tremendous hit, as the Presiding Officer knows.  As we move forward to address the shortcomings in the oversight of our financial markets, we must carefully consider the true impact of what has occurred. Thousands of people have lost billions of dollars. Thousands of people have lost jobs. Millions of people have lost or are losing faith in our capital markets every day.  The fact is, none of this is made any easier because of the manner in which this has happened. Americans don't feel better because the mugging took place in the boardroom rather than the back alley. In many ways, what has happened is even worse. Because of the sheer size and number of participants in our markets, the corporate scams have been much more efficient and much more effective than the average boiler room fraud.  The bottom line is this: Real people are facing tremendous losses, and confidence in our system is eroding.  I believe we must address this situation with concrete measures. Fraud, even if committed by white-collar individuals--indeed, especially if committed by white-collar individuals--needs to be severely punished with criminal sanctions.  I commend the efforts to create new, tough penalties for people who commit fraud through our securities markets. I supported that, as most of the people in the Senate did.  Additionally, I believe there is more that we can do to stop or slow down the kinds of conduct that lead to situations where investing Americans are swindled out of hundreds of billions of dollars. The fact is, in one key area, the appropriate disincentives for participating in securities fraud are just not in place today.  Since 1994, after the Supreme Court ruling in the Central Bank case, there has been no liability for secondary actors who aid and abet securities fraud in America. Think about that. Since 1994, there has been no liability for secondary actors who aid and abet securities fraud. In effect, the decision in the Central Bank case led to legions of accountants, lawyers, and other security specialists who play a vital yet behind-the-scenes role in securities transactions, off the hook for down-the-line fraud in the sale of securities.  Think of it like this: The guys who procure the getaway car before the robbery, tune it up, fill it up with gas, put air in the tires, and sometimes even drive it away, face no financial liability for their involvement.  Does that make any sense? Not to me. I believe not to the majority of the Senate, if we could get a vote on the Shelby-Durbin amendment. And we will someday because this is not an issue that is going to go away.  When attorneys, accounting firms, and other securities professionals know that assisting securities fraud is nothing to worry about, as it is today, there is no wonder there has been a proliferation of audit failures, restatements, Enrons, Global Crossings, WorldComs, and many more to come. Civil and criminal penalties are important and necessary, but they are not sufficient. They serve a separate but important purpose of punishing fraudulent behavior. But they do nothing to ensure that investors, the victims, have an opportunity to seek financial redress. Civil liability supplements criminal and civil penalties and acts as a further disincentive to engage in or assist fraudulent activities.  Here are a couple of basic questions we all need to answer. Why shouldn't investors--that is, so many million in America--be able to recover losses from aiders and abettors of securities fraud? What public interest do we serve by inoculating aiders and abettors of securities fraud from civil liability? Why should this type of tort, this fraud, not give rise to a civil claim, particularly when the loss to the investor and impact on the markets is so great, as it is today?  Investors are intentionally being defrauded. Yet they have no remedy at the moment to seek monetary redress from those who aid and abet these crimes. Why? The answer is, aiders and abettors play a vital role in allowing primary actors to commit fraud. They should, accordingly, be held proportionately liable for their participation in these fraudulent schemes.  I believe for our capital markets to function properly, it is not sufficient that financial information is accurate. The public must also have full faith and confidence that it is honest, that we have integrity there.  Accountants, lawyers, and other securities professionals perform, by design, a gatekeeping function within our securities markets. It is unacceptable, I believe, that those upon whom so many rely--all of us--those whose activities can literally move markets, are not held to the highest standards. Something is wrong.  Forty years ago, at a time when securities transactions were considerably less sophisticated than they are today, Judge Henry Friendly, a distinguished jurist remarked:       In our complex society, the accountant's certificate and      the lawyer's opinion can be instruments for pecuniary lost      more potent than the chisel or the crowbar.  Today's staggering shareholder losses demonstrate that over time legal and accounting gimmicks have only grown more potent.  I believe we must create greater disincentives for those who would assist securities fraud. Restoring liability for aiders and abettors of securities fraud should make securities professionals think once, twice, even three times before they put their seal of approval on information sent to the marketplace. Such carefulness will serve investors and our markets well in the future.  Our economy has provided the best material standard of living in the world because our capital markets have traditionally favored clarity over complexity, disclosure over dissembling, and fairness over favoritism. For the sake of future economic growth and prosperity, I believe we must put those principles back into practice.  Senator Durbin and I are going to continue to pursue our amendment. As I said earlier, this is not going to go away because there are going to be more scheduled. I wish we could have done it on this bill. I yield the floor.                          ____________________
