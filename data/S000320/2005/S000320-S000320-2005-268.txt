 President, I rise today to introduce legislation with Senator Dorgan to provide a financial safety net for the families of our servicemembers who proudly serve in our Nation's military Reserve and National Guard.  Today, our National Guard and Reserve units are being called upon more than ever and are being asked to serve their country in a very different way than in the past.
