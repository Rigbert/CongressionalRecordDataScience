President, today I introduce legislation to amend the Robert T. Stafford Disaster Relief and Emergency Assistance Act. I am introducing this legislation as the chairman of the subcommittee with jurisdiction over FEMA, the Clean Air, Wetlands, Private Property, and Nuclear Safety Subcommittee. I am joined today by my ranking member, Senator Graham, who has worked closely with me in drafting this legislation. It is our intention to move swiftly through the committee process with the prospect of floor action this fall.  This bill has two main titles. The first authorizes the Predisaster Hazard Mitigation Program. This program helps communities plan for disasters before they strike which will reduce the post hazard costs associated with disasters. The second title provides a number of streamlining and cost reduction measures which will help bring into line the funds Congress ends up appropriating through supplemental budgets every time we have a major disaster.  I would like to spend a few minutes discussing two key provisions in the Predisaster Mitigation Program that I believe are very important. They relate to the Project Impact Program which was thoroughly discussed in our recent Subcommittee hearing.  Project Impact is an innovative program where FEMA is working with local communities to help them prepare for disasters. It began last year with seven pilots and was expanded this year to include one Project Impact community in every State.  Our Bill authorizes funding for the program for five years, with a sunset at the end of the five years. Based on the costs of the first 50 pilots, the funds authorized will pay for an additional 300 communities. I expect FEMA to work on how best to devolve this program to the local communities over the next five years. If this program is going to be successful then it must evolve into a State and locally run program.  Some may question why a sunset for a program like this is necessary, so let me explain. In the legislation we require the GAO to conduct a study of the program and report back to the Congress in three years. We also ask FEMA to report back on the success of the program. It is my intent that these reports make specific recommendations for the next phase of Project Impact. The House legislation only authorizes Project Impact for three years, I felt it was necessary to authorize the program for five years which will give Congress plenty of time to authorize the next phase of Project Impact.  This program cannot be another Federal bureaucratic program that continues to mushroom without clear direction and with escalating costs. At this point no one has enough experience to predict how this program should look in five years. As FEMA says, this is not just another big government program, and Congress should not treat it as one. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be printed in the Record.  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the Record, as follows:                                S. 2361       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of      the United States of America in Congress assembled,     SECTION 1.

(a) Findings.--Congress finds that--       (1) greater emphasis needs to be placed on identifying and      assessing the risks to States and local communities and      implementing adequate measures to reduce losses from natural      disasters and to ensure that critical facilities and public      infrastructure will continue to function after a disaster;       (2) expenditures for post-disaster assistance are      increasing without commensurate reduction in the likelihood      of future losses from natural disasters;       (3) a high priority in the expenditure of Federal funds      under the Robert T. Stafford Disaster Relief and Emergency      Assistance Act (42 U.S.C. 5121 et seq.) should be to      implement predisaster activities at the local level; and       (4) with a unified effort of economic incentives, awareness      and education, technical assistance, and demonstrated Federal      support, States and local communities will be able to      increase their capabilities to--       (A) form effective community-based partnerships for      mitigation purposes;       (B) implement effective natural disaster mitigation      measures that reduce the risk of future damage, hardship, and      suffering;       (C) ensure continued functioning of critical facilities and      public infrastructure;       (D) leverage additional non-Federal resources into meeting      disaster resistance goals; and       (E) make commitments to long-term disaster mitigation      efforts for new and existing structures.       (b) Purpose.--The purpose of this title is to establish a      predisaster hazard mitigation program that--       (1) reduces the loss of life and property, human suffering,      economic disruption, and disaster assistance costs resulting      from natural hazards; and       (2) provides a source of predisaster hazard mitigation      funding that will assist States and local governments in      implementing effective mitigation measures that are designed      to ensure the continued functioning     of critical facilities and public infrastructure after a      natural disaster.     SEC. 102. STATE MITIGATION PROGRAM.       Section 201(c) of the Robert T.
