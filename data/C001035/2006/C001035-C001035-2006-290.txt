President, as a long-time supporter of stem cell research, I want to commend the majority leader for working out an agreement that will give the Senate the opportunity to act on this critically important issue.  I am particularly pleased that the Senate will finally have the opportunity to vote on the Stem Cell Research Enhancement Act. I am proud to be a cosponsor of this bipartisan bill which will expand the number of stem cell lines that are eligible for federally funded research, enabling scientists to take full advantage of the scientific and medical opportunities provided by stem cells. At the same time, it establishes standards and creates a framework to ensure that this research is conducted ethically.
