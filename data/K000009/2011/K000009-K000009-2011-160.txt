Speaker, I rise today to pay tribute to the National Exchange Club as it celebrates a centennial of service. The National Exchange Club--a service organization with 700 clubs and over 22,000 members throughout the United States and Puerto Rico--will begin celebrating its 100th anniversary March 27, 2011, with celebration events occurring throughout the year.  To kick-off this milestone, the Exchange Clubs of the Toledo area will host a special ceremony on the date of the anniversary, Sunday, March 27, 2011, with dignitaries, members and guests at the National Headquarters located in the city of Toledo. A display of 100 American Flags on the front lawn will greet visitors who will be able to view a Freedom Shrine featuring a collection of 29 original historic documents chronicling our nation's journey to freedom, including the U.S. Constitution, the Declaration of Independence and several Presidential addresses.  Founded on March 27, 1911 in Detroit, Michigan by businessmen who wanted to ``exchange'' ideas, the Exchange Club moved its headquarters to Toledo, Ohio, in 1917. Through a century, its volunteer efforts have supported the needs of the country and of local communities, making it the country's oldest American service organization operating exclusively in the United States.  With a focus on ``Americanism'' the Exchange Club promotes the grand ideal that our country plays a special role as a beacon of freedom, democracy, equality and inclusiveness. Living the ideal, the Exchange Club's national project is the Prevention of Child Abuse. Exchange also sponsors activities designed to benefit, award and develop our nation's youth, prevent crime, serve senior citizens and recognize military and public safety service providers. Even as it remembers a century in practicing the ideals of ``Americanism'' in voluntary service to all citizens--from those who are vulnerable to those who protect--The Exchange Club moves forward to bring its mission into the next century. We honor the efforts of the members of the Exchange Club for leadership, vision, and compassion. Onward!                          ____________________
