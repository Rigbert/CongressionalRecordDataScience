 They had Washington counsel, distinguished counsel of very high quality. They tried to assert the rights under the statute, and the court essentially turned them down. This isn't what we think; this is what happens. I will quote a bit more from Professor Tribe on this very subject, until Senator Byrd, who is next, comes to the Chamber.  Larry Tribe makes this statement:       Beginning with the premise that the Constitution should not      be amended lightly and should never be amended to achieve      short-term partisan or purely policy objectives, I would      argue that a constitutional amendment is appropriate only      when the goal involves (1) a needed change in government      structure, or (2) a needed recognition of a basic human      right, where (a) the right is one that people widely agree      deserves serious and permanent respect, (b) the right is one      that is insufficiently protected under existing law, (c) the      right is one that cannot be adequately protected through      purely political action such as state or federal legislation      and/or regulation, (d) the right is one whose inclusion in      the United States Constitution would not distort or endanger      basic principles of the separation of powers among the      federal branches . . . (e) the right would be judicially      enforceable without creating open-ended or otherwise      unacceptable funding obligations.  Professor Tribe goes on to say:       I believe that S.J. Res. 3 meets these criteria. The rights      in question--rights of crime     victims not to be victimized yet again through the processes      by which government bodies and officials prosecute, punish,      and/or release the accused or convicted offender--are      indisputably basic human rights against government, rights      that any civilized system of justice would aspire to protect      and strive never to violate.
