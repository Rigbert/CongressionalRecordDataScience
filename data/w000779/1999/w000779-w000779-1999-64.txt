Leahy, and Mr. Baucus) submitted the following resolution; which was referred to the Committee on Finance.                               S. Res. 58       Whereas electronic commerce is not bound by geography and      its borders are not easily discernible;       Whereas transmissions over the Internet are made through      packet-switching, making it impossible to determine with any      degree of certainty the precise geographic route or endpoints      of specific Internet transmissions and infeasible to separate      interstate from interstate, and domestic from foreign,      Internet transmissions;       Whereas inconsistent and inadministrable taxes imposed on      Internet activity by subnational and national governments      threaten not only to subject consumers, businesses and other      users engaged in interstate and foreign commerce to multiple,      confusing and burdensome taxation, but also to restrict the      growth and continued technological maturation of the Internet      itself;       Whereas the complexity of the issue of domestic taxation of      electronic commerce is compounded when considered at the      global level of almost 200 separate national governments;       Whereas the First Annual Report of the United States      Government Working Group on Electronic Commerce found that      fewer than 10 million people worldwide were using the      Internet in 1995, that more than 140 million people worldwide      were using the Internet in 1998 and that more than one      billion people worldwide will be using the Internet in the      first decade of the next Century;       Whereas information technology industries have accounted      for more than one-third of real growth in United States Gross      Domestic Product over the past 3 years;       Whereas information technology industries employ more than      seven million people in the United States, and by 2006, more      than one-half of the United States workforce is expected to      be employed in industries that are either major producers or      intensive users of information technology products and      services;       Whereas electronic commerce among businesses worldwide is      expected to grow from $43 billion in 1998 to more than $1.3      trillion by 2003, and electronic retail sales to consumers      worldwide are expected to grow from $8 billion in 1998 to      more than $108 billion by 2003;       Whereas the Internet Tax Freedom Act of 1998 enacted a      policy of technological neutrality and non-discrimination      toward taxation of electronic commerce, and stated that      United States policy should be to seek bilateral, regional      and multilateral agreements to remove barriers to global      electronic commerce;       Whereas the World Trade Organization, at its May 1998      Ministerial Conference, adopted a declaration that all 132      member countries ``will continue their current practice of      not imposing customs duties on electronic transmissions'';       Whereas the Organization for Economic Cooperation and      Development and industry groups issued a joint declaration at      its October 1998 Ministerial meeting on Global Electronic      Commerce supporting the principles of technological      neutrality and non-discrimination and opposing discriminatory      taxation imposed on the Internet and electronic commerce;       Whereas the Committee on Fiscal Affairs of the Organization      for Economic Cooperation and Development has stated that      neutrality, efficiency, certainty and simplicity,      effectiveness and fairness, and flexibility are the broad      taxation principles that should be applied to electronic      commerce;       Whereas the United States has issued joint statements on      electronic commerce with Australia, the European Union,      France, Ireland, Japan, and Korea providing that any taxation      of electronic commerce should be neutral and      nondiscriminatory; and       Whereas a July 1999 United Nations Report on Human      Development urged world governments to impose ``bit taxes''      on electronic transmissions; Now, therefore, be it       Resolved by the Senate (the House of Representatives      concurring), That the Congress--       (1) urges the President to seek a global consensus      supporting--       (A) a permanent international moratorium on tariffs on      electronic commerce; and       (B) an international ban on special, multiple, and      discriminatory taxation of electronic commerce and the      Internet;       (2) urges the President to instruct the United States      delegation to the November 1999 World Trade Organization      ministerial in Seattle to seek to make permanent and binding      the moratorium on tariffs on electronic transmissions adopted      by the World Trade Organization in May 1998;       (3) urges the President to seek adoption by the      Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development and      implementation by the group's 29 member countries of an      international ban on special, multiple, or discriminatory      taxation of electronic commerce and the Internet; and       (4) urges the President to oppose any proposal by any      country, the United Nations, or any other multilateral      organization to establish a bit tax on electronic      transmissions.
