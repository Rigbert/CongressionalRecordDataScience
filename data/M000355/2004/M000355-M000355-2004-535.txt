 President, I rise today to honor the life of a noted Kentuckian and inspiring educator, Ms. Flora Allen. I also take this opportunity to extend my condolences to her daughters, Nora Ruth Jenkins and Margaret Cornelison, her five grandchildren, and all who knew and loved this remarkable woman.  Ms. Allen knew she wanted to be a teacher at a very early age. What she didn't know was the amazing impact she would have on the students she taught.  After moving to Berea, KY in 1946, she earned her bachelor's degree in teaching from Berea College and her masters from Eastern Kentucky University. She taught Kentucky history, social studies and science for 32 years. In addition to the traditional lessons, Ms. Allen also taught life lessons, such as how to behave and treat others.  When Ms. Allen was away from the classroom, she was busy in her community. She was a member of the Lioness Club, Berea Retired Teachers Association, Progress Club, Delta Kappa Gamma, and Berea Baptist Church where she taught Sunday school and Bible school. Ms. Allen spent her summers and remaining spare time working in the flower shop she owned with her husband, Allen's Flowers. Even with all this activity, Ms. Allen's best and most admirable attributes can be seen through the lives she touched.  It has become cliche to say that teachers inspire. Undoubtedly, informed of such a happening, Ms. Allen would simply have smiled and stated that it had been her goal all along. What is not cliche is the fact that she instilled in her students a desire to learn, to know, and to understand. Not all of her former students went on to be historians. However, it is certain that a great many of them who were inspired by her have become better citizens.  I ask each of my colleagues to join me in paying tribute to Flora Allen; for all that she gave to her community, her students, and to her family. She will be missed.                          ____________________
