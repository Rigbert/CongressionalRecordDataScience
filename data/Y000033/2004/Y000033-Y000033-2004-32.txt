Mr. Speaker, it is my understanding that this is a resolution continuing present law until September 24 for highways and until the end of the month of September for transit and other activities under present law. That is my understanding.  We must do this, as the gentleman is well aware, because, if we do not, then the ongoing activities of States across this Nation will be brought to a halt. We have high hopes that by the 24th of September, as the gentleman mentioned, we will have a meeting of the minds on what we call the total bill and there will be no longer any need for a continuing resolution. That is the hope of this chairman, and I am sure it is the hope of the gentleman also.  Basically, that is what this resolution does.
