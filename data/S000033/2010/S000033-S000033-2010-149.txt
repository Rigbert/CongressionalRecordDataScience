 Recently, Ms. Paterson was named National Ambassador for Young People's Literature by the Librarian of Congress James H. Billington.  Katherine Paterson's accomplishments as an author surely merit her appointment. She has twice been awarded the prestigious Newbery Medal, once for ``Bridge to Terabithia'' and a second time for ``Jacob Have I Loved.'' In addition, she won the National Book Award, also twice, for ``The Great Gilly Hopkins'' and ``The Master Puppeteer.'' Nor are these the only major recognitions of her importance as one of the major writers of our time. She has won 19 additional literary awards for other works, including the Hans Christian Andersen Medal, the Astrid Lindgren Memorial Award and the Governor's Award for Excellence in the Arts, which was awarded to her by her home State of Vermont.  Katherine Paterson was named a Living Legend by the Library of Congress in 2000.  Her most recent book is ``The Day of the Pelican,'' a moving, dramatic story of a refugee family's flight from war-torn Kosovo to America. It is the 2010 selection for Vermont Reads, a statewide reading program.  Katherine Paterson has long been dedicated to promoting literacy among young people, which makes her appointment as National Ambassador for Young People's Literature particularly appropriate. She has chosen ``Read for Your Life'' as the theme for her platform for the upcoming 2 years as National Ambassador. Throughout her tenure, she will be a most articulate advocate for the importance of literature in young people's lives.  We in Vermont are proud of Katherine Paterson's accomplishments as a writer. We are proud of her dedication to literacy among young readers. And, at this moment, we are proud that our national library, the Library of Congress, has conferred upon her this new honor, and the enlarged task of being the Nation's leading advocate for young people's literature.                          ____________________
