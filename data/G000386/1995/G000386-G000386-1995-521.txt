 President, this request is from the floor leader. I ask unanimous consent that the Senate stand in recess from 3:15 p.m. until 4 p.m. today.  There being no objection, at 3:15 p.m., the Senate recessed until 4 p.m.; whereupon, the Senate reassembled when called to order by the Presiding Officer (Mrs. Hutchison).                          ____________________
