Mr. McCONNELL. Mr. President, on behalf of myself and the distinguished Democratic leader, Mr. Schumer, I send to the desk a resolution on documentary production by the Select Committee on Intelligence, and ask for its immediate consideration.  Mr. McCONNELL. Mr. President, the Select Committee on Intelligence has received a request from the Department of Justice in a pending criminal case against Paul J. Manafort, Jr., for a copy of a transcript of an interview that the Committee staff conducted of a witness named W. Samuel Patten in January 2018.  In response to this request, this resolution would authorize the Chairman and Vice Chairman of the Select Committee on Intelligence, acting jointly, to provide a copy of the interview transcript, under appropriate security procedures, to the prosecution, which intends to share it with the defense under a protective order entered in the case.                          ____________________
