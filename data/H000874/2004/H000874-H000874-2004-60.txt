 Mr. DeLAY. Mr. Speaker, I appreciate the gentleman yielding to me. The committees have been working, and many committees have been working in a bipartisan way. I think a bill will be introduced in the next day or two, possibly tomorrow; and the committees have been instructed to mark up that bill, and I think that bill covers 12 different committees. Next week, and we hope to have the final product ready to come to the floor either by the end of next week or the following.
