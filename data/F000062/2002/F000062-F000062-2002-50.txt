 President, I am proud to introduce legislation today to transfer 27 acres of land from the Stanislaus National Forest to the Clovis Unified School District.  This bill allows the school district to continue operating the California Five Mile Regional Learning Center and, more importantly, raise the necessary funds to renovate the facilities.  Since 1989, Clovis Unified School District has leased the Five Mile Regional Learning Center from the Forest Service to offer programs to students living in the Central Valley. And each year, thousands of eager children come to the Center to take classes that emphasize natural resource conservation. During this past academic year, for instance, more than 14,000 students benefitted from classes ranging from forest management to aviary studies to team building.  In addition to classes, students have the option of attending summer basketball camps offered in the Center's gymnasium and participating in individual activities given on the Center's adjacent 93 acres. To date, the district has invested $14 million of local funds to provide these opportunities.  Unfortunately, in the last few years, the Regional Learning Center has fallen into a state of disrepair. The buildings that occupy the 27 acres are over 40 years old, but have never undergonemajor renovations to modernize and improve them. As a result, the Center has a laundry list of items in need of repair: from cracked asphalt and leaky roofs to unreliable electrical wiring. And while Clovis Unified School District officials have done a fine job of operating the Center and are willing to invest in renovations, the Forest Service can not permit the district to spend local funds to renovate these federally owned buildings.  This bill enables the Forest Service to convey the acreage that the buildings occupy to the school district allowing the district to make the necessary repairs. Clovis Unified has already committed to investing $5 million over 5 years to make the renovations, in addition to the district's $1.2 million of annual contributions spent on routine maintenance and operating costs. These investments will be used to expand and enhance the Center's environmental educational curriculum. I believe that given the budget constraints that schools nationwide are facing that this commitment speaks to the quality of these programs and to the need to keep the Center in operation.  The Forest Service has already acknowledged that this transfer would be in the best interest of both the Forest Service and the general public. At the Forest Service's request, reversionary language was added to this bill to ensure that the gederal government would retain ownership of the land should the school district decide to no longer operate the facilities.  Without this important legislation, in a few years time, the California Five Mile Regional Learning Center will be uninhabitable and another educational resource that benefits our children will close its doors. I believe that this bill is the perfect example of what can happen when local, state, and federal governments work together to get something done. It is this type of partnership that Congress should support in our efforts to diversify and improve educational opportunities for students and encourage multi-use activities on federal land. In this case, I believe everyone wins and I urge my colleagues to join me in supporting this bill.  I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be printed in the Record.  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the Record, as follows:                                S. 2838       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of      the United States of America in Congress assembled,     SECTION 1.
