Speaker, this past weekend I held two town hall meetings in Wisconsin's Fifth District that had record turnout. The headline in the local paper summed up the meeting well: ``Health Reform Bill Gets Thumbs Down in Elm Grove.''  Very few people in Wisconsin's Fifth District believe a program costing more than a trillion dollars can be deficit neutral. My constituents were overwhelming opposed to any government takeover of health care.  I believe the right way to improve health care is to prioritize spending and be careful with taxpayer dollars.  The wrong way is to raise taxes even higher and dig our debt even deeper to pay for more wasteful programs that don't work.  This health care overhaul bill will likely make Cash for Clunkers look like a Black Friday door buster item!  Before we raise taxes to pay for yet another program, we owe it to our constituents to cut out the waste, fraud, and abuse of government programs.  One size does not fit all when it comes to health care. A patient and their physician should be in charge of their health care decisions, not politicians.  I too, give this bill a thumbs down.
