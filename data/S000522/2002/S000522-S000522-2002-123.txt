Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentleman for yielding me time.  Mr. Speaker, let me offer an analogy, a Biblical quotation, and I paraphrase: Give a man a fish and he will eat for a day; teach that person to fish, and he will have food for a lifetime.  This is the kind of venture that has not only worked well in other countries, but has worked well in Michigan, in Illinois and many other States. I only wish we would expand this kind of program, that takes an individual that has the willingness to venture into enterpraneurship and the hard work that is required in any capitalistic movement, and give funding to that individual so that they can develop a business that is not only going to help them, but going to help their community.  Again, to the gentleman from New Jersey (Mr. Smith) and the colleagues on the other side of the aisle that helped with this legislation, this is probably a more efficient way to help more people in more countries than a lot of the foreign aid that we have pursued in prior years.  Mr. Speaker, in closing, let me say I urge my colleagues to vote for H.R. 4073.
