Madam Speaker, I would like to extend my congratulations to the people of the Republic of China (Taiwan) as they mark their National Day this October 10. Taiwan is our important ally in the Asia Pacific region and a key trading partner with Alaska. Due to the hard work of Taiwan's president, Dr. Ma Ying-jeou, the relationship between the U.S. and Taiwan remains strong. I hope that these relations will continue to flourish as trade, educational and cultural exchanges, security cooperation, and Taiwan's participation in international organizations increases.  I would also like to recognize President Ma, who, in the last two years, has significantly improved the relations between Taiwan and Mainland China. There has been a considerable reduction of tension across the Taiwan Strait and there have been productive talks between the two sides on a number of important issues, including the signing of the Economic Cooperation Framework Agreement on June 29 this year.  In celebrating Taiwan's National Day, I hope that Taiwan will continue to have a strong relationship with United States, China and the rest of the global economy.                          ____________________
