Madam Speaker, on Monday, July 30, Patriarch Teoctist, the head of the Romanian Orthodox Church, died in Bucharest of complications after a surgery. He was 92 years old and had not been in good health for several weeks.  As a member of the Foreign Affairs Committee and the Helsinki Commission, I have been very concerned and active on issues regarding the promotion of human rights and children's rights in Romania. I have visited Romania five times--both when it was under Communist rule and since 1990--and I know Patriarch Teoctist was respected and beloved by millions of Romanians. He became patriarch in 1986, resigned immediately after the revolution in 1989 that overthrew the dictatorship of Nicolae Ceaucescu, but was recalled by the Holy Synod of the Romanian Orthodox Church.  Madam Speaker, after 1990 Teoctist promoted ecumenical dialogue. He invited Pope John Paul II to visit Romania. This visit took place in 1999 in Bucharest, where Teoctist met with Pope John Paul II, embraced him fraternally and prayed with him. What a magnificent gesture! It was the first time the Roman pontiff visited a predominantly Orthodox country since the schism of 1054.  At this time of sorrow, I wish to express my condolences to the Romanian Orthodox believers and confidence and prayers that Teoctist rest in peace.                          ____________________
