 President, I rise to respond to a colloquy yesterday that occurred between Senators Ayotte, Lieberman, and Graham regarding amendment No. 1068 offered by Senator Ayotte to the Defense authorization bill.  Senator Ayotte's amendment would eliminate measures that provide our interrogators with the guidance and clarity they need to effectively solicit actionable intelligence while upholding American values. In doing so, the amendment would override the better judgment of our military and intelligence professionals in a manner that will harm, not improve, our short- and long-term security.  Yesterday, Senator Lieberman said on the Senate floor that he wants prisoners taken captive by the United States to be ``terrified about what is going to happen to them while in American custody.'' He also said he wants ``the terror they inflict on others to be felt by them.'' I believe that such statements are antithetical to fundamental American values. I firmly believe that America will not and cannot lower itself to the level of terrorists. To do so would be to abandon our most cherished principles and what our country stands for.  There was also discussion of abuses at Abu Ghraib, which diminished America's standing and outraged the American public.  As chairman of the Select Committee on Intelligence, I can say that we are nearing the completion a comprehensive review of the CIA's former interrogation and detention program, and I can assure the Senate and the Nation that coercive and abusive treatment of detainees in U.S. custody went beyond a few isolated incidents at Abu Ghraib.  Moreover, the abuse stemmed not from the isolated acts of a few bad apples but from fact that the line was blurred between what is permissible and impermissible conduct, putting U.S. personnel in an untenable position with their superiors and the law.  That is why Congress and the executive branch subsequently acted to provide our intelligence and military professionals with the clarity and guidance they need to effectively carry out their missions. And that is where the September, 2006 Army Field Manual comes in.  However, Senator Ayotte's amendment would require the executive branch to adopt a classified interrogation annex to the Army Field Manual, a concept that even the Bush administration rejected outright in 2006.  Senator Ayotte argued that the United States needs secret and undisclosed interrogation measures to successfully interrogate terrorists and gain actionable intelligence. However, our intelligence, military, and law enforcement professionals, who actually interrogate terrorists as part of their jobs, universally disagree. They believe that with the Army Field Manual as it currently is written, they have the tools needed to obtain actionable intelligence from U.S. detainees.  Further, in 2009, after an extensive review, the intelligence community unanimously asserted that it had all the guidance and tools it needed to conduct effective interrogations. The Special Task Force on Interrogations--which included representatives from the CIA, Defense Department, the Office of the Director of Intelligence, and others--concluded that ``no additional or different guidance was necessary.''  Since 2009, the interagency High Value Detainee Interrogation Group Interrogation Group has assured the Senate Intelligence Committee that it has all the authority it needs to effectively gain actionable intelligence. =========================== NOTE ===========================     On page S8130, December 1, 2011, the Record reads:There was also, discussion of abuses at Abu Ghraib, which diminished America}s standing and outraged the American public, and there was discussion about how there were a few isolated incidents at Abu Ghraib. . . . detainees in U.S. custody was far more systematic and widespread than we thought. . . . their missions. And that is where the Army Field Manual comes in.Since 2009, the interagency High Value Detainee Interrogation Group has briefed the Select Committee on Intelligence numerous times. The group has repeatedly assured the Committee that they have all the authority they need to effectively gain actionable intelligence. As a consummate consumer of the intelligence products they produce, I agree.    The online Record has been corrected to read: There was also, discussion of abuses at Abu Ghraib, which diminished America}s standing and outraged the American public . . . detainees in U.S. custody went beyond a few isolated incidents at Abu Ghraib. . . . their missions. And that is where the September, 2006 Army Field Manual comes in. . . . Interrogation Group has assured the Senate Intelligence Committee that it has all the authority it needs to effectively gain actionable intelligence. ========================= END NOTE =========================   Unfortunately, amendment No. 1068 would overrule the judgments of these professionals--who have served under both the Bush and Obama administrations--and impede their important work.  If our intelligence community is telling us that the current guidelines and interrogation techniques are effective, why would we add secret interrogation methods?  Senator Ayotte's amendment would muddy the waters on what is and isn't permissible in interrogating U.S. detainees. Her amendment would overturn not only the Executive order on lawful interrogations but also roll back the McCain amendment passed in 2005--which the Senate approved in a 90-to-9 vote--by allowing some interrogators, including some military interrogators, to evade established interrogation protocols.  In creating unnecessary exceptions to existing interrogation guidance, Senator Ayotte's amendment would deprive our military and intelligence professionals of the clarity they deserve and threaten to reopen the door to secret techniques and other abuses of U.S. detainees.  While Senator Ayotte has insisted that her amendment would continue to prohibit cruelty, the colloquy on the floor suggests otherwise. When Senator Graham asked her if the amendment was needed to bring back enhanced interrogation techniques--techniques we now know included induced hypothermia, slapping, sleep deprivation, and forced stressed positions she responded in the affirmative.  We cannot have it both ways. Either we make clear to the world that the United States will honor our values and treat prisoners humanely or we let the world believe that we have secret interrogation methods to terrorize and torture our prisoners.  The Ayotte proposal also ignores the dangerous practical implications for our intelligence and military partners overseas.  The colloquy between the Senators yesterday suggests they believe the United States will have some advantage by having a secret list of interrogation techniques and that this will have no negative implications, aside from giving interrogators more options.  Last year, GEN David Petraeus said it best when he unequivocally asserted that we should not return to so-called ``enhanced'' techniques because they ``undermine your cause'' and ``bite you in the backside in the long run.''  Current U.S. law and policy makes clear that America is committed to fundamental humane treatment standards. By overturning the status quo, the Ayotte amendment would create dangerous pockets of uncertainty to the detriment of our international standing, our intelligence collectors, and our national security.  Should this amendment ever come to the floor of the Senate, I urge my fellow Senators to oppose it.
