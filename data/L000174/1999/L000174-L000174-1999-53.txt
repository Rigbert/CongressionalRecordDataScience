President, I ask unanimous consent the Senator from Maine and the Senator from New York be recognized, and then the Senator from Wisconsin, Mr. Kohl, and the Senator from North Carolina, Mr. Edwards, be recognized for 5 minutes each after the Senator from Maine and the Senator from New York, and then the floor go to the Senator from California--now that I see the Senator from Iowa on the floor--so she could then go back to the bankruptcy bill.
