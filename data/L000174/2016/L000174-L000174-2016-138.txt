President, I know that Vermont has very few gun laws, but we at least restrict the number of rounds that one can put in a semiautomatic gun during deer season. I would like to see as much restriction and protection for the children who are walking our streets, the people in our churches or our synagogues, and the people gathering for social reasons as we do to protect the deer herd.  My final question is one that I get from Vermonters all the time. These Vermonters--many are gun owners and many are not--are all repulsed and saddened not just by what they saw this past weekend in Florida but by what they see with numbing consistency on our news. Day after day after day they see people being gunned down in the streets of America. They ask me: What is Congress doing? They ask me why Congress is not responding by giving law enforcement the tools they need. Certainly law enforcement wants to stop this. I suspect the questions I get asked in Vermont are similar to the questions that my friend from Connecticut gets.  How do we respond to these Americans--thousands in Vermont and millions throughout this country--who say: What in heaven's name are you doing in Washington to make life safer for us?
