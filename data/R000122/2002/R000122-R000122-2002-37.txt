President, I rise to call attention to the 28th anniversary of the Turkish invasion and occupation in the Republic of Cyprus.  In 1974, the Turkish Government sent 35,000 Turkish troops in two separate actions into Cyprus, obstensibly to put down a coup attempt against Cyprus President Makarios and to protect Turkish Cypriots. However, after taking over 36 percent of the northern part of the island, Turkish troops remained. This led to the Turkish Cypriots declaring their own government, the Turkish Republic of Northern Cyprus; a government only Turkey recognizes.  Since then, the United Nations has maintained a buffer zone between the two land areas. The U.N. Secretary General has called Cyprus ``one of the most militarized regions of the world.'' Despite the U.N.'s presence and numerous attempts at settlement, there have been many tragic results of the Turkish intervention: nearly 200,000 Greek Cypriots have been displaced, over 1,000 Greek Cypriots and 4 Americans remain unaccounted for, over 400 Greek Cypriots remain enclaved in the occupied area, and the Turkish troop presence continues. For this and other reasons, I was proud to cosponsor S.C.R. 28, calling for a U.S. effort to end restrictions on the freedoms and human rights of the enclaved people in the occupied area of Cyprus.  We should be heartened that it appears that the settlement process may be making some progress. Talks between Cyprus President Clerides and Turkish Cypriot Leader Denktash began in January of 2002 under the auspices of the U.N., and although they missed the June deadline for settlement, they have continued their dialog.  The U.S. must remain committed to the settlement process. A durable, comprehensive settlement that addresses the legitimate concerns of both sides and promotes regional stability would benefit Cypress, the region, and U.S. interests. Cypress is an important partner and friend of the U.S. Most recently Cypress has cooperated in the fight against terrorism since September 11 and was of enormous help when it agreed to allow the 13 Palestians in Bethlehem to stopover temporarily on their final destination in the EU.  On the anniversary of the day Cyprus was divided we must renew our efforts to promote measures aimed at reunification and designed to reduce tensions and promote peace between the two communities.                          ____________________
