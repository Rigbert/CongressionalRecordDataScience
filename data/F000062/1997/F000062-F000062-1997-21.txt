  We are open to a compromise. We are willing today to accept the very language that we thought we had agreed upon, which gave us the two and a half issues out of the four which would enable us to have public-private competition at these bases. In order for this to occur, we must return to the earlier compromise language, before the changes were made.  Madam President, I cannot tell you what a big deal this is in Northern California. The entire community has been mobilized around this concept of possibly being able to privatize the workload. All we are asking for is fairness. All we are asking is that the deck not be stacked against us. All we are asking is that public depots not have the opportunity to fudge bids by hiding costs. This conference report denies that, and we have decided that we will use every avenue open to us to fightthis bill until we either achieve a compromise or a veto.
