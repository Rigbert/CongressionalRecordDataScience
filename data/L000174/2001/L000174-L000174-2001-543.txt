President, if I may interrupt, I hope Senators who have amendments they want to bring down, and I hope they will because I think many of us would like to get some amendments that would be in a position to be voted on perhaps early tomorrow morning so we can start fairly quickly.  As I said, we would have finished this bill last week had we not had ergonomics and other things interfering.
