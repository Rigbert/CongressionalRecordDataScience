 President, I think it is very important that this directive, which clearly states that it is the policy of the Taiwanese government to pursue national reunification and strongly oppose independence, be known by the world.  Now there will be a window of opportunity following Saturday's election for resumption of the Cross-Straits Initiative that was derailed last summer after Lee Teng-hui's visit. This dialogue, conducted by China's Association for Relations Across the Taiwan Straits and Taiwan's Straits Exchange Foundation, offers a unique opportunity to begin to meet and discuss the major issues concerning reunification.  China has for some time offered Taiwan direct air service. As you know, today the plane leaves Taiwan, it appears to land at Macao, it changes its flight number, and it goes on to China. This is not necessary. China is prepared to once again offer, as its Vice Foreign Minister told 10 U.S. Senators who were present at a meeting last week, direct sea service and direct postal service.  I ardently urge both parties to sit down at the table and begin to discuss issues around which there is a commoninterest. One has to be a One China policy. The second has to be peaceful reunification. The third has to be steps taken to achieve both of the foregoing.  I think the peace, security, and stability of Asia, and perhaps the world, are at stake in these discussions.  I earnestly and sincerely implore the parties, both the People's Republic of China and the Republic of China, to sit down at the table, to end these military exercises, and to resolve a peaceful reunification for the future.  I thank the Chair for your indulgence.
