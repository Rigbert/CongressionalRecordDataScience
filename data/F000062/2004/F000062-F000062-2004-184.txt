 President, the substitute amendment, which I have offered, has been crafted to avoid these problems.  Our amendment, the Motherhood Protection Act, will accomplish the same goal as the Unborn Victims of Violence Act, but will do so in a way that does not involve us in the debate about abortion or when life begins. In my view, there is no reason to vote against this substitute unless the intention is to establish legally that human life, for the purposes of Federal criminal law, begins at the moment of conception because, ladies and gentlemen, that is exactly what this bill does.  To emphasize the point, let me again turn to the comments of Samuel Casey, executive director and CEO of the Christian Legal Society, who clearly states the intention behind the bill in this quote:       In as many areas as we can, we want to put on the books      that the embryo is a person. . . .That sets the stage for a      jurist to acknowledge that human beings at any stage of      development deserve protection--even protection that would      trump a woman's interest in terminating a pregnancy.  Let there be no doubt about the intent. Anyone who is pro-choice cannot vote for this bill without the expectation that they are creating the first legal bridge to destroy Roe v. Wade.  Now, there is a time and a place to discuss the morality and philosophy of when life begins. This is not that time. Now is the time to change our Federal law to punish criminals who would inflict grievous injuries or death upon pregnant women on Federal lands. So I urge my colleagues to support the substitute amendment.                               Exhibit 1                                          Stanford Law School,                                      Stanford, CA, July 10, 2003.     Senator Dianne Feinstein,     U.S. Senate, Senate Hart Office Building, Washington, DC.       Dear Senator Feinstein: I wish to express my concern about      the current formulation of S. 1019, the Unborn Victims of      Violence Act of 2003. Although I fully endorse the Bill's      ultimate aim of protecting pregnant women from the physical      and psychological trauma of an endangered or lost pregnancy,      I believe that the Bill's current formulation will frustrate      rather than forward this goal.       I write both as a former prosecutor and as a law professor      specializing in criminal law and criminal prosecution. At the      outset of my career, I served as an assistant district      attorney in Middlesex County, Mass., and as an assistant      attorney general in the Massachusetts Attorney General's      office. I then went to Boston College Law School, where I      administered and taught in the criminal prosecution clinic. I      have been at Stanford since 1995 and a tenured professor of      law since 1999; during the next academic year, I will serve      as Academic Associate Dean. In 1996 I founded Stanford's      criminal prosecution clinic and have administered and taught      in the clinic ever since. I have also created a course in      prosecutorial ethics, which I taught at Boston College Law      School and, as a visitor, at Harvard Law School.       My background and interest in criminal prosecution prompt      me to raise three objections to this Bill. All of them focus      on the Bill's use of the expressions ``child in utero'' and      ``child, who is in utero,'' and on its definition of these      terms as ``a member of the species homo sapiens, at any stage      of development, who is carried in the womb.''       First: The Bill's apparent purpose of influencing the      course of abortion politics will discourage prosecutions      under any future Act.       I do not know what motives gave rise to the Bill's use of      the expressions ``child in utero'' and ``child, who is in      utero,'' but I do know that any vaguely savvy reader will      conclude that these terms and the Bill's definition of      them were intended by the Bill's authors to influence the      course of abortion politics. It is a fair prediction that      when a pro-life President is in office, prosecutions under      this Bill will be more frequent than when a pro-choice      President is in office. That is because the public will      interpret this Bill as suggesting that abortion is a      potentially criminal act and will interpret prosecutions      under the Bill as endorsing this sentiment.       If the authors of the Bill truly seek to protect unborn      life from criminal violence, they will better accomplish this      purpose by avoiding such expressions as ``child in utero.''      Better alternatives would refer to injury or death to a fetus      or damage to or termination of a pregnancy.       Second: The Bill's apparent purpose of influencing the      course of abortion politics will motivate prosecutors to      exclude those prospective jurors who otherwise would be most      sympathetic to the prosecution's case.       If I were prosecuting a case under this Bill, I would hope      to have a jury that includes persons deeply sensitive to the      rights and interests of pregnant women. Such jurors would      regard an attack on a pregnant woman as being a twofold      crime, comprising both the injury directly inflicted on the      mother and the stark emotional and physical trauma resulting      from injury to or loss of her pregnancy.       But such jurors also will be more likely than others to      believe that pregnant women have the right to exercise      autonomy over their bodies and to choose whether to abort a      pregnancy. I predict that many or most judges will bar      prosecutors and defense counsel from questioning prospective      jurors about their views on abortion or about related matters      such as their religion, religious practices, or political      affiliations. Forced to act largely on instinct, prosecutors      may be inclined to exercise peremptory challenges against      those prospective jurors who appear to be most sympathetic to      the rights of pregnant women. This result clearly would      frustrate the Bill's stated purpose of protecting unborn life      from criminal violence.       Third: The Bill's apparent purpose of influencing the      course of abortion politics offends the integrity of the      criminal law.       To anyone who cares deeply about the integrity of the      criminal law, this Bill's apparent attempt to insert an      abortion broadside into the criminal code is greatly      offensive. The power to inflict criminal penalties is, second      only to the power to wage war, the highest trust invested in      our institutions of government. Because the power to make and      enforce criminal laws inherently carries enormous potential      for abuse, those who exercise that power must always do so      with a spirit free of any ulterior political motive. The      American Bar Association's Standards Relating to the      Administration of Criminal Justice provide that ``[i]n making      the decision to prosecute, the prosecutor should give no      weight to the personal or political advantages or      disadvantages which might be involved . . . .'' (Standard      3-3.9(d).) Not all prosecutors conduct themselves with      fidelity to this principle, but we may readily condemn      those who do not. We may likewise condemn other public      actors who abuse the sacred public trust of the criminal      sanction for political ends.       For these reasons, I object to the current formulation of      the Unborn Victims of Violence Bill. As I am confident that      an alternative version of the Bill can fully accomplish its      stated purpose of protecting unborn life from criminal      violence while avoiding each of the difficulties I have      outlined above, I strongly encourage the Senate to modify the      Bill in the ways I have suggested above or in some other      manner that avoids the freighted and frankly politicized      terms, ``child in utero'' and ``child, who is in utero.''       My thanks to you for your consideration of my views.           Sincerely,                                                    George Fisher,                                                 Professor of Law.
