The festivities for the celebration begin on Sunday, June 3, 2007, with the celebration of Mass, followed by a dinner and dance reception at Villa Cesare in Schererville, Indiana to celebrate this exceptional milestone.  On February 14, 1910, a group of men met to discuss building a church for the Croatian people in East Chicago. Holy Trinity Lodge became one of the main supporters of this project, and it appears to be the reason for the church being dedicated to the Most Holy Trinity. The first church board, assembled on April 14, 1914, consisted of President Nikola Mihalic, Secretary Mate Zivcic and Treasurer Peter Skefich. It was at this time that Father Judnic, the first pastor of the parish, made arrangements to come to East Chicago on Sundays and offer the Holy Sacrifice of the Mass for the Croatian people. With the church beginning to grow, the first Baptismal celebration took place on November 12, 1916, the first burial on November 22, 1916, and the first marriage on November 26, 1916.  With the completion of the church, the next undertaking was the school. The first enrollment in 1918 was 140 children for the first six grades. In September 1918, Sisters Anges, Stanislaus, and Catherine, the Sisters Adorers of the Most Precious Blood, arrived at Holy Trinity. On June 1, 1921, Confirmation was administered for the first time in the parish by Bishop Alerding. Father Judnic continued as pastor until August 1922, when he was succeeded by Father Francis Baboric, who served the congregation until March 1924. On April 15, 1924, Reverend Francis Podgorsek took over as the new pastor of the parish. It was through his leadership that the present rectory was erected in 1925. Due to Father Podgorsek's failing health, Father Paul F. Bogovich arrived as the first assistant to the parish and served in that capacity until he was appointed Acting Pastor on February 6, 1946.  A monumental event took place at Holy Trinity in 1951, when the First Solemn High Mass was offered by the first son of the parish ordained to the Holy Priesthood, Father Benjamin Domsich. On March 17, 1963, Father Bogovich was vested the title of Very Reverend Monsignor by high recommendations from the Most Reverend Andrew G. Grutka. Another important historical event for Holy Trinity was the visit made by Cardinal Franjo Seper, Archbishop of Zagreb, Yugoslavia, on May 2, 1966.  Monsignor Bogovich lived his life for the church. His last Sunday Mass took place on May 26, 2002, and was offered in honor of his 62nd anniversary in the priesthood. Following his death, Father Matthew Kish stepped in and performed the Mass until October 2006. Holy Trinity now relies on a number of priests and senior priests to say Sunday Mass.  On November 19, 2006, the parish family came together to celebrate a First Communion Mass, the first of its kind in over a decade. Over the years, Holy Trinity has become home to a Girl Scout Troop, has actively participated in food drives for various local parishes, and at Christmas, has supported Catholic Charities helping needy families. Today, Holy Trinity follows in the footsteps of its founders. While Holy Trinity still treasures its Croatian customs, it has come to reflect the diversity of the surrounding community. Holy Trinity looks forward to a bright future and is proud of their many accomplishments.  Madam Speaker, I ask that you and my other distinguished colleagues join me in honoring and congratulating Holy Trinity Croatian Church on its 90th anniversary. Throughout the years, the clergy and members of Holy Trinity have dedicated themselves to providing spirituality and guidance through the protection of the Croatian traditions and faith. Their constant dedication and commitment is worthy of our admiration.                          ____________________
