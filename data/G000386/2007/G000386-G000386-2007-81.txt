 President, I am voting against the motion to proceed to the DREAM Act today. Even though I support the end goal of this legislation; that is, to provide children with an education, I do not think the bill is perfect. I would like to see changes made. The bill didn't go through the proper channels and was not approved by the Judiciary Committee. Moreover, the majority leader has indicated that he will fill the tree and prevent the minority from offering amendments to the bill. ``Filling the tree'' by the majority leader is what this process is called and it freezes me out of offering amendments to improve the DREAM Act. For these reasons, I will oppose proceeding to the bill today.
