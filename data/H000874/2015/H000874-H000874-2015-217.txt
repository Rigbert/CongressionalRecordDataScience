 Madam Speaker, I join her in thanking Mr. Carter and Mr. Rogers for bringing to the floor in December a Homeland Security bill that was appropriate and that funded at the levels that were agreed upon by both parties. All we are asking is that we pass Mr. Carter's and Mr. Rogers' bill.  The Republicans pledged to not mingle controversial issues and allow each issue to stand on its own merits or demerits. That was their pledge to America in 2010. This action is inconsistent with that pledge.  The Senate has just voted, Madam Speaker, 68-31 to pass the Rogers-Lowey-Mikulski-Shelby bill. This is not a partisan bill that we are arguing about. This is the bill that we have agreed upon, Republicans and Democrats--and we can't even pass that--with the knowledge that if we do not, the future funding of America's homeland security will still be in question.  Yes, we can do it for 3 weeks. I call it our cul-de-sac strategy, going into a cul-de-sac over and over and over again and feeling somehow a pathway is going to open. The Senate is now voting on the Collins amendment. Now, as I understand the strategy of the Republican Party in the House, Madam Speaker, it is to add the bill that has been rejected four times on the floor of the United States Senate. They went in the cul-de-sac once, it didn't open up. They went in the cul-de-sac twice, it didn't open up. They went in the cul-de-sac a third, fourth time, it didn't open up. And now the proposal is to go into that cul-de-sac a fifth time while we focus on whether or not we are going to fund Homeland Security, not on the objectives of homeland security.
