 President, I am proud to join today with my colleague, the Senator from Maine, Mrs. Snowe, in introducing a resolution honoring the Veterans of Foreign Wars (VFW) of the United States and commemorating the 100th Anniversary of the founding of the VFW, by declaring September 29, 1999 as Veterans of Foreign Wars of the United States Day.  Since its inception after the Spanish-American War in 1899, the VFW has dedicated itself and its members to improving twentieth century America. The value of the contributions that members of the VFW and its Ladies Auxiliary have made to their communities and to this nation cannot be overstated. After returning home from foreign service during times of war and armed conflict, these men and women have continued to give of themselves to ensure that this nation protects and maintains the democratic ideals upon which it was founded, and that the veterans and their dependents are cared for. From providing services for veterans and their families, to sponsoring community action and charity projects, the VFW strengthens not only its members, but each and every American as well.  On a personal note, I have had the unique pleasure of sharing the floor of the United States Senate with several decorated veterans, as well as enjoying the privilege of having several veterans of American conflicts on my own staff. I've also enjoyed the ongoing opportunity of meeting and working with the very patriotic citizens of Delaware whom this resolution honors. Throughout my entire tenure in the United States Senate, the members of Delaware's VFW have been, for me, a continued source of knowledge, insight, and inspiration.  Particularly with the members of our armed forces currently serving in the Balkans in mind, whom I just visited, I offer my humble recognition to all of those who have so bravely and selflessly served America in the past. I sincerely trust that my colleagues will join me in acknowledging the courage, the sacrifice, and, frequently, the sheer bravery of our members of the Veterans of Foreign Wars, whose contributions to this country will be reaped for generations to come. I want to both demonstrate and convey to them my profound gratitude.                          ____________________
