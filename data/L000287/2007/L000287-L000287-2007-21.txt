Mr. Speaker, I want to thank my friend and colleague, the chairman, Mr. Lantos, for yielding.  Mr. Speaker, today we remember what happened at the World Trade Center and the Pentagon 6 years ago tomorrow. Just as it was 6 years ago, it is still unreal. It is still shocking. It is still unbelievable, but it did happen.  Today we continue to remember the brave firefighters, the police officers, the doctors, nurses and all of the emergency medical personnel and rescue workers and private citizens who lost their lives that day, and those who gave their lives trying to save others. Together as one Nation we remember again those we have lost.  Today we remember again the families and the loved ones of the victims at the World Trade Center and the Pentagon and the families of those who perished in Pennsylvania who prevented another vicious attack and saved countless lives here in Washington on that day.  Today we pray that the grace of God be with us and all who mourn. We pray that God will continue to give us the strength to carry on and continue to do his work. And we pray today for peace in our world, peace in America and peace in our hearts and souls.  Mr. Speaker, I am pleased to support this resolution today.
