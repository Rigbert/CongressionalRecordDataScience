 President, on one final matter, I would like to take a brief moment to recognize a talented member of the Senate community who will be retiring this month after 20 years of service to this body and to the Nation.  Nancy Kervin is a reference librarian in the Senate Library, and for years, whenever my office needed assistance with a seemingly impossible research question, she was always ready to lend a helping hand. I could not let her depart without giving her the recognition that she so richly deserves.  Nancy came to the Senate following a wide-ranging career in publishing and in research, and through her work here, Nancy has made a lasting mark.  To members of my staff and to numerous others around the Senate, Nancy has been the first person to call when facing a difficult research question. Nancy's signature combination of intellectual rigor and unyielding perseverance has enabled her to skillfully complete countless research projects on numerous subjects throughout her time in the Senate, and, of course, she is widely known for her kindness and her good humor.  My office has worked closely with Nancy on a number of different projects over the years, but there is one project--a project of particular personal importance to me--that I would like to mention today.  A number of years ago, I began a series of lectures at Kentucky colleges and universities focusing on the lives and legacies of prominent U.S. Senators from the Commonwealth. Since the project's inception, my staff has regularly looked to Nancy for help. She has been an indispensable resource for each historical speech in Kentucky that I have delivered. Her work in gathering sources and putting the information in its proper context has helped me to pay tribute to many distinguished Kentuckians.
