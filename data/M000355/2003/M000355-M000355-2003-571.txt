 President, I rise today to introduce the Tobacco Market Adjustment Act of 2003. This is truly a key moment in the history of tobacco as each of the Senators from the leading tobacco-producing States stands united in support of changing the Government's involvement with tobacco.  This legislation enjoys the support of farm bureaus from Kentucky, North Carolina, Virginia, Tennessee, South Carolina, Georgia, Florida, as well as the support of the Burley Co-op, Burley Stabilization, and the Council for Burley Tobacco.  I ask unanimous consent to have letters indicating their support printed in the Record.
