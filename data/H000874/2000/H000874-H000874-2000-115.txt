Speaker, I thank the gentleman from Ohio (Mr. Brown), my friend, the distinguished ranking member of the subcommittee who does such an outstanding job on behalf of health of all Americans on this subcommittee.  I am also pleased to join the gentleman from New York (Mr. Lazio) in cosponsoring this particular piece of legislation. Mr. Speaker, I had the great honor 11\1/2\ years ago of getting involved with members of the disability community and Members of this House and, in particular, a Member of the Republican side of the aisle, Steve Bartlett from Texas, who worked on the passage of the Americans with Disabilities Act.  It took us approximately 2 years or perhaps a little longer from the initial introduction to its passage and to the signing by President George Bush on July 26, 1990. Because of the length of today's session, we have moved from the eve of that signing to the day of that signing.  Today is the 10th anniversary of the Americans with Disabilities Act. That act has properly been called I think the most significant civil rights act passed since 1965. From 1965 to 1990, it was a long time, a quarter of a century in which we saw a significant segment of our population discriminated against based upon their disability. What the Americans with Disabilities Act said very loudly, clearly and powerfully was that what we need to do in America is look at people's ability, not their disability.  Mr. Speaker, we need to look at what people can do, what they can contribute to a better America, and to a better life for themself. And what we said was as it is wrong in America to discriminate against people because of their race or their religion or national origin, it is also wrong to discriminate against Americans based upon a disability that we needed to look in a nondiscriminatorily way at what could be done by individuals, what contribution they could make in employment, in education, in transportation, in communication, in public accommodations, in every area of our society.  That bill, as we look at its performance 10 years hence, has been a success. It has not been a total success. There still is a long way to go. Tony Coehlo, who was the principal sponsor before he left, and I really took over his responsibility. When he left in 1989, Tony Coehlo made the point today that we had come a long way, but we still had a long way to go.  Another hero of the Americans with Disabilities Act, Justin Dart. I am sure that many of my colleagues know Justin Dart was there today, wheelchair bound and constricted by physical disability, but with a spirit that is unconstrained by any physical disability, a spirit that soars and impels all of us to understand the possibilities that life can present if one has the will to take those possibilities.  Having said that, Mr. Speaker, I am pleased to be here tonight to join the gentleman from New York (Mr. Lazio) and the gentleman from Ohio (Mr. Brown) and others in supporting the passage of the Developmental Disabilities Act.  Mr. Speaker, that act is a cornerstone of the disability policy and has been in place since 1963, as has been pointed out, and was a forerunner of the Americans with Disabilities Act, and in many ways was the genesis of that act.  It has not been substantially reauthorized since 1994, and it is in need of some updating. Just as our technology and science evolves everyday, so do the strategies for reaching, engaging, and assisting individuals with developmental disabilities.  Individuals with developmental disabilities often have multiple evolving lifelong needs, Mr. Speaker, that require interaction with agencies and organizations that offer specialized assistance, as well as interaction with generic services in their communities.  The Developmental Disability Act seeks to provide, as I said, a voice for those with disabilities as they negotiate the complicated system of public services policies and organizations that we currently have in place. The act seeks to provide families with the knowledge and tools they need to help individuals with developmental disabilities become integrated and included in their communities.  It seeks to foster true independence for those with developmental disabilities, and it provides support to protect them from abuse and neglect, something clearly that all of us would want.  This has been a long and arduous road for the act. The Senate worked tirelessly with the disability community on this bill to ensure that all voices were heard. They were, and as a result, the Senate passed its version with title 2 included, 99 to zero.                              {time}  0030  The version of the act that we are considering tonight is somewhat different, as has been referenced. The act that my colleague from New York (Mr. Lazio) and myself introduced yesterday, along with the support of the gentleman from Virginia (Mr. Bliley), the gentleman from Michigan (Mr. Dingell), the gentleman from Florida (Mr. Bilirakis) and the gentleman from Ohio (Mr. Brown) included three titles. Unfortunately, this one includes only two.  While I rise in strong support of this bill, I would also like to reinforce my commitment to the segment of this bill that was struck by amendment. The gentleman from New York (Mr. Lazio) has already done so, and I look forward to working with him and the gentleman from Ohio (Mr. Brown) in seeing passage of that title that is not in this bill at this point in time.  Title II of the act would have authorized a funding to states for support of families that have individuals with developmental disabilities. That, unfortunately, was struck from the bill. I regret that we were unable to get agreement on including this section, which is in the jurisdiction of the Committee on Education and Workforce. Hopefully, hopefully, before we adjourn for the year, we will be able to pass a bill that includes that section.  Obviously, it was a difficult decision for many of us to drop this section, as funding to states for family support was and is an important provision in this bill, but we did not want to risk losing the rest of the act as well. As my colleagues have already stated, we intend to work very hard to have family support placed back into the Developmental Disabilities Act during conference.  Mr. Speaker, I rise in strong support of this bill. It is especially appropriate that we pass it today on the anniversary of the 10th year since passing and signage of the Americans with Disabilities Act, an act which said to every American, now 58 million of us who have a disability of some type or another, said to those 58 million people that the door of opportunity, the door to empowerment, is open to you. You have to take the steps, or roll the chair, or in some way get there, but we are going to make sure the door is open for you, and we are going to make sure that we take reasonable steps, we callthem ``reasonable accommodations,'' that can be done within the framework of reasonable expenses to make sure that the American dream is yours as well, notwithstanding the fact that you may have a disability that some of the rest of us do not have.  Passage of this bill tonight is another statement of this Congress to a commitment for empowerment and inclusion of all Americans, irrespective of some arbitrary and capricious distinction we might draw which might otherwise shut them out of enjoying the American dream.  Mr. Speaker, I am pleased to have had this opportunity to cosponsor and to speak in support of the passage of this bill tonight.  Mr. Speaker, tonight we commemorate the enactment of the most sweeping civil rights legislation since the Civil Rights Act of 1964.  Ten years ago tomorrow--on July 26, 1990--President Bush signed the historic ``Americans With Disabilities Act'' into law.  This bipartisan legislation prohibits discrimination against more than 50 million disabled Americans--in employment, in public services, in transportation, in public accommodations and in services operated by private entities.  The ADA sent an unmistakable--and long overdue--message to all Americans: It is unacceptable to discriminate against the disabled--to relegate our brothers and sisters to the sideline of our society--simply because they are disabled.  It is unacceptable and, under the ADA, it is illegal.  The disabled belong to the American family, and must share in all we have to offer: equality of opportunity, full participation, independent living and economic self-sufficiency.  I will never forget the President's words on July 26, 1990--nor the setting.  More than 2,000 advocates for the disabled--some in wheelchairs, some with interpreters, some with seeing-eye dogs--joined the President, Members of Congress and others in the hot summer sun on the South Lawn of the White House.  Some worried that the heat would cause the disabled too many medical problems. But the disabled--who have suffered so many indignities, so many unjustified acts of discrimination over the years--insisted on a major outdoor ceremony.  And they deserved it.  Mr. Speaker, as the lead sponsor of the ADA in this House, that day stands out as one of my proudest--especially when President Bush told those gathered:  ``Every man, woman and child with a disability can now pass through once-closed doors into a bright new era of equality, independence and freedom. Let the shameful wall of exclusion finally come tumbling down.''  I would be remiss tonight if I did not mention the tireless efforts of our former colleague in this House and my dear friend, Tony Coelho, on behalf of the disabled and the ADA.  As many of you know, Tony now chairs the President's Committee on Employment of People with Disabilities. You also may know that he has epilepsy.  However, you may not be aware of the discrimination he has overcome. When Tony's epilepsy was discovered some years ago, he was expelled from the seminary where he was studying to become a priest, he had his driver's license revoked, and his insurance company canceled his health coverage.  Simply because he had a disability.  Today, because of the ADA, that type of unjustified and indefensible discrimination is outlawed in America--as it should be.  I also want to thank and commend an organization in my District that now serves more than 2,000 people with developmental disabilities. Melwood, a non-profit organization based in Upper Marlboro, Maryland, has assisted the disabled for 35 years. Today, it is a national model in the areas of training, employment, housing and recreation.  There's no doubt that the ADA has promoted progress. The signs are everywhere--ramps, curb cuts, braille signs, captioned TV programs, and bus lifts.  So many disabled Americans have moved into the mainstream of American life, holding down good paying jobs in a New Economy where information and knowledge are key.  But while we commemorate the ADA tonight, let's not kid ourselves: Tomorrow we must roll up our sleeves and continue to build the house of opportunity and equality that we began 10 years ago.  While the unemployment rate in our country hovers around 4 percent, unemployment among disabled Americans remains unacceptably high.  Just last week, the National Organization on Disability released the findings from a Harris Survey of Americans with and without disabilities, and those findings demonstrate how much work we have left to do.  Only 32 percent of disabled people of working age work full or part time compared to 81 percent of non-disabled Americans;  More than two-thirds (67 percent) of the disabled who are not employed say they would prefer to work; and  People with disabilities are nearly three times as likely as those without disabilities to live in households with total incomes of $15,000 or less.  The Harris Survey also found that large gaps exist between people with and without disabilities with regard to education, access to transportation, health care, socializing, attendance at religious services, political participation, and life satisfaction.  Many of these measures, of course, are directly linked to employment. We know that a good job is the key to independence and self-sufficiency.  Thus, I believe we should implement nothing short of a comprehensive national strategy to address this unemployment crisis and continued cycle of dependency.  First, we must continue to make sure that government programs empower citizens and encourage them to seek employment in the private sector. For example, the Ticket to Work and Work Incentive Act, which extends Medicare coverage for disabled recipients who work, did just that. For too many, the fear of losing health insurance has proved to be a deterrent to work.  We also must redouble our commitment to the public-private partnerships created during the last 10 years to expand employment opportunities.  Further, in the New Economy, we must encourage disabled Americans to develop their technological skills. Information and knowledge--rather than brawn--are power and hold much promise for the disabled. Thus, we need to improve education, job training and rehabilitation programs.  Additionally, we must address the criticisms and recommendations contained in a recent report by the National Council on Disability. That report found that the impact of the ADA has been diminished by the lack of a cohesive, pro-active enforcement strategy. One of the Council's principal recommendations is to direct the Department of Justice to develop a strategic vision and plan for ADA enforcement across federal agencies.  Finally, we can take a big step in renewing our commitment to disabled Americans by passing the Development Disabilities Reauthorization Act this week before Congress breaks for its summer recess. This law is the cornerstone of disability policy, paving the way for the ADA 10 years ago and providing services, support, information and training for disabled Americans.  These issues must be addressed if the ADA is going to fulfill its promise.  So as we gather today to commemorate this historic law, let's recognize all that we've accomplished; let's renew our commitment to the principles and spirit of the ADA; and let's realize that our work is not done.  The ADA allowed us to tear down the wall of exclusion and pour a strong foundation for the House of Equality. But that House--in which Americans are judged by their ability and not their disability--is still being built.  The promise remains unfulfilled, but still is within reach. Let's not rest until we complete what we began 10 years ago.
