 President, today I am introducing, along with Senator Boxer, a bill to authorize the Broadcasting Board of Governors to make available to a private entity archival materials from the Africa Division of the Voice of America. This bill is also being introduced today in the other body by Representative Cynthia McKinney, who initiated this proposal and asked me to introduce the Senate version of the bill.  The bill authorizes the Broadcasting Board of Governors to make available to the Institute for Media Development, a non-profit organization, archival materials of the Africa Division of the Voice of America (VOA). These materials, currently stored at the VOA in analog form, will be put into modern digital form and made available to scholars through the University of California, Los Angeles, and any other institution of higher learning approved by the Board.  I believe this is a very useful public-private partnership that will result in a positive benefit to scholars of African studies. As I am sure my colleagues are aware, the Voice of America is not broadcast in the United States. Programs which may be of interest to students and scholars of African politics, history, literature and foreign policy are often inaccessible. Moreover, there is no systematic means, much less the funds, to make such archival material available. And once the programs are aired, there is no guarantee that the analog tape on which they are recorded will be preserved. History may literally be lost, if news shows and interviews with prominent figures in various African countries are not preserved. Storing these recordings in a central archive should prove invaluable in years to come.  There will be no cost to the U.S. Government. The bill requires that the government be reimbursed for any expenses it incurs in making such materials available, and for the indemnification of the government in the event that the materials are used in a manner that violates the copyright laws of the United States. I would not anticipate that such copyright violations will occur, because the bill also makes clear that materials made available may be used only for academic and research purposes and may not be used for public or commercial broadcast purposes.  I am pleased that the chairman of the Committee on Foreign Relations has agreed to place this legislation on the agenda of the committee later this week. I hope the Committee, and then the full Senate, will give its approval.  I ask unanimous consent that the bill be printed at this point in the Record.  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the Record, as follows:                                S. 2682       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of      the United States of America in Congress assembled,     SECTION 1.
