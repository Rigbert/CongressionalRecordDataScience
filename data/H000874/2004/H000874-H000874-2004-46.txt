Speaker, I have not spoken to the gentleman from Michigan (Mr. Conyers) about that, but obviously, because it is a constitutional amendment, I understand there have been four hearings. Presumably those four hearings were an attempt to elicit some information about the merits of the constitutional amendment and any changes that may or may not be necessary, which could obviously be perfected by an amendment in the committee.  Does he expect any amendments to be considered in the Committee on Rules?  Mr. DeLAY. Mr. Speaker, will the gentleman yield?
