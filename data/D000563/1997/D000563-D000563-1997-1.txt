President, I am completing my first year in the Senate. I will be the first to confess I have a lot to learn, but it has certainly been a rewarding experience serving in this great body. Having had the opportunity to serve 14 years in the House, I was no stranger to Capitol Hill, but this is a much different institution. The dynamic of 100 men and women working together as opposed to 435 is substantially different. I have been impressed with the volume of work that each Senator is asked to shoulder. I have also been very impressed with the leadership, and I join my colleague from Kentucky, Senator Ford, in noting the fine work of Senator Daschle as the Democratic minority leader. It is a tough job. He is lucky to have a good staff to have the energy and talent he brings to it. We are fortunate on the Democratic side to have him.                          ____________________
