We could perhaps reallocate these visas to the families of those who have won the lottery previously who have become good citizens.  But the point is, does America want to have a lottery to get the best, the most skilled people from around the world or the most diverse people from around the world? And I think not.  It has been subject to fraud. My office every day deals with people whose families have been waiting 5, 6, 7, 8 years patiently in line around the world to come here from the Philippines, from Mexico, from India and other countries. Should they get bumped to the back while some random person comes first? I think not.
