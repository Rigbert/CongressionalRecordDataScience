 President, I am pleased to introduce today, with Senator Hatch, the Violence Against Women Act of 2000. And I thank Senator Hatch, the principal cosponsor of the original Act, for working with me over the past year to produce a bipartisan, streamlined bill that we are confident will enjoy the support of Senators from both sides of the aisle. Indeed, we already have a total of 50 cosponsors--many of them Republicans--as original cosponsors of this legislation.  The enactment of the Violence Against Women Act in 1994--bipartisan legislation cosponsored by 67 Senators from both parties--signaled the beginning of a national and historic commitment to the women and children in this country victimized by family violence and sexual assault.  The legislation changed our laws, strengthened criminal penalties, facilitated enforcement of protection orders from state to state, and committed $1.6 billion over six years to police, prosecutors, battered women shelters, a national domestic violence hotline, and other measures designed to crack down on batterers and offer the support and services that victims need in order to leave their abusers.  And this federal commitment has paid off: the latest Department of Justice statistics show that overall, violence against women by intimate partners is down, falling 21% from 1993 (just prior to the enactment of the original Act) to 1998.  The programs contained in the original Act were authorized only through fiscal year 2000. So unless Congress acts, programs to run the battered women's shelters, the national domestic violence hotline, the STOP grants to help law enforcement and prosecutors combat domestic violence and to provide victims services, grants to address domestic violence in rural communities--all of these will expire this year. These programs are popular, and more importantly, ladies and gentlemen, the Violence Against Women Act is working.  And it's not just me calling for this law to be reauthorized.  It's police chiefs in every state. It's Attorneys General. Sheriffs. District attorneys. The American Bar Association. Women's groups. Nurses. Battered women's shelters. Family Court judges.  States, counties, cities, and towns across the country are creating a seamless network of services for victims of violence against women--from law enforcement to legal services, from medical care and crisis counseling, to shelters and support groups.  The Violence Against Women Act has made, and is making, a real difference in the lives of millions of women and children by providing much needed funds at the local level to--and let me just give you a few examples:  Give police officers more specialized training both to deal swiftly and surely with abusers and to become more sensitive toward victims, as well as to provide them with better evidence-gathering and information-sharing equipment and skills;  Train prosecutors and judges on the unique aspects of cases involving violence against women;  Hire victim advocates and counselors and provide an array of services, including 24-hour hotlines, emergency transportation, medical services, and specialized programs to reach victims of violence against women from all walks of life; and  Open new and expand existing shelters for victims of violence against women and their children.  The Violence Against Women Act funds 1,031 shelters and 82 safe houses in all 50 states, the District of Columbia, and Puerto Rico. But tens of thousands of women and children are still turned away every year.  Together--at the federal, state, and local levels--we have been steadily moving forward, step by step, along the road to ending this violence once and for all. But there is more that we can do, and more that we must do.  The Biden-Hatch Violence Against Women Act of 2000 would accomplish three basic things:  First, the bill would reauthorize through Fiscal Year 2005 the key programs included in the original Violence Against Women Act. These include the STOP grants, the Pro-Arrest grants, Rural Domestic Violence and Child Abuse Enforcement Grants, the National Domestic Violence Hotline, and rape prevention and education programs.  This also means reauthorizing the court-appointed special advocate program (CASA), and other programs in the Victims of Child Abuse Act.  Second, the bill would extend the Violent Crime Reduction Trust Fund through Fiscal Year 2005. Funding for the trust fund expires this year. This dedicated funding source--paid for by the savings generated by reducing the federal workforce by more than 300,000 employees--provides all the grant money for additional police officers, prosecutors, and battered women shelters. It is these funds that provide the specialized domestic violence training for law enforcement and prosecutors.  The Trust Fund is the source of funding for all the victim services, including counseling, legal services, nursing and hospital services, especially designed for victims of domestic violence and sexual assault.  Of course, the Trust Fund's significance extends beyond the Violence Against Women Act. The trust fund has provided the funds for a host of successful law enforcement initiatives, ranging from drug courts; the weed and seed programs that exist in every state to drive drugs from our cities; and funding for prisons, the FBI, the Drug Enforcement Agency, and Boys and Girls clubs. And the list goes on.  In order to replicate the successes we have achieved under the original Violence Against Women Act, and in order to continue to pursue these other important law enforcement programs, it is imperative that we: (1) extend the Violent Crime Reduction Trust Fund for an additional five years, and (2) that we fully fund the Trust Fund.  Third, the Violence Against Women Act of 2000 makes some targeted improvements that our experience with the original Act has shown to be necessary. Let me give you just a few examples.  Civil Legal Assistance Grants: Our bill would create a separate grant program to help victims of domestic violence, stalking, and sexual assault who need legal assistance because of that violence, to obtain access to legal services at little to no cost.  This provision would also establish a database of legal assistance providers to be maintained and used by the National Domestic Violence Hotline, so that victims who call the hotline can be directed to a legal service provider immediately.  Improving Full Faith & Credit Enforcement of Protection Orders: My bill would help states and tribal courts improve interstate enforcement of civil protection orders, as required by the original Violence Against Women Act. The program would prioritize the development and enhancement of data collection and sharing systems to promote tracking and enforcement of protection orders across the nation.  Transitional Housing: The bill would also authorize the Department of Health and Human Services to make grants to provide short-term housing assistance and short-term support services to individuals and their dependents who are homeless or in need of transitional housing or other housing assistance as a result of fleeing a situation of domestic violence, and for whom emergency shelter services are unavailable or insufficient.  Safe Havens for Children: The bill would authorize a new two-year pilot grant program to be administered by the Department of Justice aimed at reducing the opportunity for domestic violence to occur during the transfer of children for visitation purposes by expanding the availability of supervised visitation for victims of domestic violence, sexual assault, and child abuse. We all know that women are at greatest risk of assault at the time when children are transferred between parents.  I also would like to take this opportunity to point out that the Supreme Court's recent decision in United States v. Morrison, 120 S. Ct. 1740 (2000), invalidated a single provision of the original Act, the ``civil rights remedy'' that permitted a victim of gender-motivated violence to sue her attacker in federal court. No other provision in the original Act--or, for that matter, in the Violence Against Women Act of 2000--is affected by the Supreme Court's decision.  Finally, I would like to comment on where we are and how we got here.  The bill Senator Hatch and I are introducing today is a streamlined version of S. 51, the legislation I originally introduced at the beginning of the 106th Congress.  Since I first introduced S. 51, I have consulted extensively with Senator Hatch and with many other individuals, inside and outside of the Senate, and on both sides of the aisle, in an effort to narrow the legislation to produce a bill that every Senator, regardless of party, can enthusiastically support.  In the course of that effort, I agreed to drop a number of items that quite frankly, I think were worth doing, and made other concessions. I did that because I believe it is critical, in the waning days of this legislative session, to achieve a strong bipartisan consensus on the essential elements that must be included in this bill. I am convinced that we have reached that consensus, and that the bill we now propose reflects the priorities of a substantial majority of Senators.  For far too long, law enforcement, prosecutors, the courts, and the community at large treated domestic abuse as a ``private family matter,'' looking the other way when women suffered abuse at the hands of their supposed loved ones. Thanks in part to the original Act, violence against women is no longer a private matter, and the time when a woman has to suffer in silence because the criminal who is victimizing her happens to be her husband or boyfriend has passed.  The bill I introduce today will renew the commitment we made as a nation in 1994 to combat family violence, sexual assault, and stalking. I urge all of you to support it.  I ask unanimous consent that the full text of the bill be printed in the Record.  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the Record, as follows:                                S. 2787       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of      the United States of America in Congress assembled,     SECTION 1.

(a) In General.--The Attorney General shall--       (1) direct the National Institute of Justice, in      consultation and coordination with the Bureau of Justice      Statistics and the National Academy of Sciences, through its      National Research Council, to develop a research agenda based      on the recommendations contained in the report entitled      ``Understanding Violence Against Women'' of the National      Academy of Sciences ; and       (2) not later than 1 year after the date of enactment of      this Act, in consultation with     the Secretary of the Department of Health and Human Services,      submit to Congress a report which shall include--       (A) a description of the research agenda developed under      paragraph (1) and a plan to implement that agenda;       (B) recommendations for priorities in carrying out that      agenda to most effectively advance knowledge about and means      by which to prevent or reduce violence against women.

TITLE V--BATTERED IMMIGRANT WOMEN     SEC. 501. SHORT TITLE.       This title may be cited as the ``Battered Immigrant Women      Protection Act of 2000''.     SEC. 502. FINDINGS AND PURPOSES.       (a) Findings.--Congress finds that--       (1) the goal of the immigration protections for battered      immigrants included in the Violence Against Women Act of 1994      was to remove immigration laws as a barrier that kept      battered immigrant women and children locked in abusive      relationships;       (2) providing battered immigrant women and children who      were experiencing domestic violence at home with protection      against deportation allows them to obtain protection orders      against their abusers and frees them to cooperate with law      enforcement and prosecutors in criminal cases brought against      their abusers and the abusers of their children without      fearing that the abuser will retaliate by withdrawing or      threatening withdrawal of access to an immigration benefit      under the abuser's control; and       (3) there are several groups of battered immigrant women      and children who do not have access to the immigration      protections of the Violence Against Women Act of 1994 which      means that their abusers are virtually immune from      prosecution because their victims can be deported as a result      of action by their abusers and the Immigration and      Naturalization Service cannot offer them protection no matter      how compelling their case under existing law.       (b) Purposes.--The purposes of this title are--       (1) to remove barriers to criminal prosecutions of persons      who commit acts of battery or extreme cruelty against      immigrant women and children; and       (2) to offer protection against domestic violence occurring      in family and intimate relationships that are covered in      State and tribal protection orders, domestic violence, and      family law statutes.
