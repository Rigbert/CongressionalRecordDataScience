Speaker, I thank the gentleman and tell him that we simply refer to it as the ANWR bill. It is so much easier.  Mr. Speaker, the majority leader has listed several pieces of energy legislation for consideration next week. Can he tell us the procedures that he anticipates these bills will be considered; specifically will amendments and/or substitutes be allowed, and will the rule bundle the bills to send them over to the other body, or will we pass them seriatim one at a time to the other body?  Mr. DeLAY. Mr. Speaker, will the gentleman yield?
