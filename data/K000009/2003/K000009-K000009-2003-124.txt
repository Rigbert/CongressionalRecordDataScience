Speaker, tonight I wish to express my profound gratitude toward President Jacques Chirac and toward the French Parliament for their enduring alliance with our country and with NATO. I would also like to offer my respect to French Foreign Minister Dominique de Villipin. The civilized world cannot know yet the best method for stemming the growing terrorism that is engendered by the revolutionary fervor found in the Middle East and Central Asia, but I am certain of one thing: We will not succeed without our historic and valuable allies in Europe. They are priceless. War must be the last resort, only after tough and thorough inspections performed by U.N. agents have been exhausted.  I would like to speak of relations between the Governments of France and the United States and between the citizens of our countries. Our friendship is important and historic and dates from the days when General Marquis de Lafayette helped us win our own revolution for independence. Our very capital city, the city of Washington, was designed by a Frenchman, Pierre L'Enfant, and was modeled after Paris. The words of the French Revolution, ``liberty, equality, fraternity,'' remain true today, and in our Congress they are truly carved for all time.  Just this week, I opened a medal for our Uncle Stanley Rogowski, who had fought in Normandy. Three Bronze stars. Bloodied for 3 years across the northern plains of France. As I visited the cemeteries there, I thought about the close alliance between the American people and the people of France and the struggle for freedom over tyranny in the 20th century.  U.S. President and U.S. Ambassador to France Thomas Jefferson wrote, ``I do not believe war the most certain means of enforcing principles. Those peaceable coercions which are in the power of every nation, if undertaken in concert and in time of peace, are more likely to produce the desired effect.'' He wrote that in 1801. He loved France. He traveled there, he learned much, and he helped weave that into the fabric of American life in our earliest years.                              {time}  1815  As Archbishop Desmond Tutu of South Africa urged from a continent torn by terrorism in Sudan, in the Ivory Coast, in Egypt, in Nigeria, ``Peace. Peace. Peace. Shouldn't America listen to the rest of the world?,'' he said. ``Give the inspectors time.''  Note what is happening throughout the world. The largest antiwar turnouts in U.S. history. In London, 750,000 citizens marched against the war, that city's largest demonstration ever. In Rome, 1 million people. In Spain, millions marched in Madrid and Barcelona. In Berlin, half a million. People marching in nations whose homelands have been ripped apart by past wars and who are victims of terrorism as well. Surely they know the price of suffering.  Imagine the message these demonstrations are sending across the caves of terrorism. America is being isolated in world opinion. This is neither wise nor politically sustainable for our Nation to go it alone. The war on terrorism can only be won with a broad and committed international coalition starting with America's most historic allies.  In this new struggle of righteousness, moral force is more important than bombs. The war on terrorism is actually a political insurgency halfway around the world, first against the corrupt regimes in the world of Islam, much like a civil war. Lacking any experience with democracy, desperate and politically motivated masses grasp Islam as a metaphor for political change and reform. The United States should not become the beleaguered referee caught between warring factions who also happen to sit atop the world's largest oil wells on which we have become dependent. Rather, America must unhook ourselves from that oil addiction; and as important, America must work with a broad international coalition to support the forces of popular reform and rising hopes for a better and more just way of life.  In some of the most undemocratic places in the world, in places like Pakistan and Afghanistan, two-thirds of thepopulation is younger than 20, uneducated and often hungry. A major international commitment to feeding hungry children while educating them would serve the world much more durably in the years ahead.  In embracing the future, America must hold to its deepest ideals in this sea of political discontent and ally with rising aspirations of the dispossessed and forgotten. America should not, as happened in Iran, be caught on the wrong side of an unsustainable dictatorship or propping up weak regimes. Only broad and committed international coalitions can triumph in this struggle. Of three facts we are certain: we need our friends; America cannot win this battle alone; and only with justice will peace come.                          ____________________
