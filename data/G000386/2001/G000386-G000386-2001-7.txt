 President, in keeping with my policy on public disclosure of holds, today I placed a hold on further action on S. 1803, legislation reported out by the Senate Foreign Relations Committee to authorize appropriations under the Arms Export Control Act and the Foreign Assistance Act of 1961.  I am particularly concerned with Section 602 of this legislation.  Section 602(a) expresses the sense of Congress that the United States Trade Representative should seek to ensure that Free Trade Agreements are accompanied by specific commitments relating to nonproliferation and export controls.  Section 602(b) specifically directs the United States Trade Representative to ensure that any Free Trade Agreement with Singapore contains or is accompanied by a variety of specific nonproliferation and export control commitments.  Both of these matters--what sort of commitments Free Trade Agreements should contain, and specific negotiating instructions to USTR relating to the United States-Singapore FTA negotiations--are matters under the jurisdiction of the Senate Finance Committee.  Apart from the fact that Section 602 deals with matters that pertain to the jurisdiction of the Finance Committee, I have an additional practical concern as well.  According to the Trade Act of 1974, the United States Trade Representative is required to consult with and report to Members of the Senate Finance Committee and the House Committee on Ways and Means on the status of trade negotiations. This includes ongoing negotiations, like the US-Singapore FTA talks, and future FTAs in general.  If enacted into law, Section 602 would likely result in a confusing situation in which the Senate Foreign Relations Committee is advancing negotiating instructions to USTR on behalf of Congress, even though the oversight responsibility for such negotiations lies with the Finance Committee. USTR would have to consult with the Finance Committee about its implementation of negotiating instructions developed by the Foreign Relations Committee, instructions Finance Committee Members had no role in developing, and are not familiar with.  As far as I know, no Member of the Finance Committee has even seen Section 602 before.  Just a few days ago, the Finance Committee approved a bipartisan Trade Promotion Authority bill by a vote of 18-3. This bill contains specific and detailed negotiating instructions relating to multilateral, regional, and bilateral trade negotiations. The issues raised in Section 602, especially those framed as negotiating instructions, should have been considered by the Finance Committee in the context of the mark-up of TPA legislation, not on the floor in the context of legislation authorizing appropriations under the Arms Export Control Act.  For these reasons, Mr. President, I will continue to hold this legislation until the concerns I have raised here are addressed.                          ____________________
