 President, I hope I will have an opportunity to rebut the distinguished Senator's comments. I find it very interesting that suddenly gun trace information is not acceptable information, but we can go out and do a survey of criminals, and that is an acceptable way of evaluating the success or failure of the assault weapons legislation. I don't buy it. In my view, tracing guns to crime is an appropriate way.  I ask unanimous consent to have printed in the Record the executive summary of a new report out on ``Target: The Impact of the 1994 Federal Civil Assaults Weapons Legislation.''  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in the Record, as follows:                           Executive Summary       To evaluate the questions below, the Brady Center to      Prevent Gun Violence asked Crime Gun Solutions LLC to review      and analyze national crime gun trace data maintained by the      Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives (ATF).      This data represents guns nationwide that have been illegally      possessed, used in a crime, or suspected of being used in a      crime, thereafter recovered by law enforcement, and then      traced to learn about the sales history of the gun.       Has the Federal Assault Weapons Act reduced the incidence      of assault weapons in crime?       Yes. In the five year period (1990-1994) before enactment      of the Federal Assault Weapons Act, assault weapons named in      the Act constituted 4.82% of the crime gun traces ATF      conducted nationwide. Since the law's enactment, however,      these assault weapons have made up only 1.61% of the guns ATF      has traced to crime--a drop of 66% from the pre-ban rate.      Moreover, ATF trace data     shows a steady year-by-year decline in the percentage of      assault weapons traced, suggesting that the longer the      statute has been in effect, the less available these guns      have become for criminal misuse. Indeed, the absolute number      of assault weapons traced has also declined.       This decline is extremely significant to law enforcement      and has clearly enhanced public safety, especially since      these military-style weapons are among the deadliest ever      sold on the civilian market. For example, if the Act had not      been passed and the banned assault weapons continued to make      up the same percentage of crime gun traces as before the      Act's passage, approximately 60,000 additional assault      weapons would have been traced to crime in the last 10      years--an average of 6,000 additional assault weapons traced      to crime each year.       Have industry efforts to evade the Act through ``copycat''      assault weapons eliminated its positive effects?       No. After the Assault Weapons Act was passed, gun      manufacturers sought to evade the ban by producing weapons      with minor changes or new model names. The Act was designed      to prevent this occurrence by defining assault weapons to      include ``copies or duplicates'' or the firearms listed in      the ban in any caliber, though this provision has never been      enforced. Yet, even if copycats of the federally banned guns      are considered, there has still been a 45% decline between      the pre-ban period (1990-1994) and the post-ban period (1995      and after) in the percentage of ATF crime gun traces      involving assault weapons and copycat models.       The results of this study make it clear that the United      States Congress needs to renew the Federal Assault Weapons      Act. If the Act is not renewed, a decade of progress could be      lost and thousands of additional assault weapons are likely      to be used in crime in the future.
