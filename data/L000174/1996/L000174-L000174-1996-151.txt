President, the agreement was--I understand that the Republican leader has a scheduling concern--that we would go to the amendment of the distinguished Senator from Arizona at 9:30 in the morning, that we would have one-half hour equally divided in the usual form, but obviously we could yield that back. I mean, technically we could be on the vote at 9:31.  I say that only because I do not want the two leaders, my distinguished friends from Mississippi and South Dakota, to suddenly have to hear from Members, why are we having a vote at 9:30, not 10? But my understanding is that the distinguished chairman will soon ask unanimous consent on behalf of the distinguished majority leader that we would be on the McCain amendment at 9:30, one-half hour equally divided, though we can yield back.  Mr. McCONNELL addressed the Chair.
