  As we know, with anything done the first time you never really quite know what it is going to do. I have had estimates. The group supporting this has done some research. I know what they have told me. I cannot make any guarantee to this body that it will produce a lot of money. I do know that it is worth a try, in my opinion. It is important to people. There is a movement behind it.  The breast cancer stamp now exists as of now and it has no fundraising connected to it. It is simply a first-class stamp. This has the ability, for people that want to do so, to buy for the reason of raising an additional cent. I think every one of us know people immediately close to us that are suffering from breast cancer. I happen to believe the women of America are going to respond to this. I think young women are going to respond to it. I think you are going to see interesting ways that people are going to sell first-class stamps. I think that is good for the post office. It is good for the mail, and hopefully it will be good for breast cancer.  I know I didn't buy an Elvis Presley stamp. What was the other stamp? I didn't buy the other breast cancer stamp. I will buy these. I think there are many others like me. I don't know how many. But I think it is worth a try.  I thank the Senator for his comments.  I yield the floor.
