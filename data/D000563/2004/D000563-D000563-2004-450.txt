What the Senator has just described is what I hear. People who really believed in the American dream thought that with enough hard work and the right values you could succeed. That is what brought my mother as an immigrant to this country and millions like her. Now the concern is that despite your good values, despite your effort, despite your hard work, you can't reach that point of security because the Senator from Iowa is hearing, as I am, retirees finding that their retirement benefits are being cut off. Their health care benefits are cut off.  These people also wonder if Social Security and Medicare will be there when they need it. If we reach the point where we have diminished those institutions through the prescription drug bill on Medicare, through this budget and its raid on the Social Security trust fund for years to come, then, frankly, we have walked away from the heritage we received.
