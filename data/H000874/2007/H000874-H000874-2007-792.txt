 Bill's life was one of service. He served his country in the Air Force through two tours in Vietnam. He served his neighbors as a Washington, DC, police officer for more than 20 years. And he served his community as a member of the Bowie City Council--and more significantly, as an impassioned leader who always thought of others before thinking of himself.  Bill was a man that truly understood what public service is all about. Those who knew him best know that he had a fondness for costumes. At Christmas, he made appearances throughout the city of Bowie as Santa Claus. At Easter, he visited local parks and hospitals as the Easter Bunny. And he even made public appearances as ``McGruff the Crime Dog'' to help keep Bowie's children on the right track.  I always thought of Bill as a partner in our shared pursuit to enhance the quality of life in the city of Bowie--and I know that his boisterous personality and impeccable character will be profoundly missed throughout all of Prince George's County, Maryland.  My condolences--and those of a grateful community--go out to Bill's wife, Clara, to his daughter, Emily, and to everyone whose life was touched by William Augustus Aleshire during this most difficult of times.                          ____________________
