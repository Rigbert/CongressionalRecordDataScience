I agree with the Senator from Nevada. For the leader of our country to repeatedly say that our economy is in trouble is to, frankly, have a self-fulfilling prophecy. In this situation I am afraid people lose confidence if the leader of our country doesn't have confidence. Some of the campaign rhetoric should have been abandoned as soon as the President took office. The spirit of optimism and growth, a positive feeling about the future is important for American families to feel they can do the right thing by perhaps buying a new home or putting an addition on their home, perhaps buying a car, whatever it might be that makes a difference in terms of economic growth. The Senator from Nevada is right.
