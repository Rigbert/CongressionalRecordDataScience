President, I wish to engage the distinguished Chairman of the Senate Appropriations Committee and the Defense Subcommittee, Senator Stevens, in a brief colloquy regarding distance learning.  As Chairman Stevens may know, the City Colleges of Chicago Europe has been providing college degree and certificate programs to the U.S. military service members and their families in Europe since 1969. In fact, the City Colleges of Chicago was one of the early pioneers in distance learning. Today, the program offers over 70 courses on the Internet and provides interactive television courses via satellite to U.S. peacekeeping forces stationed in the Sinai Desert, Bosnia, and Hungary.  The Senate bill includes an increase for distance learning of $45 million. Is it the understanding of Chairman Stevens that successful programs like the City Colleges of Chicago Europe should be able to work with the Department of Defense to receive funding?
