Mr. Speaker, I yield myself the balance of my time.  Mr. Speaker, I can only urge my colleagues again, as I mentioned before, let us leave the conferees work with the conferees. This is a Senate provision, not a House provision. I have said all the arguments, that this, in fact, was suggested, it was supported, it was promoted by Secretary Babbitt, Mr. Armstrong, President Clinton, and is also not a ripoff to the taxpayers. This, in fact, would increase moneys to the Treasury of the United States and mean that it will make us less dependent on those fossil fuels we are importing today.  Again the biggest ripoff to the taxpayers today is that oil we are buying from the sheiks, and that oil we are buying from the Qadhafis, and that oil is we are buying from the Saddam Husseins. That is a ripoff because the policy of those that were speaking in the well in the previous years that have driven our domestic industry off our shores overseas and not hiring our American workers. We have lost those jobs. We have got to try to get them back. We will have further legislation to bring more workers back to our shores. We will start developing our oil onshore, as it should be developed onshore, and we will have development in the gulf if we pass the amendment that was promoted by the Senate, or at least discussed by the Senate. But to have us reinstructed, or be instructed, by this motion by the gentleman from California is wrong for this Nation, it is wrong for the taxpayer, it is wrong for this conference chairman, it is wrong for this Congress to do.  So, Mr. Speaker, at this time I urge a large ``no'' vote on this motion.  Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.
