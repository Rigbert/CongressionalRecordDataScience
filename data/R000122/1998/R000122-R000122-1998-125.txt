President, I, too, commend the Democratic leader for his efforts to ensure that this debate reaches the full spectrum of issues that concern American education.  I believe there is one thing we can all agree upon: The problems of American education are multiple, and to conducta debate that would focus exclusively on one remedy and not allow other voices, other approaches, is, to me, relinquishing our responsibility to deal principally and responsibly with education policy in the United States.  There are proposals by my colleagues with respect to class size. Again, we are seeing evidence from States like Tennessee, where it makes a real difference in performance in education. Yet, we are not allowed to talk about those issues in this debate. If we are going to approach this issue with the idea of helping American education rather than the idea of promoting one particular ideological version, we have to allow for open, robust debate that incorporates all of the amendments my colleagues are proposing. And the idea to carry on without the debate, to me, is not worthy of this body.
