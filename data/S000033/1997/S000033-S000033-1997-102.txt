 Chairman, with the gentleman's assistance, last year Congress provided some initial funding for the park, and I am pleased that the fiscal year 1998 bill fully meets the park's needs for its operating costs. However, the bill does not provide the construction funds needed to refurbish the park's historic Carriage House.
