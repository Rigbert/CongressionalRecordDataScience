President, there will be very little time later today when we start voting for there to be full explanations of any of these amendments, which I think is very unfortunate. I do want to let my colleagues know about some of these amendments, and I am proud to say that, for the most part, the amendments I have filed and have now called up are bipartisan amendments that enjoy support on both sides of the aisle.  For example, my amendment No. 427 would create a deficit-neutral reserve fund to support sufficient investment in Alzheimer's disease research to achieve the goal set by the national plan to address Alzheimer's disease--of having the means to prevent and effectively treat that disease by the year 2025.  This amendment is cosponsored by Senator Moran, Senator Warner, Senator McCaskill, Senator Toomey, and Senator Donnelly. It is modeled very much on a bill that Senator Klobuchar and I have introduced to increase funding for Alzheimer's research.  Just yesterday the Special Committee on Aging, which I lead along with Senator McCaskill, held an extensive hearing on Alzheimer's disease. We listened to preeminent researchers and individuals such as B. Smith, who unfortunately has been afflicted with early onset Alzheimer's. We listened to a caregiver and to a geriatric physician from Portland, ME. We had testimonyfrom the Mayo Clinic and testimony from the individual who heads the Institutes on Aging at the National Institutes of Health. To a person they pointed out that we are spending $226 billion a year caring for people with Alzheimer's, yet we are investing less than $600 million in this disease.
