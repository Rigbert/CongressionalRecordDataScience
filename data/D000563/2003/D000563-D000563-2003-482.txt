What the Senator has just suggested is a good basis for establishing what we might even call a Senate committee where we could have Members of the Senate come together, consider evidence, and offer amendments before the bill comes to the floor. If I am not mistaken, the Senate bill already provides for committees. Why is it that this bill, of such consequence, should not go through a Senate committee system so that the very aspects that we have just discussed can be openly debated and amended and come up with a work product that might be of real value to this country?
