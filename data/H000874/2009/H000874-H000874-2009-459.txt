She has spent her working life at the AFL-CIO advancing the interest of America's working families. During that time, she has been an integral part of every fight over the last three decades on labor law reform, minimum wage, trade, health care, retirement security, and more. She has been witness to and a key part of many chapters of labor and Congressional history, often working behind the scenes, but always an integral part of progress.  So on the occasion of her retirement, I join with her family, her friends, and all of her colleagues at the AFL-CIO in congratulating her and expressing deep appreciation for all of her dedicated work. Marge Tracey has lived a remarkable life of service to working men and women, and I wish her all the best in the years to come.                          ____________________
