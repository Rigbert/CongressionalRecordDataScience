 President, I ask unanimous consent that the Senate stand in recess subject to the call of the Chair.  I will say to my Republican colleagues, we are going to have a conference in the Strom Thurmond Room right now.  There being no objection, the Senate, at 1:05 a.m., recessed subject to the call of the Chair and reassembled at 2:13 a.m. when called to order by the Presiding Officer (Mr. Gardner).                          ____________________
