Speaker, it is with the greatest pleasure that I recognize the awarding of an honorary Doctorate degree to Monsignor William L. Linder by John Carroll University. Msgr. William Linder had the vision thirty-five years ago to give new life and hope to people who lived in Newark, New Jersey, then one of America's lowest income communities, with the establishment of New Community Corporation. Indeed, the city had experienced urban riots and destruction related to the awakening of modern civil rights in America.  A Roman Catholic priest for nearly forty years, Msgr. Linder has spent his ministry in Newark, New Jersey, still one of the poorest cities in the country. For 28 years, he has been the pastor of St. Rose of Lima Catholic Church, a somewhat unique congregation comprised of people from thirty different national backgrounds. A Doctor of Sociology, Msgr. Linder is an adjunct professor at Columbia University's School of International and Public Affairs. He has received dozens of national and community awards honoring his pathbreaking work to build a new city out of the old.  When rioting in 1967 devastated much of Newark's Central Ward, Msgr. Linder founded New Community. Working with a coalition of local residents and others, Msgr. Linder grew New Community into a development encompassing fourteen city blocks in the heart of the Central Ward. New Community is a thriving venture of people in safe, attractive, affordable housing with an intricate network of employment, day care, education, training, health care, credit unions, banking and human services focused on economic development which benefits its people. New Community employs 2,300 people in sixteen separately funded efforts. Its capital assets now exceed over $375 million.  New Community offers people from childhood through old age myriad opportunities forsuccess and positive quality of life experiences. Thousands of people have benefited from New Community's operations, in addition to the hundreds who participate daily in its success. It is a true example of a community at work as they thrive, live and grow and build America's story. At the same time as it transforms the lives of Newark's Central Ward residents, so too has it transformed the ward itself into an attractive and vital urban neighborhood. New Community is the driving force behind new investment in long-term housing, day care and economic stability in Newark's central neighborhood.  With a mission to ``empower low-income individuals to determine their own destiny'' New Community will continue to live the adage ``of, by, and for the people'' well into future decades. Msgr. William Linder's selfless gift is imprinted on all aspects of New Community, as his quiet strength lovingly guides it forward, block by block and life by life. His contributions as shepherd and engineer embody the living Gospel. Congratulations to Msgr. William Linder on this special recognition from John Carroll University. His legacy is one of extraordinary achievement that serves as a model of human and community development at home and abroad.                          ____________________
