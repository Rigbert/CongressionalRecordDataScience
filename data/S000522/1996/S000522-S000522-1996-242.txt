Mr. Speaker, tomorrow on February 2, my parents, Bern and Kay Smith, will celebrate their 50th wedding anniversary. For our family and friends this will be an historic milestone filled not only with enormous happiness and joy, but gratitude, as well.  My parents' love for each other, and for my two older brothers and me, was always strong, an absolutely sure thing, never in question. They always had our best interest at heart. In raising us, we always knew they were raising their three sons not just for this life on earth, but for eternity with God. The bond of love was strong for their own parents, my dad's brother Gil and his daughter Sue--who was like a daughter to them and a sister to us--and my mother's nine brothers and sisters.  Conceding up front that mere words are inadequate in expressing the depth and breadth of our feelings, mom and dad, here are three letters from your three sons  And mom, a letter from dad.                 Katherine J. Holl and Bernard H. Smith       How do we label fifty years of marriage? Is it an event, an      achievement, a celebration, a milestone, survival of the      fittest, a bit of luck or just plain true love? The answer      probably lies somewhere within all of these concepts and      more. It is difficult to accurately and to adequately      describe my Mom and Dad, Kay and Bern.       My first recollection of them begins at their wedding in      February 1946. I insisted that I attended and can prove it by      merely viewing pictures and scenes from their 16mm movie      films. Of course the ``me'' was my 12 year old uncle, but      nonetheless I continue to assert otherwise.       Growing up in the Smith home was never dull. Adventure is a      good description for those times. Mom and Dad were intimately      involved in our lives. Their love nurtured and encouraged      without smothering. Reassurance and challenge were always      present. They were always there for us. They gave us room to      grow and were ready to support and comfort their boys.       If there is an ideal childhood then certainly we had one.      The lessons of life were taught by example through an      exquisite balance of firmness, fairness and fun.      Opportunities of many varieties were provided, shared and      celebrated. Success of one was joy for all. Adversity was met      directly and, ultimately, viewed as a learning experience to      prepare us for the future.       Mom the Club Scout Den Mother, Dad the little league coach,      both the homework ``checkers'' have left their imprint on us.      That these acorns did not fall far from the tree is evidenced      by the Smith boys' character and individual traits. All      different yet each possessing the basic core values Mom and      Dad lived. We are the fruit of their love and labor.       Although their lives revolved around us they ensure their      love and happiness was rooted in each other. They believed in      their families and showed us the treasures in grandparent,      uncles, aunts and cousins. We were fortunate to have so many.      Kay and Bern's friends over these last fifty years are too      numerous to list and there are always more being added to the      fold. Wherever they live, travel or `hang out' some new      acquaintances emerge, most become friends. The strength we      know was and is felt by many. Their generosity and      friendliness is well renowned. They have known tough times in      their fifty years and after each have emerged stronger in      their love for each other. Kay and Bern live life vigorously,      content in their past while expectantly anticipating the      future.       To be their son is a supreme gift from God. To live up to      and emulate their greatness is a difficult task to achieve      yet a goal worthy of the quest. Mom and Dad made it simpler      because they gave us the template for success and are always      there to pick us up and `point our heads' in the right      direction.       I think the answer to my question on how to describe Kay      and Bern's fifty years of      marriage is rather simple. How beautiful and wonderful they are . . .      my Mom and Dad are an everlasting, unending love story.           Happy Anniversary!                                                             Mick.                                  ____       My Mom and Dad are proudly celebrating their 50th wedding      anniversary, and the impact of this day has made me reflect      on just how unique and special they are to my brothers and I.      We have enjoyed a lifetime of genuine love and involvement,      and it is not possible for me to truly measure all that I      have learned from them. Sometimes the ``push'' to grow and      change was subtle, at other times it was not, but even as      kids, the Smith boys recognized somehow that the love we      received on a daily basis was to be cherished.       Of all the qualities that parents can imbue in their sons,      several have come to be guiding forces in my life. From my      earliest recollections of the teachings of my Mom & Dad, they      have stressed the importance of honor and duty. My brothers      and I have now seen for ourselves the results of ``doing the      right thing'' in our daily lives and we can (and do) thank      Mom & Dad for their hands-on style of parenting. In the 90's,      it is rather common for many to be unconcerned of the      consequences of their actions, but my brothers and I were      taught that we must be true to ourselves and to ``own'' our      behavior. The ``Golden Rule'' was often the answer we      received when we were seeking advice from our parents. I      remember a discussion I had with my Dad when I was unsure      whether it was O.K. to vote for myself in the upcoming      Freshman Class Presidential election. Dad's view on this      matter was disarmingly simple and direct. He said, that if I      was to ask anyone else to vote for me, that this was akin to      asking them to trust in me, and if I had their trust, then      surely I must trust in myself to do the job. So I voted for      myself, as I had the confidence in myself that loving parents      help engender in their children. Trust in oneself took many      forms in our household. One only need look at some of the      events that we brothers engaged in from some pretty young      ages, with full support from Mom & Dad. Chris had his first      paper route at age 6! I was about 8 years old when Mick and I      started scuba diving. Mom and Dad endeavored to treat us      equally. I know we all appreciated that, and I believe the      results of that even-handed treatment are partly responsible      for the closeness we brothers feel for each other to this      day. Sibling rivalry was never an issue, unless the issue was      sports!       All of us participated in sports, seemingly always showing      a preference for those sporting events where individual      achievement could be measured. I think we all desired very      strongly to show Mom & Dad that we could be as good as they      told us we were! Mom & Dad were early devotees of swimming      and tennis and filled our community's need for a place to      play, by organizing with assistance from uncle Gil, a Swim      Club. Dad was also instrumental in the start-up of a boy's      baseball league, and even coached one of the teams. I think      we can all remember Dad's frequent calls to be ``Heads Up!''      and to stay in the flow of the action by being prepared to      act immediately if we fielded a ball. He would keep us      thinking by having us say to ourselves: ``What am I going to      do if the ball comes to me?'' The situational awareness that      was fostered by this and other self-knowledge exercises while      growing up, uniquely prepared my brothers and I for Life's      challenges, and I feel strongly that this training helped me      in my aviation career. The dinner table discussions at the      Smith Family house also helped us to really know and      appreciate each other and honed our skills at the      presentation of opinions. No topic was off limits and we all      learned that to have an opinion on something was to be      prepared to clearly debate the issues, with Mom & Dad guiding      us a making sure our ``Ducks were in a row.'' My brothers and      I benefited tremendously from these now legendary happenings,      and to this day when we get together there will be strongly      held opinions discussed and dissected, and the learning will      continue. There was no need to have the television on to keep      us busy.       Mom is the ``Heart Of Our Family'' and is very skilled at      making others feel welcome and a part of our family. We were      fortunate to meet and know many of Mom & Dad's friends over      the years, as they entertained often and graciously. We were      never treated like little kids unless we acted that way,      which we tried very hard not to do so that we could be      involved in more adult matters and discussions. Often upon      leaving a large family gathering, we would be praised for      being good kids and for making them proud with the way we      handled ourselves. My brothers and I always appreciated this      positive feedback.       Dad likes to say ``show me'' on occasions where he needs to      be convinced of the veracity of a statement. Mom & Dad showed      us how they felt about us all the time, and they still do. We      knew that we were loved, we were not just told that we were.      It is common now to speak of ``family values'' as if they      could be capsulized and distributed to people for their      enrichment. When you have had good strong family values as      the defining fabric of your entire life, as we have had, you      begin to sense that ``love is the answer, no matter the      question.'' I can honestly state, that Mom & Dad by      constantly demonstrating their unwavering love for God, for      us, and for each other, have shown the way to true happiness      in this life. They have taught us the secret. It is up to us      to live that secret and to pass it on to everyone we touch.       Mom & Dad, congratulations on your 50-year achievement!!       I love you very much!     T.                                                                    ____       Dear Mom and Dad: Fifty years ago today, you both said ``I      do,'' and what you've done together has truly left, and      continues to leave, a special legacy for all of us who deeply      love and respect you.       I am certain that your parents--Nana and Gramp Smith and      Holl--Sue and all our loved ones who are with the Lord,      rejoice today in your achievement. You have been a blessing      and inspiration beyond what you'll ever know. Someday perhaps      the Lord will tell you in Heaven how the thousands of      seemingly little things--acts of kindness or honesty--     affected us for the good. You taught Mick, Tom and me as      much, if not more, by your consistent example and good works      than by what you said. And Mom, you know how Dad loves to      talk.       Growing up in Iselin, our family was strong--like a rock--     because of your faith in God, your devotion to the Blessed      Mother, your goodness, your sense of humor, your work ethic      and concern for others--especially the little guy.       You taught us to look beyond the obvious and below the      surface. To think deep thoughts and big ideas, but not to get      bogged down in dreams. ``You can keep your head in the      clouds,'' you often said, Dad, ``as long as you keep your      feet on the ground.'' And then there's your old friend      ``economics.''       You never did anything half-way or half-baked or half-     hearted. Yet, if I heard it once I heard it a thousand times,      ``everything in moderation and balance.'' You poured      yourselves first into making your marriage work, and then      into the challenge of raising three hard-driving,      independent-minded, rough-and-tumble boys.       I never knew a time when you both didn't work hard to make      a decent living; and you did it honestly. Remember the time      Rawlings sent several dozen top of the line baseball gloves      which would sell for almost $100 each, but billed us for      rawhide laces at 50 cents a pop. What a profit! What a      killing! No one would ever know. Not! You called Rawlings      immediately to set the record straight. Well, I remember that      day, and I learned a lesson in integrity to last a lifetime.      Years later when Mick and I were in the store, a van filled      with ``hot'' merchandise--good deals, for sure--pulled into      our parking lot. When approached, Mick said, ``not      interested,'' called the police, and they arrested the thief      as he was making a ``sale'' a short distance away. These      kinds of lessons, and others like them, etched values into      the depths of our souls concerning right and wrong in ways no      book or words could ever do.       Mom, you were a ``career woman'' long before that idea came      into vogue; yet, you were always available to Mick, Tom and      me because of the way you arranged your hours. We never had      to ask, ``Where's Mom?'' There was never any doubt whatsoever      that your first priority was us--and, of course, B. H.       In the store you were the bookkeeping guru, Mom, and much      more, making sense of accounts payable, receivable and      purchase orders. As long as you had a cup of Herb's coffee--     we all lived on that stuff for a while (except Tom, who hated      it)--you were ready for anything that might walk through that      front door.       While Dad did most of the selling to schools and athletic      teams, with a minor assist--for a time--from his sons, you      were the super glue behind the scenes who made it all work.       Come to think of it, you were the glue at home, as well.       You are a truly remarkable lady, Mom; a real softy with a      great big heart. And the way you've handled your health      ordeal further reveals your inner strength and faith in God.      Dad is right on target when he calls you ``St. Katherine of      Robbinsville.'' And Dad you are an example of unfailing love      and dedication to mom in ``sickness and in health''--you're      always just there for her--don't think your devotion goes      unnoticed.       Dad, I sure do respect your courage and boldness.       Mick, Tom and I are tough on the inside because of your      ``tough love.'' You were easy to please, but hard to satisfy.      We were admonished to ask the difficult questions; stand on      principle, even if you do it alone; to never give in; to be      prepared; to give 100%. You coached our Little League teams;      co-founded a family swim club with Gil, your brother, with      whom you are best friends; and founded our Boy Scout troop.      You taught us to love the outdoors, camping, hiking and      citizenship. Both you and Mom seemed awfully proud when Mick,      Tom and I each made Eagle Scout.       In life, and in baseball, you drilled it into us one of the      secrets of success: Anticipation, and I'm not talking about      ketchup. Your mantra was to ask: ``what do I do if the ball      comes to me.'' You instilled in us a pro-active way of      thinking--not just making double plays. I'm sure Mick and      Tom--especially when making critical flight decisions in the      pilot's seat somewhere in the stratosphere--find this      training extremely useful.       Although we had to prod you for details about World War      II--much of it too hellish to recount--we always admired your      gallantry and courage serving America as a combat soldier in      New Guinea, the Philippines, and other battles in the      Pacific. And      what guy wouldn't be impressed with all those medals you earned. When I      read your historic novel--Horizons of Glory--I couldn't help      wonder how many of the scenes depicted had their root in your      actual war experience. Both you and Mom are extremely well-     read; thanks for passing the importance of books and reading      on to us. And Dad, you have always had the gift--the flair--     for writing.       And talk about a guy with that ``competitive edge.'' In      sports and life you have risen to every challenge.       In 1977, when I married my college sweetheart Marie, no one      was more happy for me--us--than the two of you. I like to      think our happy home is like ``our'' happy home. We couldn't      be more pleased that Melissa, Chris, Mike and Elyse think of      the two of you (aka Mom-Mom and Bobby) as really neat--and      they, too, love you.       I just realized, I'm getting a little long--which is really      not fair. Mick, Tom and I agreed that each letter was to be      concise. Hey, number three son's a politician--what'd you      expect? A postcard? Happy 50th!           Love,     Chris                                                                    ____ A Love Letter To Kay on our Fiftieth Anniversary February 2, 1946-1996       My Darling Kay: The unabashed, no apology romantic in me      happily says, ``Kay, you are synonymous with Love''.       Love is the only perfect place on our planet. It can move      mountains; it has brought down kings. Yet, Love is      paradoxically delicate and tenuous and must never be      maneuvered, and certainly never be manipulated.       To paraphrase St. Paul in one of his letters to the      Corinthians . . . Love is selfless, Love is sacrificial,      Love, if nurtured, can be unending.       You neither have to agree to love, nor should there be a      reimbursement to Love. We don't have to be Loved back to Love      the way God intended. Very simply, it is the never ending      gift of totally giving our ourselves--and asking nothing in      return.       Cynics may scoff at these sentiments but they come and go      like the waves on a beach and, we have spent more than fifty      years, most of our lives, proving them wrong. Living as we      do, in an age of hedonism, you and I have never measured      success with material wealth--the size or location of our      homes: the cost of our cars; labels on our clothes, etc. . .      .       Our wealth--indeed our legacy is our children and their      children and obviously, there is no way to put a dollar value      on that, nor should there be a need to.       You and I would like to think that the magic that we first      felt for each other was not just blind chance--and we never      lost it. Were we just lucky? Maybe--but I think not.       Just a craftsman, a technician and an athlete constantly      hone and refine their skills, so too did we, through constant      communication and understanding the needs of each other. And,      the tender, sometimes wild, often explosively, cataclysmic,      earth moving events that produced Mick, Tom and Chris became      for us, wondrously frequent happenings. It sure hasn't been      ho-hum nor routine.       Do you remember many, many years ago discussing. ``The      Magic Cottage'' by O. Henry? It told of a young, handsome and      vibrant couple who never saw themselves older with the      passing years, as long as they were in the confines of their      ``Magic Cottage''. Much the same as the fabled, ``Shangri-     La''.       Well, I believe we have found the spirit of our, ``Magic      Cottage'' in our minds. The ``Fountain of Youth'' is not a      place but rather that tenuous, delicate spirit of love along      with our ``Joie de Vivre''. The joy of life.       The very phrase--Joy of Life--has such a positive ring to      it. Very few of us are born with it. It must be cultivated      over a span of years and, I believe we have done that.       It has manifested itself countless times through the quiet      pride we take in our loving parents, brothers, sisters, three      fine sons and our grandchildren.       We have been separated by war, have experienced illness and      pain, suffered the loss of loved ones always putting our      faith in God and His Blessed Mother--and we have been      sustained.       My dearest Kay, I have learned, and will continue to learn      from your example of never complaining. Someone who knows us      both very well once asked me if I found it difficult to live      with a saint?       ``Not at all'', I answered. ``it's kind of nice''.       Now we celebrate our fiftieth and I know you wonder as I      do, ``Where in the world did those years go so quickly?''      Would I do it all over again? In a minute and I wouldn't      change a thing.       And I'll bet you feel exactly as I. Remember the line from      an old song? ``A million laughs and a few little tears?''      That sums it up pretty good, don't you agree?       Since writing you hundreds of letters beginning in 1939, I      always ended them with a simple--``I love you'' but I don't      think I'll actually end this one. The song is still playing      and I don't think it will ever end.       So, I'll break off here with something you told me you      liked very much after hearing it in a speech I once gave.       ``Age is not a time of life--youth is merely a state of      mind. We become old when we desert our ideals and dreams. We      are as young as our faith, as old as our doubts. As young as      our self confidence, as old as our fears''.       ``And deep within our hearts is a recording chamber, and as      long as that chamber is receiving messages of hope--faith and      cheer, we will never, never grow old. Happy anniversary.           Love,     Bern                          ____________________
