Speaker, across the river from the Eiffel Tower, in the middle of a major traffic circle in Paris, one can see a majestic statue of his brother-in-arms, George Washington, raising his sword high in a triumphant salute.  Lafayette and his French officers suffered hunger and cold at Valley Forge to help secure for the American people our freedom. Generations later American Rangers scaled the craggy cliffs of Pointe-du-Hoc to help the people of France regain theirs.  Our history binds us together. So does our future. That is because we believe in tomorrow. Ever hopeful, we believe that the unknown which lies ahead can be shaped by our hands into a better world than the one we know today. That is what sets us apart from our enemies. That is why those who perpetrated Friday's attacks will never, never, never win.
