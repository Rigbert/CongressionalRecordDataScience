Speaker, I rise today to bring much-needed attention to summer meal programs for food insecure families. A new collaboration of community organizations in Lucas County, Ohio called Summer Meal Partners is working to raise awareness and increase participation in summer meal programs in that county. This group can be a model for similar collaborative efforts supporting under-served communities around the country. Summer Meal Partners will hold their official kickoff event on May 30th of this year.  Today in Lucas County just eight percent of the 54,135 children that are eligible for free or reduced price school meals participate in readily-available summer meal support. This support could make a real difference in thelives of tens of thousands more families but a lack of awareness, transportation and enrichment programming have limited participation.  Families without reliable access to sufficient affordable nutritious food face increased health, mental and behavioral issues.  Hunger undermines a child's ability to learn. Malnutrition and vitamin deficiencies also put children at risk for serious and permanent problems with attention, cognition and behavior. They undermine natural growth and development and lead to compromised immune systems.  With most primary school students on break, the summer can be a challenging time for working parents. Relief is available in the form of summer meals but only a small fraction of eligible families take advantage of this important initiative.  I congratulate Summer Meal Partners for their important work and for their upcoming kickoff on May 30, 2015.                          ____________________
