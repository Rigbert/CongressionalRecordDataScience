 That was in the Washington Post, I believe, yesterday. It dealt with the Small Business Administration, that is correct.  Mr. DeFAZIO. That is extraordinary. So somehow, I guess small businesses in the United States are not a good risk or we just cannot afford them, even if they are a good risk. And so we are going to have to cut back on that extension of credit. But a regime in Mexico, which has had three major financial crises, essentially two previous defaults in the last 12 years, which is an authoritarian regime which has lowered the standard of living of its own people by 25 percent in the last decade, which has, however, created 24 billionaires in a mere 7 years, is somehow a great credit risk. And there is nothing to worry about. But American businesses, well, I am sorry, we cannot afford to extend that kind of credit to American businesses. We are just going to have to cut that program back, and we are also going to cut our loans, rural electrification loans and other things.  We do have a budget crisis. I agree. It is time to get it under control. But how is it that suddenly, when we have to bail out the savings and loans, we can do it off budget; when we have to bail out Mexico, we can do it off budget. But if it goes to average American people and their concerns, their small businesses, their livelihoods, their education, we are broke.  This is a strange parallel to me.
