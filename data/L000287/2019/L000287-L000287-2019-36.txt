Chair, I rise in strong support of H.R. 3351, the fiscal year 2020 Financial Services and General Government Appropriations Act.  Let me begin by thanking Chairman Quigley and Chairwoman Lowey for their leadership on this important bill. I would also like to recognize their staff for reaching out and listening our concerns and priorities in this bill.  The Federal Government shutdown, changes to the tax code, and difficulty accessing experts increases IRS casework in many District Offices, including my own. As the chair of the Ways and Means Oversight Subcommittee, I believe it is critically important that Congress restore desperately needed funding for the Internal Revenue Service (IRS).  For many years, the National Taxpayer Advocate underscored the necessity of providing the agency with the resources, staff, and tools it needs in order to improve taxpayer services. Although Congress needs to restore the agency's funding to at least $12.3 billion, I believe that this bill finally moves the agency in the right direction.  I would also like to reiterate my appreciation for the Appropriations Committee's support when the House considered the Taxpayer First Act. As you know the Taxpayer First Act, which the House and Senate adopted earlier this year, is the most important improvement to taxpayer services in a generation. We worked hard to correct misinformation that our bill would tie the hands of the IRS and hurt taxpayers' options. During a time when there is so much tension and rush to judgment, our coalition remained thoughtful and fair.  As you know, Mr. Chair, the Taxpayer First Act resulted from years of bipartisan hearings, roundtables, and a public comment period on the draft bill. This legislation authorizes $30 million dollars in matching grants for the popular Volunteer Income Tax Assistance program, which helps low and moderate-income taxpayers complete and file their taxes. The Taxpayer First Act also protects certain low-income taxpayers from the private debt collection program, and authorizes desperately needed new initiatives to protect and serve taxpayers, who are victims of identity theft. I hope that this bipartisan, bicameral bill will become public law in the near future.  In closing, I would also like to recognize the Chairman's hard work to remove problematic policy riders from the FY20 House bill. I know that it was not easy, and I thank him and his staff for taking the time to consider our concerns. I offer my strong support and commitment to continue working with the Chairman and the Subcommittee so that this critical agency receives the funding and guidance so that the IRS may provide the highest quality, timely and secure taxpayer experience.                          ____________________
