So it is not unreasonable to include it. But we decided, in an effort to get a bipartisan agreement on the bill, that we would remove the section they objected to. Then they came in with a list of three amendments and said they wanted to offer these three amendments, which have maybe a loose connection with small business but not much more of a connection, and we said: Fine, you can offer those three amendments, and we will offer three amendments, and let's go and get this done. Then they came back and objected again.  So isn't it correct that right now we are trying to get to a point where we are providing credit to small businesses all across the United States through good sound banks, and that credit will help these small businesses survive and hire more employees, and we are being stopped by the Republicans in our effort to help small business? Is that what is happening?
