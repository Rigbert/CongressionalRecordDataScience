I noted before the article in today's New York Times about Nike and Vietnam and one of the officers of Nike indicated that the factory that was inspected was ``among the most modern in the world,'' in fact directly competitive, ``but there are a lot of things they could get better,'' according to the spokesman. But the point the Senator makes is well taken. This is not some old rattrap that was built in the 1930's and has some ad hoc machines there. This is a modern facility. It is a modern facility, the best technology to produce footwear, but it is obvious from this report no thought or concern was there to protect the workers to do the things we insist must be done in our factories.  So the Senator is absolutely right. So far as the new machines to make the product cheaper, better, faster, of higher quality, they are there, but all of the other concerns that go to the bottom line of any company, environmental quality being a major one, they can be avoided, and that is what we are facing.  I believe that unless we elevate environmental considerations to a major negotiating objective, not only will we see the further deterioration of the world's environment, not only will we be in a situation where we go to international conferences with the rest of world asking us to do more and more and more to raise our standards, making us less competitive, we are going to see the impact in our trade balance dramatically and directly. This is not about altruism alone. This is not about ecopolitics. This is not about sensitivity to the environment alone. It is all of those things, but it is something else. It is something about having a system of trade laws which recognizes the important bottom line impact of environmental quality here and with respect to our trading partners.  I yield the floor.
