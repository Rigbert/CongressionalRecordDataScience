President, if the Senator will yield and share a copy of that list with me, I would appreciate it. But in the meantime, I ask the Senator, it seems that the czar watchers on her side of the aisle, Senator Hutchison, for example, found 32 czars when she went looking. One of the advisers to some politicians--and I will not include the Senator from Maine; she can speak for herself--the noted guru Glenn Beck has identified 32 czars as well.  I ask the Senator from Maine before we get into the propriety of her amendment under Senate rules, who is going to define who is covered by her amendment, if her colleague from Texas found 32, Glenn Beck found 32, and she found 18?
