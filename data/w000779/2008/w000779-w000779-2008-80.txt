President, I wish to take a few minutes to talk to the Senate and America about the great pride that I and other Oregonians are feeling about the recent championships of Jefferson High School's girls' and boys' basketball teams, the Democrats. Both teams have been crowned winners of the 2008 5A state championship, respectively. Both the boys' and girls' basketball teams have had amazing seasons. In fact, Jefferson is the first high school in 5A history to ever win dual championships in the same season. This is an extraordinary accomplishment for a school that has only 600 kids in their student body and competes with schools that are much larger in size all the time.  The championships capped a regular season in which both teams turned in performances that were unprecedented in Oregon sports history. The Jefferson girls went undefeated with a regular season record of 27-0 and won their championship against a very tough Hermiston team on March 8, 2008. TheJefferson boys had a regular season record of 24-1. They duplicated the girls' victory the following weekend on March 15, 2008 by winning their first state championship in the 5A Division against a very good Corvallis team.  Both teams showed an incredible amount of determination; they proved their great will to win and displayed a spirit that would not allow them to give up. As a former basketball player myself, I know how hard it is to win and play at a high level for multiple games. I am especially proud because Jefferson High School has a special place in my heart. When I started my public career in Portland, I lived in the Jefferson district, so I always feel like it is home.  I learned a long time ago that the Jefferson community is the heart and soul of Portland. That is why I want all of my colleagues in the Senate and people around the country to know about the Jefferson Democrats' Herculean efforts and achievements. These two teams exemplify the character and true values of Oregonians by proving that hard work can lead to great success. They have shown that if you really work at something and are persistent, you can get the job done on and off the hardwood.  I want to salute all the members of the girls' basketball team and acknowledge the exceptional play of their starting lineup Janita Badon, Dequise Hammick, Nyesha Sims, Ariel Reynolds, and Tyrisha Blake who have proven to be the best girls' starting lineup in Oregon. Without the solid contributions from Jasmine Smith, Arquazia Jackson, Daniel Dixon, Debbie Blackmon, Arqueisha Preston, Hollisha Watson, Denaya Brazzle and Adreya Hudson, the Democrats would not have won a state championship. They also had great leadership that took them all the way to the championship, starting with their head coach, Michael Bontempts, and his outstanding assistant coaching staff.  I also want to salute the members of the boys' basketball team who carried on the tradition of winning that has been built by so many Jefferson champions who came before them community and business leaders like Tony Hopson, Ray Leary, Aaron Miles, and Michael Lee. Each of them began at Jefferson and went on to become winners in life after winning championships on the court. It will not surprise me when I read about the huge individual successes that these stellar players from the 2008 championship teams will have in their future. Oregonians everywhere will surely be watching as they go off to pursue great things.  So I applaud all the players on the boys' basketball team along with their head coach, Marshall Haskins, and his coaching staff. They put together a great starting line-up for the 2007-2008 season, including Terrance Jones, Terrance Ross, Tyrone White, Kalonji Paschel, Henry Williams and Jordan Black who is known as the best sixth man in 5A basketball. The Jefferson boys' roster was loaded with talent that gave them an option of a second starting line up that often made it difficult for teams to prepare for them when Darrel Nelson, Noah Kone, Jonathan Hall, Marlon Miles, Alexander Johnson, Robert Price, and Rashad Dent entered the game.  Jefferson keeps winning against all odds. They are true champions and an inspiration for all Americans both on and off the court. Their commitment and dedication to hard work has given me a new reason to be proud that I am an Oregonian. I will savor this unique moment in our State's sports history along with my fellow 3 million Oregonians as I congratulate both the girls' and boys' Democrats on a job well done.                          ____________________
