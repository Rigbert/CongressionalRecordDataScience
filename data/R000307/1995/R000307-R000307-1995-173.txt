Chairman, I move to strike the requisite number of words.  Mr. Chairman, this is one of those ``I had not intended on making a speech'' speech. But it seems to me as I listened to the debate between the gentleman from Ohio [Mr. Portman], the gentlewoman from Colorado, and the gentleman from California in regard to this partnership effort that we have in trying to establish safeguards for clean water and clean air and all of the things that we must do to ensure our country have the cleanup and the safety of every consumer and every citizen.  I think the remark was made about a partnership effort in children as being part of the family. The gentleman from Ohio [Mr. Portman] touched on this just for a moment, but I think it bears some amplification, more especially as it applies to this amendment.  An example I would like to bring is that of a small community in Kansas in my district by the name of Pretty Prairie. Now, Pretty Prairie has under 1,000 people. It has been in a growing dispute with the EPA for the last 4 or 5 years.  The EPA in their infinite wisdom has reduced the level of nitrates in regard to what is safe and not safe from 20 parts per million to 10. And all of a sudden the EPA through the State agency informed this small community that they were out of compliance.  Some 600 to 800 people were forced to try to come up with some kind of a plan to address the EPA dictate, or the mandate. We are talking nearly a million bucks. A million bucks to develop a new waterworks or face all sorts of fines and problems.  This community asked the EPA whether or not bottled water would substitute. Now, why do we have a change in the nitrate level moving from 20 parts per million to 10? That is to prevent the blue baby syndrome. Except there is one problem here that nobody seems to understand from the EPA. Nobody was sick. No child was sick. There has never been a case in Kansas in regard to the blue baby syndrome.  But all of a sudden here is Pretty Prairie having to come up with a million bucks to change their entire waterworks.                              {time}  1440  So the community said, fine, we will use bottled water, but that does not suit the EPA. We are still in discussion after 4 or 5 years with this mandate that is about to put this town out of business.  That is the kind of parent-child relationship it seems to me is what is wrong about this. This has happened all over my district. I can give case after case after case where there is a growing rebellion in regard to the partnership effort that should be established with all of the alphabet soup agencies that come down with these mandates. In Kansas today in 105 counties, all of the county commissioners have to spend at least half of the budget on these mandates, and in many cases they are counterproductive, they do not apply and they are just downright silly.  Let me give one other example I am worried about in regard to the Towns amendment. I have great admiration of the gentleman. But in St. Francis, KS many senior citizens came to me and signed a petition and said why are you increasing our trash fee three or four times as much as the current fee. These are senior citizens who are now living on fixed income. And the EPA there, through the landfill regulations and through the State agency, said from date certain last October you are going to have to have all of your trash hauled to a regional landfill. There are two problems. One, there was no regional landfill, and there were not any trucks to haul the trash.  There was a suggestion made that we would go to Denver, but Denver did not want it. That would simply go across the State line. The Towns amendment obviously would simply prevent us from really trying to focus on that kind of a mandate.  So here are the senior citizens on fixed income in St. Francis, KS saying to the gentleman from New York [Mr. Towns], the gentlewoman from Colorado [Mrs. Schroeder], and the gentleman from California [Mr. Miller], why are we paying for this mandate. I will tell my colleagues what will happen. Every senior citizen there will get the neighbor boy to come and take the trash and put it in a pickup truck and they will dump it in a ditch, and we will have trash blowing all over the Great Plains as a result of this damn fool mandate, and it is interstate.  Let me give one other example if I might. Some time ago the EPA proposed 65 mandates to help clean up all of rural and small-town America.
