President, I am pleased to speak in support of the Child Nutrition and WIC Reauthorization Act of 2004 as passed by the Senate. In the best tradition of the Senate, Members from both sides of the aisle have come together over the past year to renew and improve the School Lunch and Breakfast Programs, the Summer Food Service Program, the Child and Adult Care Food program, and the Special Supplemental Nutrition Program for Women, Infants and Children, WIC. I commend the chairman and ranking member of the Agriculture Committee, Senator Cochran and Senator Harkin, as well as their staffs, for their hard work in support of the millions of children and families who rely on these vital programs to meet their daily food needs.  At the start of the 108th Congress, when we began the process of renewing the child nutrition programs, many of us had high hopes for improvements that might be made. I proposed legislation to provide financial incentives to schools that want to improve their nutritional environment, to renew Federal support for nutrition education in schools, and to expand and stabilize both the WIC and the WIC Farmer's Market Nutrition Programs. With my friend from Pennsylvania, Senator Specter, I proposed the creation of a farm-to-cafeteria program that would bring fresh foods from local farms into the cafeteria, and with my friend from Indiana, Senator Lugar, I proposed giving the Secretary of Agriculture greater authority over the sale of soft drinks and junk foods in schools. Other proposals were made to eliminate the reduced price category for school meals, thereby providing free lunches to all children living in families with income below 185 percent of poverty. Unfortunately, the tight budget with which we had to work did not enable us to enact all of these worthy ideas. I am pleased, however, that the bill before us does include many of them and that at the same time it substantially improves program access and integrity.  Working together, we were able to ensure access to the programs for needy children through direct certification, targeted verification, and technical assistance to reduce administrative error, rather than simply requiring across-the-board increased verification that would have potentially caused eligible children to be erroneously and unacceptable kicked off the program.  We have maintained the historic role of milk in our school meals program, while granting parents the flexibility to help their children get a nutritionally equivalent beverage with lunch if they cannot drink milk. This legislation will also allow schools to have more flexibility on what to serve on the school lunch line. While the school lunch program currently restricts schools to offering only milk varieties that most students chose in the previous school year, this legislation would allow schools to expand choices based on what they believe are the best offerings for the student body, including flavored milk, lactose-free milk and milk of varying fat levels. In particular, I welcome the addition of lactose-free milk to the school lunch line, believing it will expand milk's appeal to those with special dietary needs.  We are also taking an important first step in beginning to conquer the problem of soda in our schools. Twenty years ago children consumed more than twice as much milk as soda; now they drink twice as much soda as milk. This is a huge problem for our children. Thus I am pleased this bill gives schools the authority to offer milk at anytime and anywhere on school premises or at school events. This will prevent restrictions on milk sales that are sometimes inserted in soft drink vending contracts with schools.  This legislation ensures that small States will receive an inflationary increase in their administrative expense grant--the money that they receive to administer and ensure the integrity of the Federal child nutrition programs. This provision is particularly important to my home State of Vermont as well as to other small and rural States that have not seen an increase in their grant in over 20 years despite inflationand expansion of the responsibilities of the States to oversee the programs.  I look forward to the many wonderful local school-farm partnerships that will be possible under my new farm-to-cafeteria grant program as authorized by this bill. Communities all across our Nation are beginning to explore the benefits of linking local farms and school cafeterias. When these connections are made, children get healthier fresh food choices at school, and hands-on knowledge about where their food comes from and how it is produced. And farmers not only strengthen their local markets but become more involved with the schools in their community. With just a little seed money and some technical assistance these schools can create a program that teaches children about good nutrition, shows them the importance of agriculture, and supports local farms by keeping food dollars within the community. Under this new program, communities will be able to apply for competitive grants from USDA for up to $100,000 to purchase adequate equipment to store and prepare fresh foods, to develop food procurement relationships with nearby farmers, to plan seasonal menus and promotional materials, and to develop hands-on nutrition education related to agriculture. As a member of the Appropriations Committee, I will now work to secure funding for this important new program.  My support for these new farm-to-cafeteria projects comes in part from the amazing successes demonstrated by the WIC Farmers Market Nutrition Program, FMNP. Years ago, I helped create this program, which provides vouchers to WIC families good for fruits and vegetables at the local farmers market. The effects of this program have been stunning, and I am very pleased that under that this bill the WIC FMNP voucher has been increased from $20 to $30 and that we have reduced the cost to States of administering the program.  These provisions and more mean that millions of children and their families will be better served by the Federal child nutrition programs. Though I wish we could have had more resources to do some of the other things we had considered, like expand access to the child care and summer programs in rural areas, provide mandatory funds for nutrition education, and eliminate the reduced price meal category, I support the package of reforms that we have before us and I pledge to keep working on the rest.  In particular, I will continue to work with my colleagues in the Senate to address the growing crisis of childhood obesity in America and the ready availability of junk foods in our schools and cafeterias. With more and more of our children suffering the health consequences of being overweight and obese, we have a responsibility to help them make smarter nutrition choices. But with all of the funds that Congress rightly appropriates each year for nutrition education and healthy school lunches and meals, our Nation's efforts are severely undermined when children have to walk through a gauntlet of vending machines offering unhealthy choices on the way to the cafeteria. We need to put limits on the availability of junk foods in our schools, to ensure that students are not substituting empty calorie sodas and snacks for their nutritious federally subsidized school meals. Though this measure's establishment of local wellness policies is a step in the right direction, I am concerned that we have sidestepped our responsibility to the health of our Nation's children yet again and I am hopeful that we will revisit this issue in the near future.  Once again, I thank Chairman Cochran and Senator Harkin for their leadership on this important legislation, and I am pleased to express my strong support for its final passage.                          ____________________
