Chairman, I yield myself such time as I may consume.  Mr. Chairman, this amendment is one that proposes to make technical and conforming changes to the bill. The 420-page bill had a number of technical problems, such as improper spacing, incorrect terminology, drafting errors, incorrect headings, incorrect references to section numbers and grammatical inconsistencies. This amendment will clean up the bill which will make the provisions of the legislation easier to execute and to understand.  I want to emphasize that this amendment does not substantively alter the composition of the bill. Over the last several years, the Congress has considered, amended, debated, negotiated and refined this measure, and the product under consideration is the result of those labors. During the last Congress, that delicate balance is preserved in this legislation. This amendment improves the bill by making it as technically accurate as possible, which is important because lawyers, accountants, creditors and debtors will be relying on and scrutinizing its provisions. Again, this is a technical amendment meant only to clarify with precision the terms of this legislation. I urge its adoption.  Mr. Chairman, I reserve the balance of my time.
