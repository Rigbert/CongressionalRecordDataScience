 President, as all of us are aware, J.P. Morgan has agreed to buy Washington Mutual, which is based in my home State of Washington. I have been in touch with J.P. Morgan and with WaMu about their plans, and I have been assured that the transition will go smoothly and that Washington Mutual's banking customers will not see any interruption in service. And that is good news.  It is, of course, still too early to know the impact of the failure of WaMu, the Nation's largest thrift, will have on local jobs, but it is further evidence to me that the economic crisis has spilled over into our communities.  I am very saddened that it is having an impact on families and our economy, and yet it is another sign that we must find a bipartisan solution now.  We are working together quickly to reach an agreement. We have rejected the President's $700 billion blank check because it did not ensure oversight or protection for our taxpayers. But Democrats and Republicans in the Senate are working with the House Democrats, the Treasury, and the Fed to come up with a solution that keeps this crisis from hitting more communities. We are hopeful that the House Republicans will come to the table and work with us on a solution that protects American taxpayers.  As we do this, I firmly believe we must also offer the American people a hand and help get our economy going in communities across this country.  We now have an opportunity today to help millions of struggling families who are grasping for a lifeline as this economy sustains blow after blow. Long before this economic crisis rippled across our financial system, middle-class families were already reeling under the impact of failed policies that were implemented by President Bush and backed by John McCain, and it is critical that we act now to help those families, those small businesses, State and local governments get back on their feet.
