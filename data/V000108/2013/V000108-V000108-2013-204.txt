Speaker, it is my distinct honor to congratulate the members of the International Association of Sheet Metal, Air, Rail, and Transportation Workers (SMART), as they celebrate the 125th anniversary of the union's founding. The members and officers of SMART are to be commended for their dedication and recognized for the union's history of remarkable achievements.  SMART, formerly known as the Sheet Metal Workers' International Association and the United Transportation Union, is a truly inventive, progressive, and strong union made up of skilled craftsmen throughout the United States, Canada, and Puerto Rico. Representing construction, sheet metal, transportation, railroad, shipyard, and production employees in the industry, SMART works tirelessly to ensure safe working conditions, living wages and benefits, and growth opportunities for its employees.  Since its founding in 1888, SMART has been one of labor's most ambitious and diligent organizations. Throughout history, its union leaders and members have been through many struggles and triumphs seeking to bring about hope for workers seeking fair wages, hours, and benefits while contributing to the structural development and building of the United States. Since the late 1920s, members and officers have contributed to the welfare of the country at home and abroad. From their assistance with the production of Charles Lindberg's airplane, the Spirit of Saint Louis, designed for his historic flight across the Atlantic Ocean, to the building and sustaining of America's Navy in our nation's shipyards, as well as the union's support in the World Trade Center tragedy, SMART's members are worthy of the highest praise.  Northwest Indiana has a rich history of excellence in its craftsmanship and loyalty among its tradesmen. The members and officers of SMART are outstanding examples of these qualities. They have demonstrated their loyalty to both the union and communities internationally through their hard work and selfless dedication.  Mr. Speaker, I ask that you and my other distinguished colleagues join me in honoring the past and present hardworking members and officers of SMART and to congratulate the organization on the 125th anniversary of its founding. They have committed themselves to making a significant contribution to the growth and development in Northwest Indiana, throughout the United States, and abroad.                          ____________________
