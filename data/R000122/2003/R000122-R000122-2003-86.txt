 Mr. President, this amendment would add $50 million for the CDC immunization program under section 317 of the Public Health Service Act. My amendment is offset by using the same mechanism that the chairman and ranking member utilized on $2.2 billion of the underlying bill.  Immunization of children is one of the great hallmarks of our public health system of the United States. It has had remarkable success. Diseases such as polio that were terrifying America when I was a child have been eradicated. We have to keep up this effort. This $50 million will add to that effort to be sure we do not lose ground and that we continue to immunize all our children. It is fully offset, and I urge my colleagues to support the amendment.
