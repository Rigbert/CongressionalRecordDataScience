President, to use our time, my colleague from Indiana spoke earlier as though the cloture vote on the extenders determines whether the Senate will have any amendments to the extenders bill. That is not the case. A ``yes'' vote today is a vote to move the debate forward.  In that vein I simply want to announce that if cloture is invoked, I would be happy to work with Senator Hatch and the two leaders to developan agreed-upon list of amendments, narrowly related to the bill that the Finance Committee did in its consideration of the bill in the committee.
