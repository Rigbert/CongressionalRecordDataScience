Speaker, I rise today to join my colleagues in recognizing one of this body's most outstanding employees, the director of House photography and one of my constituents, Keith Jewell.  I have known Keith since I first came to this body in a special election in 1981. He has always been one of those people who work in the shadows, yet his outstanding photography has graced many of our office walls and made countless constituents happy.  In my capacity as chairman of Helsinki Commission, I traveled to many of the former Communist countries as they were before, during and after their transition to democracy. During some of my visits, especially to the Baltic States following their breakaway from the Soviet empire in the early 1990's, it at times became a little dangerous as we walked amongst sandbags and barricades to meet with the new leaders.  Keith Jewell was always right there with us, snapping photos while looking over his shoulder to see that we were all safe. The photos that appeared in newspapers and were sent to various organizations both here and abroad helped provide inspiration to those people throughout the world who were seeking freedom from dictators and oppression. When we talk about images that helped to end the cold war, I believe Keith Jewell was instrumental in helping to project Congress' support for freedom and democracy throughout the world.  Keith, this is one Member who wishes you well from the heart. You have been an outstanding employee and one that I am sorry to see leave this body. Best of luck in your future endeavors. The camera's eye will always be on you for your work and dedication to this body and the people it serves.                          ____________________
