President, I rise today to pay tribute to Ms. Debra Ferland, who is being installed as the president of the Women's Council of the National Association of Home Builders on February 11, 2001 in Atlanta, Georgia. I would like to thank her for her twenty-three years of work, and honor her for her achievements within the housing industry.  After graduating from the University of Massachusetts at Dartmouth, Debra began her long and admirable career by working for several prominent national property management firms, including Picerne Properties, First Realty Management, and Diversified Properties. She has been a Construction Manager at HUD approved rehabs, consulted for rent supplement and Section 8 programs, and is currently Director of Special Projects at the Ferland Corporation.  Debra has taken an active role in the industry on both a state and national level by assuming numerous leadership roles, including local Council President, Membership Chair, and National Convention Chairman. She has been appointed as a member of both the Labor Shortage Task Force and the National Association of Home Builders Capital Club, and is the Women's Council Life Director.  In addition to her tremendous career achievements, Debra has devoted herself to family, including her husband A. Austin Ferland, her daughter Nicole, and her extended family of Fred, Deborah, and four year old grandson, Ben. She is a chef and an avid golfer, and has displayed her commitment to her local community through Habitat for Humanity, the Lincoln School for Girls, and the Tomorrow Fund.  The citizens of Rhode Island are indeed fortunate for Debra's many contributions and for her ongoing commitment to creating housing opportunities both within our state and nationwide. I congratulate her on the leadership role which she is about to undertake and know that she will continue her good work for years to come.                          ____________________
