President, I thank the Senator from Pennsylvania for his comments, for his introduction of Governor Ridge at the hearing last Friday, and for his participation as a member of the committee. We are indeed fortunate to have the benefit of his expertise.  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that after the Senator from North Dakota delivers his remarks, the Senator from Alabama be recognized next for as long as he needs, with a limit of 10 minutes.
