A resident of Brookfield, VT, Mr. Koren is best known nationally for his distinctive creature cartoons that appear in the New Yorker. His work has also been featured in many other publications.  Mr. Koren grew up in Mount Vernon, NY, and attended Columbia University, where he first began sketching cartoons for the university's magazine. Encouraged by a favorable review of one of his earliest works, Mr. Koren then dedicated himself to drawing investigative and satirical cartoons. His hard work, quick wit, and unique social commentary are evidenced in his work. In true Vermont tradition, he has also found the time to volunteer as a firefighter in his small community for the past 26 years.  I am proud to recognize Ed Koren's achievement as Vermont's Cartoon Laureate. The Vermont Digger recently published a profile of this accomplished man who has adopted Vermont as his home that captures all that is so unique about his character and creativity. I ask that the article, ``Cartoonist Ed Koren earns a Vermont laurel, but don't expect him to rest on it,'' be printed in the Record.  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in the Record, as follows:                [From the Vermont Digger, Feb. 16, 2014]   This State: Cartoonist Ed Koren Earns A Vermont Laurel, But Don't                         Expect Him To Rest on it                          (By Andrew Nemethy)       From his rambling 1840s farmhouse in Brookfield in central      Vermont, Ed Koren looks out on Sunset Lake and a      quintessential Vermont village whose famed floating bridge is      an icon of the state. But as a cartoonist, Koren's off-beat,      pinballing mind is focused on a different view, as he scans      the strange landscape of human foibles, fads, social mores      and culture. It's a scene that has sustained him for more      than five decades.       ``There's something always new, or quirky or nutty or      outrageous,'' he says, describing the lode of material that      keeps inspiring his cartoons. ``To me, it never ends, and      it's great for that.''       By a cranial alchemy that even he is hard-pressed to      explain, what he sees out in the world gets distilled into      cartoons populated by fuzzy big-beaked creatures and captions      that capture the essence of whatever tickled his perceptive      fancy. What emerges in his cartoons is at once universal but      also artisanal and localvore because of the settings, which      reflect the terroir of his adopted state. Take a recent New      Yorker cartoon whose locale was instantly recognizable to any      patron of the Three Penny Taproom in Montpelier, from the      layout to the bartender to the list of beers, which included      ``Curtis India Pale Ale'' (his wife's name is Curtis) ``Onion      River Saison'' and ``Camel's Hump Imperial Stout.''       ``I kind of bring it home,'' he says simply. ``It's like a      tribute to friends. It's capturing what I like about living      here.''       It's entirely fitting, then, that on Feb. 27, Koren will be      recognized as Vermont's Cartoonist Laureate at the      Statehouse, and will give a talk at the Center for Cartoon      Studies in White River Junction, which nominated him for the      award. (Burlington's James Kolchalka was the first.)       Koren is honored and, typically, quick to riff humorously      about the nomination, quipping that he may have to wear a      neck brace. ``It's a weighty thing,'' he says of the honor      and a potential swelled head. He then dredges up a quote from      his literary mind, attributed to politician and UN ambassador      Adlai Stevenson: ``Flattery is all right so long as you don't      inhale.''       Truth is, there's little danger of flattery going to his      head. Koren lives a well-grounded rural life in Brookfield:      For 26 years he has served in the volunteer fire department,      a job he loves, though he admits at 78, hauling hoses and      pouring water on house fires, the ``real grunt work,'' is      beyond his capacity today.       ``I'm getting to be too old,'' he says.       When it comes to cartoons, few artists have a style as      distinctive and easily recognizable as Koren's squiggly      creatures, which have appeared all over Vermont, his donation      to nonprofits and other organizations he deems worthy. Koren      himself is small-beaked and not very large, with a bushy gray      mustache, a frequent twinkle in his eye and a sprightly gait      that reflects his exercise pursuits, which range seasonally      from cross-country skiing to biking and paddling. He's famed      for exercising daily, which he says refreshes his mind and      his sense of the beauty in the world.       Imagine a lean, fit fatherly elf with a curmudgeonly tinge,      and you're not far off (though it's more grandfatherly these      days, thanks to grandkids from his first marriage). He now      lives with his wife Curtis and an elderly Siamese feline      named Catmandu.       Koren, who was raised in Mount Vernon, N.Y., was doing a      teaching gig in graphic arts at Brown University when Vermont      beckoned and he moved here permanently.       ``I fell into this house in Brookfield from a year-old copy      of Country Journal,'' he explains. He saw an ad for the house      in the magazine, checked it out, fell in love with its      village location, and, while living in New York City, bought      the place in 1978 as a second home.       His ties to the Green Mountains go much further back,      however, to his teens when he attended a summer theater camp      in Waitsfield. The lush landscape and way of life was      beguiling. ``Like a lot of kids, it stays with you,'' he      says.       While Vermont offers fodder and settings for his cartoons,      he admits to living a yin and yang existence. ``I've always      been a New Yorker because I've spent so much of my life      there. I'm at a heart a city guy, but I'm at heart a country      guy,'' he says. And like many a Vermont country guy, he's      now, in mid-February, admitting to being weary of winter as      he lugs in firewood from the shed to keep his Vermont      Castings stove going and his house warm.       Koren was drawn to the arts early. As a kid, he was      inspired to draw by Al Capp's Li'l Abner, especially the      simple lovable cartoon characters known as ``Shmoos.'' He      began drawing cartoons in the mid-1950s at Columbia      University for the college humor magazine, ``Jester,'' and      then went on to study graphic arts in Paris and to receive an      MFA from Pratt Institute. He was feeling tugged in several      career directions--city planning, architecture, and graphic      arts--when a ``kindly response'' from The New Yorker about      looking at his cartoons put his future on course.       Koren landed in the magazine's pages in its literary heyday      when the legendary William Shawn was editor. His      illustrations and cartoons began appearing in The New York      Times, Time and Newsweek magazines, as well as in ads for      financial publications and Fortune 500 companies, and in a      wide range of books. Always a freelance artist, for a number      of years in the late 1990s he fell out of favor at the New      Yorker (it was ``an unreliable family member'') but now seems      to be back in the magazine's cartoon graces.       Koren is vague in describing how he came up with the      creatures in his cartoons, which he roughs out and then      refines in a lengthy process using pen and ink on large      pieces of art paper measuring about two feet on each side.      Those squiggly lined creatures of his just sort of happened,      he says, explaining his style had a ``lax way of evolving''      and that he ``wasn't trying to do any of what I achieved.''       Koren draws in a spacious and cluttered studio at one end      of his house, with two tables, stacks of books and walls      pinned with illustrations, hand-written quotes and mementoes.      Underneath one table is a bank of 40 drawers that hold      decades of his life in pen and ink.       ``I save everything. I'm a pack rat. I hate to throw things      away,'' he admits.       As for his captions, which often nail smug and self-     important people and modern life in general, he says he keeps      his ears open ``like two giant antennas,'' especially when he      is visiting New York City. At home he reads a lot and listens      to radio (WDEV, VPR and NHPR.)       Does he ever think of retiring? ``Never!'' he says,      recoiling at the idea. Besides, humanity is constantly      providing inflated egos to puncture and trends to lampoon.       ``It's part of my life. If I didn't do that, what would I      do?'' he asks.                          ____________________
