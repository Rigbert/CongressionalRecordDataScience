Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of H.R. 3694, the Highway Funding Restoration Act. This bipartisan bill has 316 cosponsors in the House of Representatives and the other body companion measure, S. 1917, is cosponsored by 74 Members of that body.  I want to particularly thank the gentleman from Iowa (Mr. Nussle), the chairman of the Committee on the Budget, for his support for the restoration of highway funding. The gentleman from Iowa (Mr. Nussle) included in the House budget resolution a provision for the outlay of these funds. I support enforcement of the budget resolution adopted by the House.  Mr. Speaker, I am working with the gentleman from Iowa (Mr. Nussle) to address in the future a better method of calculating the Revenue Aligned Budget Authority, which we refer to as RABA. We need to more accurately align highway spending with highway revenues, while maintaining predictability and stability in highway funding levels.  There is a clear and strong consensus that H.R. 3694 is the right approach to restore proposed cuts to Federal-aid highway funding in the fiscal year 2003 budget.  Mr. Speaker, H.R. 3694 restores not less than $4.4 billion to the Federal-aid highway construction programs for fiscal year 2003, and ensures that these funds will be spent according to the formula established by the Transportation Equity Act for the 21st Century, otherwise called TEA-21.  I am pleased that the leadership of the House has agreed to this expedited process. I am confident that the Senate will also take timely action on the bill before the fiscal year 2003 appropriations cycle is well underway.  Mr. Speaker, this bill is vitally necessary for three reasons. First, State Departments of Transportation cannot absorb the proposed cut of $8.5 billion below the level of funding received in the fiscal year of 2002, a 27 percent program reduction.  Second, transportation spending keeps people employed. More than 180,000 family-wage jobs are associated with the $4.4 billion funding restoration in this bill.  Third, cash balances in the Highway Trust Fund, the dedicated revenue source for highway and transit construction, are sufficient to accommodate this funding restoration.  Again, I want to thank the full committee ranking member, the gentleman from Minnesota (Mr. Oberstar); the gentleman from Wisconsin (Mr. Petri), the chairman of the Subcommittee on Highways and Transit; and the gentleman from Pennsylvania (Mr. Borski), the subcommittee ranking member, along with the full membership of the Committee on Transportation and Infrastructure, and all of the other 242 Members of the House urging immediate passage of the bill.  Mr. Speaker, again, I cannot stress enough the importance of this bill. It does restore the funding level where it should be to build our highways so that we can keep the 180,000 people employed and, more than that, increase the infrastructure necessities in this country and keep them on the right track.  Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.                              {time}  1545
