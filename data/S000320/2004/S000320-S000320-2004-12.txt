 President, I ask unanimous consent that the Congressional Budget Office cost estimate for S. 894, the Marine Corps 230th Anniversary Commemorative Coin Act, be printed in the Record.  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in the Record, as follows:                                                    U.S. Congress,                                  Congressional Budget Office,                                    Washington, DC, June 22, 2004.     Hon. Richard C. Shelby,     Chairman, Committee on Banking, Housing, and Urban Affairs,          U.S. Senate, Washington, DC.       Dear Mr. Chairman: The Congressional Budget Office has      prepared the enclosed cost estimate for S. 894, the Marine      Corps 230th Anniversary Commemorative Coin Act.       If you wish further details on this estimate, we will be      pleased to provide them. The CBO staff contact is Matthew      Pickford.           Sincerely,                                                Elizabeth Robinson                              (For Douglas Holtz-Eakin, Director).       Enclosure.     S. 894--Marine Corps 230th Anniversary Commemorative Coin Act       S. 894 would authorize the U.S. Mint to produce a $1 silver      coin in calendar year 2005 to commemorate the 230th      anniversary of the United States Marine Corps. The      legislation would specify a surcharge of $10 on the sale of      each coin and would designate the Marine Corps Heritage      Foundation, a nonprofit entity, as the recipient of the      income from the surcharge. CBO estimates that enacting S. 894      would have no significant net impact on direct spending over      the 2004-2009 period.       Sales from the coins that would be authorized by S. 894      could raise as much as $5 million in surcharges if the Mint      sells the maximum number of authorized coins. However, the      experience of recent commemorative coin sales suggests that      receipts would be about $3 million. Under current law, the      Mint must ensure that it does not lose money producing      commemorative coins before transferring any surcharges to a      recipient organization. CBO expects that those receipts from      such surcharges would be transferred to the heritage      foundation in fiscal year 2006.       S. 894 contains no intergovernmental or private-sector      mandates as defined in the Unfunded Mandates Reform Act and      would not affect the budgets of state, local, or tribal      governments.       On March 22, 2004, CBO transmitted a cost estimate for H.R.      3277, the Marine Corps 230th Anniversary Commemorative Coin      Act, as ordered reported by the House Committee on Financial      Services on March 17, 2004. The two pieces of legislation are      similar and our estimates of implementing each bill are the      same.       The CBO staff contact for this estimate is Matthew      Pickford, who can be reached at 226-2860. This estimate was      approved by Peter H. Fontaine, Deputy Assistant Director for      Budget Analysis.                          ____________________
