Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.  Before beginning my statement, let me state that after the committee filed the committee report on this legislation, we received a Congressional Budget Office cost estimate dated October 6, 2004, and I will insert this cost estimate into the Record at this point.                                                  October 6, 2004.     Hon F. James Sensenbrenner, Jr.,     Chairman, Committee on the Judiciary, House of          Representatives, Washington, DC.       Dear Mr. Chairman: The Congressional Budget Office has      prepared the enclosed cost estimate for S. 1194, the Mentally      Ill Offender Treatment and Crime Reduction Act of 2004.       If you wish further details on this estimate, we will be      pleased to provide them. The CBO staff contact is Susanne S.      Mehlman.           Sincerely,                                              Douglas Holtz-Eakin,                                                         Director.       Enclosure.     S. 1194--Mentally Ill Offender Treatment and Crime Reduction          Act of 2004       Summary: S. 1194 would authorize the appropriation of $50      million for fiscal year 2005 and such sums as may be      necessary for the 2006-2009 period for the Department of      Justice to make grants to state and local governments to      improve the treatment of criminal offenders with mental      illnesses or substance abuse disorders. CBO estimates that      implementing the bill would cost $172 million over the 2005-     2009 period, assuming the appropriation of the necessary      amounts. Enacting S. 1194 would not affect direct spending or      revenues.       S. 1194 contains no intergovernmental or private-sector      mandates as defined in the Unfunded Mandates Reform Act      (UMRA). The creation of a new grant for mental health      programs in the state, local, or tribal justice systems would      benefit those governments.       Estimated cost to the Federal Government: The estimated      budgetary impact of S. 1194 is shown in the following table.      For this estimate, CBO assumes that the authorized amounts      will be appropriated near the start of each fiscal year and      that outlays will follow the historical rate of spending for      similar programs. For the 2006-2009 authorization levels, CBO      estimated the necessary funding levels by adjusting the      fiscal year 2005 authorization level for anticipated      inflation. The costs of this legislation fall within budget      function 750 (administration of justice).------------------------------------------------------------------------                                         By fiscal year, in millions of                                                   dollars--                                      ----------------------------------                                        2005   2006   2007   2008   2009------------------------------------------------------------------------              CHANGES IN SPENDING SUBJECT TO APPROPRIATION Estimated Authorization Level........     50     51     52     53     55Estimated Outlays....................     11     26     37     45     53------------------------------------------------------------------------       Intergovernmental and private-sector impact: S. 1194      contains no intergovernmental or private-sector mandates as      defined in UMRA and would benefit state, local, and tribal      governments by authorizing a joint grant program between      those justice systems and social service providers. These      grants could be used for planning and implementing      alternative court systems for defendants with mental illness,      creating training and treatment programs, and coordinating      efforts of state and local governments. Any costs to those      governments would be voluntarily as conditions of receiving      federal aid.       Previous CBO estimate: On October 28, 2003, CBO transmitted      a cost estimate for S. 1194, as reported by the Senate      Committee on the Judiciary on October 23, 2003. The two      versions of the bill are similar, though the authorization      levels and timing of the authorizations differ and the cost      estimates reflect those differences.       Estimate prepared by: Federal Costs: Susanne S. Mehlman;      Impact on State, Local, and Tribal Governments: Melissa      Merrell; and Impact on the Private Sector: Paige Piper/Bach.       Estimate approved by: Peter H. Fontaine, Deputy Assistant      Director for Budget Analysis.  Mr. Speaker, many of our Nation's inmates are mentally ill, and the system is not well equipped to deal with them. The Bureau of Justice Statistics estimated in 1999 that 16 percent of State prison inmates, 7 percent of Federal inmates, and 16 percent of those in local jails or on probation reported either a mental condition or an overnight stay in a mental hospital.  According to this study and others, homelessness and unemployment are most prevalent amongst the mentally ill. Mental health treatment and other forms of assistance for the nonviolent mentally ill offenders can reduce recidivism in the criminal justice system. These offenders require treatment for their mental illness and often for their drug and alcohol abuse problems as well.  In response to this problem, Members on both sides of the aisle have proposed this bill to establish a grant program to encourage States to address this issue. The grants may be used to fund mental health courts or diversion programs for those with mental health issues. They may also be used to promote cooperation between the criminal justice system and the mental health community, or to train both criminal justice personnel and mental health providers to respond to the needs of mentally ill offenders.  In addition, changes were made to S. 1194 by the Committee on the Judiciary to encourage a system of graduated sanctions for mentally ill offenders and supervision of those who are offered a diversion option to ensure the safety of the community.  I believe this legislation will reduce recidivism amongst the mentally ill while striking the appropriate balance between protecting our communities and addressing the needs of mentally ill offenders. I urge my colleagues to join me in supporting it.  Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.
