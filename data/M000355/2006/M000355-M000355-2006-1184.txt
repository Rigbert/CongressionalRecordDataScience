 President, if I could just briefly say to our good friend from Maryland that Republican Senators, too, join in wishing him well on this extraordinary accomplishment. And if he would like to resign any time before January, that would be all right, too. But in the meantime, we are glad to have you around.  Congratulations, Senator Sarbanes.
