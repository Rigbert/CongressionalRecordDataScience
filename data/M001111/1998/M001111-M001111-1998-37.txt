 President, I rise in strong support of the Commerce, State, Justice Appropriations measure. As a member of the Appropriations Committee, I can speak to the importance of this legislation and I commend Senator Gregg and Senator Hollings for putting this bipartisan product together.  I could speak to many important provisions in this bill for my constituents. From fisheries to the cops on the street to export assistance, this bill is important to Washington state. But there is one provision in the bill that I wish to give special attention to today. And that's the language to repeal Section 110 of the 1996 Illegal Immigration Act.  The repeal of Section 110 is one of my highest priorities for the year. As a member of the Appropriations Committee, I do strongly support including the repeal in the Commerce, State, Justice Appropriations legislation.  Section 110 requires the Immigration and Naturalization Service to develop an automated entry and exit system for the purpose of documenting the entry and departure of ``every alien'' entering and leaving the United States. It was not until after Section 110 became law that Congress became aware of the full impact of this new language.  As currently written, Section 110 will have disastrous consequences for U.S. border communities whose economies are dependent on border travel, trade and tourism. For example, more than $1 billion dollars in economic activity is generated each day by legal crossings between the U.S. and Canada. More than 116 million people legally crossed the border from Canada in 1996. This travel and economic activity will be discouraged to the detriment of U.S. interests if we impose new restrictions and create additional bureaucratic delays along our shared borders.  Section 110 will have dire consequences for my entire state and particularly for the residents of Northwest Washington in Whatcom County. In my state, Section 110 will create an invisible barrier between neighbors, families and coworkers who happen to live on different sides of the border. More than $250 million dollars of annual economic activity in Washington state will be threatened. Border infrastructure which is already inadequate and overwhelmed at certain times of the year will be further burdened with new documentation requirements and traffic congestion certain to anger both American citizens and Canadian nationals. It is estimated that Section 110 will almost immediately create a 12 hour backup at the border in Blaine, Washington.  Section 110 is a ticking time bomb. It's really that simple. The INS does not have the technology, facilities or trained personnel to implement this language. The real explosive issue here is the cost to implement Section 110. The INS is silent on this issue. That's because it will cost billions of dollars to implement the Section 110 time bomb. Let's be very clear on this point, without changes this provision will cost billions of dollars not anticipatedby either the Congress or the American people.  Many of my constituents in Whatcom County will view the repeal of Section 110 as the most significant action taken by the Congress this year. Section 110 is the classic square peg solution for a round hole problem. That's why I've been fighting for more than a year to scrap the disastrous language.  Last year, I introduced the first Senate bill on this issue. My bill, S. 1205, the U.S.-Canada Economic Friendship Preservation Act of 1997 seeks to exempt Canadians from Section 110. The effort to fix the Section 110 problem has grown tremendously since the introduction of my bill. Communities across Washington state and virtually the entire Northern Border are working to preserve our close ties with our Canadian neighbors. Governors from Washington state, Michigan, Texas, Arizona and others are supporting the effort. Editorials endorsing the repeal of Section 110 have been written all across the country including The Bellingham Herald, The Seattle Post Intelligencer, The Los Angeles Times, The Washington Post, and The San Diego Union Tribune have all criticized Section 110. Numerous Chambers of Commerce and other business and community groups from all parts of the country are supporting the repeal Section 110 effort.  Various legislative efforts have garnered bipartisan and broad support. I am also an original cosponsor of Senator Abraham's legislation addressing Section 110 and I compliment him for his leadership and advocacy on this issue. Senator Abraham has been a champion in this effort; holding hearings along the border and in Washington, D.C. in his capacity as Chairman of the Immigration Subcommittee. I continue to believe the Senate in addition to passing the language in this bill should pass Senator Abraham's stand alone bill on Section 110.  I commend my colleagues at the Appropriations Committee for taking this action to repeal Section 110. And I urge my colleagues to give this language strong and bipartisan support.
