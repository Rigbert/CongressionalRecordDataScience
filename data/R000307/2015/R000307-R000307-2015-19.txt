President, I thank my friend for the question. I respond to my friend that, yes, the chairman, Mike Conaway, has reached a bipartisan agreement with the House leadership and also the chairman of the Committee on Appropriations, Mr. Rogers from Kentucky. So there is bipartisan agreement with the House leadership, and it is now time for the Senate to respond.  I also echo the comments of the senior Senator from South Dakota, with the help of Senator Rounds, and I would be remiss in not mentioning virtually every member of the ag committee who has been involved in this effort as well. I appreciate the work of my colleagues and the work of our ranking member, Senator Stabenow. I especially want to thank her for raising this issue and helping to find an agreement.  I note that I have worked my entire career to build crop insurance as a public-private partnership that best protects our producers, taxpayers, and consumers, not to mention a very hungry and malnourished world. This agreement reached today continues in that effort to fulfill that mission. I thank the majority leader, the majority whip, and Senator Thune for their commitment. I also thank many of our colleagues who helped reach this solution today.  Mr. President, I yield the floor.
