Chairman, I rise in opposition to the substitute amendment.  Mr. Chairman, I think the difference between the substitute amendment offered by the gentlewoman from Texas [Ms. Jackson-Lee] and the Sensenbrenner-Weldon amendment shows the difference between the two parties in the House of Representatives.  Mr. Chairman, the Jackson-Lee substitute is an add-on. There are no offsets. It adds on $81.5 million to make the personnel account whole. They do not look at reordering priorities. They do not look at keeping the total appropriation or total authorization for NASA the same. They just want to spend some more money and not offset any of the accounts, even those that they think have been set at too high a level by the majority on the committee.  The Weldon amendment, as amended by my amendment, provides the same amount of money for the NASA personnel account as the Jackson-Lee amendment, $81.5 million to stop all of those terrible things that the gentlewoman from Texas and the gentleman from California say will happen.  But what the Weldon and Sensenbrenner amendments do is to offset other parts of NASA, so that our amendment is budget neutral. It does not increase the total amount of money that will be spent on NASA. It is budget neutral.  So, Mr. Chairman, if Members are for just plussing up the NASA account without making offsets, vote for the Jackson-Lee amendment. If Members are not for that, vote to reject it and vote for the Sensenbrenner amendment and then the Weldon amendment, as amended by the Sensenbrenner amendment.
