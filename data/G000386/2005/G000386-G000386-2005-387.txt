 President, I very much thank Senator Judd Gregg, chairman of the powerful Budget Committee, for his leadership and for doing what has not been done in this Senate, it is my understanding, since 1997: We have a budget reconciliation bill that will reduce the deficit by changing programs that are either appropriated or on automatic pilot that tend to never get reviewed as often as they should in order to watch the taxpayers' money wisely.  Senator Gregg's commitment to fiscal discipline has informed and defined this process, and I am grateful for his efforts.  As he just did, I congratulate the chairmen of seven other authorizing committees whose titles of this bill, along with the Finance title that I am going to talk about, comprise this giant legislation that we call reconciliation that Senator Gregg successfully reported last week.  I know that it was not easy for the chairmen of these eight committees to reach consensus and to move their titles forward. These chairmen and the members of their committees have every right to be proud of the work they have done achieving savings but also implementing policies that will help American workers.  Today, we have saved nearly $40 billion over 5 years--to be more accurate, $39.1 billion over 5 years--and that is $4.1 billion more than Congress even directed these committees to do back in April when the budget was adopted. Considering the 8 years since this has been done, this is a significant accomplishment and one of which we ought to be proud.  Many of the proposals in my committee's title, as well as the other titles of this bill, have bipartisan support. Some of them have been proposed by the administration in its budget which came out last February. While I am hopeful that during the debate this week, we will be able to persuade a number of Democrat Members to vote in favor of this bill, I recognize that the budget process is often a partisan exercise and that we will be able to count on few, if any, votes from the Democrat side of the aisle.  As the chairman of the Senate Budget Committee made very clear with his chart that was blank, we have not seen a Democrat proposal. Why? Because they do not want to bite the bullet and do what is hard to suggest from their point of view--how to reduce the deficit--unless it might be by raising taxes because often that is their solution, whereas I myself have never come to the conclusion that the American public is undertaxed. I never have my taxpayers telling me that they are undertaxed. The problem of the budget deficit is that Congress overspends.  In developing my part of this budget reconciliation proposal, I attempted to address a number of bipartisan priorities. These efforts were acknowledged by my colleagues during last week's Senate Finance Committee markup, and I want those members of the Finance Committee to know that I appreciate their kind words. Rather than having their kind words, I would rather have had those Democrats vote for this bill coming out of my committee rather than having it come out on an 11-to-9 partisan vote.  The Finance Committee portion represents nearly a year's worth of work on behalf of members of my committee and the staffs of the respective members, as well as committee staff.  The Senate Finance Committee title achieves a net of $10 billion in savings from Medicare and Medicaid by reducing wasteful spending and by closing loopholes. The Finance title also targets resources to preserving and improving Medicaid, the State Children's Health Insurance Program, and Medicare. In particular, the Medicaid provisions in the title will also produce additional resources for States in operating their Medicaid Programs. In so doing, this bill protects Medicaid benefits for the most vulnerable of our society.  The Senate Finance Committee title cracks down on Medicaid fraud and abuse by encouraging States to aggressively pursue Medicaid fraud by implementing in the respective States, beyond the 13 that have done it, State false claims acts, which in comparable legislation at the Federal level is the single most important tool that U.S. taxpayers have to recover the billions of dollars stolen through fraud every year. In addition, my Finance Committee title requires suppliers that do business with Medicaid to have a false claims act education program so that those with evidence of fraud against Medicaid know they may pursue these claims on behalf of the Government and help to recover stolen funds. In order to fight Medicaid fraud, the Senate Finance Committee title dramatically increases resources to fight fraud and abuse in Medicaid. This then will protect State and Federal budgets and generate substantial savings from this investment.  My committee's title also achieves savings by helping State Medicaid Programs obtain millions in payments owed by third-party payers each year. It also produces savings by ending drug manufacturers' gaming of the system by closing the authorized generic loophole so that appropriate rebates are paid to the States.  The Senate Finance Committee title helps preserve services to beneficiaries by ending overpayments to pharmacies, by reforming the broken system used to reimburse pharmacists for prescription drugs, which is based on the flawed average wholesale price formula, costing taxpayers lots more money than it should. There have been 13 reports in the last 5 years dealing with an average wholesale price formula done by the Congressional Budget Office, the Inspector General's Office, and from the Government Accountability Office, all calling for reforming the Medicaid pharmacy payment formula and ending overpayment for prescription drugs. These overpayments have been costing the States, as well as our Federal Government, billions of dollars needlessly.  The bill also includes provisions to protect rural pharmacies and encourage greater use of cost-saving generic drugs. In addition, my portion of this reconciliation bill balances the savings derived from pharmacy payment reforms with an increase in the rebate paid to State Medicaid Programs by drug manufacturers from 15.2 percent to 17 percent.  On the Medicare side, the Finance title calls for the phaseout of the budget neutral modification to the MedicareAdvantage risk adjuster. This provision will help ensure that the health status risk adjuster required by the Balanced Budget Act of 1997 meets its objective of providing accurate payment to plans based on their enrollees' health. The title also repeals the MedicareAdvantage regional stabilization fund.  There are concerns about these provisions, and some people have argued that we should not touch the MedicareAdvantage Program. In response, I point out that the phaseout of the risk adjuster was announced three times: first in February in the President's budget; second, with the 2006 rates; and again in the September CMS factsheet. So plans submitted their bids knowing full well that the phaseout was going to happen.  When we worked on the Medicare Modernization Act--and that was in 2003--the idea was that if the funds were not needed, then the dollars were to be returned to the U.S. Treasury. We have strong regional preferred provider organization participation. Regional preferred provider organizations are in 21 out of the 26 regions into which the country has been divided. Regional preferred provider organizations have several other safeguards to make sure they are available.  The base MedicareAdvantage rates have been fixed. There are risk corridors, network adequacy requirements, the essential hospital fund, and a moratorium on local PPOs. The title does not affect any of these safeguards, so we feel this money going back to the Federal Treasury under this bill is the right thing to do.  The Finance Committee title of this bill also preserves access to health care for seniors in Medicare by providing a 1-percent payment update to all providers paid under the Medicare physician fee schedule. This replaces a 4.4-percent payment cut that physicians are scheduled to receive in 2006 under the existing formula. So we change that formula to make sure that the 4.4-percent cut does not go through. On top of that, there is a small increase for our physicians.  The Part B premium is affected due to changes included in the title that affect Part B spending. While some provisions lower Part B spending, other provisions increase the spending. However, there is no effect on the Part B premium paid by our seniors until the year 2007. It is also important to keep in mind that the Part B premium increase does not affect low-income beneficiaries. In fact, I worked hard to extend the QI Program so that Part B premiums would continue to be covered for these individuals.  Avoiding the physician payment cut has strong support in the Senate. In July of this year, 89 Senators from both sides of the aisle sent a letter to the White House Office of Management and Budget calling for the removal of Part B drugs from the physician payment formula. This change, which the administration has the authority to make, would permit Congress to address the longstanding programs with the Medicare formula for reimbursing physicians.  Certainly, we are all concerned about any impact on Part B premiums, but this Senate is almost unanimous in its support of addressing this, as evidenced by the 89 signatures calling for changes in the formula that were sent to the administration. To be clear about this, the changes in the physician fee called for in that letter would also increase Part B premiums to our senior citizens. It is important that we take steps to maintain access to physician services in the Medicare Program. The benefits in Medicare are not worth much if beneficiaries cannot find a doctor when they need one.  Another important area addressed by the Senate Finance Committee is long-term care costs. Recognizing that long-term care costs account for significant spending in the Medicaid Program, this bill makes key provisions in long-term care for seniors and the disabled. Consistent with a proposal put forth by President Bush, this bill includes a ``money follows the person'' rebalancing demonstration program. This program would direct grants to States to increase use of home- and community-based services rather than institutional care, and it would eliminate barriers that prevent or restrict the flexible use of Medicaid funds so that individuals may receive support for long-term services in a setting of their choice. This is empowering people.  The title also provides new options for private coverage of long-term care through the long-term care partnerships and promotes the availability of programs of all-inclusive care for the elderly in rural areas.  The Finance Committee title also addresses a number of Medicare priorities while also achieving savings in other areas of Medicare. To begin, being mindful of the unique needs of rural residents and the facilities that serve them, the title protects access to Medicare services for rural beneficiaries.  First, the title would extend the hold-harmless provisions for the small rural hospitals and sole community hospitals from implementation of the hospital outpatient prospective payment system.  Second, it would expand coverage of additional preventive benefits under the Federal qualified health centers.  Third, it would extend the Medicare Dependent Hospital Program, which provides financial protections to rural hospitals with less than 100 beds that have greater than 60 percent of their patients coming from Medicare.  Another issue I suspect we will hear a good deal about during this debate over the next few days is the impact that Hurricane Katrina had when it devastated hundreds of thousands of our fellow Americans.  The title would provide for a much needed downpayment to those States that have suffered as a result of Hurricane Katrina. I am committed to ensuring that the families who have suffered so greatly as a result of this national tragedy receive the services they need to rebuild their lives, and the States which have been affected are made whole.  The Finance Committee title of this bill also provides funding to strengthen and improve the Medicaid and State Children's Health Insurance Program. As my colleagues know, as many as 23 States are projected to experience shortfalls in the Children's Health Insurance Program over the next 2 years. The national total of these State Children's Health Insurance Program shortfalls is near $1 billion. The Senate Finance Committee title includes temporary provisions that will stem these State shortfalls and ensure that States are not forced to curtail or end their Children's Health Insurance Program coverage for vulnerable low-income children.  In order to continue to improve the Medicaid and Children's Health Insurance Programs, the Senate Finance Committee title in this reconciliation bill also includes outreach and enrollment efforts so that children eligible for public health assistance receive that assistance.  This legislation also addresses a fundamental flaw in our current Medicare payment system. Right now, Medicare payment policies do not encourage high-quality care. In other words, doctors get the same reimbursement and hospitals get the same reimbursement whether they are doing the highest quality of care or whether they do not care, and people are always going back into the hospital because the job is not done right the first time. So we have come to the conclusion that we need to reward quality and we need to provide incentives to invest more in health care information technology and other efforts that will improve health care quality.  This reconciliation bill does just that. This bill implements recommendations from the Institute of Medicine and also from the Medicare Payment Advisory Commission. These provisions are based on the bipartisan Medicare Value Purchasing Act, which is S. 1356, introduced by me and my Democratic colleague, the leader on the other side of the aisle of the committee, Senator Baucus of Montana. The legislation creates quality payments under Medicare for physicians and other providers, including hospitals, health plans, skilled nursing facilities, home health organizations, and end stage renal disease facilities.  Finally, the Senate Finance Committee title includes the Family Opportunity Act. The Family Opportunity Act was motivated by the circumstances of individual families--the Melissa Arnold family of Iowa and the Dylan Lee James family. You could say they are representative of hundreds of thousands of families. Both are families we use as an example of those who relied on Medicaid health services for their children with disabilities, and both families ended up risking eligibility for Medicaid as a result of financial eligibility rules that continue to create disincentives for parents to work and stay working and even improve their employment opportunities.  Acute need persists for the Family Opportunity Act. It is just as important today as it was over the past several years that I have been fighting to get the Family Opportunity Act law. I have heard from a number of families in Iowa and across the country, speaking of the imperative to enact the Family Opportunity Act. They tell me about their son or daughter or grandchild, and how much they love their child or grandchild and how important it is to tell their story. They tell about the illness or disability that their families have been struggling with for years.  Then they describe how dad and mom could comfortably support their family but must remain poor, even unemployed, in order that their child receive the health care coverage they need. These parents want to work and provide for their families but must put the health care of their child first.  If we are able to successfully pass the legislation--we have been able to pass this legislation in the Senate, but it did not get through the House of Representatives. If we are successful again, we will achieve important savings that help put our fiscal house in order as well as preserve benefits and ultimately expand access through the Family Opportunity Act for families in Iowa and across the Nation.  The Finance Committee title of this bill achieves significant savings in Medicare and Medicaid by reducing wasteful spending and closing loopholes. It then directs much of these savings to make improvements in these programs that expand access to health care services, protect health care coverage for kids, and protect access to Medicare beneficiaries.  But the bottom line is more than $10 billion in savings in existing programs or additional money being recouped from fraud or money coming in from fees. The bottom line to the Federal deficit is $10 billion.  I have two summaries of the Finance Committee title. I ask unanimous consent that they be printed in the Record.  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in the Record, as follows:                          Summary of Title VI       Title VI of the Deficit Reduction Omnibus Reconciliation      Act of 2005 achieves significant budget savings, slashes      wasteful spending, and targets resources to preserve program      integrity, improve access to health care, and preserve and      protect Medicare and Medicaid.                          spending reductions                                medicaid                   prescription drug payment reforms       Redefines average manufacturer price (AMP) to reflect      discounts and rebates available to retail pharmacies and then      uses that definition for payments to pharmacies and for the      calculation of the best price.       Defines weighted average manufacturer price (WAMP) as the      basis of a new payment system for these drugs and for a new      federal upper limit for multiple source drugs.       Clarifies nominal price definition to ensure that sales      made at a nominal price are appropriately included in AMP      calculations.       Creates a new federal upper limit for payments to states      for covered drugs that goes into effect January 1, 2007 (with      a later transition for states without '06 legislative      sessions) of AMP+5% for single source drugs and WAMP-15% for      multi-source drugs.       Includes language that requires states to provide      appropriate dispensing fees to pharmacists and sets factors      upon which they should be based.       Creates an interim payment policy for 2006 capping the      current federal upper limit at 125% of the July 1, 2005 AWP,      WAC, or direct price levels.       -$4.595 billion / 5 years         reform of medicaid asset transfer rules and loopholes       Closes loopholes in current Medicaid law concerning      transfer of assets to limit the circumstances under which      persons may intentionally shelter assets in order to qualify      for Medicaid.       This section includes the following provisions to close      other loopholes that exist in current law:       Requires states to apply partial month penalties.       Requires states to accumulate transfers in computing the      period of ineligibility.       Requires that annuities are treated the same as trusts      under current law.       Requires that certain notes and loans are considered      countable.       Requires private annuities be based on actuarial life      expectancy.       Limits transfers to purchase life estates.       States would be required to provide a notice of the undue      hardship waiver process to any individual applying for      Medicaid who would be subject to a penalty period so they may      request a waiver of the penalty period.       States would be required to provide for a timely process      for determining whether an undue hardship waiver will be      granted, and a process for appeal of an adverse      determination.       -$335 million / 5 years                         fraud, waste and abuse       Enhancing third party recovery. The section creates useful      new tools for existing third party recovery programs: (1)      clarifies that PBMs must respond to claims; (2) clarifies      that self-insured plans must turn over eligibility data; and      (3) clarifies that states can recover claims for up to three      years from the date of service.       Limitation on use of contingent fee arrangements. The      section gives the Secretary authority to implement standards      for states in their use of contingent fee contracts.       State False Claims Act. Creates an incentive for states to      implement state False Claims Acts by providing them with an      enhanced FMAP for any settlements reached through a state      False Claims Act.       False Claims Act employee education program as a condition      of participation. Requires employers that do more than $1M      business with Medicaid to have a False Claims Act education      program for their employees.       Prohibition on payments to States for prescriptions drug      claims that have already been submitted and paid. This      section clarifies in statute that pharmacists cannot bill      Medicaid for drugs that have been paid for previously and      restocked.       -$512 million / 5 years                      State Financing of Medicaid                        MCO Provider Tax Reform       This provision would treat managed care organizations the      same as other providers for purposes of applying current law      on provider taxes. This section permits states that have a      Medicaid-only managed care provider tax to keep it.       -$75 million / 5 years                    Targeted Case Management Reforms       The Targeted Case Management provision clarifies the      definition of case management services. The provision      specifies that ``case management services'' include:      assessment activities, the development of a specific care      plan, referral and related activities to help an individual      obtain needed medical, social educational and other services,      monitoring and follow up activities.       Further clarifies that ``case management services'' do not      include the direct delivery of medical, educational, social      or other services, such as: research gathering, assessing      adoption placements, recruiting or interviewing potential      foster care parents, serving legal papers, homes      investigations, and transportation.       -$760 million / 5 years                   Drug Rebate and Related Provisions                   Close Authorized Generics Loophole       Improved regulation of authorized generic drugs. This      section requires CMS to include the best price of an      authorized generic in the calculation of the best price for      the branded drug.       -$180 million / 5 years               Increase Flat Rebate Amount to 17% in 2006       Increase in rebates for covered outpatient drugs. This      section increases the rebate paid by innovator drug      manufacturers from 15.1% to 17% and on noninnovator drugs      from 11% to 17%.       -$1.400 billion / 5 years                      Physician Administered Drugs       Requires the collection and submission of utilization data      for certain physician administered drugs. This section      requires states to begin collecting information on physician      administered drugs for the purpose of insuring the state      receives the proper rebate amount.       -$150 million / 5 years       Subtotal--Medicaid Spending Reductions: -$8.007 billion / 5      years       Page 3 of 13                                MEDICARE                                 PART A     Extend Medicare Bad Debt Policy to Skilled Nursing Facilities       As proposed in the President's FY 2006 budget, this      provision would reduce Medicare's reimbursement of skilled      nursing facility bad debt (unpaid beneficiary co-pays and      deductibles) from 100% to 70% of allowable costs.       Medicare skilled nursing facility bad debt payments have      increased 44% from 1996 to 2000.       Congress provides a 30% reduction in Medicare bad debt      payments to hospitals. This policy would equalize the SNF bad      debt payment rate making it consistent with the bad debt      payment rate for hospitals.       -$250 million / 5 years Prohibit Physician Self-Referrals to Physician-Owned Limited Service                                Hospitals       Prohibits new physician-owned limited service hospitals      from having any ownership or investment interest by      physicians who refer Medicare or Medicaid patients to the      hospital. Confirms that the ``whole hospital'' exception      would not apply to any new physician-owned limited service      hospital effective June 8, 2005.       Physicians are generally prohibited from referring Medicare      and Medicaid patients to facilities in which they have a      financial interest, unless they have an ownership or      investment interest in the whole hospital and not merely a      subdivision of the hospital.       In 2003, Congress established that the ``whole hospital''      exception would not extend to physician-owned limited service      hospitals (hospitals that are primarily engaged in cardiac,      orthopedics or surgical care) for an 18-month period.       Allows existing physician-owned limited service hospitals      to continue operation with certain restrictions.       -$22 million / 5 years                                 PART B                DME Payment and Maintenance Fee Reforms       Part B of Medicare pays for certain pieces of durable      medical equipment (DME) under a capped rental method.      Medicare currently pays 120% of the purchase price over 15      months.       Suppliers can bill Medicare for maintenance and servicing      (usually 10% of the purchase price) 6 months after the 15      month rental period ends and once every 6 months thereafter.      Suppliers are allowed to bill even if maintenance is not      provided.       This provision would require DME rentals to be purchased      after the 13th month, which would eliminate payments for 2      months and eliminate payments for maintenance and servicing      unless otherwise necessary.       This would reduce the price Medicare pays suppliers from      120% to 105% of the purchase pnce.       -$910 million / 5 years                                 Part C       Eliminate Budget-Neutrality Modification to Risk Adjusted      Payments to Medicare Advantage Plans       This provision would codify the Administration's proposed      phase-out of its budget neutral modification that undermines      the Medicare Advantage risk-adjusted payment system.       Permits true comparisons based on health status of      beneficiaries enrolled in Medicare Advantage to beneficiaries      enrolled in fee-for-service Medicare.       Ensures that underlying BBA-mandated health status based      risk adjusted payment system will produce accurate payments      for a beneficiary with a particular health status who enrolls      in Medicare Advantage.       This provision is consistent with a June 2005 MedPAC      recommendation.       -$6.460 billion / 5 years      Eliminate Regional Medicare Advantage PPO Stabilization Fund       Repeals fund established to promote plan entry and      retention in Medicare Advantage program.       In an August 2005 Fact Sheet on the Medicare Advantage      program, the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services      indicated that the program has ``stabilized and flourished.''       As of January 1, 2006, regional Medicare Advantage plans      will be available in 21 out of the 26 Medicare Advantage      regions, indicating that plans are experiencing fewer than      anticipated challenges in entering regions.       Does not affect any other provisions to promote regional      PPOs such as risk-corridors, local PPO moratorium, essential      hospital fund, and network requirements.       This provision is consistent with a June 2005 MedPAC      recommendation.       -$5.440 billion / 5 years                             OTHER MEDICARE                          Pay for Performance       Requires the Secretary of Health and Human Services to      develop and implement value-based purchasing programs under      Medicare for acute-care hospitals, physicians and      practitioners, Medicare Advantage     plans, end-stage renal disease (ESRD) providers, home health      agencies, and to take initial steps toward value-based      purchasing for skilled nursing facilities.       Outlines the process and requirements for the development,      implementation, and updating of a Quality Measurement System      that will guide reporting and value-based purchasing      programs.       Principles for Medicare value-based purchasing include:       Building upon existing system and involving all relevant      stakeholders.       A two-phased implementation that first ties Medicare      reimbursement updates to the reporting of quality measures,      and then creates a quality pool to reward providers for      meeting certain thresholds of quality improvement and quality      attainment.       The amount of Medicare payments in the quality pool will      start at 1 % of provider payments scaling up to 2% over a 5-     year period.       Increased transparency and mandatory reporting of quality      data to ensure that beneficiaries and the public have access      to information to help them make informed health care      decisions.       -$4.510 billion / 5 years       Subtotal- Medicare Spending Reductions: -$18.637 billion /      5 years       Subtotal--Gross Spending Reductions: -$26.644 billion / 5      years                          PROGRAM IMPROVEMENTS                           MEDICAID AND SCHIP                   IMPROVED FRAUD AND ABUSE OVERSIGHT  Health Care Fraud and Abuse Control Program/Medicaid Integrity Fund       Under current law, funds from the Health Care Fraud and      Abuse Control (HCFAC) account are used by federal agencies in      their efforts to control fraud and abuse in health care      programs. Funds go to the HHS OIG and to the Department of      Justice. The additional funding provided would be used to      continue efforts to find erroneous and fraudulent uses of      Medicaid and SCHIP funding and provide an increase in audits      and evaluations of state Medicaid programs.       $403 million/5 years             PRESERVING AND IMPROVING ACCESS TO HEALTH CARE                         Family Opportunity Act       Under current law, parents of severely disabled children      who work lose Medicaid eligibility for their disabled      children if they have income and resources above the poverty      level.       The Family Opportunity Act, which has broad bipartisan      support, would allow these parents to go to work and earn      above-poverty wages while maintaining health care for their      disabled children.       Key Provisions:       Medicaid ``buy-in'' for disabled children whose family      income or resources are at or below 300% of the poverty level      ($58,050.00 for a family of four).       Funds for demonstration projects in 10 states to provide      services to Medicaid enrolled children with psychiatric      disabilities at home, instead of in an institution.       Funds for information and outreach centers to serve      families with disabled children.       Immediate access to Medicaid coverage for those children      who are ``presumed eligible'' for Supplemental Security      Income (SSI).       $872 million/5 years                      Addressing SCHIP Shortfalls       Under current law, CMS projects that as many as 23 states      are projected to experience funding shortfalls in their SCHIP      programs over the next 2 years.       Consistent with the SCHIP proposal in the President's      budget, this provision addresses SCHIP shortfalls by      redistributing a portion of these balances from states that      have SCHIP surpluses to states that have SCHIP shortfalls.       Permits states to use up to 10% of their 2006 and 2007      allotments for outreach activities.       Prohibits future SCHIP waivers for non-pregnant adults.      Provides that redistributed funds for shortfall states must      be spent on targeted low-income children in order to receive      the enhanced SCHIP-match. States that wish to use the      redistributed funds for individuals other than targeted low-     income children may do so but at their regular FMAP matching      rate.       Continues authority for certain ``qualifying states'' to      use funds for Medicaid expenses. Qualifying states include:      Connecticut, Hawaii, Maryland, Minnesota, New Hampshire, New      Mexico, Rhode Island, Tennessee, Vermont, Washington and      Wisconsin. Public Laws #108-74 and 108-27 allowed qualifying      states to use up to 20% of the state's 1998-2001 allotments      to pay for Medicaid eligible children above 150% FPL that      were part of a state's Medicaid expansion prior to enactment      of SCHIP. The 1998-2000 allotments ``expired'' in 2004. The      2001 allotments ``expired'' at the end of the FY 2005.      Therefore, currently, no spending under these provisions is      permitted.       ``Covering Kids'' which provides $25 million for fiscal      year 2006 for grants to eligible entities to conduct outreach      and enrollment efforts designed to increase enrollment and      participation of eligible children under Medicaid and SCHIP      and promote understanding of the importance of health      insurance coverage for prenatal care and children.       $205 million/5 years                 Money Follows the Person Demonstration       Provides for demonstration projects to encourage community      based services to individuals with disabilities rather than      institutional long-term care services.       This provision offers states a financial incentive to      expand the number of individuals who can receive home and      community-based services by providing an enhanced federal      match rate for the cost of service expenditures for one year      for individuals who are relocating from an institution into      the community.       Authorizes grants by HHS to states for the following      purposes:       To increase the use of home and community based services,      rather than institutional services.       Eliminate barriers that prevent or restrict the flexible      use of Medicaid funds to enable individuals to receive      support for appropriate and necessary long term services in      the settings of their choice.       To increase the ability of the State Medicaid program to      assure home and community based long term care services to      eligible individuals, who choose to transition from an      institution to a community setting.       Ensure that procedures are in place to provide quality      assurance for eligible individuals receiving Medicaid home      and community based long term care services and to provide      for continuous quality improvement in such services.       $105 million/5 years                    IMPROVED LONG TERM CARE OPTIONS               Expand Long-Term Care Partnership Program       Encourages the purchase of private long term care insurance      by providing persons who have exhausted the benefits of a      private long-term care insurance policy to access Medicaid      under different means-testing requirements. This proposal is      designed to result in savings to the Medicaid program by      delaying the need for Medicaid coverage of long term care      expenses.       Repeals the federal legislative ban on new long-term care      partnership programs to allow any state in the nation the      option of implementing a long term care insurance partnership      program.       Establishes consumer-protections consistent with National      Association of insurance Commissioner recommendations.       Requires the Secretary, in consultation with stakeholders,      to develop standards to permit reciprocity of policies across      states.       Establishes a national clearinghouse for information on      long-term care insurance policies.       $10 million/5 years                            Other Provisions       Targeted temporary relief to certain parishes in Louisiana,      counties in Mississippi and Alabama, and the state of Alaska      FMAP (Sec 6032). This section reimburses states at 100% FMAP      for any claims paid on behalf of an individual living in a      specific parish in Louisiana or county in Mississippi and      Alabama the week of August 28, 2005. This increase is      temporary, beginning on August 28, 2005 and ending on May 15,      2006. It also creates a statutory floor for the FMAP for the      state of Alaska at the 2005 FMAP level for 2006 and 2007.       $1.940 billion/5 years       Provides an adjustment to the District of Columbia's DSH      allotment reflective of actual audited base year costs that      all other Medicaid programs now use in their computation.       $100 million/5 years       Provides for podiatrists to be treated as physicians, as is      the case under Medicare. The provision expands the definition      of ``physician services'' under Medicaid to include a doctor      of podiatric medicine with respect to the functions such a      person is legally authorized to perform by the state in which      he/she practices. States would now be required to cover the      medical services of podiatrists.       $55 million/5 years       Provides for a 10-state demonstration project under which      institutions for mental diseases not publicly owned or      operated, would be eligible to receive reimbursement for      Medicaid eligible recipients between the ages of 21-64 for      the sole purpose of stabilizing an emergency medical      condition.       $30 million/5 years       Subtotal Medicaid Spending: $3.722 billion/5 years                                MEDICARE                                 PART A                        Rehabilitation 75% Rule       Sets implementation of the ``75% rule,'' which is a      criteria used to determine whether a hospital or unit      qualifies as an inpatient rehabilitation facility (IRF) and      thus for higher Medicare payments, at the 50% level through      June 30, 2007.       Allows facilities more time to comply with the 50%      threshold. Those IRFs that failed to meet the 50% compliance      will be given an additional 6 months to meet this threshold.      If after 6 months the facility remains noncompliant, the      Secretary would revoke the facility's IRF status and collect      any overpayments.       Calls for a study to identify and review the types of      patients, medical conditions and rehabilitation providers      that are unable to meet CMS' qualifications. Establishes a      rehabilitation advisory council to provide advice and      recommendations on the coverage of rehabilitation services      under Medicare.       $105 million/5 years      Extend and Improve Medicare Dependent Hospital (MDH) Program       Extends the Medicare Dependent Hospital (MDH) program,      which was created to provide financial protections to certain      rural     hospitals with less than 100 beds that have a greater than 60      percent share of Medicare patients, through 2011.       Allows hospitals the option to use 2002 base year costs, in      addition to base year costs from 1982 or 1987.       Improves the blended payment rate by raising it from 50      percent to 75 percent of the difference between prospective      payment system (PPS) payments and cost-based payments.       Removes the 12 percent disproportionate share hospital      (DSH) payment cap for qualifying hospitals.       $14 million/5 years                                 PART B                  Short Term Physician Payment Update       Physician payment updates are determined using the      Sustainable Growth Rate (SGR) formula, which is based on four      factors: .       Medicare Economic Index (MEI)       Number of beneficiaries in Fee-For-Service Medicare       Expenditures due to changes in law or regulations       Growth in real GDP per capita.       Actual spending has been higher than spending projected by      the SGR formula, which will result in negative updates for      the next six years.       Eliminating the SGR formula and adjusting payments for      inflation would cost $154.5 billion over 10 years.       This provision would provide physicians with a positive      1.0% update in 2006.       $10.8 billion/5 years                         Therapy Cap Moratorium       In 1997, the BBA created a financial cap on the amount of      money Medicare could spend per beneficiary for outpatient      therapy services.       Two caps were set at $1,500 indexed to the Medicare      Economic Index (MEI); one for physical therapy and speech      language therapy, the other for occupational therapy.       Since 1999, Congress has twice enacted a moratorium on      implementation of the therapy caps. The moratorium is set to      expire in 2006.       This provision would extend the moratorium for one year.       $710 million/5 years    Hold Harmless Payments for Rural Hospital Outpatient Departments       MedPAC has stated that rural hospitals' financial      performance under the outpatient prospective payment system      (OPPS) is expected to decline by 2006.       Hold harmless payments are targeted to rural sole community      hospitals and other rural hospitals with 100 or fewer beds.       The hold harmless policy should be extended because it      targets the specific rural hospitals most affected.       This provision would extend hold-harmless payments under      the OPPS through calendar year 2006.       This provision is consistent with a March 2005 MedPAC      recommendation.       $170 million/5 years                         ESRD Composite Update       MedPAC has found beneficiary access to care is good,      provider capacity is increasing, quality is improving, and      provider access to capital is good.       This provision would provide a 1.6% increase in the      composite rate update for 2006, consistent with the update      provided in the MMA.       ESRD facilities will be paid for quality and efficiency      starting in 2007 under the Medicare Value-Based Purchasing      Act.       $520 million/5 years               Expand Availability of PACE in Rural Areas       Establishes site development grants and a technical      assistance program for up to 15 PACE sites in rural areas.       Creates a fund to provide partial reimbursement for      incurred expenditures above a certain level.       $37 million/5 years                        International Volunteers       There are several older Americans that volunteer overseas      for programs sponsored by 501(c)(3) organizations.       During this time, volunteers are required to purchase      insurance that provides international health benefits.       Volunteers are also required to pay Medicare Part B      premiums in order to avoid future penalties and delayed      enrollment when they return to the United States.       This provision would waive the Part B late enrollment      penalty and would establish a special enrollment period for      these individuals upon their return to the United States.       $20 million/5 years    Medicare Payment Adjustment to Federal Qualified Health Centers       Federal Qualified Health Centers (FQHCs) are located in      areas where care is needed but scarce.       This provision would allow FQHCs to provide diabetes      outpatient self-management training services and medical      nutrition therapy services.       A health care professional (including registered dietician      or nutrition professional) under contract with the center can      now provide services in an FQHC.       This provision would also allow FQHCs to be eligible for      Health Care for the Homeless grants.       $40 million/5 years       Subtotal Medicare Spending: $12.916 billion/5 years .       Subtotal--Gross Spending: $16.638 billion/5 years                             Package Totals       Medicaid: Savings: -$8.007 billion;       Spending: $3.722 billion; Net: -$4.285 billion (Figures are      over five years.)
