Mr. Speaker, I want to thank my good friend for his comments and for working so well with us on these important bills, the whole package.  Mr. Speaker, I yield such time as he may consume to the distinguished gentleman from Florida (Mr. Bilirakis), the vice chairman of the Committee on Veterans' Affairs.
