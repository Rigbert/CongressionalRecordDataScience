 President, for the information of all Senators, tomorrow morning the Senate will resume consideration of S. 14, the Energy bill. There are currently two LIHEAP amendments pending to the bill, as well as the bipartisan ethanol amendment. At this time, I urge any Member who wishes to offer an amendment to the bill to contact Chairman Domenici or the ranking member of the Energy Committee so they may schedule a time for consideration of the amendment. Members should expect rollcall votes tomorrow. It is anticipated that we will be able to dispose of several energy amendments during tomorrow's session. Members will be notified when the first vote is scheduled.  For the remainder of the week, the Senate will continue the consideration of the Energy bill and complete action on the Department of Defense authorization bill. Therefore, Members should expect rollcall votes each day this week.                          ____________________
