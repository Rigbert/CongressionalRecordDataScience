J. Res. 59, the Bipartisan Budget Act of 2013, allows the chairman of the Senate Budget Committee to revise the allocations, aggregates, and levels filed on January 14, 2014, pursuant to section 111 of H.J. Res. 59, for a number of deficit-neutral reserve funds. These reserve funds were incorporated into the Bipartisan Budget Act by reference to sections of S. Con. Res. 8, the Senate-passed budget resolution for 2014. Among these sections is a reference to section 313 of S. Con. Res. 8, which establishes a deficit-neutral reserve fund for a farm bill. The authority to adjust enforceable levels in the Senate for a farm bill is contingent on that legislation not increasing the deficit over either the period of the total of fiscal years 2013 through 2018 or the period of the total of fiscal years 2013 through 2023.  I find that the conference agreement on H.R. 2642, the Agricultural Act of 2014, as reported on January 27, 2014, fulfills the conditions of the deficit-neutral reserve fund for a farm bill. Therefore, pursuant to section 114(d) of H.J. Res. 59, I am adjusting the budgetary aggregates, as well as the allocation to the Committee on Agriculture, Nutrition, and Forestry.  I ask unanimous consent that the following tables detailing the revisions be printed in the Record.  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in the Record, as follows:    BUDGETARY AGGREGATES--PURSUANT TO SECTION 111 OF THE BIPARTISAN BUDGET ACT OF 2013 AND SECTION 311 OF THE                                        CONGRESSIONAL BUDGET ACT OF 1974----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------                     $s in millions                             2014             2014-18            2014-23----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------Current Budgetary Aggregates:    Spending:..........................................
