President, I appreciate the cooperation and collaboration. I am pleased also that you are looking closely at these amendments. My position is simple. I believe the amendments are relevant. I hope we can have votes on all of them. I particularly think Senator Warner's amendment is relevant, pertinent, and important. I hope he can offer that. But it is my hope that we can bring allof the pertinent amendments up, with appropriate timing, and conclude.  As we stand now, as the rules require, there will be a cloture vote sometime tomorrow. I think I understand also that after that cloture vote, moving from the gun liability bill to any of the other provisions--energy or the Transportation bill--would require unanimous consent. That is another factor that should be considered. So I hope we can resolve this this evening.
