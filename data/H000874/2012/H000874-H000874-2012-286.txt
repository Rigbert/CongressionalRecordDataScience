I'm glad that he's in the chair. He and I have worked together because we understand what needs to be done in order to meet the fiscal crisis that confronts our country. All of us need to participate--not just our Federal employees, but all of us.  In the short term, we need to do what this bill does:  160 million people will get an extra thousand dollars that hopefully will help build our economy, create jobs, and expand opportunity for our people;  The unemployed will make sure that they've had that safety net that is critical for them and their families;  The doctors will have a short period of time to have some confidence that they will be compensated to serve Medicare patients over the next 10 months.  The only people asked to pay for that, as I said before, are Federal employees. That is why I took this 20 minutes, to say to each and every one of us in this House, first of all, Federal employees ought not to be the piggy bank out of which you pretend that we're going to be able to pay the deficit. That's wrong. It's not been recommended by any of our groups.  I've had the opportunity of working with Mr. Camp, who, in my view, is a very conscientious Member of this body. I'm glad that he's the leader. Actually, I wish Mr. Levin were the leader, because he's of my party. But since my party is not in control, I'm glad that Mr. Camp leads it, a reasonable person.  Ladies and gentlemen of this House, America must know that we all need to contribute. The Federal employee has paid $60 billion over the last 24 months, over the next 10 years already. This year, they will have their pay reduced from what the law requires another $30 billion. That's $90 billion. Forget about this bill. Forget about the highway bill which says $44 billion in additional reduction in benefits. It's $134 billion that's on the table. It hasn't passed, but it's on the table.  Let us, as conscientious Members of this Congress, as representatives of our people, come together and have a plan that does not require nickel-and-diming of Federal employees, nickel-and-diming of doctors, nickel-and-diming of Medicare patients, and nickel-and-diming of America. Let us come together and do what America knows what needs to be done.  I yield back the balance of my time.                              {time}  1110
