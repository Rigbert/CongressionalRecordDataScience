Chairman, I appreciate the gentleman from Georgia (Mr. Kingston) yielding.  Mr. Chairman, as I mentioned in my earlier remarks, I am not opposed to the gentleman's amendment but would simply point out that we are now applying an additional responsibility to the Inspector General's office and not providing any additional funds; and the fact is the funding for the Inspector General in this bill is $1.5 million less than the administration request.  The final observation I would make is obviously we are dealing with the Department of Energy. The gentleman is very concerned, as we all are, about the high price of gasoline; but I do not know whether the expertise to do the best job possible in the Department of Energy resides with the Inspector General.
