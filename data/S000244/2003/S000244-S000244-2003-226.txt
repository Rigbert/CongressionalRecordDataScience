Speaker, I move to suspend the rules and pass the bill (H.R. 1086) to encourage the development and promulgation of voluntary consensus standards by providing relief under the antitrust laws to standards development organizations with respect to conduct engaged in for the purpose of developing voluntary consensus standards, and for other purposes, as amended.  The Clerk read as follows:                               H.R. 1086       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of      the United States of America in Congress assembled,     SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.       This Act may be cited as the ``Standards Development      Organization Advancement Act of 2003''.     SEC. 2. FINDINGS.       The Congress finds the following:       (1) In 1993, the Congress amended and renamed the National      Cooperative Research Act of 1984 (now known as the National      Cooperative Research and Production Act of 1993 (15 U.S.C.      4301 et seq.)) by enacting the National Cooperative      Production Amendments of 1993 (Public Law 103-42) to      encourage the use of collaborative, procompetitive activity      in the form of research and production joint ventures that      provide adequate disclosure to the antitrust enforcement      agencies about the nature and scope of the activity involved.       (2) Subsequently, in 1995, the Congress in enacting the      National Technology Transfer and Advancement Act of 1995 (15      U.S.C. 272 note) recognized the importance of technical      standards developed by voluntary consensus standards bodies      to our national economy by requiring the use of such      standards to the extent practicable by Federal agencies and      by encouraging Federal agency representatives to participate      in ongoing standards development activities. The Office of      Management and Budget on February 18, 1998, revised Circular      A-119 to reflect these changes made in law.       (3) Following enactment of the National Technology Transfer      and Advancement Act of 1995, technical standards developed or      adopted by voluntary consensus standards bodies have replaced      thousands of unique Government standards and specifications      allowing the national economy to operate in a more unified      fashion.       (4) Having the same technical standards used by Federal      agencies and by the private sector permits the Government to      avoid the cost of developing duplicative Government standards      and to more readily use products and components designed for      the commercial marketplace, thereby enhancing quality and      safety and reducing costs.       (5) Technical standards are written by hundreds of      nonprofit voluntary consensus standards bodies in a      nonexclusionary fashion, using thousands of volunteers from      the private and public sectors, and are developed under the      standards development principles set out in Circular Number      A-119, as revised February 18, 1998, of the Office of      Management and Budget, including principles that require      openness, balance, transparency, consensus, and due process.      Such principles provide for--       (A) notice to all parties known to be affected by the      particular standards development activity,       (B) the opportunity to participate in standards development      or modification,       (C) balancing interests so that standards development      activities are not dominated by any single group of      interested persons,       (D) readily available access to essential information      regarding proposed and final standards,       (E) the requirement that substantial agreement be reached      on all material points after the consideration of all views      and objections, and       (F) the right to express a position, to have it considered,      and to appeal an adverse decision.       (6) There are tens of thousands of voluntary consensus      standards available for government use. Most of these      standards are kept current through interim amendments and      interpretations, issuance of addenda, and periodic      reaffirmation, revision, or reissuance every 3 to 5 years.       (7) Standards developed by government entities generally      are not subject to challenge under the antitrust laws.       (8) Private developers of the technical standards that are      used as Government standards are often not similarly      protected, leaving such developers vulnerable to being named      as codefendants in lawsuits even though the likelihood of      their being held liable is remote in most cases, and they      generally have limited resources to defend themselves in such      lawsuits.       (9) Standards development organizations do not stand to      benefit from any antitrust violations that might occur in the      voluntary consensus standards development process.       (10) As was the case with respect to research and      production joint ventures before the passage of the National      Cooperative Research and Production Act of 1993, if relief      from the threat of liability under the antitrust laws is not      granted to voluntary consensus standards bodies, both      regarding the development of new standards and efforts to      keep existing standards current, such bodies could be      forced to cut back on standards development activities at      great financial cost both to the Government and to the      national economy.     SEC. 3. DEFINITIONS.       Section 2 of the National Cooperative Research and      Production Act of 1993 (15 U.S.C. 4301) is amended--       (1) in subsection (a) by adding at the end the following:       ``(7) The term `standards development activity' means any      action taken by a standards development organization for the      purpose of developing, promulgating, revising, amending,      reissuing, interpreting, or otherwise maintaining a voluntary      consensus standard, or using such standard in conformity      assessment activities, including actions relating to the      intellectual property policies of the standards development      organization.       ``(8) The term `standards development organization' means a      domestic or international organization that plans, develops,      establishes, or coordinates voluntary consensus standards      using procedures that incorporate the attributes of openness,      balance of interests, due process, an appeals process, and      consensus in a manner consistent with the Office of      Management and Budget Circular Number A-119, as revised      February 10, 1998.       ``(9) The term `technical standard' has the meaning given      such term in section 12(d)(4) of the National Technology      Transfer and Advancement Act of 1995.       ``(10) The term `voluntary consensus standard' has the      meaning given such term in Office of Management and Budget      Circular Number A-119, as revised February 10, 1998.''; and       (2) by adding at the end the following:       ``(c) The term `standards development activity' excludes      the following activities:       ``(1) Exchanging information among competitors relating to      cost, sales, profitability, prices, marketing, or      distribution of any product, process, or service that is not      reasonably required for the purpose of developing or      promulgating a voluntary consensus standard, or using such      standard in conformity assessment activities.       ``(2) Entering into any agreement or engaging in any other      conduct that would allocate a market with a competitor.       ``(3) Entering into any agreement or conspiracy that would      set or restrain prices of any good or service.''.

SEC. 5. LIMITATION ON RECOVERY.       Section 4 of the National Cooperative Research and      Production Act of 1993 (15 U.S.C. 4303) is amended--       (1) in subsections (a)(1), (b)(1), and (c)(1) by inserting      ``, or for a standards development activity engaged in by a      standards development organization against which such claim      is made'' after ``joint venture'', and       (2) in subsection (e)--       (A) by inserting ``, or of a standards development activity      engaged in by a standards development organization'' before      the period at the end, and       (B) by redesignating such subsection as subsection (f), and       (3) by inserting after subsection (d) the following:       ``(e) Subsections (a), (b), and (c) shall not be construed      to modify the liability under the antitrust laws of any      person (other than a standards development organization)      who--       ``(1) directly (or through an employee or agent)      participates in a standards development activity with respect      to which a violation of any of the antitrust laws is found,       ``(2) is not a fulltime employee of the standards      development organization that engaged in such activity, and       ``(3) is, or is an employee or agent of a person who is,      engaged in a line of commerce that is likely to benefit      directly from the operation of the standards development      activity with respect to which such violation is found.''.
