Let's continue this productivity. We have a chance to do it now on this very significant bill. We had a conversation with the leadership, and I think she and I and the leadership agree that we can have some limitations on amendments. I have been over here asking for our Members to bring amendments several times now. Actually, we started this about 3 weeks ago. I don't have them in my hands yet. I would suggest since we have this tentative agreement that all amendments would go through the managers--that is, through Senator Boxer and me--that we go ahead and say they have to be germane, and if they are not in by noon on Friday, no more amendments could come in.  It seems as though we always have to have deadlines around here to get things done. I will be proposing that after I make a few remarks, and I think our Members can depend on that being a condition.  Does that sound reasonable to the Senator?
