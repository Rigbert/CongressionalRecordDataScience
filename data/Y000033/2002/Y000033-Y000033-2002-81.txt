Mr. Speaker, first, I would like to thank the gentleman from Minnesota (Mr. Oberstar) for his cooperation in reaching this compromise on H.R. 3609, the Pipeline Infrastructure Protection and Enhancement Security and Safety Act. I also would like to thank my good friend and hunting partner, the gentleman from Louisiana (Mr. Tauzin), and the gentleman from Michigan (Mr. Dingell) for their hard work in crafting a bill that both our committees can agree to.  H.R. 3609 improves safety and protects workers and residents who live near pipelines. H.R. 3609 will strengthen the training procedures of pipeline workers, and implement a tough inspection and rigorous inspection schedule of pipelines.  The bill will improve the permitting procedures that allow operators to make the repairs that will be required under rules currently being developed at the Department of Transportation.  The bill will improve the enforcement of statutes and regulations that cover pipeline and operators at facilities.  Mr. Speaker, this is a good piece of legislation, and I urge my colleagues to support the legislation.  Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.
