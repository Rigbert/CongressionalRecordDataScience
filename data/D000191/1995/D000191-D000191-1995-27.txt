Chairman, I have a parliamentary inquiry.  The CHAIRMAN pro tempore (Mr. LaHood). The gentleman will state his parliamentary inquiry.  Mr. DeFAZIO. Mr. Chairman, I have noted that repeatedly the gentleman from New York has stood up and made a rebuttal statement or a statement that does not pertain to the yielding of time or to the introduction of the next speaker. I would like to know if the rules of the House allow for that or whether or not all of those comments should be counted against his time or whether those are out of order.  The CHAIRMAN pro tempore. The Chair will state that the time that the gentleman has used has been taken off of the time that he is allowed for his time on this amendment.  Mr. DeFAZIO. I thank the Chair.
