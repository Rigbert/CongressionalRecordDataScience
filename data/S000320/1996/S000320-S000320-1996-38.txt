 President, I would like to tell all the Members that have been conferring with the majority leader that he wants us to be out of here at 9 o'clock. There are a number of amendments. We have made a lot of progress. People have come over here. I know Senator McCain is ready to move. He has been detained somewhere else. In just a few minutes he will get moving. There are others who have been called to the floor. If we are not through at 9 o'clock--which is in 2 hours and 20 minutes--the majority leader has informed me and asked me to share with everybody that we will be in session tomorrow on this bill.
