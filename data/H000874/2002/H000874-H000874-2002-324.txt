Speaker, today, we commemorate the 12th anniversary of the landmark Americans With Disabilities Act, the most sweeping civil rights legislation since the Civil Rights Act of 1964.  We do so with pride, as we measure our progress. We do so with sadness, as we mourn the recent passing of Justin Dart Jr., the ADA's ``father'' and an indefatigable soldier of justice. And we do so with deep concern, as the courts continue to issue decisions that limit the ADA's scope and undermine its intent.  Twelve years ago today, the first President Bush signed the ADA into law, hailing it as the ``world's first comprehensive declaration of equality for people with disabilities.''  As the lead House sponsor of this historic law, I knew it would not topple centuries of prejudice overnight. But I knew that, over time, it could change attitudes and change hearts, and unleash the untapped abilities of our disabled brothers and sisters.  The ADA sent an unmistakable message: It is unacceptable to discriminate against the disabled simply because they have a disability. And it is illegal.  The ADA, which enjoyed overwhelming bipartisan support, prohibits discrimination against the more than 50 million disabled Americans--in employment, in public accommodations, in transportation and in telecommunications. It recognizes that the disabled belong to the American family, and must share in all we have to offer: equality of opportunity, full participation, independent living and economic self-sufficiency.  Its first dozen years have ushered in significant change. Thousands of disabled Americans have joined the workforce, many for the first times in their lives. The ramps, curb cuts, braille signs and captioned television programs that were once novel are now ubiquitous.  However, despite such demonstrable progress, the ADA increasingly has become a legal lightning rod with courts issuing narrow interpretations that limit its scope and undermine its intent.  In its most recent term, for example, the United States Supreme Court issued a series of decisions involving the ADA, ruling against the claimant each time.  In Chevron v. Echazabal, the Court held that an employer can keep a worker from filling a job that could be harmful to the worker's own health, even though the ADA itself only allows employers to deny jobs to those who pose a ``direct threat'' to other workers.  Whether intended or not, this decision stands for the proposition that disabled Americans really cannot exercise independent judgment on what is best for them. Thus, Eehazabal perpetuates the paternalistic attitudes that the ADA sought to combat.  In another devastating blow, the Court held in Toyota Motor Manufacturing v. Williams that a worker needed to show that her condition not only affected her on the job, but also prevented or restricted her from performing ``tasks that are of central importance to most people's daily lives.'' Because the claimant in Williams had not sufficiently demonstrated how her disability limited her in performed tasks such as brushing her teeth, the Court said, she was not ``disabled'' under the ADA.  Is this really what Congress intended when it passed the ADA? That a determination of ``disability'' would require courts to examine whether claimants can brush their teeth? The answer is obviously no.  This decision has put disabled Americans who avail themselves of the law's protection in a Catch-22: They must demonstrate that their impairment is substantial enough so that it constitutes a disability under the ADA, but not so substantial that the claimant cannot do the job without a reasonable accommodation.  In other recent ADA decisions, the Supreme Court has stripped state workers of their right to sue for monetary damages for ADA violations, and held that corrective or mitigating measures such as eyeglasses or medication should be considered in determining whether an individual is ``disabled'' under the law.  The latter decisions have produced absurd results in lower courts, People with diabetes, heart conditions, mental illness and even cancer have been ruled ``too functional''--with corrective or mitigating measures--to be considered ``disabled.''  Mr. Speaker, this is clearly not what Congress intended when it passed the ADA and President Bush signed it into law. We intended the law to have broad application. In fact, any person who is disadvantaged by an employer due to a real or perceived impairment by others may bring a claim under the ADA. That's because, simply put, the point of the law is not disability; the point is discrimination.  Justin Dart Jr., the gentle giant who worked tirelessly on behalf of the ADA and the disabled throughout the world, would no doubt agree.  Perhaps best known as the father of the ADA, Justin passed away on June 22nd. For nearly five decades, he was one of the world's most courageous, passionate and effective advocates for civil and human rights.  Many called him the Martin Luther King of the disability civil rights movement. But he though of himself in more humble terms--simply as a soldier of justice. I was fortunate to call him a dear friend.  As we commemorate this 12th anniversary of the ADA today and pay tribute to a wonderful man who devoted his life to promoting justice and equality for others, let's recognize that our work is far from finished. The series of Supreme Court decisions on the ADA remind us of that, and command us to begin discussing possible legislative responses.  We have come so far in the last dozen years. And we have poured a strong foundation for our house of equality, where Americans are judged by their ability and not their disability.  Yet, the promise of the ADA remains unfulfilled today but still is within reach. It falls to us now to carry on the fight and to realize Justin Dart's vision of a revolution of empowerment. Let's not rest until the work is done.                          ____________________
