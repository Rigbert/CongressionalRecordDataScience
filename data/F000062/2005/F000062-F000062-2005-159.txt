 President, I very much concur with what my chairman has just said. In watching on television, one of the things that has come through to me is the enormous sensitivity of our military toward people's plights. What is coming back from people is: Oh, they are treating us so well. They really care.  I believe that is a real commendation for the American military, thrown into a situation for which they are not necessarily trained. After all, they are trained for war fighting. They have done amazingly. I think from the top, when General Honore went down--no nonsense, ``move that gun down''--there was no doubt who was in command. It was a true command presence and followed down through the ranks in an amazing way.  So I just want to say thank you very much to each man and woman who is down there helping people go through some of the worst days of their lives.
