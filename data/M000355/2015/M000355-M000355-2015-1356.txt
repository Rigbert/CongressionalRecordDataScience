 President, I ask unanimous consent that the Committee on Environment and Public Works be discharged from further consideration of H.R. 1075 and the Senate proceed to its immediate consideration.  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Gardner). Without objection, it is so ordered.  The clerk will report the bill by title.  The legislative clerk read as follows:       A bill (H.R. 1075) to designate the United States Customs      and Border Protection Port of Entry located at First Street      and Pan American Avenue in Douglas, Arizona, as the ``Raul      Hector Castro Port of Entry.''  There being no objection, the Senate proceeded to consider the bill.  Mr. McCONNELL. I ask unanimous consent that the bill be read a third time and passed and the motion to reconsider be considered made and laid upon the table.
