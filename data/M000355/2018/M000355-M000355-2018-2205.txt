 President, for the information of all our colleagues, the Senate will convene at 12 noon tomorrow.  My hope is that an agreement can be reached. We will be here in session tomorrow working to finally resolve the way forward. Senators should expect votes tomorrow.  I suggest the absence of a quorum.
