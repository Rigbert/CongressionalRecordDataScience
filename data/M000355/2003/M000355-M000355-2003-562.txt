 President, briefly, it has been said by Senator Lott and others that there is nothing unusual about the so-called double-tracking of issues, nothing unusual at all. The distinguished majority leader offered to our colleagues and friends on the other side an opportunity to have the four cloture votes on judges this week with no debate at all. It would have taken up no time on the Energy bill.  The fact is, this is the 18th day we have been on the Energy bill this year; that is more than any other bill. The distinguished majority leader made the right call to go to energy this week. He made the right call to try to bring to closure four of the President's distinguished nominations for the circuit court benches.  I think Senator Lott is correct. We need to, as he put it, take a deep breath, settle down here, and remember that we all came here to do the people's business. Energy is important.  I know the Majority Leader is committed to finishing this important legislation for the people of America. I hope there are a significant number of our friends on the other side of the aisle who would also like to see an Energy bill. I am confident the majority leader is going to give all of us an opportunity at some point this year to finish this bill.  I say to my friend, the Majority Leader, I think his scheduling decisions for the week were excellent, correct, and consistent with the best interests of the American people, and we support him fully in those scheduling decisions.  Mr. President, I yield the floor.
