President, I rise today to recognize the 25th anniversary of both the first White House Conference on Library and Information Services and the White House Conference on Library and Information Services Taskforce, WHCLIST, as well as to applaud a booklet, ``Libraries, Citizens & Advocacy: The Lasting Effects of Two White House Conferences on Library and Information Services,'' published by WHCLIST in honor of this occasion.  As a result of the WHCLIST conferences and efforts--which have brought together hundreds of thousands of citizen representatives and library professionals--many Americans have discovered their community libraries for the first time, hundreds of Friends of the Library groups have formed, and a cadre of committed library supporters has emerged. The conferences renewed our Nation's emphasis on libraries and have helped spur my efforts to improve libraries.  The ``Libraries, Citizens & Advocacy'' report, which assesses the outcomes of the 1979 and 1991 White House Conferences on Library and Information Services, concludes that the WHCLIST has effectively focused the attention of the profession, trustees and advocates, and elected local, State, and national officials on the conferences' resolutions and recommendations. In the past quarter of a century, many of these resolutions and recommendations have been realized.  For example, resolutions from the 1979 conference included urging libraries to play a greater role in literacy development; provide improved access for minority groups, individuals with disabilities, and other underserved populations; and serve as a community center that offers recreation, social interaction, and an independent learning center. Delegates to the 1991 conference voted the Omnibus Children and Youth Initiative as the recommendation of greatest priority, including recommendations for school libraries and children's services in public libraries, intergenerational programming, and family literacy partnerships between library and Head Start personnel.  We have made significant progress toward improving the quality of school libraries. Notably, the 1996 passage of the Library Services and Technology Act made school libraries eligible to receive Federal funds for training, networks, and statewide consortium activities, and the Improving Literacy through School Libraries program, which I authored and was included as part of the No Child Left Behind Act, restored categorical funding for school libraries.  I have been proud to lead the way on these pieces of legislation, which ensure access to library and information services for library patrons of all ages, support the training and recruitment of librarians, and help provide the resources libraries need to improve literacy skills and academic achievement. I am honored to continue in the spirit of Senator Claiborne Pell's strong leadership on library issues.  I also wish to acknowledge the immense contributions and passionate advocacy of two other leaders from my home State: Rose Ellen A. Reynolds, current WHCLIST chair, and Joan Ress Reeves, delegate to the 1979 and 1991 conferences and former WHCLIST chair.  Let us recognize the White House Conference on Library and Information Taskforce on this 25th anniversary and celebrate the role it has played in improving our communities' libraries and our Nation's literacy.                          ____________________
