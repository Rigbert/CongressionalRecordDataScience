President, I think the Senator from Idaho makes it very clear what seems to be going on now. I heard a few moments ago the majority leader's response to Senator Kennedy, saying there would be an opportunity to present amendments, to debate this bill. I would also note that prior to any other action, cloture was filed on this bill.
