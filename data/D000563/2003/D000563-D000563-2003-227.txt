The Iraqi people ought not be saddled with massive debts to countries like Saudi Arabia, some of the wealthiest countries in the world. The American taxpayer should not be told to pay for the reconstruction of Iraq, while Iraqi oil revenues are hauled off to Saudi Arabia and Kuwait.  I yield 8 minutes to my colleague from Florida, Senator Graham.
