 President, I thank my colleagues and our floor staff on both sides of the aisle who helped us. They know that Senator Isakson and I dogged them every single day, every single minute of the way until we got this done. Without their help we couldn't be here either. I will end by saying I have looked in the eyes of too many people who have lost a loved one to a product that contained asbestos because they went to work and didn't know they were being exposed. To all of those people who have stuck with us and worked with us and fought with us--some of them are here in the Senate with us today--we wouldn't be here without you and your passion. Because of that, we are changing the world to a better place.  I thank the Chair.                          ____________________
