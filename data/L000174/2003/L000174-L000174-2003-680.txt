President, I appreciate very much the distinguished majority leader trying to figure out a way to get through this impasse. It is in the tradition of majority leaders, and I have served with every majority leader since the time of Mike Mansfield. Majority leaders try to work these matters out, and I appreciate that.  I urge him, in doing so, to look at the fact that Miguel Estrada has said he is willing to discuss his papers and find a way that that could be done. I think his suggestion of a hearing where questions would be asked based on that would be very workable. But I commend the distinguished majority leader for doing what is the tradition of leaders--to try to find a way through this.
