Speaker, I just want to say what a pleasure it has been to participate in this special order with both gentlemen this evening, and to also mention that part of the reason we doubt this rescue package is simply because people like myself believe that the markets are being manipulated by those who have a great deal of power.  In Mexico, for example, we know that both the government of Mexico and our own Government knew that the peso was overvalued. We tried to get it dealt with in the NAFTA agreement itself. They tried to prop up and they did prop up the value of the peso right before the Mexican election in August, and right after the election the peso began to drop in value.  Then we had the GATT debate here in Congress, and right after GATT passed the peso went through the floor. So we know that that government manipulates the value of its money. Knowing that, we know we are now being manipulated; that much of what we see happening is being done to benefit the very same financial interests that created the overinflated peso during the 1993-1994 period. There is a lot of money on the line for many of these private interests.  My point with them is when, especially for those interests in the United States which made over a 66 percent return on their emerging market funds since 1990, you greeted those gains and profits with smiles and parties in New York and boat parties off the docks and all the things that happened with a 66 percent return, while interest rates for average American families were going up at the same time as you ate your profits, now is the time to eat your losses. The private market is a very harsh referee, but you have to accept the market, both in the ups and the downs, and not come running to the taxpayers of the United States for some type of private or public relief for private actions.  I just want to thank the gentleman for participating in this special order this evening, and to say what makes it worthwhile serving in the Congress of the United States. Though we don't always win, though we fight as hard as we know how, it is only bearable because of the people who send you here and because of the fine colleagues with whom you serve.  I would say to the gentleman from Oregon [Mr. DeFazio] and to the gentleman from Vermont [Mr. Sanders] it is only worth serving because you are here, too. It has been a pleasure to be here with you.  Mr. DeFAZIO. Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentlewoman. I thank her for her leadership, and I can assure our colleagues that this is not the last they have heard from us on this issue, either on the Mexican bailout and the new attempts by the President to end run the Congress, or the Federal Reserve and their incessant increases in interest rates driving thousands of Americans out of work.                          ____________________
