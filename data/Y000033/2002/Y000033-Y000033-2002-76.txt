Mr. Chairman, I yield myself the remaining time.  I would like to just say a couple of small things about this. I hope the gentleman from Minnesota understands what I am trying to do; I am confident he does. I hope the rest of the committee understands that FEMA separated, as proposed by the ad hoc committee, would be a disaster. The President supports my position. I believe every member of the committee other than the Committee on the Judiciary supports my position, and I ask for a ``yes'' vote on this very important document.  Much has been said tonight about who supports the firefighters the most. I will say the gentleman from Pennsylvania (Mr. Weldon) is outstanding in that arena, but I also say that the gentleman from Minnesota (Mr. Oberstar) is also outstanding in that arena; and the gentleman from Minnesota's (Mr. Oberstar) intent to keep FEMA outside of the separate agency should be admired.  I do not think it is a reality, but in saying that, if it is not outside, let us make it whole. Let us make it as one. Let us make it an entity where we know where the money is going. Let us not make it an entity that goes into another agency that has frankly misused their dollars, has not used them correctly. In fact, the GAO says that, and I think it has been raised up before that let us keep this agency intact, let us make sure it works, let us make sure our constituents can be responded to if there is a national disaster, man-made disasters, so we have somebody to turn to and they have somebody to listen to and our constituents are served.  That is all I am asking in this amendment. I urge a quick passage of this amendment.  Mr. Chairman, I yield back the balance of my time.
