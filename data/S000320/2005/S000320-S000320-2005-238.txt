 President, I rise this afternoon to speak about this amendment because I believe it is very important to our Reserve and Guard units who have been called upon to serve their country during this time of war.  This amendment is based on a bill I introduced last month with Senator Dorgan. It provides a financial safety net for the families of our service members proudly serving in our Nation's military Reserve and National Guard.  Today, our National Guard and Reserve units are being called upon, as you well know, more than ever and are being asked to serve their country in a very different way than they have in the past. The global war on terror and the high operational tempo of our military require that our Reserve components play a more active role in the total force.  These long tours and frequent activations have a profound and disruptive effect on the lives of these men and women and on the lives of their families and loved ones. Many of our reservists suffer significant loss of income when they are mobilized, forcing themto leave often higher paying civilian jobs to serve their country. Such losses can be compounded by additional family expenses associated with military activation, including the cost of long distance phone calls and the need for additional childcare. These circumstances create a serious financial burden that is extremely difficult for reservists' families to manage.  I believe we can and we should do more to alleviate the financial burden; therefore, the amendment I am discussing this afternoon would provide a completely refundable income tax credit of up to $20,000 annually to a military reservist called to active duty. The amount of the tax credit would be based upon the difference between wages paid by the reservist's civilian job and the military wages paid upon mobilization. The tax credit would be available to members of the National Guard or Ready Reserve who are serving for more than 90 days and would vary according to their length of service.  Now is the time to recognize the service and sacrifice of the men and women in the Guard and Reserves. I believe the Congress should focus on this issue. It is important to thousands of service members who are serving their country and their families who are struggling financially.  Mr. President, I recognize that the emergency supplemental before us today may not be the best place to begin a discussion about this subject, so I urge my colleagues on the Senate Armed Services Committee and the Finance Committee to not only study but to work with me and Senator Dorgan to act on this issue this year. This is very important to thousands and thousands of families in this country.  At a time when the Nation is calling our guardsmen and reservists to active duty to execute the war in Iraq, fight the war on terrorism, and to defend our homeland, I believe it is imperative that Congress recognize their vital role and acknowledge that the success of our military depends on these troops. It is not too much to ask of our Nation and, more importantly, I believe it is the right thing to do.                      Amendment No. 466, withdrawn  Mr. President, I want to withdraw my amendment because I don't think this is the proper place for it on the supplemental, but it is the proper place to begin the debate in the Senate. I ask unanimous consent to withdraw my amendment.
