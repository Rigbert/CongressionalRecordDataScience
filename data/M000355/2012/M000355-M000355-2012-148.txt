  No. 1, I understand my friend the majority leader, last night on MSNBC, said it was his intention at the beginning of the next Congress, if Democrats were in the majority, to change the rules of the Senate by a simple majority. So I want to begin by asking my friend the majority leader if his comments at the beginning of this Congress, on January 27, 2011, are no longer operative. At that time, my friend the majority leader said:       I agree that the proper way to change Senate rules is      through the procedures established in those rules, and I will      oppose any effort in this Congress or the next to change the      Senate's rules other than through the regular order.  So my first question to my friend the majority leader is: Is that statement no longer operative?
