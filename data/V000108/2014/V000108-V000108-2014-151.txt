Speaker, it is with great pleasure that I stand before you today to honor Jerry Hanas and to wish him well upon his retirement as General Manager of the Northern Indiana Commuter Transportation District. Mr. Hanas's many years of service and expertise in his field have been a remarkable asset to the community of Northwest Indiana and beyond. In honor of Jerry's retirement, a celebratory reception was held on Wednesday, November 5, 2014, at Sand Creek Country Club in Chesterton, Indiana.   Northwest Indiana's extensive transportation network earns this region's reputation for being the crossroads of America. Interstates 80, 94, 90, and 65 traverse our landscape, as do the railroad tracks servicing the Norfolk Southern, Canadian National, and CSX rail lines, connecting travelers and business interests alike from the East to West Coasts. Most notably, the South Shore Rail Line, a passenger rail service offered by the Northern Indiana Commuter Transportation District (NICTD), provides riders access to the environs of Chicago and its $500 billion economy. Under Mr. Hanas's direction, NICTD and the South Shore Rail Line have flourished.   Established in 1908, the South Shore Rail Line provided passenger service to the city of Chicago as well as to the recreational opportunities found in Northwest Indiana, given its proximity to Lake Michigan and South Bend. With the advent of the interstate system, and the newfound ability to travel between neighboring communities with ease, ridership along the South Shore Rail Line began to decline. In order to prevent the complete loss of this asset, the state of Indiana created NICTD for the sole purpose of maintaining and operating the passenger line. Jerry Hanas was hired as the General Manager of NICTD upon its creation in June 1977, and it is here where he has served the railroad for 37 years.   NICTD's success is due to Jerry's competence, hard work, and dedication to a long-term vision in which passenger rail service is improved and expanded throughout the region. He effectively coordinated NICTD's purchase of the South Shore railroad and passenger assets, resulting in a stable and reliable relationship between the passenger and freight services. This acquisition required a steadfast commitment to a series of strategic investments to ensure the line's continuation. To that end, under Jerry's leadership, since 1977, over $500 million has been dedicated to upgrading the rolling stock, stations, track, catenary, bridges, and signals associated with the line in order to enhance safety and to make much needed capacity-related track improvements.   Currently, NICTD is in the process of conducting the appropriate environmental studies as part of its effort to expand services to the suburban areas in Northwest Indiana. This expansion is a key component to capitalizing upon our region's transportation network and maximizing economic development opportunities. Although Jerry Hanas retires this fall, he leaves a completely rebuilt and vibrant South Shore Rail Line to serve as his legacy and a well-established corporate vision to keep the momentum going for future generations.   Jerry's commitment to his career and to the community of Northwest Indiana is exceeded only by his devotion to his family. He and his wonderful wife, Nancy, have a daughter, Melissa, son-in-law, Tom, and one beloved grandson, Donovan. They also have one son, Roger, whose fiancee, Annie, will be joining Jerry's exceptional family.   Mr. Speaker, I ask that you and my other distinguished colleagues join me in commending Jerry Hanas for his lifetime of leadership, service, and dedication to the Northern Indiana Commuter Transportation District. Jerry's impact on the region will be evident for generations to come, and he is worthy of the highest praise. I ask that you join me in wishing him well upon his retirement.                          ____________________
