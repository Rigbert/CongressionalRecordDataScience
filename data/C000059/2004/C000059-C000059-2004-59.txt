Speaker, I rise today to honor and pay tribute to an individual whose dedication and contributions to the community of Corona, California are exceptional. Corona, and surrounding communities, has been fortunate to have dynamic and dedicated business and community leaders who willingly and unselfishly give their time and talent and make their communities a better place to live and work. Cathy Sciortino is one of these individuals. On March 27, 2004, Cathy will be honored at the annual YMCA Ira D. ``Cal'' Calvert Distinguished Service Awards Dinner.  Cathy was born in Akron, Ohio where she attended school and graduated from Youngstown State University in Youngstown, Ohio. After graduation, she worked for May Co. Corp. in Youngstown, Ohio for eleven years as a buyer of women's ready to wear clothing. In 1985, Cathy and her husband moved to Yorba Linda, California and a year later they bought a house in Corona.  After the birth of her first child, Carly, Cathy became a stay at home mom and was very active in the school system. She joined the PTA and served on the board for 14 years. In 1995, Cathy was elected to the Corona-Norco Unified School Board and served as the president in 1997-1998 and 2002-2003. She also served as the delegate for the California School Board Association Assembly and as the Corona-Norco School Board Representative. She has also served as a chairmember on the Corona Regional Medical Center Governing Board; was a founding member of the Unity Advisory Board; the Centennial High School PTSA President; board member of the Choices for Success advisory board; and board member of the ADV advisory board.  Cathy has been the recipient of the PTA-Honorary Service Award and the Soroptimist-Woman of Distinction Award for Education.  Cathy has set a standard of excellence and commitment in his work in the community. Her tireless passion for community service has contributed immensely to the betterment of the community of Corona, California. Her involvement in the community makes me proud to call her a fellow community member, American and friend. I know that many community members are grateful for her service and salute her as she receives the Ira D. Calvert Distinguished Service Award.                          ____________________
