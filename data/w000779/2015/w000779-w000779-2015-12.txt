President, I strongly oppose the amendment that has just been described. Our colleague from Wisconsin is seeking to bring back the so-called grandfathered health plans that existed between 2010 and the end of 2013. My view is that this is something of a health care Frankenstein. All the plans that were grandfathered on December 31, 2013, and disappeared on that date would somehow be magically brought back to life by the Senator from Wisconsin. That is not the way the private health insurance market works in America. Many of the plans that were in existence on December 31, 2013, don't exist anymore. In the private market, which I support, plans change continually. Plans changed in 2014 and they changed again at the beginning of 2015.  It seems to me that what this amendment does is it distorts the private marketplace. I urge my colleagues to oppose it.
