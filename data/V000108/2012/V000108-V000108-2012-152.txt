Speaker, it is with great pleasure that I stand before you today to congratulate Saint Luke United Lutheran Church on its 100th anniversary. In honor of this momentous milestone, a celebratory reception will be held on May 19, 2012, at The Senior Center in Michigan City, Indiana. For 100 years, Saint Luke United Lutheran Church has been committed to providing spiritual guidance as well as charitable contributions to numerous organizations and individuals.  In 1912, Saint Luke English Lutheran Church was founded in Michigan City, Indiana, under Reverend Dobberstein. At the time, the people living in the area saw the need for an English-speaking Lutheran Church, so Saint Luke's began holding services at the local YMCA, as well as in one of the Sunday school classrooms at Saint Paul's Church. In 1915, the congregation, consisting of twenty families, witnessed the construction of their first church building. Later, in 1969, to accommodate the needs of the growing congregation, the current church building was erected on Coolspring Avenue in Michigan City. In 2002, Lutheran Church of the Dunes joined parishes with Saint Luke, and the church became the Saint Luke United Lutheran Church. Today, the church has an impressive membership of 112 families.  Saint Luke United Lutheran Church, under the leadership of Reverend John Mikenas, provides much support to charity organizations and has built an outstanding community outreach program. The congregation has been dedicated to serving those in need and has focused its charitable efforts in many ways including: assisting soup kitchens throughout the Michigan City area, organizing a food and warm clothing drive for the Salvation Army, and supporting the men's homeless shelter in Michigan City. Saint Luke's has also created a program for families in need of assistance with utility and medical bills, as well as another program that provides homemade soup and fruit baskets to the homebound. In addition, Saint Luke's is dedicated to the youth of the community and runs a vacation bible school during the summer months. The Saint Luke Youth Group also participates in mission trips and assists the elderly in the community.  Mr. Speaker, at this time, I ask that you and my other distinguished colleagues join me in honoring the congregation at Saint Luke United Lutheran Church for its exceptional community service ministry and in congratulating the parish on its 100th anniversary. The great work of this truly admirable congregation continues to touch the lives of countless individuals, and for their selfless service, the leadership and members at Saint Luke's are worthy of the highest praise.                          ____________________
