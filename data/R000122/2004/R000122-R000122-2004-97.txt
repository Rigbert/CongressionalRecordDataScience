President, I rise today to introduce bipartisan legislation to expand access to college. I am pleased to be joined in this effort by Senators Collins, Kennedy, and Murray.  In a year in which we are slated to reauthorize the Higher Education Act, we have had only a few hearings on the reauthorization in the HELP Committee. In these hearings and the discussions ongoing in the other body, there has been scant mention of our insufficient investment in need-based financial aid. Instead, the discussions have been dominated by proposals that will hurt, rather than help, the neediest students.  This is troubling, particularly as more and more students are being priced out of college, which shortchanges their future and that of our nation. Economic security is a necessity not just for the wealthy, but for every American. And the key to economic security is education.  An individual's climb up the economic ladder is directly related to the amount of education he or she receives. Given the strong correlation among educational attainment, employment, and wages, the cost of not going to college is just too high.  Almost a third of the growth in employment over the next decade is expected to occur in occupations that require at least a bachelor's degree. College graduates, on average, earn 60 percent more than high school graduates, while an individual with a professional degree earns almost four times what a high school graduate earns.  And yet, too many college students are under-prepared, underfinanced, and overworked. Those who make it through are saddled by nearly insurmountable loan debt. But many more cannot afford the cost of college at all.  Even though there have been gains due to the Higher Education Act, the current approach to student aid isn't alleviating the gaps between our lowest and highest income students nor is it addressing the gaps between the aid low-income students receive and the actual cost of attendance.  7 times as many students from high-income families 48 percent graduate from college by age 24 as students from low-income families 7 percent. Low-income, college-qualified high school graduates have an annual ``unmet need'' of nearly $4,000 in college expenses. Without drastic increases in need-based aid, over the next decade, according to a report by the Advisory Committee on Student Financial Assistance, 4.4 million low- and moderate-income college qualified high school graduates will not be able to pursue a four year degree full time and 2 million will not go to college at all.  A combination of factors has arisen to create this unfortunate situation, chief among them a decline in the purchasing power of the Pell Grant and sharp increases in the cost of college.  My predecessor, Senator Claiborne Pell, established what is now known as the Pell Grant in order to ensure higher education wasn't an ``unachievable dream.'' Almost one quarter of undergraduate students from colleges and universities nationwide receive a Pell Grant. It is the single largest source of grant aid for higher education funded by the Federal government.  Unfortunately, the Pell Grant's purchasing power has plummeted due to the slow growth in funding and the rapid rise of college prices. In the late 70s, the maximum grant covered 77 percent of costs at a public four-year institution. Today, the maximum Pell Grant of $4,050 covers only 41 percent.  On top of that, an estimated 60 percent of student aid is now in the form of loans and 40 percent in grants, a reversal of the distribution 20 years ago. Indeed, the average graduate has a student loan debt of $17,000. Pell Grant recipients, who represent the lowest income sectors of students, graduate with an average of $20,000 in student loan debt.  Over the last ten years, public and private 4-year college costs, tuition and fees, rose 47 percent and 42 percent, respectively, after adjusting for inflation, which is a more rapid growth rate than consumer prices. Over the last three years, since President Bush entered office, tuition has increased by 28 percent on average, even after inflation. Students have felt the bite as states have drastically cut funding for public colleges.  There is a further convergence of economic and demographic factors. In 2008, the largest number of students in our history will graduate from high school. A high percentage of these students will be from low-income, minority families, who will need student aid. At the same time, our Nation will need replacement workers as aging, college-educated baby boomers begin to retire in increasing numbers.  This crisis calls out for action. It should be a national imperative to ensure an educated citizenry and a world class workforce. Our Nation cannot afford to lose out on the countless returns from a robust education investment.  The legislation we introduce today, the ACCESS, Accessing College through Comprehensive Early outreach, State partnerships, and Simplification, Act, seeks to set our Nation back on the course that Senator Pell sought when he authored the grants later named after him in 1972.  The ACCESS Act revitalizes the Leveraging Educational Assistance Partnership (LEAP) program, which was established over thirty years ago to encourage States to play a role in helping low-income students go to college. Without this important, although extremely modest, Federal incentive, many States would never have established need-based grant programs and many States would not continue to maintain such programs.  Recognizing that LEAP can do even more to address the barriers to college access and persistence, the ACCESS Act forges a new Federal incentive for states--via higher levels of Federal match--to spur greater investments by states, colleges, businesses, and philanthropies in need-based grants for low-income students. At a time when public higher education is bearing the brunt of the fiscal crises confronting our States, we need to do more to encourage States to help low-income students attend college.  We want States to focus their energies on enhancing coordination and cohesion among Federal, State, and local programs and efforts of colleges, philanthropies, and businesses, with the goal of generating new investments in need-based aid sufficient to provide low-income students with an access and persistence grant to fill the gap in aid they face. All too often successful middle school students give up the dream of college because they think there is no way they can ever afford college. The ACCESS Act also requires States to notify low-income students beginning in middle school of their potential eligibility for student financial aid and encourages increased participation in early intervention, mentoring, and outreach programs.  The legislation is modeled after initiatives like the Rhode Island Children's Crusade in my home state and Indiana's 21st Century Scholars Program. A Lumina Foundation evaluation found that 21st Century Scholars--low-income students who receive an early notification of assistance, early intervention and support, and scholarships equivalent to the cost of in-state college tuition--were nearly 5 times more likely than non-participants to enroll in college. Indeed, successful college access programs are those that offer early intervention and mentoring services coupled with early information about estimated financial aid awards and adequate grant funding to make the dream of higher education a reality. Students participating in such programs are more financially and academically prepared, and thus more likely to enroll in college and persist to degree completion.  Our legislation also simplifies the financial aid process for low-income students. It allows more students to qualify for an Automatic-Zero Expected Family Contribution, aligning its eligibility with the standards for other Federal means-tested programs, like free school lunch, SSI, and Food Stamps. Students and families should not have to prove over and over again that they are low-income, and asking students to fill out lengthy forms when they already meet the eligibility level for Pell Grants is a burden we should ease.  In a similar vein, the legislation establishes a short, paper FAFSA-EZ application form for students qualifying for the auto-zero along with a tailored web-based system and a free telefile system for students without Internet access.  The ACCESS Act also expands college access for low-income students, in part by prohibiting a qualified education benefit, like education savings plans, from being considered as a student asset and by reducing the work penalty. The current income protection allowance levels are unrealistically low, creating a disincentive for students who work in order to pay college costs. I look forward to receiving further information on this and other problems addressed in the legislation when the Advisory Committee on Student Financial Assistance completes work on the congressionally mandated financial aid simplification study later this year.  We must act on this legislation and others to make sure that every student who works hard and plays by the rules gets the opportunity to live the American Dream.  I was pleased to work with the Advisory Committee on Student Financial Assistance, and a host of other higher education organizations and charitable foundations, including Scholarship America, on this legislation. I am also pleased that this legislation has the support of a range of higher education and student groups, including the American Association of Community Colleges, the American Association of State Colleges and Universities, the American Council on Education, the Association of American Universities, the Association of Jesuit Colleges and Universities, the Center for Law and Social Policy, the Council for Opportunity in Education, National Association for College Admission Counseling, the National Association of Independent Colleges and Universities, National Association of State Student Grant and Aid Programs, the National Association of State Universities and Land-Grant Colleges, the National Association of Student Financial Aid Administrators, the United Negro College Fund, and the United States Student Association.  I urge my colleagues to cosponsor this important legislation and work for its inclusion in the upcoming reauthorization of the Higher Education Act.  I ask unanimous consent that the text of this legislation be printed in the Record.  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the Record, as follows:                                S. 2477       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of      the United States of America in Congress assembled,     SECTION 1.
