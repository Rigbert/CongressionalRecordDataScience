 President, I am pleased today to reintroduce President Clinton's proposal, the Presidential Honors Scholarship Act of 1997. I first introduced this bill on behalf of the administration last September--and I have included a very similar proposal in my own comprehensive higher education legislation, known as the Get Ahead Act. I am honored to have the opportunity to reintroduce this measure for the President, who continues his endless efforts at improving American education and making sure that college is affordable to all Americans.  Most people are probably not familiar with Presidential Honors Scholarships, but I think many people have heard of the idea of merit scholarships. It is pretty simple. Under the bill, all students in public and private schools who graduate in the top 5 percent of their class would be designated as Presidential honors scholars and would receive a $1,000 scholarship to college. The scholarship could be used during their freshman year at the college of their choice, and the scholarship would not be used in determining eligibility for other financial aid.  I strongly support merit scholarships for two reasons. First, we need to start rewarding excellence in educational achievement. Under the leadership of President Clinton, 4 years ago Congress passed legislation that encourages States to set high academic standards for their students. This proposal builds on that idea by rewarding those students who meet those high standards. Students who work hard and succeed ought to be recognized and rewarded.  Second, by providing scholarship moneys, this bill will help thousands of students in paying for the costs of a college education, which, I might add, is becoming more and more difficult for middle-class families. I realize that $1,000 does not go a long way in paying for a public college education, not to mention the costs of a private college. But, it will be of some help, and for those who choose to go to a community college, it will pay for about two-thirds of the cost.  Mr. President, I suspect that we will be debating higher education more than once this year. There is much to be done. We need to provide a tax deduction for the costs of college. We should allow penalty-free withdrawals from Individual Retirement Accounts to pay for college. We should make permanent the employer-provided education tax exclusion. We need to expand the Pell Grant Program. And, we need to reauthorize the Higher Education Act.  In that process, however, let us not forget merit scholarships. It is not the answer, but it is part of the answer. It is a piece of the puzzle. And while some would say that it is a small piece, it plays an important role in being the one piece that rewards those students who reach for excellence.  I look forward to working with my colleagues and with President Clinton in seeing that this proposal becomes law.                                 ______                                       By
