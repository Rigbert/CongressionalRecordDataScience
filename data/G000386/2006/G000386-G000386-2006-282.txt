 President, first, I will respond to some of the things that Senator Baucus brought up in his opening statement. He complimented me in our working through this, and I always have a good working relationship with Senator Baucus. And 90 percent of the time, or maybe more, he and I are on the same side of the fence. I remind people in the Senate that on three occasions, in November and January and February, we were on the same side of the fence on this issue.  The difference between us now is related to the extension of the capital gains and dividend tax credit that was not in the Senate bill at that particular time. And since it is not in the conference report, that is one of the reasons he and I are on separate sides of the fence.  I will respond to some of the points he made on extenders because they are not in the conference report. Senator Baucus's criticism is right that they are not in this bill. They are, however, covered in a collateral agreement between tax-writing committees and congressional leadership. And on a document basis for my saying that we will be dealing with those, even though they are not in the conference report, I ask unanimous consent to have printed in the Record a joint statement on a collateral extenders agreement, that they will be in a follow-on piece of legislation that ought to be before the Senate very quickly. These are not in dispute between the House and Senate. This is a product under negotiation, but these issues are no longer under negotiation.  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in the Record, as follows:     Hon. Chuck Grassley,     Chairman,     Committee on Finance.       Today a majority of conferees signed the conference report      on H.R. 4297, the Tax Increase Prevention and Reconciliation      Act of 2005, and filed it with the House floor. Sen. Chuck      Grassley, chairman of the Committee on Finance, and chairman      of the conference committee, made the following comment on      the conference report. A detailed summary of the conference      agreement follows.   Statement of Chairman Chuck Grassley, Senate Committee on Finance    conference report on h.r. 4297, the Tax Increase Prevention and             Reconciliation Act of 2005, Tuesday, May 9, 2006       The tax relief laws extended in this conference report are      working to strengthen the economy and protect millions of      families from footing a higher tax bill because of the      Alternative Minimum Tax. Rolling back these widely-applicable      tax relief measurea would hurt the economy and mean less      take-home pay for hard-working taxpayers. By acting on this      tax reconciliation conference report, Congress will assist      small businesses, encourage the kind of investment that      creates jobs and makes our economy grow, and ensure more fair      tax treatment for middle-income families who would otherwise      be left to pay a tax intended for wealthy individuals.      Ultimately, these temporary fixes need to become permanent      law if Congress is serious about promoting economic growth      and tax fairness.       In addition to the tax reconciliation conference report,      Chairman Thomas and I have an understanding about how other      expiring tax provisions will be extended in a second tax      bill, including relief for college students paying tuition,      teachers buying supplies for their classrooms, and the      research and development of innovative ideas that benefit our      society. The items in this second tax relief bill reflect      additional tax policy priorities for both Republicans and      Democrats in Congress, and I look forward to congressional      action on the legislation as soon as possible.
