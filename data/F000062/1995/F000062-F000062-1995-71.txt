 President, I rise today to address an issue of great concern and importance to me, and I believe, to the integrity of our democratic system of Government: campaign finance reform.  I supported the legislation introduced and passed by this body in 1993, and I came back to Washington in 1995 with renewed commitment to pursuing meaningful reform of our Nation's campaign finance laws.  Mr. President, I completed in November my 10th political campaign--10 of them. Three of them were very big. One was for Governor of the State of California, and two were for the U.S. Senate.  I would like to tell you what I raised in just those three campaigns: In 1990, for Governor, $19,770,062; in 1992, $8,540,222; and in 1994, $14,407,179. That totals in three campaigns $42,231,463.  Mr. President, I am a walking, talking, case exhibit for campaign spending reform. And I would like to submit that the time has come for the Senate and the House to rally to the challenge, and produce some legislation which can reduce the impact and the need for fundraising and dollars in American political national House and Senate campaigns.  I supported the legislation introduced and passed by this body in 1993. And I came back to Washington after this last campaign really with a renewed commitment. I raised $14 million. My opponent outspent me by better than 22 to 1. That should not be the case for a U.S. Senate seat, even in a State as big as the State of California.  The bill I introduce today addresses what I believe are the areas most in need of reform: curbing the astronomical amounts of money that flood campaigns today, creating a level playing field between wealthy candidates who finance their own campaigns and candidates who cannot, and honesty in campaign advertising.  Among the bill's key provisions are:  Voluntary spending limits based on voting-age population;  Provisions relating to spending from personal funds and creating a level playing-field for their opponent; and  Disclosure requirements for political advertisements.                            spending limits  For almost 20 years now this Congress has studied and debated the issue of campaign spending reform. Last year in the Senate, we passed out a bill. It did not move forward in the House. During that time, though, spending in Senate races has increased more than 500 percent while the cost of living has roughly doubled.  The last election cycle exemplifies the absurd levels campaign spending has reached. According to the Federal Election Commission, congressional candidates in 1994 raised and spent over $724 million--the highest amount ever recorded in any election cycle in the Commission's 20-year existence.  The fundraising pressure on candidates to meet ever-growing demand is enormous. I know it firsthand. It increases with every election cycle, and it clearly discourages otherwise qualified candidates from running.  So the legislation which I put forward today is very limited and very simple. Not a lot of it is new. There are a few new twists. But it really is combining three things that were presented before that I think go to reduce spending, create that level playing field, and particularly to reduce the inordinate costs of media.  Voluntary spending limits would be based on each State's voting age population ranging from a high of $8.2 million in a State like California to a low of $1.5 million in a smaller State like Wyoming.  The rules are the same as those that were sent out by the Rules Committee in the Senate bill of last session.  In return for voluntarily controlling spending, a candidate receives a bonus. This is the carrot to go along with the voluntary limit.  In return for voluntarily controlling spending, a candidate would be entitled to receive: 30 minutes of free broadcast time, a proposal which is based on a bill Senator Dole introduced in the 102d Congress; a 50-percent discount on television time over and above the free time, and a reduced postage rate on two pieces of mail to each voting-age resident in their State.  These latter two benefits were in the bill passed by the Senate in the last Congress.  Previous spending limit proposals have been seen as pro-incumbent measures and a barrier to challengers who have to spend more money to compete against an incumbent with high name recognition.  This bill evens the playing field a little by making critical advertising time available to challengers and incumbents alike--30 minutes of broadcast time free, and the rest at half the price.  With 30 to 40 cents of every dollar raised--sometimes well over half--going to media advertising, free media time and a 50-percent broadcast discount rate will not only reduce campaign costs but will also serve as a powerful incentive for candidates to agree to voluntary spending limits.                             personal funds  This legislation, which mirrors parts of the campaign finance bill introduced by the majority leader, Senator Dole, in the last Congress, attempts to limit the ability of a wealthy candidate to buy a seat in Congress.  This is where the provisions are a little different than anything anybody has introduced prior. But let me say what they are.  Under this bill, after qualifying as a candidate for the primary, a candidate must declare if he or she intends to spend more than $250,000 of their own funds in the election. If the candidate says, Yes, I am going to spend more than $250,000 of my own money in this election, then the contribution limits on his or her opponent are raised from $1,000 to $5,000. If a candidate declares that he or she will spend more than $1 million on the race from their own pocket, then the contribution limit on his or her opponents are removed entirely.  As with my case, where somebody came forward and said, I will spend $30 million of my own--that still is disbelief to me to even say that huge amount of my own money on this race--there is no way, no matter how proven a fundraiser you are, that you can compete with that amount of money. This would enable an individual to compete because the spending limits are off of them.  I believe this requirement will minimize the advantage of enormous personal wealth in campaigns, while maximizing the opponent's time to pursue a campaign on the issues, rather than being caught in a quicksand of fundraising.  Let me speak for a moment about honesty in campaign advertising, which I really did not believe that we should deal with. I really thought that, well, campaigns are freewheeling. They are rough and tumble. I participated in very hard mayoral races, rough and tumble in San Francisco. But I never saw the degree to which negative ads permeate the campaign spectrum as I did in the last campaign.  So honesty in campaign advertising is of great interest to me. I think it is critically important to the voters who are now saying, well, a pox on both their houses, and I do not believe any of them, as we restore some level of credibility and respect to the political process. Honesty will do it. Honesty in campaign ads will go a long, long way.  One issue of great concern to me and one that, I believe, is critically important to restore some level of credibility and respect to the political process, is honesty in campaign advertising. In recent years, the amount of negative advertising and personal attacks in campaign ads has exploded. And all the experts are predicting in the next set of races that it is going to get even worse. You see it beginning to start with someone who may be a probable or possible Presidential candidate even before he gets into the race.  Campaigns that rely on unchecked character assassination--with no regard for the validity or truth of the charges--have contributed to unprecedented voter cynicism and apathy.  In the 1994 campaign, negative ads, groundless attacks on character, distorted facts dragged political advertising to this new low. In my campaign, at least two televisions stations and one radio station ran a disclaimer before my opponent's ads in an attempt to absolve their station of responsibility and liability for the content of the ads and noting that the reason they ran the ads is because they were required by law to do so.  Campaign advertising has become a virtual arms race, and in some cases is based upon a deliberate strategy of alienating voters to degrees voter turnout. The result again is this public turn-off, the cynicism, the pox on both your houses, and the enormous disaffection people feel with political leaders and the political process itself.  Most of us would like but we are limited in our ability to curtail negative advertising because of first amendment considerations. We can hold candidates and campaign committees more responsible for what they do or we can individually just decide not to do it ourselves. I resolved not to do it myself, not to respond, and my poll numbers went like this. And when we did the focus groups, what we found was that the negatives blasted through and the positive credentials did not. People just did not believe them. They tend to believe the negatives, but they would not believe the positives. And that is a sad, sad case in American political affairs.  So what has happened--and I believe this is fairly typical across the United States--is campaign consultants are finding that the negative ads blast through and the positive ads do not, so the tendency on an increasing basis is to go to negative campaign advertising.  The provisions of my bill would set minimum standards for disclosure in print, on radio, and on television. The bill would require disclaimers in TV ads to appear for at least 4 seconds with a reasonable degree of color contrast between the background and the printed statement. It requires a clearly identifiable photograph or other image of the candidate if the ad is paid by a candidate or the candidate's committee by the candidate, and the statement at the end of the add by the candidate saying, ``This is Dianne Feinstein. I have approved the content of this ad.''  The thrust of this is to connect the responsibility between the consultant who does the ad and the candidate whose campaign runs the ad. After all, the candidate is eventually responsible.  The bill also would require sponsors of other advertisements such as independent campaigns to indicate in a statement that they are responsible for the veracity of the content of the ad.  Now, what is not contained in this bill? What is not contained in this bill is public financing of campaigns. It is my belief that the American people are not ready to accept public financing of campaigns. Tax dollars are hard fought for, and that situation is not going to get better; it is going to get worse. Therefore, even a checkoff for public financing of campaigns I think is unworthy of the priorities that we face as legislators.  So there is no direct public financing in this legislation.  Some have opposed spending limits as contrary to the Supreme Court's decision in Buckley versus Valeo which rejected mandatory limits unless they are imposed--for example, in exchange for public benefits. This bill attempts to strike a balance called for in that decision by making the spending limits voluntary and tying them to public benefits.  I supported initial campaign spending reform that would curb the influence of political action committees, and in the $14 million that I raised in the last campaign, about 16 percent was from political action committees. But I believe distinctions need to be made to protect small contributors who pool their resources, share information, and involve themselves in the process by supporting candidates or causes in which they believe.  A blanket ban on all political action committees in a sense throws the baby out with the bath water. I think we need to be encouraging people to be involved in politics, not discouraging them. And virtually every legal scholar I know who has examined this question believes that a complete ban is unconstitutional.  The Congressional Research Service has advised the Senate:       A complete ban on contributions and expenditures by      connected and nonconnected PAC's appears to be      unconstitutional in violation of the first amendment.  The Supreme Court has repeatedly held that campaign contributions and expenditures are a form of political speech protected by the first amendment to the United States Constitution. While the activities of some political action committees certainly need to be scrutinized, others give the small person, the ordinary person a voice in politics. They allow many people who cannot afford to make only small contributions to band together so that their voices can be heard. For those PAC's whose practices violate the letter or intent of Federal election law, the full weight of the FEC enforcement should be brought to bear. But I do not believe we should silence the voice of small contributors in our efforts to curb the influence of big special interest PAC's.  One example is the League of Conservation Voters. The average contribution to their PAC is $40. Individually, these donors cannot take out ads supporting environmental legislation or candidates. But by pooling their resources, they can purchase an ad announcing their support. Surely this is not the type of political influence that warrants an outright ban on political action committees. Yet, other legislation being considered by this body would do just that. And that is where I split.  I was encourage when President Clinton and Speaker Gingrich agreed to set up a bipartisan commission to study and perhaps finally act on campaign finance reform. But apparently that agreement seems to have since become bogged down with political baggage. This issue has been studied and studied and studied not only by this Congress for 20 years but by a bipartisan commission whose recommendations were made to the Congress in 1990.  I think it is time for Congress to act. And what we have tired to do in this legislation is take concepts that have stood the test of time, put them together in a limited package of three major areas where I believe there is a consensus in both political bodies and around which I think there can be forged no real opposition that is credible and worthy to taking these three steps as a first and meaningful step in campaign spending reform.  So I submit the legislation, and I welcome the discussion and the debate.  I thank the forbearance of the Chair, and I yield the floor.  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be printed in the Record.  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the Record, as follows:                                S. 1389       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of      the United States of America in Congress assembled,     SECTION 1.
