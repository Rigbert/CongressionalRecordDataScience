President, I was hoping to have a little bit more time, so I will cover this a little faster than I normally would. It is so critical.  I just got back from the Middle East, and I know the problems that are over there. A lot of people are saying the gas prices that are going up are a result, partially, of what is happening over there, but the real problem is a political problem.  First of all, let me talk about the commitment this administration has to cap and trade. Some people who have been around for a while can remember that way back at the Kyoto treaty I kind of led the opposition to ratifying that treaty. Later on--for the next 10 years--they tried to pass cap-and-trade legislation. Since I chaired the committee of jurisdiction at that time, we thought this was not going to work, even by the admission of the EPA. If we were to pass something such as this in the United States, it wouldn't have any effect on reducing greenhouse gases.  I still say this. Something is happening this morning in the House.
