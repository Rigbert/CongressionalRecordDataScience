 President, first of all, I want to make very clear, regarding some of the concerns that have been expressed in support of this amendment, I thought we took them into consideration 2 years ago--did take them into consideration in their policy. I think now that things are rolling out I am even more confident of what we did. So that would apply also to the issues raised here, whether or not beneficiaries have the ability to make decisions about their care, the type of plan they want to be in.  We knew beneficiaries would need to have good resources to learn about the benefits. We have, for instance, a State Health Insurance Information Program that has counselors who can provide one-on-one counseling. CMS has developed a network of community-based organizations to do the same thing. AARP is holding meetings--all over the country, I believe, but I see them noticed in our newspapers all the time. It seems like a massive number of meetings that my senior citizen constituents have gone to.  Do I think nobody could fall through the cracks? Perhaps so. But I think they would have to be people who are very isolated. I know CMS is taken through the mail, and presumably everybody has an address that gets mail. We have taken very good care to make sure people are notified through the mail. If there is one place where there might be a problem, that is the extent to which States might not have everybody in their files. But I have even been satisfied that CMS has been working on that problem for a long period of time.  So because we have thought about these things, I rise to oppose the amendment by the distinguished Senator from Washington.  When we worked on the Medicare Modernization Act, which established this drug benefit program, every State Governor wanted beneficiaries who have Medicaid and Medicare coverage, dual eligibles, to get their prescription drugs through Medicare.  Members of both sides supported this approach.
