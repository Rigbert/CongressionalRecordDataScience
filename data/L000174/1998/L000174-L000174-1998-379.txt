President, my wife and I have lived our lives in Vermont. One of the great advantages of that is the wonderful Vermonters we have gotten to know over the years.  One of our valued Vermonters is Katherine Paterson, who has just won the 1998 Hans Christian Anderson Award for her authorship of children's books.  Mrs. Paterson has written 27 children's books, and she and her husband, the Reverend John Paterson, live on Cobble Hill in Barre Town, not far from our tree farm in Middlesex, Vermont.  While I was home for Easter Break, I read a wonderful article about her in the Saturday, April 11th, Times Argus, and I ask that it be printed in the Record.  The article follows:                 [From the Times Argus, Apr. 11, 1998] Barre Author Wins Writing Award--For Katherine Paterson ``The Closest                     I'll Ever Get To A Nobel Prize''                          (By David W. Smith)       Barre Town--Author Katherine Paterson has just won what may      be the most prestigious award in her field, the Hans      Christian Ansersen Award, but that doesn't make finding a      last-minute seat on a plane to New Delhi any easier.       ``It's hard to get a ticket to India,'' she said with a      sigh, as yet another phone call interrupted her train of      thought.       Paterson, the well-known Barre author of 27 children's      books, needs to find her way to the other side of the world      by April 20 to receive the award, bestowed every two years by      the International Board on Books for Young People (IBBY). An      international jury of children's literature specialists      selects a recipient who has created a body of work important      to the genre. Paterson's work has been translated into 22      languages.       ``An award for a body of work is the best kind,'' said      Paterson. ``None of your children get neglected.''       Sitting in the parlor of her house on Cobble Hill Road,      Paterson joked about the award and the prestige that      children's authors accept in lieu of money, but also      reflected with a sense of wonder on the amount of attention      she's received in her 34-year writing career.       ``It's thrilling. I'm surprised at how thrilled I was,''      she said. ``It's the closest I'll ever get to a Nobel      Prize.''       Paterson's first attempt at serious writing was a book for      the Presbyterian Church explaining questions of religious      faith to children. ``Who Am I?'' was published in 1964, but      from there it would be a long seven years until another of      her works went to press.       ``I feel I've paid my dues,'' she said.       Working in a small corner room of her house with a single      skylight which she described as ``the room that has books all      over the floor,'' Paterson tries to rise each day and write      for a few hours before breakfast.       ``(It's when) your critical mind is lazier than your      creative mind,'' she said. ``I'm glad I have a critical mind,      it just gets in the way when you're trying to get through the      first draft.'' Paterson writes for children of all ages, but      is best known by her novels for 10-14 year-olds, like      ``Lyddie,'' The Great Gilly Hopkins,'' ``Bridge to      Terabithia,'' and ``Jip, His Story.''       ``I really am a writer for children and very happy to be a      writer for children,'' she said. ``They're your best      audience. They want your book to be the best book they ever      read.''       The recipient of many awards, Paterson has also been      subject to critical scrutiny. Her books have been singled out      as containing everything from obscenity and profanity to      religious blasphemy and have even been banished from      libraries.       Never one to shy away from difficult subject matter,      ``Lyddie,'' deals with the sexual harassment and exploitation      of mid-19th century factory girls, while ``Terabithia''      focuses on a child's grief at the death of a special friend.      Paterson said that usually it is the adults, not the young      readers, who are upset by her work.       ``(Adults) don't want to believe that children feel things      as deeply as they do,'' she said. ``They want them to stay      innocent.''       Paterson said she felt her more controversial work was      often released at the same time as other children's books      which dealt with similar topics.       ``We all breaths the same air,'' she said, ``and we all      sort of breathe in themes at the same time.''       A play based on her novel, ``The Great Gilly Hopkins,''      which was adapted by her son David, will be presented by the      Center Stage Theater Group on May 8 and 9 at the Barre Opera      House. The same play is being performed on Broadway.                          ____________________
