 Mr. DeLAY. Madam Speaker, I thank the gentleman for yielding.  Madam Speaker, the House will convene on Tuesday at 12:30 for morning hour debates and 2 p.m. for legislative business. We will consider several measures under suspension of rules. A final list of these bills will be sent to Members' offices by the end of the week. Any votes called on these measures will be rolled until 6:30 p.m. on Tuesday.  On Wednesday, the House will convene at 10 a.m. for legislative business. We may consider additional legislation under suspension of the rules, as well as H.R. 2443, the Coast Guard and Maritime Transportation Act of 2003. Next week we hope to have the conference report for H.R. 6, the Energy Policy Act for 2003 ready for consideration, as well as the Department of Defense authorization conference report. And in addition to that, there are four appropriations bills currently in conference that will be ready at any time.  Members should also be aware that we will be in session next Friday, October 31, and expect to have votes that day. Finally, I would like to make all of the Members aware that we hope the following week, the week of November 3, will be our last week of the session. We expect our first votes of that week to occur after 6:30 p.m. on Tuesday, and we anticipate having votes through Friday, November 7.  I thank the gentleman for yielding, and I will be happy to answer any questions the gentleman may have.
