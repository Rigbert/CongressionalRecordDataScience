President, I would respond to that concern in two ways. First of all, the dramatic decline in revenues is not the fault of State governments. It is a product of the lagging economy we are in, and the lingering effects of the attacks on our Nation of September 11. The States have been prudent, have taken appropriate steps, but when you have 49 States, every single State but Wyoming, struggling to close budget gaps, it is clear it is not the result of profligate spending by one or two particular States but, rather, reflects our declining economy or our lagging economy.  What we have here is a confluence of the impact of September 11 and a recession with declining revenues that have caused these budget gaps in 49 States.  A second point is, despite our best efforts, the States are still going to have to make some very painful and difficult choices. In the State of Maine, we are facing a budget gap of over $1 billion. Under our proposal, Maine would get a much welcomed $190 million. There is still a long ways to go.  Our proposal will certainly help the States avoid some of the most harmful cuts, particularly in health care, which is our greatest concern, but it certainly does not mean States are let off the hook in any way.
