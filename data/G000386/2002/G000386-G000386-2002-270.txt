 President, I rise to explain my opposition to this bill but also to point out that I voted for cloture because it is quite obvious that we have reached closure on this bill, and we might as well get to final passage and move on.  I could just as well vote yes and look like a reformer, but looking at it cynically and looking at the history of the 1974 legislation, previous reform attempts have evolved into a money machine for politics. Congress meant to reform the process in 1974, but it has been proven that legally money is going to find its way in to support political speech. I could find a way to rationalize voting yes on this bill to look like a reformer.  Still, down the road there are going to be people who are very astute at finding a way within the law to spend money in the support of political speech. Because the democratic process in the United States is so central to our way of life, there should not be any impediments whatsoever put in the way of getting political ideas adequately explored, particularly during a Presidential election. I am not going to look like a reformer. I am going to vote no on this legislation. And the reason is this: I see people get worked up about the fact that candidates spend large sums of money in their campaigns--I will use myself as an example. Every sixth year my campaign might spend roughly $2.3 million to get reelected. My campaign does. My junior partner from Iowa has generally spent about $6.5 million. But whether it is $2.5 million or $6.5 million, it is all spent to promote ideas. That is what our form of government is all about--the expression of ideas and the implementation of ideas. What is wrong with that? But to do so, I might spend, let's say, $2.3 million, to be reelected.  Now, why do people get all worked up about $2.3 million, when you watch the Super Bowl commercial on Super Bowl Sunday, and one 30-second commercial costs about $2.3 million? Are we ready to say that it is OK on one Sunday afternoon out of a year that it is OK for commercial free speech, for people to spend $2.3 million for a 30-second ad, and it is wrong for a candidate and his supporters for a whole year of an election to spend approximately that amount of money? No.  I think political speech is even more important than commercial free speech, and that we ought to do everything we can to perpetuate more political free speech than we do, instead of trying to curb it.  It is quite obvious that I think we should not pass this legislation. The American people deserve an open system--one that shines in the full light of day on campaign contributions, and that ought to be the ruling force--not the amount of money.  At the same time, we should make it easier for citizens to become engaged in the electoral process. However, the campaign finance bill before us contains fatal flaws. The one I am going to mention has been talked about so much that I almost do not need to repeat it. That is the most egregious problem with this legislation--the provision that limits the free speech of some organizations 60 days before an election. Whether it is an individual or an organization, why curb discussion of any political issue in America? Groups from across the political spectrum would be prohibited from communicating their views if they even refer to a candidate for Federal office. I don't think we should put a damper on any organization speaking at any time in the United States about political ideas, but especially 60 days before an election. Limiting political discourse at election time solves nothing and it curbs the advancement of democracy.  It also goes against the grain of one of our most fundamental rights, the right of freedom of speech. Political speech is what the authors of the Bill of Rights were talking about, although it has been expanded way beyond political speech, to even cover commercial speech.  But I also believe that the complete ban on soft money in this bill goes too far. Political parties raise this money to finance voter registration drives, get out the vote activities, and communications about issues that parties stand for. These are essential functions of a political party. They are also activities that increase voter participation.  Effective limitations on soft money are necessary to reduce real and perceived corruptions in the system, but a complete ban would undermine the role of national political parties. Who is going to fill the void in the process if we tie the hands of the parties? TheDemocrats have always relied upon labor unions to man phone banks and get people to the polls. That would not change the result of this bill. The Republicans, however, don't have an external organization to fall back on. Republicans rely on the party to build and mobilize their grassroots network. This bill takes the Republicans' organizational ability and cuts it off at the knees, but it leaves the other party untouched. They have legitimate ideas that ought to be explored, but so do we. That is hardly a balanced approach.  A big reason why soft money spending has increased in the first place is the limitations on campaign contributions by individuals. The cap on individual donations has been frozen at the same level since 1974. This made the individual contributions work less and less over the years.  I am pleased that this bill increases the individual contribution limit amount and indexes it for inflation. It is high time we put more emphasis back on individuals by individual citizens instead of corporations or unions.  On the other hand, the new prohibitions on soft money will simply cause an increase in spending on other areas. For instance, spending on issue ads can impact a campaign but is not regulated. Some have advertised the new restrictions as getting the money out of politics, but they don't get the money out of politics--or they don't get rid of the money in politics. They only shift it from one place to another.  In fact, this point is illustrated by an article that appeared in Roll Call, February 21, entitled ``House Democrats Make Plans to Circumvent Campaign Reform.'' This article described a promise that was made, apparently, by the House minority leader to a group of Democratic Members. He assured them that he would help raise money for certain outside groups aligned with the Democrats, despite the new fundraising restrictions that he supported. These groups can then turn around and use this money to run unregulated issue ads to the benefit of Democrat candidates. This example belies the contention that a soft money ban will solve the problem of money in politics.  The best method of combating the influence of money in politics is to require full disclosure of campaign donations. I don't care even if it is to the penny. We can try to regulate ethical behavior by politicians, but the surest way to cleanse the system is to let the Sun shine in. We must allow the voters to hold candidates accountable.  I have been a longtime advocate of comprehensive disclosure requirements. In fact, this bill contains several positive reforms. It increases the number of times candidates have to report contributions to the FEC, and it makes report information more accessible to the public. This bill also increases penalties for campaign finance law violations and provides for tough new sentencing guidelines. These are precisely the sorts of reforms of which we should be doing more. However, some of the purported reforms in this bill simply won't work and may even be counterproductive. I am not the only one to spot the problems in this bill.  Recent editorials in the two largest newspapers in the State of Iowa highlight many of the same concerns I have just outlined.  Many attempts were made in both the House and the Senate to fix the problems with this bill, but to no avail.  If this bill passes in its current form, I believe we will have lost an important opportunity to enact a balanced and sensible package of real reforms to our campaign finance system. Therefore, I must reluctantly vote against the final passage of this bill.  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to print several editorials and an article in the Record.  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in the Record, as follows:          [From the Cedar Rapids (IA) Gazette, Feb. 22, 2002]              Not Much ``Reform'' in Campaign Finance Bill       How much reform will actually emerge from campaign finance      legislation now being fine-tuned in Washington?       One has to wonder, given comments by Rep. Jim Nussle, R-2nd      District, to the Gazette editorial board Monday. On the      morning of its final vote, Nussle observed, he felt ``Shays-     Meehan no longer looked like Shays-Meehan.''       One provision ``that was snuck in, in the middle of the      night'' said the reforms don't apply to the 2002 election.      ``If it's so bad, and so corrupting and so illegal and so      rotten, then let's get rid of it,'' Nussle said. But that      stayed in, so that makes me suspicious.       ``The other thing that makes me suspicious is that you can      borrow against soft money. You can borrow hard money with      your soft money, and after the election, pay off your debt of      hard money, with soft money. That was another exception.''      Soft money refers to unlimited and unregulated donations to      national political parties. hard money, which falls under      federal regulation, involves contributions by individuals to      candidates or a party committee. ``Now all these parties are      going to be borrowing money,'' Nussle said.       That didn't get much attention, Nussle continued, ``because      Shays-Meehan has now become a slogan. You either vote for      Shays-Meehan or you're against campaign finance reform.''       The final version of Shays-Meehan allows either party to      build or buy a building, ``even though only one party is      going to do this,'' Nussle continued: ``You can't do that      now. You can't do any of those activities now, but they're      all made exceptions as part of this bill.''       Nussle believes in full disclosure. That's the Gazette's      long-held view. (He also said he doesn't use, raise or need      ``soft money.'')       Nussle claims to be one of only 13 in Congress who fully      disclose contributions, ``following the letter of the law.''       ``I've always thought that maybe it should be the 13 of us      who write the bill and not the other 400-500 and whatever      that would be, because, quite honestly, unless you're willing      to follow the law, you don't have much standing to complain      about the law.'' Good point.       Reform? Change? No way. This legislation is only so much      post-Enron chest-thumping--an attempt to appear to be doing      something. Money, meanwhile, will just find new routes to      intended targets. Had Congress enacted real measures to      better assure that voters know who's contributing to who, at      least then you'd have a basis on which to judge candidates.                                  ____                     [From the Des Moines Register]                     Campaign ``Reform'' Won't Work       While members of the U.S. House of Representatives engaged      in what Speaker Dennis Hastert called political      ``Armageddon'' over campaign finance last week, most      Americans were riveted by a scandal unfolding at the Winter      Olympics.       It's worth considering how the two events are alike, and      how they are different. While both politics and sports would      be ruled by merit, not money, the question is who makes the      decisions.       What drew extra attention to the Olympics was the      allegation of misconduct in the judging of the figure-skating      competition. But putting aside the issue of possible      corruption, the question is whether medals should be awarded      by a panel of judges or by applause meters. Obviously,      experts should make the call.       In the case of American-style democracy, however, the      applause meter is supposed to rule, but a lot of people      believe the meter is broken by the corrupting influence of      campaign money. Legislation designed to fix it was passed by      the House in the small hours of the morning Thursday.       But it no cure, and could make matters worse.       The Shays-Meehan campaign finance ``reform'' is advertised      as preventing ``special interests' from buying influence in      Congress. It would, among other things, ban ``soft money''      given to national political parties to evade the limits on      contributions to individual candidates.       Like previous efforts to ``reform'' campaign financing,      this one would simply channel the money into a different      pocket. Just as the post-Watergate cap on individual      contributions led to political-action committees and soft      money. Those with the will and the wallet to influence the      political process will find a way around this legislation,      too, if it becomes law.       Meanwhile, the bill adds to the already burdensome      regulatory bureaucracy that terrorizes the poor candidate who      does not have an army of lawyers and accountants to figure      out the rules. For incumbents with big treasuries, however,      there is much to like in this bill: It doubles the amount an      individual may give to a candidate for federal office, and it      would prohibit ``special interest'' groups from putting      ``attack ads'' on TV within two months of election day.       Besides raising obvious constitutional questions, this bill      is wrong in principal. If people desire to spend their own      money on a political candidate or a cause, they have that      right under the First Amendment. ``Special interest'' include      ordinary people in groups, whether it's the National Rifle      Association or the National Abortion Rights Action League.       The law stops short of banning independently wealthy      individuals from using their own money to get themselves      elected. Why shouldn't someone with the same resources be      able to put his or her money on someone else?       It is naive to believe it possible to legislate good      behavior by politicians. Instead, let the democratic applause      meter do its work: Give citizens quick and easy access to      campaign-finance reports, and if they don't like what they      see, they can boo the rascals off the ice.                                       ____                    [From Roll Call, Feb. 21, 2002]          House Dems Make Plans to Circumvent Campaign Reform                         (By Alexander Bolton)       As comprehensive campaign finance reform nears its expected      enactment, House Democratic lawmakers have already adopted      strategies for redirecting the flow of large contributions to      outside groups aligned with their party, a move they hope      will help them regain control of the Chamber.       House Minority Leader Dick Gephardt (D-Mo.) has assured      African-American members of his caucus that he will raise      money for groups such as the National Association for the      Advancement of Colored People (NAACP) and the Southwest Voter      Project to pay for their voter registration and get-out-the-     vote operations.       Reform legislation sponsored by Reps. Chris Shays (R-Conn.)      and Marty Meehan (D-Mass.) that passed the House last week      bans soft money but allows federal lawmakers to raise funds      in $20,000 increments for outside organizations as long as      those groups are ``nonpartisan.'' The loose restrictions      would allow party leaders to direct hundreds of thousands of      dollars for such groups.       Though the NAACP is officially nonpartisan, many      Republicans believe it is closely allied with the Democratic      Party. One GOP operative said Gephardt's plans are a cynical      attempt to exploit legal loop-holes for political gain.       ``It's disgusting they're crying for reform when they're      already cutting deals with tax-exempt organizations like the      NAACP that were playing politics in the 2000 election,'' said      Matt Keelan, a prominent Republican fundraiser who has      approximately 20 clients in the House.       Keelan and many other Republicans are still steamed over an      NAACP-funded ad from the 2000 campaign that reminded black      voters of the racially motivated murder of James Byrd Jr.      They feel it was an implicit attack on then-Gov. George      Bush's commitment to civil liberties, and one of the reasons      Bush garnered few votes from the black community.       Other Democrats say they will also raise funds for outside      groups to turn out the party's base on Election Day.       ``I would formulate voter education and registration      projects that would be funded by people like myself,'' said      Rep. Alcee Hastings (D-Fla.). ``We can go to all the people      that we know. There's no limit on nonprofit organizations.''       ``The Democratic Party has to do that as well,'' Hastings      added.       Gephardt pledged to raise the funds for outside groups last      week during a private meeting with Reps. Jim Clyburn (D-     S.C.), Bennie Thompson (D-Miss.), Lacy Clay (D-Mo.), Earl      Hilliard (D-Ala.) and Carolyn Cheeks Kilpatrick (D-Mich.),      who were wavering in the support for the Shays-Meehan      legislation.       A representative from the NAACP also attended the meeting.       Republicans say the ability of outside groups to continue      campaign activities on behalf of the parties is one of the      reasons Shays-Meehan is unfair.       ``The bill still does not create a level playing field,''      said Rich Bond, former chairman of the Republican Party. ``An      inherent advantage has been given to outside groups that are      predominantly Democratic.''       Clyburn, a onetime opponent who voted for the bill, said he      switched his position because of Gephardt's assurances. Clay      and Kilpatrick also voted for the bill.       However, some lawmakers were not convinced that outside      groups could replace the party's grassroots activities,      activities that will be curtailed by a soft-money ban.       ``I've been involved in too many elections in my lifetime      to leave questions unanswered to the point where I have to      just take people at their word,'' said Thompson, referring to      Gephardt's promise. ``The opportunity for [minority]      participation and the opportunity for [minorities to      participate in] elections in the South has been hard fought      for.''       ``I was not satisfied enough with what was on the table at      the time to change my vote,'' he added. ``There were not      enough specifics to give me comfort.''       Thompson's spokesman, Lanier Avant, said that state parties      do not have the resources to mobilize voters.       ``We have no confidence in the state parties to fund those      efforts,'' Lanier said. ``We need the national soft      dollars.''       ``We'll see if [Gephardt] comes through on his word to      redirect his money to the NAACP,'' he added.       Rep. Harold Ford Jr. (D-Tenn.), a supporter of Shays-Meehan      and member of the Congressional Black Caucus, said that      anxiety over minority voter turnout was unfounded.       ``I believed all along those activities would not be harmed      or undermined,'' said Ford.
