President, it would be hard to state it any better than the Senator from Nevada has. But so many of the issues we grapple with every single day on this floor--regulatory issues, issues that affect the various departments of government--when there are appeals of those issues, when there are questions of what the Departments do, they invariably go to the DC Circuit. They don't go to the U.S. Supreme Court.  The U.S. Supreme Court, as the distinguished Presiding Officer and the distinguished majority leader know, takes only a tiny percentage of cases that are appealed. But every one of these major legal issues that are appealed are heard by the DC Circuit, and it is frustrating to know there is a concerted effort on the other side to try to stop having a balance in the DC Circuit.  Every one of us as lawyers would hope we could come into a courtroom and know that if we have a good case, we would win it; and if we have a bad case, we would lose but that the cards aren't stacked against us because we are a Republican or Democrat. Because of the makeup of the DC Circuit, more and more people are getting the view--rightly or wrongly--it is stacked. The efforts of the Republican Party to block anybody else from going down there except for people they have vetted increase that impression that the court is stacked. That doesn't help the system of justice in the United States. It actually doesn't help whether you are a Republican or a Democrat because it destroys the idea of the impartiality of the courts.
