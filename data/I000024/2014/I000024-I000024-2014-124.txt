President, I wish to express my opposition to the nomination of Michelle Friedland to the Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals.  Although Ms. Friedland has a fine resume, it is not her work experience that concerns me but, rather, her views on many issues--views that should give anyone reason to question her appointment as a U.S. Circuit Court judge. Most troubling to me is Ms. Friedland's views that the International Court of Justice preempts U.S. law, despite the Supreme Court's repeated rejection of this notion. For those who don't know, the International Court of Justice is the judicial arm of the United Nations and Ms. Friedland believes decisions from this court should be binding on state courts in the U.S. I am thankful that the Supreme Court hasn't agreed with her and I'm fearful that her appointment to the Ninth Circuit will give her the opportunity to surrender U.S. sovereignty to foreign courts and international law.  Another reason we, as legislators, should oppose Ms. Friedland is that she has expressed views that indicate judges are free to legislate from the bench. As we all learn in grade school, the legislative branch creates the laws, the executive branch enforces them, and the judicial branch interprets them. Despite this, Ms. Friedland believes laws have no force unless a judge says they do. So when legislators, elected by the people, pass a law or a constitution is amended, the new law has no power until a judge deems it enforceable and a constitution, state or U.S., does not create any rights unless the judiciary says it does. This is a dangerous notion that tells me that Ms. Friedland is likely to only enforce laws and constitutional rights with which she agrees.  It is for these reasons that I am opposed to this nomination.
