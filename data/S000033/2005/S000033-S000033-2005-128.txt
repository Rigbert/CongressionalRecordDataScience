 Chairman, I yield myself such time as I may consume.  This amendment is supported by the American Library Association, the American Booksellers Association. Seven States in America, Democrat and Republican legislatures, have gone on record expressing serious concerns about the PATRIOT Act. And hundreds of thousands of Americans, hundreds of thousands, have written Members of Congress about this issue.  Mr. Chairman, all of us and all Americans grieve the horror of 9/11 and the deaths of thousands of our fellow citizens. And every Member of this Congress is on record pledged to do everything he or she can to defend the American people from another terrorist attack. We have spent tens of billions of dollars, and we are prepared to spend more. But, Mr. Chairman, the reason that conservatives and progressives and people in between have come together is that we understand that what we are talking about is freedom; is liberty; that we can fight terrorism, we can defeat terrorism, we can protect the American people without undermining the constitutional rights that men and women have fought for, have died for, and that made us the greatest country on Earth.  Let us go forward defeating terrorism, but let us do it in a way that makes us all proud, that protects the greatest document ever written, the American Constitution. And that is what this amendment is about.  Mr. Chairman, I yield back the balance of my time.
