 President, I ask unanimous consent that the Congressional Budget Office cost estimate for S. 498, the Joseph A. De Laine Congressional Gold Medal bill, be printed in the Record.  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in the Record, as follows:                                                    U.S. Congress,                                  Congressional Budget Office,                                    Washington, DC, June 19, 2003.     Hon. Richard C. Shelby,     Chairman, Committee on Banking, Housing, and Urban Affairs,          U.S. Senate, Washington, DC.       Dear Mr. Chairman: The Congressional Budget Office has      prepared the enclosed estimate for S. 498, a bill to      authorize the President to posthumously award a gold medal on      behalf of Congress to Joseph A. De Laine in recognition of      his contributions to the nation.       If you wish further details on this estimate, we will be      pleased to provide them. The CBO staff contact is Matthew      Pickford.           Sincerely,                                              Douglas Holtz-Eakin,                                                         Director.       Enclosure     S. 498--A bill to authorize the President to posthumously          award a gold medal on behalf of Congress to Joseph A. De          Laine in recognition of his contributions to the nation       S. 709 would authorize the President to award posthumously      a gold medal to Joseph De Laine Jr. to honor Reverend Joseph      Anthony De Laine on behalf of the Congress for his civil      rights contributions to the nation. The legislation would      authorize the U.S. Mint to spend up to $30,000 to produce the      gold medal. To help recover the costs of the medal, S. 498      would authorize the Mint to strike and sell bronze duplicates      of the medal at a price that covers production costs for both      the medal and the duplicates.       Based on the costs of recent medals produced by the Mint,      CBO estimates that the bill would not significantly increase      direct spending from the U.S. Mint Public Enterprise Fund. We      estimate that the gold medal would cost about $25,000 to      produce in fiscal years 2003 and 2004, including around      $5,000 for the cost of the gold and around $20,000 for the      costs to design, engrave, and manufacture the medal. CBO      expects that the Mint would recoup little of its costs by      selling bronze duplicates to the public.       S. 498 contains no intergovernmental or private-sector      mandates as defined in the Unfunded Mandates Reform Act and      would not affect the budgets of state, local, or tribal      governments.       The CBO staff contact for this estimate is Matthew      Pickford. This estimate was approved by Peter H. Fontaine,      Deputy Assistant Director for Budget Analysis.                          ____________________
