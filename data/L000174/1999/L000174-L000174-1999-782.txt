President, I take this opportunity to briefly talk about the problem of hunger in our nation. I would also like to place into the Congressional Record two recent front-page articles from the New York Times, written by Andrew Revkin. These articles provide valuable insight into the growing demand for emergency food assistance that food banks around the country have been facing over the last couple of years.  Mr. President, as we approach the beginning of the next century, we have much to be proud of as a nation. The stock market has reached an historic 10,000 mark. We are in the midst of one of the greatest economic expansions in our nation's history. More Americans own their own homes than at any time, and we have the lowest unemployment and welfare caseloads in a generation. Not to mention the fact that for the first time in three decades, there is a surplus in the federal budget.  Yet, there are millions of Americans who go hungry every day. This is morally unacceptable. We must resolve to put an end to the pernicious occurrence of hunger in our nation. Hunger is not a Democrat or Republican issue. Hunger is a problem that all Americans should agree must be ended in our nation.  While it is true that food stamp and welfare program caseloads are dropping, hunger is not. As families try to make the transition from welfare to work, too many are falling out and being left behind. And too often, it is our youth who is feeling the brunt of this, as one out of every five people lining up at soup kitchens is a child.  Second Harvest, the nation's largest hunger relief charity, distributed more than one billion pounds of food to an estimated 26 million low-income Americans last year through their network of regional food banks. These food banks provide food and grocery products to nearly fifty thousand local charitable feeding programs--food shelves, pantries, soup kitchens and emergency shelters.  Just as demand is rising at local hunger relief agencies, too many pantries and soup kitchens are being forced to turn needy people away because the request for their services exceeds available food. Today I enter into the record stories detailing some of the problems that these local hunger relief agencies, as chronicled in the New York Times.  Last December, Peter Clavelle, Mayor of Burlington, Vermont, released the U.S. Conference of Mayors Annual Survey of Hunger and Homelessness. The Mayors reported that demand for hunger relief services grew 14 percent last year. Additionally, 21 percent of requests for emergency food are estimated to have gone unmet. This is the highest rate of unmet need byemergency food providers since the recession of the early 1990s. And this is not just a problem of the inner cities. According to the Census Bureau, hunger and poverty are growing faster in the suburbs than anywhere else in America. In my own state of Vermont, one in ten people is ``food insecure,'' according to government statistics. That is, of course, just a clinical way to say they are hungry or at risk of hunger.  Under the leadership of Deborah Flateman, the Vermont Food Bank in South Barre distributes food to approximately 240 private social service agencies throughout the state to help hungry and needy Vermonters. Just last week, the thousands of Vermonters who receive food from the Food Bank came perilously close to finding out what life would be like without its support, when the roof of the Food Bank's main warehouse collapsed. Though the warehouse was destroyed, the need for food was not, and the Vermont Food Bank is continuing its operation while being temporarily housed in a former nursing home. I applaud the efforts of Deborah and all of the workers and volunteers of the Food Bank who are persevering over this huge obstacle and are keeping food on the table for many hungry Vermonters.  The local food shelves and emergency kitchens which receive food from the Vermont Food Bank clearly are on the front-line against hunger. And what they are seeing is very disturbing--one in four seeking hunger relief is a child under the age of 17. Elderly people make up more than a third of all emergency food recipients. We cannot continue to allow so many of our youngest and oldest citizens face the prospect of hunger on a daily basis.  Perhaps the most troubling statistic about hunger in Vermont is that in 45 percent of the households that receive charitable food assistance, one or more adults are working. Nationwide, working poor households represent more than one-third of all emergency food recipients. These are people in Vermont and across the U.S. who are working, paying taxes and contributing to the economic growth of our nation, but are reaping few of the rewards.  Of the many problems that we face as a nation, hunger is one that is entirely solvable. It is my hope that my colleagues will read these articles, and that this body can then begin to take serious action during the 106th Congress, especially as we embark upon the fiscal year 2000 budget process, to end domestic hunger.  I ask that the two articles from the New York Times, dated February 26, and February 27, 1999 be printed in the Record.  The articles follow:                [From the New York Times, Feb. 27, 1999]     As Demand for Food Donations Grows, Supplies Steadily Dwindle                         (By Andrew C. Revkin)       Ron Taritas was sitting in his office on the lake front in      Chicago, phone in hand, dialing for donations. He was not      having a very good day.       As one of four full-time brokers at Second Harvest, the      country's largest nonprofit clearinghouse for donations to      soup kitchens and food pantries, Taritas has the job of      reeling in the grocery industry's castoffs--the mislabeled      cans, outdated cartons and unpopular brands that will never      make it to supermarket shelves.       But eight hours into this day, his best catch was 4,000      cases of Puffed Wheat, Raisin Bran, Honey Smacks and other      cereals. Beyond that, all he had to show for his work was 32      cases of chocolate-crunch energy bars from a warehouse in      Honolulu, 500 cases of bottled spring water from Tucson,      Ariz., and 5,000 cases of Cremora from Columbus, Ohio.       ``Some days,'' Taritas said, ``it's like catching smoke.''       These are anxious times at Second Harvest, the hub of      America's sprawling system of church-basement soup kitchens      and food pantries.       Over nearly two decades, that network has expanded to serve      more than $1 billion worth of food each year to 20 million      Americans. But now, as changes in welfare policy push many      people away from the public dole, private charity is lagging      even further behind in its efforts to feed the lengthening      lines.       Part of the problem, by the charities' account, is rising      demand on a system that was never really able to keep up in      the first place. Last year, Second Harvest calculated that it      would have to double the flow of food to supply everyone      seeking help.       But the supply side has begun to hit hard times, too. Most      troubling to the charities is the cooling of their      traditional symbiotic relationship with America's food-making      giants, in which millions of tons of surplus food products      has flowed to people in need.       From the first, the key to that relationship was the      industry's propensity for waste--and the charities' eagerness      to make it go away, gracefully. But in the streamlining      spirit of business in the late 1990's, the food makers are      simply making fewer errors. And so there is less surplus food      to pass along.       These days, a mantra of grocery manufacturers is ``zero      defects.'' Chicken not good enough for cutlets is pressed      into nuggets; scraps not good enough for nuggets are      pulverized into pet food. Sales figures from checkout      scanners are fed daily to manufacturers, allowing factories      to fine-tune their output to match demand.       And in the last few years, heaps of dented or out-of-date      cans and cartons have become the basis for an estimated $2      billion-a-year market in ``unsalable'' food. Instead of being      donated, damaged goods are exported to developing countries      or resold at sharp discounts in suburban flea markets,      unlicensed stores in rural areas or warehouse-style outlets.       Certainly, the grocery makers still turn out a lot of      surplus food. But over the last three years, after rising      steadily for more than 15 years, the donations that are the      core of Second Harvest's business have fallen 10 percent. And      while a glut of pork and the Asian economic crisis allowed      the Federal Government to kick in an unexpected burst of      unsold meat and produce last year, demand is increasingly      outstripping supply.       Although the drop is not enormous, it has already begun to      reverberate across the far-flung charity network. From Second      Harvest to the regional food banks and then down to the local      outlets, the charities have been forced to devise all manner      of new strategies to keep the food coming. They are cutting      new deals with the grocery makers. They are reaching out to      farmers and fishermen. Mainly, they are spending more of      their time and scant money chasing additional, but smaller,      donations from local sources instead of big corporations.       Some food pantries and soup kitchens remain relatively      flush. But across the country, thousands of others are      cutting hours, limiting the size and frequency of handouts,      rationing coveted items like hot dogs and peanut butter and      seeking unorthodox supplements like road-killed deer,      according to state and local surveys and Second Harvest      reports. Some are even having to turn people away.       Last year, half the food charities in New York City cut the      size of handouts at least part of the year, according to a      survey by the New York City Coalition Against Hunger, a      private group. Largely for lack of food, the coalition has      begun counseling churches and synagogues against setting up      new pantries and soup kitchens.       At the end of the emergency-food chain--the men, women and      children standing in line at the church-basement door--that      faltering flow of donations is calling into question the      notion that private charity should, and can, soften the sting      of losing public entitlements. These days, a lot of people in      the food-banking business are worrying that a system created      as a supplement to public aid is turning out to be an      increasingly ineffective substitute for it.       the charity network: source in a crisis is now a mainstay       Twenty-five years ago, the only food bank in New Jersey was      Kathleen DiChiara, a homemaker from Summit who carted canned      goods in her station wagon from food drives at churches to      people in need. Around the country, food pantries and soup      kitchens were almost unknown beyond Skid Row.       But as the deep recession of the early 1980's took hold,      followed by the budget cuts of the Reagan era, growing      numbers of people found themselves without adequate food.      Dozens, and then hundreds, of soup kitchens and food pantries      sprouted where none had been seen since the Depression.       Even so, Ms. DiChiara recalled, there was always a feeling      that the crisis would pass: Congress would restore money for      social programs; the economy would revive.       But while the economy rebounded and Congress provided      relief for the poor, the demand for food handouts grew, along      with the charity network. And by the late 1980's, people in      the food-banking business had begun to realize that they were      becoming a fixture on the American landscape--more a      secondary safety net than an emergency source of food.       Today, Ms. DiChiara runs one of the biggest food-banking      operations in the country, the Community Food Bank of New      Jersey, with a fleet of trucks that each month distributes a      million pounds of food out of a 280,000-square-foot      warehouse. New York City, which had only three dozen pantries      and soup kitchens in 1980, had 600 in 1992 and now has about      1,100. Across the nation, the food network is more than      40,000 soup kitchens and food pantries strong, with more than      3,000 paid employees and 900,000 volunteers.       Almost from the beginning, the food network formed a tight      alliance with grocery manufacturers. The charities offered a      perfect outlet, allowing manufacturers and stores to dispose      of damaged or unsold goods, cut dumping costs, gain tax      breaks and get some good publicity along the way.       Soon, the relationship was institutionalized in formal      agreements, and food company executives joined the boards of      Second Harvest and its regional food banks.       But all along, there was a queasy feeling that this cozy,      co-dependent relationship could not last. Sooner or later,      the food     bankers knew, they would begin to pay for their reliance on      the industry's prodigal past.       Soon after Thomas Debrowski became head of operations for      the Pillsbury Company in 1991, the community relations people      walked into his office in Minneapolis and presented him with      records of the regular annual donation of several million      pounds of flawed or unsold food to Second Harvest.       ``They wanted to know if we wanted to increase it,''      Debrowski recalls. ``I said, `Increase? My objective is to      give them nothing next year.' ''       To an executive charged with burnishing the bottom line, in      a business climate where everyone was on the prowl for      greater efficiencies, the idea that millions of pounds of      food was either failing inspection or going stale in      warehouses was not acceptable. And before long, like most of      the big food companies, Pillsbury instituted economies up and      down the production line.       On the line for Green Giant Niblets brand corn, where      workers once picked out discolored kernels by hand,      electronic eyes now detect the rejects, and a puff of air      blasts the offending kernel from the conveyer belt.       Shipping containers that tended to be crushed have been      redesigned.       At a Minute Maid Hi-C fruit punch plant in Wharton, N.J.,      the process has been streamlined so that the raw ingredients      arrive just 6 to 10 hours before a batch of juice is      packaged, maintaining freshness and reducing the chance of a      bad run. Where previously juice was not tested for quality      until it had been canned, continual checks are now made for      factors like sweetness, flavor, color and vitamin content      right on the assembly line.       Improvements in marketing have paralleled those in      manufacturing.       In the wasteful old days, new products were tested      according to the Darwinian laws of the marketplace: A company      would blanket the nation with the various new snack foods,      for example, knowing that some were sure to fail. Only the      fittest survived. The rest ended up in somebody's food bank.       Now, instead of ``pushing'' products out into the market,      as industry argot would have it, the focus is on having them      ``pulled'' into stores.       That means doing research to gauge consumer interests,      testing products in carefully dissected markets before      distributing them widely and tailoring production to sales.      The result is far fewer stacks of failed experiments and      formerly fashionable foods, like the oat bran cookies and      muffins that became a staple at the nation's food banks after      the fad faded in the early 90's.       Over all, what this means is that after rising steadily      until 1995, when they reached 285 million pounds, annual      donations from the big national food companies dropped to 259      million pounds in 1998.       To a certain extent, the food charities had become their      own worst enemy by making waste so identifiable, said Janet      E. Poppendieck, a Hunter College sociologist and author of a      new book, ``Sweet Charity: Emergency Food and the End of      Entitlement'' (Viking Press, 1998).       ``No firm is going to continue to put labels on jars upside      down so that there will be peanut butter at the food bank,''      she said.          `banana box deals': new competition for flawed goods       At the supermarket, the can or carton of soup or cereal      that still fails to sell, or is dented after falling off a      truck or store shelf, remains the biggest single source of      food for the charity pipeline.       Now, in a shift that has the companies and the charities      alarmed, more and more of these products are finding their      way back out to paying customers.       Over the last decade, a host of ``reclamation centers''      have evolved as a way for supermarket chains to tally damage      and charge manufacturers for losses. At the centers, leaky      packages are thrown out, and any usable products are repacked      in the rectangular cartons in which bananas are shipped. Some      are donated to Second Harvest, particularly if the      manufacturer requested that option. But, more and more, the      cans and cartons are sold, at pennies on the dollar, to      wholesalers who sell them yet again.       One recent posting on a Web site for salvaged goods, by a      Massachusetts company called I-ADA Merchandise Marketing,      made this offer: ``Eight trailer loads of food from one of      the leading department store chains in the U.S.A. All food is      in date and has been gone through to discard any unmarketable      merchandise. This is super clean merchandise. Packed in      banana boxes. All boxes are full. You will not find a      better banana box deal!!!!!''       In this trade, Second Harvest sees competition for a scarce      resource. Companies like Lipton, Campbell Soup and Quaker      Oats find themselves in a tug of war with their retailers      over control of this damaged merchandise. With brand names      they have nurtured for decades, the manufacturers fear      liability and loss of consumer loyalty if a flea market      shopper becomes ill after eating one of their products on      this largely unregulated market. For their part, the      retailers say the goods are their property to dispose of as      they wish.       So far, this emerging market has not significantly slowed      the flow of donated damaged goods to charities, but staff      members at several large food charities project that it will.      Indeed, clearly threatened by this booming trade, Second      Harvest this year said it would enter the salvage business      itself, offering to provide a secure final resting spot of      damaged goods, distributing usable items only through its      charity network and destroying anything that cannot be used.           reinventing the deal: factory runs for the hungry       Second Harvest and smaller food charities are trying a host      of other strategies as they scurry to keep goods on charity      shelves.       ``Everyone knew the charities were going to be expected to      do more now,'' Ms. DiChiara said. ``What I'm finding is that      we're expected to do more with less.''       Until two years ago, Golden Grain, a pasta maker, donated      thousands of pounds of noodles each month to the Greater      Chicago Food Depository, the second largest food bank in the      Second Harvest network. But donations fell after the company      figured out how to grind up substandard pasta and feed it      back through its machines, said the food bank's executive      director, Michael P. Mulqueen.       Ultimately, the food bank and the pasta maker came up with      a way to compensate for lost donations by running the factory      at times of low market demand to create noodles just for the      food bank, Mulqueen said. Pillsbury's Thomas Debrowski      instituted a similar practice several years ago, and Minute      Maid has begun making juice for Second Harvest. Some other      companies, like Kraft, have shifted to cash donations.       Charities are also approaching farmers to scavenge leftover      crops, conducting the Biblical ``second harvest'' for which      the national group is named. The Clinton Administration last      year announced plans for an ambitious campaign to glean some      of the mountains of imperfect produce that now go to waste      each year.       And last year, Second Harvest began distributing tons of      Pacific Northwest fish that is caught in nets but cannot be      sold because of Federal regulations controlling some fish      stocks. The program, created with Northwest Food Strategies,      a nonprofit group in Seattle, now sends frozen salmon,      halibut and other fish around the country.       As always, canned-food drives by scouting groups and      religious congregations are being employed, but they provide      a fraction of the total flow, and the assortment of goods      often does not contain the foods that are most needed--stew      or cereal and the like.       At the Neighbor to Neighbor food pantry in Greenwich,      Conn., there is a ``gourmet section,'' which recently      contained goose liver pate, lemon curd and bamboo shoots.       Over all, experience has produced a discouraging sense at      Second Harvest and other food banks that whenever they      identify a new source of food, it seems to dry up.       ``You peck away,'' said James Barone, who is in charge of      procuring supplies for Food for Survival, the main New York      city food bank. ``And it's a constant battle.''       For several years, trucks and crews from Food for Survival      have toured the Hunt's Point produce market in the Bronx each      morning after the supermarkets or other retailers have bought      their supply for the day, seeking donations of overripe      tomatoes or wilted lettuce or whatever else is left.       But the city's greengrocers appear to have noticed, and      they often now wait until the end of the morning sales      period, then offer cash, at a lower-than-usual price, for      goods that might once have found their way into the charity      system.            limits on Charity: Bare Cupboards and Saying No       At the food pantry in the basement of St. Raymond's Roman      Catholic Church in the Parkchester section of the Bronx, the      impact of the irregular flow of goods is apparent as soon as      you walk in the door.       There is the large sign on a bulletin board: ``Alert. This      food pantry is experiencing shortages. We reserve the right      to limit quantities, limit the number of visits, extend the      time between visits at any time and without prior notice.''       And there are the plastic bags of canned goods, rice and      cereal handed out to a steady stream of old people, young      women and a few young men. These days, the volunteers making      up the grocery bags have less to choose from, because of a      backlog of orders at Food for Survival.       Even basics like bread and juice are lacking lately, said      Priscilla DiNapoli, the program's paid coordinator. When the      Kellogg's Corn Flakes run out, as they inevitably do, the      workers hand out Department of Agriculture crisp rice cereal      printed with a message encouraging users to extend their      other meals with cereal.       The flow of food was not coming close to keeping pace with      rising demand, as many as 1,500 clients a month, Ms. DiNapoli      said. So last spring, instead of letting people return every      two weeks, the agency began limiting them to one visit a      month, she said. ``We just don't have the food.''                                  ____                [From the New York Times, Feb. 25, 1999]              Plunge in Use of Food Stamps Causes Concern                         (By Andrew C. Revkin)       The nation's food stamp rolls have dropped by one-third in      four years, leading to a growing concern that the decline is      caused partly by needy people's hesitance to apply for      benefits.       A vibrant economy is clearly a major reason that the number      of people using food stamps fell to fewer than 19 million      last November, from nearly 28 million people four years      earlier. But some in Congress, at the Agriculture Department,      which administer     the food stamp program, and at private poverty groups say      they feel that a significant number of people are not seeking      help even though they still lack food and are eligible.       Some officials say they believe that stringent rules      intended to put welfare recipients to work and reduce the      welfare rolls may have also discourage people from seeking      food stamps.       Some states and cities seeking to cut welfare rolls      aggressively, for example, require applicants to search a      month or more for a job before they can get benefits of any      kind. Often, official say, people in need of emergency food      aid simply walk out the door.       ``The goal was to get people off welfare programs, but      people may have failed to understand that the food stamp      program is not a welfare program,'' said Shirley R. Watkins,      the Under Secretary of Agriculture for food, nutrition and      consumer service. ``It's nutritional assistance.''       In other cases, Ms. Watkins and other officials say, it may      simply be the rising stigma surrounding public aid of all      sorts that is keeping people from applying for food aid, the      officials say.       The notion that too many people have abandoned food stamps      has caused a flurry of activity at the Agriculture      Department.       The department recently commissioned a study to understand      a simultaneous rise in the demand on private food charities      like church-basement food pantries and soup kitchens. The      goal is to determine if some of these charity seekers are      asking for handouts at private charities because they have      lost access to public food aid, agriculture officials said.       Obtaining food stamps requires a simple showing of      financial need, unlike other Federal benefits with more      stringent regulations and requirements.       Medicaid has similar broad eligibility, and it too has      recorded a similar unexplained drop in its rolls. Some      officials have said that while this drop, too, can be      attributed partly to the economy, some may also be the result      of recipients believing, inaccurately, that once they are      removed from welfare rolls, they are also ineligible for      Medicaid.       Ms. Watkins said there were indications from states like      Wisconsin that some people leaving welfare for low-wage work      are not continuing to seek food stamps that could help them      make it through the month.       Her misgivings are shared by some members of Congress from      both sides of the aisle.       It is becoming apparent that the welfare reforms of 1996      did not anticipate how tightly access to food stamps was      linked to access to welfare, said Representative Nancy L.      Johnson, Republican of Connecticut and chairwoman of the      House Ways and Means Subcommittee on Human Resources.       ``We do think there's a problem here,'' Mrs. Johnson said.      ``We need to see why state systems don't seem to capture the      food-stamp eligible population very well.       ``When you make a big change in one system it's going to      have ramifications for other systems,'' Mrs. Johnson said.      ``Some are positive. If people aren't getting food stamps      because they're making more money, that's a good thing.''       She said her committee was planning to hold hearings on the      matter this year.       So far analysts have been able to gauge only roughly how      many eligible people have left the food stamp program even      though they need the aid. Last year, for example, the      Congressional Budget Office calculated that 2.9 million such      people left the food stamp rolls from 1994 to 1997. The      budget office report, a projection of economic conditions      through 2008, proposed that the rising stigma and barriers      surrounding welfare offices could be driving eligible people      away.       Whatever the reasons, no one disputes how drastically the      program has shrunk, both in the number of people enrolled and      in the cost of providing the aid. Since 1994, the cost of the      food stamp program has fallen to $18.9 billion from $24.5      billion, according to the Agriculture Department.       But some conservative poverty analysts say the drop in food      stamp rolls does not indicate a problem. Robert Rector, who      studies welfare for the Heritage Foundation, a private group      in Washington, said the drop was simply a recovery from a      period through the early 1990's when access to food stamps      and other assistance became too easy.       ``In the late 80's and early 90's you had this notion of      one-stop shopping, getting people on as many benefits as you      could,'' Mr. Rector said.``A lot of the decline now is      hyped.''       He said that Congress would do well to make food stamps      less readily available, by instituting work requirements and      other rules similar to those already imposed on other forms      of assistance.       But Agriculture Department officials are pushing the states      to be sure their welfare offices are in line with Federal      rules, which require prompt processing of food stamp      applications.       On Jan. 29, the administrator of the food stamp program,      Samuel Chambers Jr., sent a letter to the commissioners of      welfare and food stamp program in every state urging them to      review their policies to make sure they do not violate      Federal law.       Federal officials had been particularly concerned with the      situation in New York City, where newly revamped welfare      offices, now called job centers, were delaying food stamp      applications and often directing applicants to private food      pantries instead.       After a Federal judge last month ruled that the city food      stamp process violated Federal law, the city promised to      change its practices.       In recent days, the city made another, unrelated policy      change that city officials say will trim several thousand      people from food stamp rolls. Under the 1996 package of      Federal welfare changes, single able-bodied adults can be cut      off from food stamps after three months if they do not work      at least 20 hours a week or participate in a workfare      program.       Counties can seek waivers to the work requirement if they      have high unemployment rates, and for two years the counties      in New York City had all sought the waivers, preserving the      food aid.       This year, though, the city has chosen not to seek the      waivers, so that city residents who are single and able to      work must find work or lose their food stamps, said Deborah      Sproles, a spokeswoman for the city Human Resources      Administration.       Yesterday, private groups focused on poverty issues      criticized the city's decision, saying it could put as many      as 25,000 people at risk of hunger. But, Ms. Sproles said,      ``this is part of the city's overall effort to start helping      people gain self reliance.''                          ____________________
