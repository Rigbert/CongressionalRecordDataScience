Chairman, I thank my friend for yielding. Rather than prolong the debate, I want to adapt that which has been put forward by the gentleman from Washington (Mr. Inslee) and the gentleman from Maryland (Mr. Van Hollen) in sponsoring this, and adopt the gentleman's remarks as well, and simply say that I think the gentleman from Maryland (Mr. Van Hollen) and the gentleman from Washington (Mr. Inslee) and the gentlemanfrom Washington (Mr. Dicks) have put their finger on it.                              {time}  1630  We abrogated essentially laws, statutes passed by the Congress, signed by the Presidents of the United States, without reviewing the changes that would be put before us and would impact on our Federal employees. That is all I think the sponsors are asking for the opportunity to do, and I would hope that the Members on both sides of the aisle would adopt this amendment, proceed in that fashion over the next year, and have the opportunity to review the changes that are suggested.  I thank the gentleman from Washington State, who has been a giant on behalf of Federal employees during our careers here, and I thank him for yielding.
