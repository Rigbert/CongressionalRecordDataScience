President, the legislative rider attached to the Defense appropriations conference report that would open the Arctic Wildlife Refuge to drilling gives the same two companies the Alaska Gasline Port Authority charges with colluding to withhold Alaskan gas supplies a tremendous sweetheart economic deal.  In addition to being an abuse of the legislative process, attaching this rider to the Defense appropriations bill, in my view, is bad environmental policy, bad budget policy, and most particularly bad energy policy. As a result of this rider, the Defense spending bill, which contains money critical for our troops, is getting held hostage for special interest legislation for the oil industry.
