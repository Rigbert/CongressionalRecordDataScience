Mr. Chairman, this amendment restores a relatively small amount of funding for the National Endowment for Democracy. I happen to serve as the chairman of the authorizing subcommittee. We have had extensive hearings on this. It is one of the most effective uses of our foreign aid dollars. I think we can all be very proud that Harry Wu and his Laogai Institute have been funded by NED, and it is just one example of many where we have provided scarce resources for an effective pro-democracy building effort around the world.  For this program we had authorized, let me remind Members, $34 million in the House-passed bill. The appropriators came in at $28 million. In working with the chairman, we have been able to find a compromise at $30 million. I think that $2 million additional is a very modest amount that will be used very effectively.  I also wish to commend Mr. Richardson for his amendment--for which I understand there may not be time this evening--which would have added $500,000 to NED for pro-freedom and pro-democracy programs in Burma. These programs are urgently needed, and NED is just the institution to support them. I urge NED to provide substantial funding for these projects, on at least the scale suggested by the Richardson amendment.
