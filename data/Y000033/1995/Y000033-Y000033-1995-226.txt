Mr. Chairman, if the gentleman will yield. The gentleman is correct, and I would like to thank my colleague for his efforts in this regard. The administration has agreed to hold one or more hearings before the President makes his national interest determination. The bill requires the administration to conduct an appropriate environmental review within 4 months, and the hearings will take place within this process. The public will have a formal means of making its views known directly to the administration.
