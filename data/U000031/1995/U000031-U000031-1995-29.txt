I believe that it has to be more than a consultation process, it has to be one where we can take some action. Again, I look at the gulf war. I do not believe that President Bush may have come to this body seeking our approval without that hanging over his head. He did so, and he did so admirably. He made the point and we had strong bipartisan support. Thank goodness it was the right decision for all of us to live by.  I would just suggest that perhaps we do need reform of the War Powers Act, having seen it play now for 20 some years. But I do not know that revocation is the answer. I would certainly welcome hearings before the Committee on National Security and others to look at ways that we can improve the bill rather than repeal it. I urge my colleagues to vote no.
