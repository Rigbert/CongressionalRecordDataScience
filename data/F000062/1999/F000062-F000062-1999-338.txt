 President, I rise along with my colleague from Utah, Senator Hatch, to introduce the Year 2000 Fairness and Responsibility Act. This bill, supported by more than 80 industry organizations, is especially important to California, where over 20 percent of the nation's high-tech jobs are located.  The genesis of the bill was a request by several industry groups--including the Semiconductor Industry Association (SIA), the National Association of Manufacturers (NAM), the Chamber of Commerce and the Information Technology Association of America--to develop legislation to prevent frivolous and baseless lawsuits that could jeopardize companies actually solving Y2K problems.  In concert with Senator Hatch and industry groups, a bill has been drafted that is narrow in focus and moderate in application. In developing this legislation, we have sought to solve an important problem and feel we have worked to develop a fair bill. We remain willing to address concerns with this legislation. It is a starting point, not a final piece of legislation.  This bill is a bill that will prevent frivolous and baseless litigation, but will not restrict an individual's right to sue to mitigate real damages.  Let me outline a few key provisions of the legislation.  First, this bill provides a 90-day ``cooling off period,'' during which no Y2K lawsuit may be filed and a three-step process must be followed:  A. Anyone alleging harm due to a Y2K failure must first provide written notice to the potential defendant of the problem.  B. The defendant then has 3 days to respond in writing.  C. The defendant also has 60 additional days to fix the problem.  This cooling off period is important because it allows companies to concentrate on solving the problem before suits are filed and hopefully, it will eliminate the rush to litigation that many anticipate.  Obviously, the hope is that if a company is given an opportunity to solve a Y2K problem, that company will proceed to do so with dispatch. Therefore, there will be fewer injured parties, ergo, fewer will need to file suit.  Second, the bill limits punitive damages to $250,000 or three times economic loss, whichever is greater. However, for individuals whose net worth does not exceed $500,000 or for small businesses, of fewer that 25 full-time employees, punitive damages would be limited to the lesser of $250,000 or three times economic damages.  Third, this bill provides for proportionate liability, so that a defendant would be limited to the percentage proportion of that defendant's fault in causing the alleged harm. In other words, ``no deep pockets.''  Fourth, the bill establishes requirements that the plaintiffs must allege specific harm and damages when filing suit, including the factual basis for the calculation of damages.  The bill also provides either party the opportunity to request Alternative Dispute Resolution at any time during the 90-day cooling off period provided for in this bill. If the parties agree to use Alternative Dispute Resolution and the dispute is settled, the defendant must pay the settlement in 30 days unless other arrangements are agreed to.  Sixth, the bill provides that if a contract specifically limits liability for actions that would include a Y2K action, no recovery is available beyond the contract terms. Recovery, however, is available if the contract does not mention liability limitations. Recovery is also available for any contract entered into without a true ``meeting of the minds.'' This would include contracts, for instance, between large companies and ordinary consumers. Even if the terms of use within a product box state a limit on liability, courts can award Y2K damages.  The bill also sets minimum injury requirements for class action lawsuits to prevent attorneys from gathering large numbers of plaintiffs that have not really even been harmed by a given Y2K defect.  Additionally, the bill requires that all potential class members be notified of a Y2K class action by U.S. mail, return receipt requested. That notice must include information about the nature of the action, the jurisdiction, claims that are not being pursued, and the arrangement for attorneys fees.  Ninth, the bill provides federal courts with jurisdiction over Y2K lawsuits so long as any member of the class is a citizen of a State different from the defendant (or is a citizen of a foreign country). Current law states that if any class representative of the class action is a citizen of the State in which the business is located, the federal courts have no diversity jurisdiction. This makes it easy for the attorneys filing a class action to have it heard in state court.  However, the bill does allow a federal court to abstain from exerting jurisdiction in cases where most class members are in the same State as the defendant and the case will be governed primarily by that State's law, or if the class is small or the amount in controversy is less than $1 million.  In summary, it is clear that there are consumers and businesses that have been and will be harmed by Y2K defects. For these companies and individuals impacted by Y2K problems, the Hatch-Feinstein bill preserves the right to sue and to recover damages, and actually increases their chances of finding a quick solution to their problems.  But the bill also prevents the kind of litigation nightmares that would distract from Y2K solutions and drain resources from already burdened companies throughout the country.  Mr. President, we believe that this bill represents a fair and reasoned approach to what is surely a real problem. But as I have said, this bill also represents a starting point, not an ending point. I look forward to working with my colleagues on both sides of the aisle to continue developing a fair bill that can pass in the near future. We must give businesses the reasonable protections they require to solve Y2K problems efficiently, quickly and without unnecessary distractions. I thank Senator Hatch for working with me on this issue, I urge my colleagues to contact us and to work towards a bipartisan, reasonable solution to this problem.                                 ______                                       By Mr. DeWINE (for himself, Mr. Cochran, and Mr. Voinovich):  S. 462. A bill to amend the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, the Social Security Act, the Wagner-Peyser Act, and the Federal-State Extended Unemployment Compensation Act of 1970 to improve the method by which Federal unemployment taxes are collected and to improve the method by which funds are provided from Federal unemployment tax revenue for employment security administration, and for other purposes; to the Committee on Finance.             THE EMPLOYMENT SECURITY FINANCING ACT OF 1999  Mr. DeWINE. Mr. President, I rise today, on behalf of myself and Senators Cochran and Voinovich, to introduce the ``Employment Security Financing Act of 1999.''  As you may know, our nation's employment security system was established as a federal-state partnership more than 60 years ago. This system has not undergone major restructuring since its inception; however, a ``temporary'' .2% surtax was enacted in the 1970's. Today, this system overtaxes and overburdens employers, shortchanges states, and, most importantly, underserves those who need it most--the involuntarily unemployed.  Two separate payroll taxes fund the employment security system. The most onerous and inefficient of these is the FUTA (Federal Unemployment Tax Act) tax. FUTA is a payroll tax collected by the IRS, dedicated to provide administrative funding for states through allocation from the Department of Labor (DOL). Unfortunately, FUTA taxes sent to Washington rarely find their way back to the states. In Fiscal Year 1997, DOL estimated that states sent more than $6 billion in FUTA taxes to Washington, but received only $3.1 billion in return.  Mr. President, reform of the unemployment insurance program is essential to a state like Ohio, which receives less than 39 cents of each employer FUTA dollar. This shortfall in funding has led to the closing of 22 local employment service offices during the last four years. In order to make up forthe shortfall of FUTA dollars, the Ohio legislature has appropriated more than $50 million during the last four years to pay for the administration of employment services, something that should be funded by FUTA taxes. This appropriation of state tax dollars forces Ohio taxpayers to pay twice to fund these services.  Ohio is not alone. Since 1990, less than 59 cents of every FUTA dollar has been sent back to the states. In fact, in 1997, states received a paltry 52% return on their FUTA tax dollars. As a result, many states are being forced to make up the shortfall from their own general funds, and cut back on other services provided to the unemployed.  For businesses, the system's consequences are equally severe. Employers are forced to pay two separate taxes. The current FUTA net tax rate is .8%, or a maximum of $56 per employee. In addition, employers must pay a similar state payroll tax to finance unemployment benefits. It is estimated that the nation's 6 million FUTA-paying employers spend a total of $1 billion annually simply complying with FUTA reporting requirments.  Mr. President, the Employment Security Financing Act is designed to address the problems the current system has imposed on the states and FUTA taxpayers. Specifically, it would: reduce the tax burden by repealing the ``temporary'' .2% FUTA surtax; streamline filings by transferring responsibility for collection of the FUTA tax from the IRS to the states; improve administration by ensuring that states get a greater return on their employers' FUTA tax dollars; improve services with an emphasis on reemployment; and combat fraud and abuse.  This is an important issue that Congress needs to consider. I look forward to working with others on legislation that can meet the budget rules, yet still achieve necessary reform of the unemployment insurance program.  I ask unanimous consent that letters of support from the National Federation of Independent Business, and Strategic Services on Unemployment & Workers' Compensation be printed in the Record.  There being no objection, the letters were ordered to be printed in the Record, as follows:         Strategic Services on Unemployment & Workers'            Compensation,                                Washington, DC, February 19, 1999.     Hon. Mike DeWine,     U.S. Senate, Washington, DC.       Dear Senator DeWine: On behalf of the business community,      UWC enthusiastically endorses your proposal, the Employment      Security Financing Reform Act, which will save employers $4      billion in unemployment tax and claim costs each year and      provide a permanent fix for the chronic under-funding of      state unemployment insurance (UI) and employment service      agencies. UWC is the only national association specializing      exclusively in unemployment and workers' compensation issues      on behalf of business. Our members include large and small      employers and national and state business organizations      around the country. Enactment of your proposal is a top      priority for UWC.       Only 50 cents out of each dollar now collected from      employers under the Federal Unemployment Tax (FUTA) is used      as intended for administering the state UI program. The      balance of FUTA revenue is effectively diverted to other      programs, disguising the true deficit in federal general      revenues and accumulating IOU's in a sham Unemployment      ``Trust Fund'' whose apparent buildup will later be used to      justify higher unemployment benefits--all at employer      expense. This charade would end under your proposal, which is      a win/win/win for workers, business, and government. It will      save money for employers and make government more efficient      and responsive to local needs and conditions. The proposal      achieves these results by reducing the FUTA rate and allowing      states to fund their agencies at a level closer to the amount      actually needed to administer unemployment benefits and help      match jobless workers with employers eager to fill widespread      job vacancies. It cuts paperwork for employers by eliminating      the separate FUTA tax forms; gives each state rather than      Washington responsibility to determine how much it needs to      administer its unemployment and employment services agencies;      and puts 100% of FUTA funds to work reducing state      unemployment taxes on business.       As a business organization, UWC supports adequate but not      excessive FUTA taxes. It is inexcusable that the federal      government collects more under FUTA than is needed for sound      UI administration and yet under-finances the agencies which      are responsible for efforts to move UI claimants off the      unemployment rolls and match workers with jobs. This under-     funding directly inflates the cost of state unemployment      benefits, which are financed through business payroll taxes      at the state level. It has also caused the states to impose      $200 million in additional state taxes to make up for the      shortfall in FUTA funds doled out by the federal government.      It's long past time to fix this problem, and we heartily      applaud your leadership in seeking permanent FUTA reform.           Sincerely,                                                   Eric J. Oxfeld,     President.                                  ____                                            National Federation of                                         Independent Business,                                Washington, DC, February 22, 1999.     Hon. Mike DeWine,                                      U.S. Senate, Washington, DC.       Dear Senator DeWine: On behalf of the 600,000 small      business owners of the National Federation of Independent      Business (NFIB), I want to commend you for introducing ``The      Employment Security Financing Act of 1999.'' One of our top      legislative priorities this year is to encourage Congress to      cut payroll taxes and return the unemployment system to the      states. Your legislation will ease the burden of unemployment      taxes on small business and overhaul an inefficient and      duplicative system.       Small businesses tend to be labor intensive, so they are      disproportionately affected by taxes on labor. And unlike      income taxes, payroll taxes must be paid whether a business      makes a profit or loss. Most of our members survive on a thin      margin of positive cash flow. Payroll taxes make that margin      even thinner.       Importantly, your legislation takes steps to begin reducing      the burden of one payroll tax--the Federal Unemployment Tax      Act (FUTA). Specifically, it repeals the ``temporary'' FUTA      surtax put in place in 1976 in order to repay loans from the      federal unemployment trust fund. Even though this money was      fully repaid in 1987, Congress has extended this temporary      tax four times, imposing an annual $1.4 billion tax burden on      America's employers and employees. Repeal of the surtax is      long overdue.       As this legislation progresses through Congress, we hope      that you will look for opportunities to further reduce FUTA      taxes. Even with the elimination of the surtax, FUTA taxes      collect far more than is needed for the program. In FY 1997,      the Department of Labor estimates that states received only      $3.1 billion of the $6 billion in FUTA taxes sent to      Washington. Permanent FUTA taxes should be cut to reflect the      lower costs of the program.       Finally, we support language in your legislation that      transfers responsibility for collecting the FUTA tax from the      IRS to the states. This will provide a much needed paperwork      reduction boost for small business owners who currently have      to fill our separate state and federal unemployment tax      forms.       We thank you for introducing this important legislation and      look forward to working with you in the coming months to      enact it into law.           Sincerely,                                                       Dan Danner,                            Vice President, Federal Public Policy.                                 ______                                       By
