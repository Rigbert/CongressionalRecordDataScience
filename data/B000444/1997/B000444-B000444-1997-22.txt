 President, first of all, I have two statements I wish to make, but if any of my colleagues come in and wish to begin on the amendments, I will cease at that point and not ask for all 30 minutes.  Second, Mr. President, I apologize to you and others for my gravelly voice; I have a cold, and I understand sitting in the chair can be a task. It is hard enough sometimes to listen to me, and it is even harder sometimes when I am in this condition.                          ____________________
