President, today, the Senate considers the controversial nomination of Leslie Southwick to the United States Circuit Court of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit. Unlike so many of President Clinton's nominees, Mr. Southwick was accorded a hearing on his nomination.  I refused to ambush Leslie Southwick the way Republicans ambushed Ronnie White in 1999. Thus, despite my opposition to this nomination, I made sure that Mr. Southwick was treated fairly and that his nomination was debated and voted upon by the Judiciary Committee. The process has been open and fair and the rights of every Senator Democratic or Republican have been respected.  During the Clinton administration, several outstanding nominees to the Fifth Circuit were pocket filibustered successfully by the Republicans. They included Judge Jorge Rangel of Texas, Enrique Moreno of Texas, and Alston Johnson of Louisiana. They were pocket filibustered without a hearing or committee consideration.  This is a seat on the Fifth Circuit that would have been filled long ago but for a series of troubling nominations. In the last Congress, President Bush nominated Michael Wallace to this seat, the first circuit court nomination since 1982 to receive a unanimous rating of ``not qualified'' from the American Bar Association.  This is the seat to which President Bush had previously used a recess appointment to put Charles Pickering on the bench, after his nomination was voted down by the Judiciary Committee in 2002. President Bush announced that appointment, as I recall, on the Martin Luther King Jr. holiday weekend in 2004, despite the significant concerns and open debate about that controversial nomination.  Those concerns included Judge Pickering's intervention with the Department of Justice in an attempt to get the sentence of a convicted cross burner reduced.  The nomination we consider today has engendered significant opposition. Those opposing this nomination include: the Leadership Conference on Civil Rights, the Human Rights Campaign, the Mississippi State Conference of the NAACP, the NAACP Legal Defense Fund, Lambda Legal, the National Employment Lawyers Association, the Magnolia Bar Association, the National Organization of Women, the National Urban League, the AFL-CIO, the Congressional Black Caucus, and many more.  A number of members of the Judiciary Committee spoke eloquently about their concerns and doubts during committee consideration on August 2.  I have given careful consideration to Mr. Southwick's record. Many share with me my concern about Judge Southwick's deciding vote in Richmond v. Mississippi Department of Human Services, 1998. This decision reinstated a white state social worker who had been fired for using a racial epithet what has come to be known colloquially as ``the n word'' in referring to an African-American coworker during a meeting with high-level company officials.  That epithet was called by one Fifth Circuit opinion ``a universally recognized opprobrium, stigmatizing African-Americans because of their race.'' Yet the hearing officer at her appeal before the State Employee Appeals Board suggested that the use of the racial slur ``was in effect calling the individual a 'teacher's pet.''' I am not sure any African American would consider it being called a ``teacher's pet.''  Judge Southwick provided the deciding vote to uphold the hearing officer's conclusion, the opinion he joined finding that the racial slur was ``not motivated out of racial hatred or animosity directed at her co-worker or toward blacks in general, but was, rather, intended to be a shorthand description of her perception of the relationship existing between the [co-]worker and [a] DHS supervisor.''  In dissent, two judges criticized this opinion for presenting a ``sanitized version'' of the facts and for suggesting that ``absent evidence of a near race riot, the remark is too inconsequential to serve as a basis of dismissal.'' The dissent found that this racial epithet is ``inherently offensive, and [its] use establishes the intent to offend.'' The dissent was right.  In my view, the Mississippi Supreme Court did the right thing in reversing that decision and I commend them. There is no place for ``the n word'' in the workplace or in use by a supervisor to and about an employee. None. Just as there is no place for it in this body or anywhere else. I am not naive enough not to know the word is used in parts of America, but it should be condemned by all wherever it is used, and it certainly is by me.  If, as Mr. Southwick now says, his view of the Richmond case was the narrow, technical, legalistic one that he now says justifies his providing the deciding vote to the majority opinion, he could have said so back then, in a separate opinion.  He could have noted that he felt such use of ``the n word'' was inexcusable, but that he felt constrained by his limited role on appeal to apply a standard of review that compelled him to reverse Judge Graves of the Circuit Court and reaffirm the Employee Appeals Board's reinstatement of the offending supervisor with back pay. That is not what he did, however.  In the face of a cogent dissent, he provided the deciding vote to uphold the decision excusing that remark.  Likewise I am troubled by Judge Southwick's actions in S.B. v. L.W, in which he voted to uphold a decision taking an 8-year-old child away from her biological mother due to her mother's sexual orientation and the fact that she was living with a female partner.  My concern is not just that Judge Southwick joined the majority opinion but that he went out of his way to sign on to a concurring opinion that suggested that sexual orientation is an individual ``choice'' and an individual must accept that losing the right of custody over one's child is one of the ``consequences flowing from the free exercise of such choice.''  I also have concerns about his approach in some cases involving allegations of race discrimination in jury selection, such as his opinion in a 1997 case, Brock v. Mississippi upholding a criminal conviction where the prosecution struck an African-American juror, purportedly because he lived in a high crime area.  The dissenting judge criticized Judge Southwick's opinion for accepting a strike which ``on its face appears geared toward a racially identifiable group.'' In another case involving jury discrimination, Bumphis v. State, 1996, three judges criticized Judge Southwick's majority opinion for ``establishing one level of obligation for the state, and a higher one for defendants on an identical issue.''  His legal writing also points to a narrow view of the role of the Federal courts in upholding protections against race discrimination. In one article, he found ``compelling'' a statement of a Mississippi Supreme Court Justice that ``the judiciary is not the avenue to effectuate the removal of the Confederate battle flag from public property.''  I have questions whether he would be balanced in protecting the rights of employees given the overwhelming number of cases 160 out of 180 written decisions--in which he has offered a narrow interpretation of the law to favor protecting business and corporate interests at the expense of the rights of workers and consumers.  In one 1999 case, Dubard v. Biloxi, H.M.A., Judge Southwick authored a dissent expressing the virtues of a legal doctrine that would allow employers to fire employees for any reason, even though such an analysis was not relevant in the case before him.  My concerns about his bias are heightened by a law review article he wrote characterizing litigation against tobacco companies led by former Mississippi Attorney General Michael Moore as destabilizing and posing separation of powers concerns.  As I said in opposing this nomination in committee, this is not a decision I come to lightly. I take seriously the strong support of Senator Cochran and Senator Lott whom I respect, and I have expressed my concerns directly to them as well as to the White House.  I also take seriously Mr. Southwick's answers to my questions and to those of others in connection with his hearing. I was glad to see that he now acknowledged the offensiveness of the racial epithet used in the Richmond case and also that human rights law has evolved since 2001 when he joined the decision in the child custody case.  Still, I share the deep disappointment of members of the African-American and civil rights communities that this administration continues to renege on a reported commitment to appoint an African American to the Mississippi Federal bench.  In more than 6 years, President Bush has failed to do so. He has appointed only 20 African-American judges to the Federal bench, compared to 52 African-American judges appointed by President Clinton in his first 6 years in office.  With an ever-growing number of outstanding African-American lawyers in Mississippi, the State with the highest percentage of African Americans in the country, it is not as if there is a dearthof qualified candidates. Nonetheless, President Bush has now submitted 10 nominees to the Federal bench in Mississippi, seven at the district level and three to the United States Court of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit, and none of these nominees has been African American.  Our Nation's diversity is one of its greatest strengths, and I am disappointed that the President has missed yet another opportunity to reflect this great strength in our Federal courts. Many of us believe that diversity makes America what it is. It is the diversity in our States, our courts, this body, and our families that makes us stronger.  When viewed against his record on the bench, the importance of this seat on the Fifth Circuit, and the troubling lack of diversity on that court, I am not convinced that he is the right nominee for this vacancy at this time. I shall vote no on cloture and, if it is invoked, no on this nomination.  I ask unanimous consent that letters of opposition and others be printed in the Record.  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in the Record, as follows:                                  Langrock Sperry & Wool, LLP,                                     Middlebury, VT, June 5, 2007.     Hon. Patrick J. Leahy,     Senate Russell Office Building,     Washington, DC.       Dear Pat: I understand the nomination of Leslie Southwick      to the 5th Circuit Court of Appeals is coming up for a vote      this Thursday. The little I know about Judge Southwick      absolutely frightens me. His attitude towards lesbian parents      is just totally inconsistent with Vermont philosophy and with      respect for human dignity. I also understand he has been      involved in some cases which would indicate insensitivity to      African Americans. I would certainly hope that your Committee      does not approve him.           Sincerely yours,     Peter F. Langrock.                                  ____                                             Leadership Conference                                              on Civil Rights,                                 Washington, DC, October 23, 2007.       Dear Senator: On behalf of the Leadership Conference on      Civil Rights (LCCR), the nation's oldest, largest, and most      diverse civil and human rights coalition, we write to express      our opposition to the confirmation of Leslie H. Southwick, a      former Mississippi Court of Appeals judge, to the United      States Court of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit. His record      raises too many questions about his commitment to civil and      human rights for him to be entrusted with a lifetime      appointment to the federal judiciary. We urge you to vote no      on cloture on the Southwick nomination.       The federal courts of appeal are the courts of last resort      in most federal cases. Moreover, the Fifth Circuit has the      highest percentage of minority residents of all the federal      circuits, making Judge Southwick's record on matters of civil      rights particularly important. Unfortunately, Judge      Southwick's decisions as a state court judge, along with his      hearing testimony, indicate that he favors the interests of      the powerful over the interests of minorities, working      people, and others who depend on judges to stand up for them.      This record warrants the rejection of Judge Southwick's      nomination to the Fifth Circuit.       In Richmond v. Mississippi Dep't of Human Services, Judge      Southwick joined a 5-4 ruling upholding the full      reinstatement order of the state's Employee Appeals Board      (EAB) of a white state social worker who had been fired for      calling an African-American co-worker ``a good ole nigger.''      The ruling he joined had declared that, taken in context,      this slur was an insufficient ground to terminate the white      plaintiffs employment in part because it ``was not motivated      out of racial hatred or racial animosity directed toward a      particular co-worker or toward blacks in general.'' Moreover,      the EAB decision upheld by the Court of Appeals decision      trivialized the use of the words ``good ole nigger'' by      comparing them to the expression ``teacher's pet.'' The Court      of Appeals did nothing to distance itself from this aspect of      the EAB decision.       The reasoning offered by Judge Southwick and his colleagues      in the majority is nothing short of baffling. As two      dissenters in the 5-4 decision rightfully pointed out: ``The      word 'nigger' is, and has always been, offensive. Search high      and low, you will not find any nonoffensive definition for      this term. There are some words, which by their nature and      definition are so inherently offensive, that their use      establishes the intent to offend.''       Fortunately the Supreme Court of Mississippi reversed the      decision, stating that the EAB should not simply be upheld,      but rather that the matter should be remanded to the EAB for      consideration of whether full reinstatement was truly      justified under the circumstances or whether some other      penalty short of discharge might be appropriate.       In another case, S.B. v. L.W., Judge Southwick joined an      opinion that upheld the removal of an eight-year-old girl      from the custody of her bisexual mother. In addition to      joining the majority opinion, he was the lone judge to join a      colleague's gratuitously anti-gay concurring opinion. The      concurrence argued the ``choice'' to engage in homosexuality      comes with consequences, up to and including the      consideration of ``the homosexual lifestyle'' as a      determining factor in child custody cases. The views      expressed in the concurring opinion raise doubts about Judge      Southwick's interest in ruling fairly in cases that involve      the civil rights of gays and lesbians.       In Dubard v. Biloxi, H.M.A., Judge Southwick wrote a      dissenting opinion in which he extolled the virtues of      employment-at-will, a doctrine that provides that employers      should be able to fire employees for virtually any reason,      even though his analysis was not relevant to reaching a      decision in the case. He wrote that ``I find that employment      at will, for whatever flaws a specific application may cause,      is not only the law of Mississippi but it provides the best      balance of the competing interests in the normal employment      situation. It has often been said about democracy, that it      does not provide a perfect system of government, but just a      better one than everything else that has ever been suggested.      An equivalent view might be seen as the justification for      employment at will.'' His gratuitous comments raise questions      about his ability to separate his own views from his duty to      follow the law in labor and employment cases.       Judge Southwick also has a poor record in cases involving      race discrimination in jury selection. He has routinely      rejected defense claims that prosecutors struck African-     American jurors based on race. At the same time, however, he      has usually upheld allegations by prosecutors that defendants      tried to strike white jurors on the basis of race. One of      Judge Southwick's own colleagues, in response, accused him of      ``establishing one level of obligation for the State, and a      higher one for defendants on an identical issue.''       His record also shows a troubling tendency, in state      employment law and tort cases, to favor business and      insurance interests over injured parties. He did so in 160      out of 180 such published cases in . which at least one judge      dissented, giving him an 89 percent pro-business voting      record.       When asked by Senator Durbin (D- IL) during live      questioning at his hearing if he could think of one example      of an unpopular decision he made in favor of the powerless,      the poor, minorities, or the dispossessed, Judge Southwick      responded that he could not. In response to a follow-up      written question posed by Senator Durbin, Judge Southwick      indicated that he could not find a single nonunanimous case,      of the more than 7000 opinions that he wrote or joined, in      which he voted in favor of a civil rights plaintiff or wrote      a dissent on behalf of a plaintiff.       Given the tremendous impact that federal judges have on      civil rights and liberties, and because of the lifetime      nature of federal judgeships, no judge should be confirmed      unless he or she demonstrates a solid commitment to      protecting the rights of all Americans. Because Judge      Southwick has failed to meet this burden, we urge senators to      vote no on cloture on the nomination.       Thank you for your consideration. If you have any      questions, please contact Nancy Zirkin, Vice President and      Director of Public Policy, at 202-263-2880, or Paul      Edenfield, Counsel and Policy Analyst, at 202-263-2852.           Sincerely,     Wade Henderson,       President & CEO.     Nancy Zirkin,       Vice President, Director of Public Policy.                                  ____                                        Human Rights Campaign,                                     Washington, DC, May 23, 2007.       Dear Members of the Committee on the Judiciary: I am      writing on behalf of the Human Rights Campaign and our      700,000 members and supporters to oppose the nomination of      Leslie Southwick to the United States Court of Appeals for      the Fifth Circuit. As a Mississippi Judge, Southwick      demonstrated a serious lack of understanding of gay people      and families. His statements during his hearing before this      Committee and his written responses to your questions do not      satisfy us that his positions have evolved nor that he would      fairly judge cases involving the rights of gay, lesbian,      bisexual, and transgender (``GLBT'') Americans.       During his tenure on the Mississippi Court of Appeals,      Judge Southwick (now in private practice) participated in a      custody case involving a lesbian mother. The majority      decision, which Southwick joined, took an eight-year-old      child from the mother, citing in part that the mother had a      ``lesbian home.'' The opinion further denigrates what it      calls the ``homosexual lifestyle'' and the ``lesbian      lifestyle.''       More disturbingly, Judge Southwick joined a concurrence      written by Judge Payne--completely unnecessary to effectuate      the result--that emphasized Mississippi's public policy      against lesbian and gay parents (using only the term      ``homosexuals''). Judge Southwick was the only judge in the      majority to join Judge Payne's concurrence, which is rife      with misconceptions and biases.       The concurrence does not even refer to gay individuals, but      rather focuses on ``the practice of homosexuality.'' It then      cites Mississippi's law prohibiting same-sex couples from      adopting children--even though this was not an adoption case,      but rather a case regarding a biological mother's right to      retain custody of her child. The opinion even goes so far as      to cite the state's sodomy law (subsequently invalidated by      the Supreme Court's decision in Lawrence v. Texas).       Perhaps most troublingly, the concurrence states that even      if the mother's sexual acts are her choice, she must accept      the fact that losing her child is a possible consequence of      that ``choice.'' This statement underscores Judge Southwick's      disregard for commonly accepted psychiatric and social      science conclusions. The American Psychological Association      (APA) has made clear that sexual orientation is not a choice.      The APA, along with every other credible psychological and      child welfare group, has also concluded that lesbian and gay      people are equally successful parents as their heterosexual      counterparts. This disregard for widely accepted social      science conclusions has ramifications not only for cases      involving gay and lesbian people, but also in any case where      respect for science comes into play--whether this involves      reproductive choice, people with disabilities, environmental      studies, to name a few.       No parent should face the loss of a child simply because of      who they are. If he believes that losing a child is an      acceptable ``consequence'' of being gay, Judge Southwick      cannot be given the responsibility to protect the basic      rights of gay and lesbian Americans.       When questioned before this Committee about why he joined      this offensive concurrence, Southwick gave the unsatisfactory      response that he did not write it. He further stated that the      concurrence reflected Mississippi's public policy, but did      not indicate why he joined the concurrence that his      colleagues deemed unnecessary. He did not distance himself      from the concurrence or the language that it contains.       In his written responses to questions about this case and      about the rights of gay and lesbian Americans, Southwick did      not provide adequate reassurance that his position has      changed or that his understanding has evolved. Although he      repeatedly indicated that Lawrence v. Texas is now      controlling precedent, having overruled Bowers v. Hardwick,      this is an insufficient answer. Although we are hopeful that      Lawrence will bring about greater equality for GLBT      Americans, Southwick's promise to adhere to that precedent      does not address the question of whether he believes that gay      people should have the same parenting rights as others.       The United States Court of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit      has historically paved the way for civil rights advances. We      believe that Judge Southwick's nomination is inconsistent      with this important legacy, and would turn back the tide of      progress by denying equal protections to GLBT Americans.       We therefore oppose his nomination and request that you      vote against his confirmation. Only a judge who has      demonstrated that he can be a fair and impartial judge for      all Americans, regardless of their sexual orientation, is      entitled to confirmation on this important court. For more      information, please contact Senior Public Policy Advocate      David Stacy at [email protected], or Legal Director Lara      Schwartz at [email protected]           Sincerely,                                                  Allison Herwitt,     Legislative Director.                                  ____         National Association for the Advancement of Colored            People Mississippi State Conference,                                         Jackson, MS, May 9, 2007.     Hon. Patrick Leahy,     Dirksen Senate Office Building,     Washington, DC.     Hon. Arlen Specter,     Dirksen Senate Office Building,     Washington, DC.       Dear Chairman Leahy and Ranking Member Specter: The      Mississippi State Conference of the NAACP is strongly opposed      to the nomination of Leslie Southwick to the Fifth Circuit      Court of Appeals.       As you are well aware, previous nominations to this      particular seat on the Fifth Circuit have raised serious      civil rights problems. In reviewing this history, we cannot      help but conclude that this Administration is determined to      place a person hostile to civil rights in the Mississippi      seat on the Fifth Circuit. Judge Charles Pickering was      nominated in 2001. The Senate refused to confirm him, largely      based on his civil rights record. President Bush then      nominated Michael Wallace to the same seat. The American Bar      Association found Mr. Wallace to be ``unqualified,'' due to      his judicial temperament regarding civil rights issues.      Wallace withdrew his nomination at the end of 2006. Now,      President Bush has named yet a third nominee with a troubling      civil rights record.       We note that the Southwick nomination does nothing to      ameliorate the egregious problem with the lack of diversity      on Mississippi's federal bench. Mississippi has the highest      African-American population of any state (36%). Yet there has      never been an African American appointed to represent      Mississippi on the Fifth Circuit. African-American      representation on the federal district court in Mississippi      has been limited to one judge, Judge Henry Wingate, appointed      over twenty years ago. In his two terms, President Bush has      made ten nominations to the federal bench in Mississippi--     district and appellate. None were African American. This is      extremely disturbing to many Mississippians, who believe the      State should be fairly represented on the federal bench.       The civil rights record of Judge Southwick on the      Mississippi Court of Appeals gives us great pause. We are      deeply troubled by his rulings on race discrimination in the      areas of employment and jury selection.       Judge Southwick participated in a truly stunning decision,      Richmond v. Mississippi Dep't of Human Services. He joined a      ruling that a Mississippi state agency could not terminate an      employee for using the word ``nigger'' toward an African-     American coworker. At a business conference, the white      employee had called the black employee ``a good ole nigger,''      and then used the same term toward the employee the next day      at the office. The state agency fired the white employee. But      a hearing officer reinstated the employee, finding that      calling the employee ``a good ole nigger'' was equivalent to      calling her ``teacher's pet.'' Southwick upheld the      reinstatement.       The opinion endorsed by Southwick makes outrageous      conclusions about the use of the term ``nigger'' in the      workplace. The opinion states: ``[The white employee]      presented proof that her remark, though undoubtedly ill-     advised and indicative of a rather remarkable insensitivity      on her part, was not motivated out of racial hatred or racial      animosity directed toward a particular co-worker or toward      blacks in general.'' Astonishingly, the court credited the      white employee's testimony that her remark was intended to be      ``a shorthand description'' of the relationship between an      employee and a supervisor.       Two of Southwick's colleagues strongly dissented. They      stated that it ``strains credulity'' to compare calling the      employee ``a good ole nigger'' with ``teacher's pet.'' The      dissent wrote: ``The word `nigger' is, and has always been      offensive. . . . There are some words, which by their nature      and definition are so inherently offensive, that their use      establishes the intent to offend. . . . The character of      these terms is so inherently offensive that it is not altered      by the use of modifiers such as `good ole.' . . . [The      rulings] seem to suggest that absent evidence of a near race      riot, the remark is too inconsequential to serve as a basis      for dismissal. Such a view requires a level of myopia      inconsistent with the facts and reason.'' Indeed, the      Mississippi Supreme Court unanimously reserved the ruling      joined by Southwick to uphold the reinstatement of the white      employee.       Additionally, we are disturbed by Judge Southwick's rulings      on race discrimination in jury selection. Dozens of such      cases reveal a pattern by which Southwick rejects claims that      the prosecution was racially motivated in striking African-     American jurors while upholding claims that the defense      struck white jurors on the basis of their race. In Bumphis v.      State, an appellate colleague accused Southwick of      ``establishing one level of obligation for the State, and a      higher one for defendants on an identical issue.''       Finally, on issues affecting workers, consumers and      personal injury victims, Judge Southwick rules overwhelmingly      in favor of employers and corporations. We question his      ability to be a fair and impartial decision-maker in these      cases as well. Mississippians need to be confident that they      will receive equal justice before the federal courts.           Respectfully yours,                                                  Derrick Johnson,     President.                                  ____                                   Congressional Black Caucus,                                     Washington, DC, June 6, 2007.     Hon. Patrick J. Leahy,     Russell Senate Office Building,     Washington, DC.     Hon. Arlen Specter,     Hart Senate Office Building,     Washington, DC.       Dear Mr. Leahy and Mr. Specter: We write to be clear      concerning the strong opposition of the Congressional Black      Caucus to moving Leslie Southwick, formerly of the      Mississippi Court of Appeals, through committee for the Fifth      Circuit Court of Appeals. We are enclosing the press release      that the Caucus issued just before Memorial Day recess asking      that Leslie Southwick not be listed for a vote in committee.      We understand that, nevertheless, Mr. Southwick may have a      vote in committee on Thursday, June 7, 2007. We are      astonished that the committee would seriously consider this      nominee on a circuit that hears cases affecting more Blacks      and Hispanics than any circuit in the country. Mr.      Southwick's long record, revealing inexcusably insensitive      and hostile views on race and on other issues that have      directly harmed people of color, should spell the end of his      consideration for the Fifth Circuit.       The enclosed release mentions the most obvious and overt      racial example, involving Mr. Southwick's concurrence in      Richmond v. Mississippi Department of Human Services, 1998      Miss. App. LEXIS 637 (Miss. Ct. App. 1998), allowing the use      of a racial slur that was unanimously overruled, but      importantly refers to many other areas of equally deep      concern to us because they involved average Mississippi      residents who typify the Black, Hispanic, and white residents      of the Circuit.       Mr. Southwick's record provides nothing less than a case      study of a judge with a closed mind and fixed far-right      views. In no area of law have we been able to find decisions      that did not seem to be entirely predicted by an ideological      predisposition. We believe that the committee should be      impressed by the frequency with which Southwick's opinions      and concurrences have been overruled. Our investigation of 10      years of Southwick decisions reveals a one-sided animus      against workers and consumers, in particular, with rulings      almost always favoring business and insurance interests and      almost never for working people and consumers.       Our Caucus is most concerned about Mr. Southwick's ability      to afford equal justice under law in the Circuit where racial      discrimination has always been most pronounced. The Southwick      decisions show a remarkable predisposition to rule for whites      alleging improper use of peremptory challenges and against      Blacks who make similar allegations regarding peremptory      challenges. Nothing could be more disturbing today,      considering that Congress has allowed racially unfair      mandatory minimums and sentencing guidelines to remain in      tact, virtually destroying a generation of African American      men. Rep. Bennie Thompson's Mississippi constituents were      profoundly and negatively injured during Southwick's tenure      in virtually every area of state law. We ask that you avoid      elevating Leslie Southwick to the U.S. Court of Appeals for      the Fifth Circuit, where he is likely to do the same harm to      residents of three states--Texas, Louisiana, as well as      Mississippi.       We want to be clear that the Congressional Black Caucus      could not be more troubled by the transformation of the Fifth      Circuit by judges that make it difficult to believe in the      fairness, balance and openness of the judiciary. Five members      of the CBC represent constituents in this circuit, the      largest number members in anyone circuit. The Fifth Circuit      presides over the largest percentage of minority residents      (44%) of any circuit and Mississippi has the highest African-     American population (36%) of any state in the country. We      therefore would take very seriously the reach to place yet      another farright judge with offensive racial views on the      Fifth Circuit so late in President Bush's last term. We ask      that you reject Leslie Southwick.           Sincerely,     Carolyn C. Kilpatrick,       Chairperson, Congressional Black Caucus.     Bennie Thompson,       CBC Member--Mississippi.
