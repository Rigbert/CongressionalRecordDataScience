Mr. Speaker, I rise today to mark the 41st anniversary of the Turkish government's illegal invasion of Cyprus in 1974. This tragedy of that aggression continues to this day. Northern Cyprus continues to be occupied by Turkish troops. More than 216,000 Cypriots continue to be displaced or their descendants denied their rightful property claims in ancestral homelands--and this includes 5,000 Americans of Cypriot descent.  Sadly, the occupation authorities continue their direct attacks on the religious freedom of Orthodox Christians and the island's rich Orthodox Christian cultural heritage. Cyprus's ancient Christian heritage goes back to the mission of St. Paul and St. Barnabas in 45 A.D.--Barnabas is remembered as the founder and patron saint of the Church in Cyprus. Even in recent years, Turkish security forces have continued to disrupt the religious services of Orthodox believers in northern Cyprus, and, sadly, the desecration and destruction of religious sites continues. Forty-one years after the Turkish government's invasion, Christian believers still cannot freely visit all religious sites on the island, nor use Christian religious sites for their rightful purpose. Sites looted of revered icons remain vacant, and sacred objects of Cypriot Orthodoxy regularly turn up on the international art market or are held in museums against the wishes of the Orthodox community. The services for the faithful that do take place remain tightly restricted by Turkish authorities through special permitting or other challenges to registering congregations. These violations of basic rights are a legacy of intolerance wrought by the 1974 invasion.  Mr. Speaker, I hope my colleagues will join me in urging the administration to vigorously promote meaningful settlement negotiations that affirm the fundamental freedoms and human rights of those Greek Cypriots who are displaced or enduring in northern enclaves.                          ____________________
