Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.  In response to the gentleman, I would agree to some extent with what he said. The one thing I do and have always felt very strongly is not to be dictated to by the other body. The other body said ``take it or leave it'' on issues very frankly that are very, very important to me, but we decided what we had to do was get what was best out of what we were able to do, and without any objection on our side or the gentleman's side, to achieve those goals.  I am a little frustrated with the other body, in fact, greatly frustrated, because they waited. These bills had been passed for many, many months, and then they sent us something and said, ``Take it or leave it.''  This is the House of the people, the United States House of Representatives. It is not the House of Lords. I am going to suggest respectfully that until they recognize that we also have an important role to play in this business of legislation, I am going to do what I think is appropriate for not only the Nation as a whole but the constituents that we all represent.  To have them dictate to us is very offensive to me. I have told them that vocally, and I will tell them that in writing, and I will say it in public. This is the House of the people, not the House of Lords on the other side. So the one way we did what we could do to try to achieve our goals, including the fishermen's protection act, was that the gentleman's and my bill is in this package. That is one of the things in this bill. I cannot get it all because I cannot get it passed from this side of the aisle, either.  So this is the art of trying to achieve the realities. I really worked very hard on this piece of legislation, and hopefully we will see the wisdom of passing this legislation.
