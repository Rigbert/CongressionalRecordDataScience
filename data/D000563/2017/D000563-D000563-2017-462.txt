President, I rise again to speak about the epidemic of gun violence in the city of Chicago and across America.  The American Medical Association has declared gun violence as a public health crisis in America. Every day, almost 300 men, women, and children are shot in this Nation. Gun violence touches every American community, but no community has suffered more than the city of Chicago.  I am honored to represent that city. I love it, and I think it is a great city. I spend a lot of time there to get to know the people who were born there and live their lives there and call it home. It is a great honor to call it part of my State that I am honored to represent.  The stories that are coming out of the city of Chicago are heartbreaking stories--and none worse than this week. This week there was a slaughter of the innocents. In a 4-day period earlier this week, three beautiful children under the age of 12 were fatally shot.  On Saturday night, 11-year-old Takiya Holmes, sitting in her mom's car, was shot in the head and killed. A 19-year-old suspect in custody has been charged. He reported that he was shooting from across the street at rival gang members, and a stray bullet hit Takiya. She died on Tuesday morning.  On Saturday, 12-year-old Kanari Gentry-Bowers was shot while playing basketball in the West Englewood neighborhood. She passed away just yesterday.  On Tuesday at 1:30 in the afternoon, 2-year-old Lavontay White was shot and killed while sitting in the car with his pregnant aunt and uncle. Lavontay's uncle was also killed. His aunt was wounded.  These shootings are senseless, devastating, and heartbreaking. Already this year there have been over 400 shootings in Chicago--so far this year. That is after there were more than 4,300 shootings last year.  My thoughts and prayers, of course, go to the victims and their families. I have attended so many marches and parades, funerals, and memorial services. But thoughts and prayers are not enough. We need to do something to reduce this epidemic of gun violence. There have been too many funerals, too many families who have lost that baby they loved, too many children who suffered the physical and mental trauma of gunshot wounds and witnessing violence. Many of these shootings could have been prevented, but it is going to take changes in our laws and changes in our attitude for that to happen.  We have absurd loopholes in our gun laws that make it easy for dangerous people to get their hands on guns. We have obvious gaps in our gun background check system. We have inadequate Federal laws to stop gun trafficking and straw purchases of guns. These factors allow a flood of illicit guns to come into Chicago from other towns and States, from gun shows in neighboring States where there is no background check. These drug gangs drive over to these locations and fill up the trunks of their cars with guns to take them and sell them in the neighborhoods to kids who shoot and kill one another day in and day out.  We have gun dealers--federally licensed gun dealers--who look the other way when someone comes in to make a straw purchase. That is the purchase of a gun that the purchaser is not going to use but is going to give it to somebody who is prohibited from buying a gun.  In light of the epidemic of gun violence in our country, Congress should be working around the clock to fix these gaps in our Federal law. But the Republican-controlled Senate is doing nothing to address gun violence in Chicago or anywhere else. Instead, look at what we just did yesterday. Just yesterday, this Senate, on this floor, voted to weaken the gun background check system instead of strengthening it. It is hard to understand how the Republican Party can have its priorities so wrong when it comes to gun violence.  We can respect Second Amendment rights of individuals. We can respect the rights of people to own a gun for self-defense, for sporting and hunting purposes. I have gone hunting. I have used a firearm. I complied with every law in the books, all of them. The hunters who were with me did too.  Why is it so hard to ask before we sell a gun to someone whether they have a criminal record, whether they are buying it for another person who might have a criminal record, or whether they have a history of mental instability, which would disqualify them from owning a gun?  We are facing a crisis in Chicago and across the Nation because of this violence. We in Congress have a responsibility to do everything we can at the Federal level to protect our constituents, our neighbors, from getting shot. We can't ignore this responsibility, and we certainly shouldn't be weakening gun laws as the Senate did yesterday.  We also need the Federal Government to be an engaged partner with cities like Chicago to help reduce violence and expand economic options in depressed neighborhoods. You can pick out three neighborhoods in the city of Chicago that account for almost 50 percent of gun violence--three neighborhoods. I visited some of them. They warned me: Don't get out of the car. They are right. Random gunfire is a reality of life in those neighborhoods. We know where they are. We know where the shooters live. We know where the victims are. We can do more.  President Trump sends out a lot of tweets. He likes to tweet about Chicago, and I am not quite sure why. Tweeting doesn't save lives. Saying that you are going to send in the Feds may be one of those short tweets that is catchy, but it doesn't mean a damned thing to the people who are being shot and are dying in the city of Chicago.  Last week I joined my colleague Senator Tammy Duckworth, and we sent a letter to the President asking him to do more than tweet when it comes to Chicago.  I ask unanimous consent to have printed in the Record this letter.  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in the Record, as follows:                                         United States Senate,                                Washington, DC, February 10, 2017.     President Donald J. Trump,     The White House,     Washington, DC.       Dear President Trump: During the 2016 presidential campaign      and in numerous tweets and comments since the election, you      have lamented the recent surge of gun violence in Chicago and      said the federal government could help stop the violence.      While the level of shootings and homicides is clearly      unacceptable, tweeting alone will not fix it. Tweeting does      not break cycles of violence; tweeting does not help lift      people out of poverty; tweeting does not save lives. We urge      you instead to provide a surge in federal support and      resources for Chicago to reduce violence and expand economic      opportunities for neglected communities.       Public safety is primarily a local responsibility, but the      federal government must be an engaged partner in public      safety efforts alongside local officials, law enforcement,      and community stakeholders. There is much the federal      government can do to help.       Instead of tweeting, you could begin by directing your      Administration to enhance U.S. Department of Justice (DOJ)      programs that improve community policing, such as the COPS      Hiring Program to help local police departments put more cops      on the beat, and the Byrne-JAG grant program to enable local      law enforcement to purchase or upgrade equipment. We note      that in his first year in office, President Obama pushed for      a surge in COPS and Byrne-JAG funding through the Recovery      Act and the appropriations process that provided Chicago with      $13.256 million in COPS Hiring funding and $35.637 million in      Byrne-JAG finding. This is more than four times the amount of      COPS funding and 15 times the amount of Byrne-JAG funding      that the City received last year. You could push for a      similar funding surge.       We also urge you to direct DOJ to promote mentoring and job      training programs for youth and the formerly incarcerated. We      are ready to work with you to strengthen the Office of      Juvenile Justice and Delinquency Prevention to improve      mentoring and violence prevention initiatives and to boost      funding for recidivism reduction programs under the federal      Second Chance Act. We urge you to direct DOJ to abide by its      commitment to help implement policing reforms     recommended by the Department's Civil Rights Division. We      also request your support for legislation to close gaps in      the FBI gun background check system and in federal firearm      laws that enable straw purchasers and gun traffickers to      flood Chicago's streets with illicit guns.       Federal efforts must also transcend law enforcement and      criminal justice programs to focus on causal factors,      including the lack of economic opportunity. We urge the U.S.      Department of Education and the U.S. Department of Labor to      prioritize important career and youth training programs that,      if properly funded and expanded, would address the role that      poverty plays in the violence epidemic facing Chicago and      other communities around the country.       Before you send your next tweet, you could request a surge      in additional federal resources for these public safety and      economic development efforts in Chicago. But so far, your      Administration has refused to commit to spend any additional      resources to combat Chicago's violence and has actually      threatened to cut federal funds for the City. Now is not the      time for the federal government to abandon its support for      Chicago and its people.       This week, you reportedly attributed Chicago's crime      situation to the presence of undocumented immigrants. This      coincides with your January 25 executive order that makes up      to eight million immigrants priorities for deportation and      seeks to create a mass deportation force by tripling the      number of immigration agents. The vast majority of immigrants      in our country are peaceful and have strong family values,      and studies have shown that immigrants are less likely to      commit serious crimes than native-born individuals. We are      aware of no evidence that undocumented immigrants are      responsible for any significant proportion of the murders in      Chicago, and claims otherwise do nothing but distract from      efforts to meaningfully reduce the City's recent increase in      violence.       We note that you have urged Congress to fund the      construction of a wall on the Southern border that would      reportedly cost at least $21.6 billion, even though the wall      would not fix our broken immigration system and even though      Republican Congressman Will Hurd, whose district covers 800      miles of the border, has said ``building a wall is the most      expensive and least effective way to secure the border.'' If      your Administration were to take even one percent of this      funding and devote the resources instead to help Chicago's      public safety efforts, it would make a dramatic difference in      reducing Chicago's violence. We urge you to reprioritize      federal resources that you would request for wall      construction and commit those resources instead to reducing      gun violence in Chicago and other violence-prevention efforts      around the nation. Doing so could save many more lives than      tweeting.       Thank you for your consideration on this important issue.           Sincerely,     Richard J. Durbin,       U.S. Senator.     Tammy Duckworth,       U.S. Senator.
