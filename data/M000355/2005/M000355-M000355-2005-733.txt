 President, for the information of Members of the Senate, what we are trying to do is set up a series of three votes, between an hour and 1\1/2\ hours on two Coburn amendments and a Dorgan amendment. I will be back at the conclusion of Senator Coburn's remarks to propound a unanimous consent agreement that would lock in those three votes around the time that I just suggested.
