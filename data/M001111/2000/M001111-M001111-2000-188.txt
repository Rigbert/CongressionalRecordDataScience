 President, I have come to the floor today to talk about the budget the President has presented to Congress this year. Every budget is a statement of priorities, and I wanted to share with my colleagues how this budget matches up with the priorities of the people I represent. I will spend a moment talking about how we should consider budgets in this remarkable period of economic strength.  The President's FY 2001 budget comes at a time of great prosperity and also great challenges. I take the budget decisions we will make this year very seriously. We have an historic opportunity to meet our long-term commitments and make vital investments. In looking at the budget, I am focused on two priorities.  First, we cannot squander the surplus. It has been too hard to reach this point of progress. When I came to the Senate in 1993, our fiscal house was a mess. But we made the tough, fiscally responsible decisions that have brought us to this point. The surplus is not here by accident. We made very difficult choices, and now is not the time to abandon our steady, responsible approach.  We have a responsibility to use the surplus in ways that will meet our long-term commitments and continue our economic growth. We know that Social Security and Medicare are running out of money. These are promises from one generation to the next. And it would be wrong--fiscally and morally--not to save those programs while we have the chance.  We should also remember that these surplus projections are just that--protections. I worry that some of the projections my Republican colleagues have used are too rosy--in part because they are based on faulty assumptions, and they do not account for any slowing down of our economy. I think we should use the most realistic estimates available.  Second, we have to continue to make the responsible investments that will help our economy grow. We must maintain our investments in areas like education, R, infrastructure, criminal justice, agriculture, and defense. We must strengthen Social Security and Medicare. And we must provide targeted tax relief. I am pleased that the President has presented a responsible plan for meeting those objectives.  One important investment is paying down the debt. We are responsible for paying down a major portion of the public debt. A commitment of $2.5 trillion over ten years--as called for by the President--would make us debt free within 13 years. Mr. President, now is the time to pay down the debt--while the economy is strong.  I know there will be a lot of debate over tax cuts this year. There is room for tax cuts--but they need to be responsible. We should remember that just last year Republicans were pushing an irresponsible, $790 billion tax cut. I am glad the American people rejected it. And this year, some presidential candidates appear willing to roll the dice on even riskier schemes.  This year we should be on the look out for tax cuts that do not help our country. When looking at tax cuts, I will be asking: Do they contribute to our future and promote our economic growth by investing in workers and education?  I would like to turn to the investments we have to make in education.  When I think of the types of investments that have real returns for America's families--education tops the list. Investing in education pays dividends in boosting our country's productivity and expanding our people's potential. We must continue to invest in education so that every American will have the tools and skills to succeed in the global economy. We know that by reducing class size, investing in teacher quality, and making higher education more accessible, we are improving the prospects for our nation and our people. And I am proud of the many education investments this budget makes.  We must stay on the path of hiring 100,000 fully-qualified teachers to reduce class size. We know that kids learn the basics and have fewer discipline problems in smaller classes. The budget boosts funding to $1.75 billion, an increase of $450 million over the current level. That's enough to hire about 49,000 teachers, nearly half-way to our long term goal. So I commend the president's budget for its commitment to reducing class size. By working together over the past two years, we've already made the classroom a better, more productive place for 1.7 million students--and with the President's latest commitment, we can bring the benefits of smaller classes to many more students.  We know that when we reduce the number of students in each classroom--we need more classrooms, so I am pleased the President's budget also follows through on our efforts to boost school construction.  The President's budget also takes greats steps forward to improve teacher quality. As I listened to the President's State of the Union Address last month, I was excited to see that efforts to boost teacher quality are finally getting the national attention they deserve.  We need to have a plan to recruit, train and reward great teachers; a plan to help high-poverty school districts attract great teachers through better pay and higher standards; and a plan to reward school districts that make progress in reducing the number of uncertified teachers and teachers teaching outside their subject area. These would all represent great steps forward.  We need to boost hometown teacher recruitment, to help professionals from diverse fields make the transition to the classroom, and to promote professional development for school leaders.  But there is more we should do to boost teacher quality. That's why, last year, I introduced the Quality and Accountability are Best for Children Act--Quality ABCs (S. 1926). After talking with parents, teachers and students, I wrote a bill that will hold educators accountable for their students' progress. It will help keep great teachers in the classroom by offering them improved professional development and career ladders. It will reward and recognize great educators. It will offer a meaningful financial bonus for states to improve teacher pay and it will ensure teachers have the training they need to use technology in the classroom.  I believe the President's budget--and his State of the Union Address--are a great start to boosting teacher quality across America.  The President's budget also makes important investments in early education, in Headstart funding, in preventing youth violence, and in expanding college access.  Mr. President, clearly this is a budget that recognizes the importance of education. It matches our funding with our priorities.  But there are some initiatives that do not require a budget allocation. And I would like to spend a moment highlighting some of the efforts I will fight for as we reauthorize the Elementary and Secondary Education Act.  First, there is a lot we can do to boost parental involvement. Parents are a child's first and best teachers, and studies have shown that when families are involved in education their children do better in school. Today, it is difficult for parents and family members to participate in their children's education--either because they do not feel welcomed by schools or because their time is limited by work and other constraints.  That is why I've introduced two bills to make it easier for parents to help their children succeed in school.  First, I introduced the Time for Schools Act, S. 1304, which allows parents to take up to 24 hours of unpaid leave from work each year to attend academic events at school.  And second, with input from parents and teachers, I wrote the Parent-Family School Partnership Act, S. 1772, which will encourage families to participate in schools, will train educators in the best ways to involve parents, will invest in family involvement efforts, and will use technology and community college partnerships to boost parental involvement.  A great classroom and a great teacher only go so far, these bills will go a long way to ensuring that students get the most from school by having a parent involved.  We should also do more to expand technology in the classroom. In 1997, we made sure that new teachers get the technology training they need before they enter the classroom. This year, we should work to make sure that current teachers receive technology training as part of an on-going professional development. That effort is part of my ``Quality ABCs'' bill that I just referred to.  And I support increasing resources for, and access to, education technology, improving coordination and effective uses of education technology--including distance learning and advanced placement services. And finally, protecting students from inappropriate material on the Internet.  We should offer students a voice in education decisions. I have always believed that young people should have a role in the decisions that affect them. That's why I introduced the ``Youth and Adult School Partnership Act,'' S. 1773, which will create more meaningful roles for students in their schools and communities, invest in successful student-adult partnerships, and continue researching the link between student involvement and student achievement.  Finally, we should promote the types of local partnerships that help students succeed. As I have visited schools throughout my State, I have been impressed by how well they have formed partnerships with local business and non-profit organizations. I visited one community, where the local chamber of commerce runs a Teacher Internship Program--where teachers spend their summers in the business world--seeing--first-hand--the skills their students will need. And those efforts can have great results for our students. So we must continue to promote these local partnerships.  I have laid out my vision--the Democratic vision--for how we can improve public education. I have been working on this for many years, and it seems that the response from the other side is always ``Schools are failing, and local control is the answer.''  Education in our country is already under local control. I served on a local school board, and I can tell you that as a fact. Do we need to reduce paperwork? Yes. Do we need to be more flexible? Yes. But the real question is: What are we doing to support education? This budget--and the ideas I just mentioned--offer a specific blueprint--for how we can improve education.  I fear that instead of giving these tools to our educators, the majority would rather criticize our public schools.  Too often, their rhetoric tears down, when we should be building up. The majority's education agenda too often resembles an effort to assign blame. I believe a better approach--the Democratic approach--is to strengthen the partnerships that improve education.  We Democrats--in the Senate and the House along with the President--are offering something positive--and I hope that this agenda of excellence is greeted by honest examination and constructive debate focused on helping students learn--and not the usual partisan blame game.  We have a chance to lead. We have a chance to really improve public education for all Americans. Let's notabandon the principles that have made our nation great. Let's not let partisan gamesmanship stand in the way of progress. Let's take this unprecedented opportunity in our nation's history to make the investments we need, and to do right by our nation's parents, our nation's educators, and--most importantly--our nation's future--the children attending our public schools.  I yield the floor.                          ____________________
