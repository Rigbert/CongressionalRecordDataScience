. District Court for the District of New Mexico. Ms. Herrera is a partner with the Santa Fe firm of Herrera, Long, Pound & Komer, which she co-founded in 1987. She appears in court frequently on behalf of employers, and their insurance companies, serving as defense counsel in employment discrimination and wrongful discharge cases. Before starting this practice, she handled education cases and also served briefly as a local prosecutor. She also previously served on the Sante Fe City Council. She has the support of both of her home-state Senators.  Democratic support for the confirmation of Ms. Herrera, an active Republican, is yet another example of our extraordinary cooperation in this Presidential election year. Today's confirmation will make the 180th judicial nominee to be confirmed since this President took office. With 80 lifetime judicial appointments confirmed in just the past year and a half alone, the Senate has confirmed more Federal judges than were confirmed during the all of 1995 and 1996, when Republicans first controlled the Senate and President Clinton was in the White House. It also exceeds the 2-year total for the last Congress of the Clinton administration, when Republicans held the Senate. This Senate has now confirmed more Federal judges than were confirmed during either Congress leading to a presidential election with a Democratic President and Republican Senate majority in 1996 and 2000.  This marks the 180th judicial confirmation since President Bush took office. That is more than President Reagan, the acknowledged all-time champion, achieved in his entire 4-year Presidential term from 1981 through 1984 working hand in hand with a Republican Senate majority. It is more than President Clinton was able to achieve in his entire 4-year Presidential term from 1993 through 1996, having to work with a Republican Senate majority during 1995 and 1996.  I have already noted that at the Republican Senate leadership has again chosen to avoid debate of the nomination of J. Leon Holmes and Judge DoraIrizarry. These two district court nominees have been pending on the Senate floor longer than any of the other pending district court nominees. Just so that there is no confusion, that is the choice of the Republican Senate leadership to skip those nominations.  The Holmes nomination will require significant debate. It was sent by the Judiciary Committee to the floor without recommendation, a highly unusual circumstance. That means that there was not a majority vote in committee to report the nomination favorably. The committee disserved the Senate by not doing its job of fully vetting the nomination and reaching a consensus or even a vote on the merits.  With regard to Mr. Holmes, to excuse widely shared misgivings about this nomination partisan Republicans are falsely claiming that the opposition to him is based on his religion. That is a slander. Nonetheless, right wing groups like the Committee for Justice have run outrageous and false ads and propaganda against Democrats and have posted assertions that Democrats are anti-Catholic.  Ms. Herrera is, of course, another among the scores of judicial nominees we have confirmed who are active in their faith. Ms. Herrera has stated in her Senate questionnaire that she is on the Board of Directors of the St. Michael's High School Foundation, a local Catholic high school, and she is a parishioner at St. Francis Cathedral. It is wrong for Republican partisans to seek political benefit by falsely claiming that Democrats are anti-Catholic and insulting for them to claim that Catholic Democrats are somehow not Catholic enough. Senator Durbin just released a study this week that shows that Democrats actually vote more often in agreement with the U.S. Conference of Catholic Bishops on domestic and international issues than their counterparts across the aisle. Yet the destructive Republican politics of division persist. These are unfortunate and dangerous schemes that will only further divide our people and our Nation. Anna Quindlen's recent column in Newsweek, Casting the First Stone, captures the heart of this current tendency to mix religion and politics into a concoction that some Republican strategists hope will help them at the ballot box. I ask unanimous consent that this editorial be printed in the Record.  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in the Record, as follows:                     [From Newsweek, May 31, 2004]                        Casting the First Stone                           (By Anna Quindlen)       It was nearly 25 years ago that Robert Drinan, a member of      Congress and an outspoken Jesuit (a redundancy if there ever      was one), so enraged the Vatican with his defense of abortion      rights that an order came down from Rome demanding priests      withdraw from politics.       It appears that someone has had a change of heart.       Or at least that's how it seems now that certain segments      of the Roman Catholic hierarchy are behaving like wholly      owned subsidiaries of the Republican Party, hellbent on a      course that will weaken the church's moral authority and      eventually deplete its membership. And all because of      abortion, the issue the celibate male leadership is least      equipped to personally understand.       To paraphrase a Gospel passage, my Father's house is a      house of prayer, but they have made it a den of partisanship.      The archbishop of St. Louis announced that if John Kerry, the      Democratic candidate, showed up for mass he would be denied      communion. After threats from clerics in New Jersey, the pro-     choice Democratic governor saved himself the embarrassment of      being turned away by saying he would no longer present      himself for the sacrament; the Democratic majority leader of      the state Senate responded by quitting the church and saying      he will likely join the Episcopalians. And in Colorado a      bishop went a step further, saying that any Catholic who      supports politicians who favor abortion rights, same-sex      marriage or stem-cell research should not take communion.       Surely the next step is to put ushers at the door each      Sunday with a purity checklist. Adulterer? Out. Gay? Out. Tax      cheat? Gossip? Condom in your pocket? Out. Out. Out. My, how      empty those pews have grown. And the altar, too, where we      learned that too many priests had a secret life of sexual      abuse. Why were known pedophiles permitted to give communion      for years, while people of conscience at odds with Vatican      teaching (not church dogma) are prohibited from receiving it?      It brings to mind the always topical injunction that it's he      who is without sin who gets to cast the first stone.       Too many bishops seem to have missed key seminary lessons:      the ones on the teachings of St. Thomas Aquinas that civil      and moral law are often two different things, or those on the      tradition in Catholic thought that a good law must be      enforceable, not a law like one prohibiting abortion that      will be so often broken that it leads to disregard for all      laws. Too many bishops seem to have forgotten the notion of      the individual examination of conscience. Instead they have      decided to examine conscience for us, particularly if we are      liberal Democrats.       Leaders of the church began a schism between pew and pulpit      in 1968 with the publication of the encyclical Humanae Vitae.      The majority of the members of a papal commission on      contraception recommended that the church change its      opposition; the minority members won out, mainly because they      based their argument on the primacy of the pope. Even then,      power politics overrode the well-being of the people.       But over time there was an unforeseen result of the      encyclical. The use of contraception became the church      prohibition millions of Catholics ignored, in part because      the directive was so out of step with modern life (as the      majority report suggested), in part because the issue was so      private. Little by little Catholics made their peace with      consulting their conscience instead of Father, especially on      intimate issues. The intermediaries became increasingly      irrelevant, especially when, in recent years, the full extent      of priestly sexual predation became known.       These member of the church were derided by conservatives as      ``cafeteria Catholics,'' picking and choosing their beliefs.      Now we have cafeteria clergy, picking and choosing which      prohibitions they emphasize and which politicians they damn.      What of the pro-life policies of a living wage or decent      housing? The church is opposed to the death penalty, yet no      bishop has yet suggested he will deny the sacrament to those      who support capital punishment. And sanctions for Democratic      candidates have far outnumbered those for Republicans, even      Republicans who favor legal abortion. The timing of all this      is curious as well. It coincides with that new Catholic holy      day, the feast of the first Tuesday in November, known to      secularists as Election Day.       It is one thing to preach the teachings of the church,      quite another to use the centerpiece of the faith selectively      as a tool to influence the ballot box, that confessional of      democracy. Even a member of Congress opposed to abortion      complained that church leaders were ``politicizing the      eucharist.'' If citizens who are Methodist, Muslim or Jewish      begin to suspect that Catholic politicians are beholden first      and foremost to Rome, a notion we thought was laughable and      bigoted when John F. Kennedy ran for president, who could      blame them? Next month American Catholic bishops meet for a      retreat in Colorado. There they should speak out against      grievous sin, the sin of using communion to punish by those      who have not the moral authority to persuade.
