Chairman, I thank the gentleman for yielding me this time and rise in support of H.R. 22. It is a good bill that should be enacted this year.  I applaud the gentleman from Illinois (Mr. Davis) and the ranking member, the gentleman from California (Mr. Waxman), and the gentleman from New York (Mr. McHugh).
