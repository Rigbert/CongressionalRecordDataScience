 Leader, on the matter of the legislation we just passed, I want to make one comment. It is obvious that the Senator from New Mexico is recognized as an effective chairman. It is obvious that the Senator from New York [Mr. Moynihan] is viewed as articulate and as one of the brightest people here. It is obvious that everybody knows how effective the ranking member of the Budget Committee is.  I want to make a personal comment that I never thought I would make, or need to make. I think the single-most underestimated person in this body is one of the single-most effective people, and that is my senior colleague, Bill Roth. He has a style that is so low-key and so quiet that I don't think he gets the credit he deserves. I just want to remind everybody, notwithstanding the fact that everyone sees and hears more about the able leaders I mentioned, this deal would not have been done without Bill Roth. Bill Roth. People in my State love him, but they don't even realize that.  I just want everybody to be reminded that this quiet guy from Delaware, who has a very different political view on a lot of things than I do, is one of the single-most effective people we have. On last year's welfare reform bill, and every major thing we have done in the past 18 months, he has been at the helm, or has played a major part.  I want to personally recognize the contribution he makes and state for the record, I think he gets--not intentionally; I think unintentionally--less credit than anybody in this place, and I think he plays the most significant role in all of what we are rightfully celebrating here, which is the passage of the tax bill and the reforms that have taken place in welfare, et cetera. So I want the Record to reflect that the man from Delaware, my senior colleague, deserves a heck of a lot of credit.
