 President, I am pleased to be joined by my colleague from Maine, Senator Collins, in submitting this Senate resolution designating November as ``National Runaway Prevention Month.''  A recent study by the Federal Office of Juvenile Justice and Delinquency Prevention estimates that nearly 1.7 million American youth run away or are turned out of their homes in a single year. Many of these children end up living on the streets where they become victims of illness, hunger, drug use, and crime. Any parent knows how important their support is to helping children get a good start in life.  Unfortunately, too many young people find themselves in desperate straits. Imagine a young girl, perhaps 15 or 16 years old, finding herself with no place to sleep. Or realizing that she is hungry but has no money left for food or for bus fare to get to a soup kitchen. Imagine her fear when the nights turn very cold and the clothes on her back are not enough to keep her warm. As a country, we would not, could not and must not ignore this young girl. I bring this resolution to the floor today to raise awareness of the tragedy of runaway youth, to express my appreciation for those who work to prevent runaways and help street children, and to remind my colleagues of the difference our funding decisions make in people's lives.  Many street youth are running from families beleaguered by physical abuse, neglect, parental substance abuse, poverty or serious family conflict. Unlike many homeless adults, who often suffer from mental illness or substance abuse problems, most of these young people are leaving their homes as a reaction to intolerable circumstances. But while the conditions that drive these young people out of their homes may be intolerable, they are almost always preventable or treatable.  As with many problems our society faces, the best way for us to prevent runaway and ``thrownaway'' children from taking to the streets is for our communities to work together. Communities can and must intervene to strengthen families and help youth in high-risk situations. The needs of these families are as diverse as our nation, but the solutions are often as simple as high-quality intervention services from a government, community or faith-based organization. Local organizations offering services to victims of domestic violence, counseling and anger management courses, substance abuse treatment and other social services could make the difference in whether or not a child runs away.  I would like to take a moment to recognize and thank the social workers, counselors, caseworkers, teachers, and volunteers who devote their lives to preventing runaways. The services they offer vary widely, but their intervention may keep a family together and a young person in a healthy home. I would also like to thank the thousands of workers and volunteers who work with runaway youth. It is not always easy to work with young people who may be angry, alienated or addicted to drugs, but the people who go into the streets to find and help these children are capable, committed and caring. They are often the only thing standing between a young person and self-destruction. They help street children find shelter and food, get an education and recover from substance abuse where necessary. They also help them reunite with their families when appropriate, or find a safe alternative. They are truly guardian angels.  Finally, I want to remind my colleagues that many of the local services that can help a struggling family become a healthy home are federally funded. We often see these services as abstract line-items in an appropriations bill: Temporary Assistance to Needy Families, Child Abuse Prevention and Treatment State Grants, and Social Services Block Grants. We must remember that these are not just line-items, they are lifelines to youth who need our help. Given the enormous deficits most States are facing, many of these services are losing critical state resources. As we ensure resources are available for the war against terrorism, we must not abandon our vulnerable young people in their own fight for survival.  The recent White House Conference on Missing, Exploited, and Runaway Children helped to remind us of the fate of thousands of these children. Declaring November to be ``National Runaway Prevention Month'' would build on that reminder. Across our country, communities will undertake activities during November to increase public awareness of the circumstances facing many youth and the need for safe, healthy, and productive alternatives and resources for these children and their families. This resolution puts the United States Senate on record in support of National Runaway Prevention Month and its effort to promote family-based and community-based interventions that prevent young people from running away from home. I urge my colleagues to support our Nation's vulnerable youth by co-sponsoring this resolution and making an effort through their actions or their words to raise awareness of the tragedy of runaway youth.                                 ______                                    SENATE CONCURRENT RESOLUTION 152--DESIGNATING AUGUST 7, 2003, AS                ``NATIONAL PURPLE HEART RECOGNITION DAY''
