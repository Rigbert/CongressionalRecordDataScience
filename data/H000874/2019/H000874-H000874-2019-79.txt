The Senate won't take them up, particularly one bill that says what 90 percent of the American people want done: Pass a comprehensive background check to make their communities safer.  They won't bring it up. No wonder it can't be signed, because they won't bring up any of our bills.  The Republican leadership in the Senate stops our bills from going to the Senate. They are not even being considered.  Then they have a poster that says you haven't passed any bills? Oh, no, we passed them, and the American people support them.  Yes, we had an election in 2018, and the people spoke, which is why I am the majority leader and you are the minority whip.  So, yes, we honor those elections. And when you were in the majority, you passed bills you wanted to pass.  So, I tell my friend, it is an interesting poster, but it is a reflection of the refusal of the Republicans in the United States Senate to consider legislation supported by the overwhelming majority of the American people. How sad.  But, let me ask you again: Are you saying it was right to keep the $391 million, to refuse to have a meeting with Mr. Zelensky at the White House until he agreed to conduct a political investigation that would advantage the President of the United States? Do you believe that was right?
