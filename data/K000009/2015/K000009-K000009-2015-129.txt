Frankly, I think that we, as a country, have to be much more responsive to our miners and to coal country USA. I represent the largest coal shipping port on the Great Lakes. I fully appreciate what you are saying.  I supported that industry from the day I got here. I have supported research into the clean coal program and continue to do so. I just want you to know that. We don't disagree on harming any sector. We need them all.
