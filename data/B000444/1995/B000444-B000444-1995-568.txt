 President, 2 weeks ago, terrorists destroyed the Federal building in Oklahoma City, took hundreds of lives, and destroyed the lives of thousands of others. Federal, State, and local investigators continue the search for those responsible for that heinous act.  In the weeks since the attack, there has been renewed focus on S. 390, the President's comprehensive counterterrorism bill I introducing in February with Senators Specter and Kohl.  Today, I am pleased to join with Senator Daschle and others in introducing expanded counterterrorism legislation, which contains additional proposals to assist law enforcement in the fight against terrorism.  As I said in February, I believe we must take strong action to counteract terrorism. Now, in the wake of the Oklahoma City bombing, it is clear that we must focus our attention not just on foreign terrorists, but on domestic American terrorists as well.  There are steps we can take, and this bill combines them. We should ensure that law enforcement has the tools and resources it needs to effectively investigate and prevent terrorist acts, whatever their origin.  At the same time, we should not, in the heat of the moment, pass legislation that we--and the American public--will later regret. Our freedoms and our Constitution are simply too valuable to be put at risk in a hurried rush to respond to this terrible tragedy.  Several important provisions in this bill come from S. 390, introduced earlier this year. For instance, the bill expands the circumstances in which we can prosecute crimes committed overseas which affect our interests.  It also prohibits persons from raising funds for foreign terrorist organizations, implements treaties on plastic explosives, and takes a number of other important actions.  New provisions in this bill add to that effort by providing enhanced authority to obtain records in foreign counterintelligence investigations through letter requests from the FBI. This allows access to records such as consumer credit reports and hotel/motel records.  Because foreign counter-intelligence investigations may not involve a criminal prosecution, a grand jury subpoena may not be an option in these cases.  This bill now also revises current wiretap laws to provide authorization for wiretaps in connection with any felony if the Department of Justice certifies that it is connected to foreign or domestic terrorism, and it allows for emergency wiretaps in terrorism investigations.  The bill also alters the standards to obtain a so-called roving wiretap--targeted at a person moving from phone to phone or using pay phones.  In addition, the bill allows use of the military to investigate offenses involving chemical and biological weapons.  And it allows the Department of the Treasury to promulgate regulations requiring explosives manufacturers to use methods making the explosives traceable, known as taggants.  While I believe many of the provisions now under consideration in this bill are useful and desirable, I do share some of the concerns about the bill.  Specifically, I want to examine closely the need for and the full scope of the additional authority sought for law enforcement in wiretapping and in collecting records, particularly where domestic groups are targeted.  As I said in February, I am also concerned about the alien terrorist removal provisions, which would allow secret evidence to be used to deport a person.  Our judicial system generally requires that a defendant be given the evidence to be used against him--so that he can prepare a defense. Unseen, unheard evidence simply cannot be defended against, and raises the possibility of erroneous decisions.  I also believe we should look closely at proposals which would ban fundraising for organizations which the President designates as terrorist.  The first amendment rights of association and free speech are at the heart of our system of government. While we should not allow people to knowingly support terrorism, we also must ensure that legitimate political activities are not curtailed.  We must examine these and other issues closely before acting on terrorism legislation.  But I do believe we should act. Americans enjoy freedoms unlike those in any other country on the planet. But freedoms bring responsibilities.  Incidents like the Oklahoma City bombing have no place in our free and democratic society, which allows full expression of all types of political views through legitimate means. There is simply no excuse for turning to violence in a society with open airwaves, uncensored newspapers, and regular and free elections of the peoples' representatives.                                 ______      By
