President, I rise today to make a few comments concerning legislation which I am introducing to deal with the problem of slamming.  Telephone ``slamming'' is the illegal practice of switching a consumer's long distance service without the individual's consent. This problem has increased dramatically over the last several years, as competition between long distance carriers has risen, and slamming is the top consumer complaint lodged at the Federal Communications Commission (FCC), with 11,278 reported complaints in 1995, and 16,500 in 1996. In both 1997 and 1998, more than 20,000 complaints were filed. It is very clear that this problem is on the rise, and unfortunately, this represents only the tip of the iceberg because most consumers never report violations to the FCC. One regional Bell company estimates that 1 in every 20 switches is fraudulent. Media reports indicate that as many as 1 million illegal transfers occur annually. Thus, slamming threatens to rob consumers of the benefit of a competitive market, which is now composed of over 500 companies which generate $72.5 billion in revenues. As a result of slamming, consumers face not only higher phone bills, but also the significant expenditure of time and energy in attempting to identify and reverse the fraud. The results of slamming are clear: higher phone bills and immense consumer frustration.  Mr. President, we are all aware of the stiff competition which occurs for customers in the long distance telephoneservice industry. The goal of deregulating the telecommunications industry was to allow consumers to easily avail themselves of lower prices and better service. Hopefully, this option will soon be presented to consumers for in-state calls and local phone service. Indeed, better service at lower cost is a main objective of those who seek to deregulate the utility industry. Unfortunately, fraud threatens to rob many consumers of the benefits of a competitive industry.  Telemarketing is one of the least expensive and most effective forms of marketing, and it has exponentially expanded in recent years. By statute, the Federal Trade Commission (FTC) regulates most telemarketing, prohibiting deceptive or abusive sales calls, requiring that homes not be called at certain times, and that companies honor a consumer's request not to be called again. The law mandates that records concerning sales be maintained for two years. While the FTC is charged with primary enforcement, the law allows consumers, or state Attorneys General on their behalf, to bring legal action against violators. Yet, phone companies are exempt from these regulations, since they are subject to FCC regulation.  While the FCC has brought action against twenty-two of the industry's largest and smallest firms for slamming violations with penalties totaling over $1.8 million, this represents a minute fraction of the violations. FCC prosecution does not effectively address or deter this serious fraud. State officials have become more aggressive in pursuing violators. The California Public Utility Commission fined a company $2 million in 1997 after 56,000 complaints were filed against it. Arizona, Arkansas, Idaho, Illinois, Kansas, Minnesota, Mississippi, Missouri, New Jersey, Ohio, Vermont, and Wisconsin have all pursued litigation against slammers. Public officials of twenty-five states asked the FCC to adopt tougher rules against slammers.  As directed by the Telecommunications Act of 1996, the FCC has moved to close several loopholes which have allowed slamming to continue unabated. Most important, the FCC has proposed to eliminate the financial incentive which encourages many companies to slam by mandating that customers who are slammed do not have to pay fees to slammers for the first thirty days after the switch occurred. At present, a slammer can retain the profits generated from an illegal switch. Additionally, the FCC has proposed regulations which would require that a carrier confirm all switches generated by telemarketing through either (1) a letter of agency, known as a LOA, from the consumer; (2) a recording of the consumer verifying his or her choice on a toll-free line provided by the carrier; or (3) a record of verification by an appropriately qualified and independent third party. The regulations, which were recently finalized by the FCC, unfortunately have been blocked by court order until long distance carriers have time to analyze the implications of the rules. If and when these rules are finalized, I still believe that these remedies will be wholly inadequate to address the ever-increasing problem of slamming. The problem is that slammed consumers would still be left without conclusive proof that their consent was properly obtained and verified.  My legislation encompasses a three-part approach to stop slamming by strengthening the procedures used to verify consent obtained by marketers; increasing enforcement procedures by allowing citizens or their representatives to pursue slammers in court with the evidence necessary to win; and encouraging all stakeholders to use emerging technology to prevent fraud.  Mr. President, let me also thank the National Association of Attorneys General, the National Association of Regulatory Utility Commissioners which through both their national offices and individual members provided extensive recommendations to improve this bill. Additionally, I have found extremely helpful the input of several groups which advocate on behalf of consumers. I was particularly pleased to work with the Consumer Federation of America to address concerns which its members expressed.  Mr. President, let me take a few minutes to outline the specific provisions of my bill. My legislation requires that a consumer's consent to change service is verified so that discrepancies can be adjudicated quickly and efficiently. Like the 1996 Act, my bill requires a legal switch to include verification. However, my legislation enumerates the necessary elements of a valid verification. First, the bill requires verification to be maintained by the provider, either in the form of a letter from the consumer or by recording verification of the consumer's consent via the phone. The length that the verification must be maintained is to be determined by the FCC. Second, the bill stipulates the form that verification must take. Written verification remains the same as current regulations. Oral verification must include the voice of the subscriber affirmatively demonstrating that she wants her long distance provider to be changed; is authorized to make the change; and is currently verifying an imminent switch. The bill mandates oral verification to be conducted in a separate call from that of the telemarketer, by an independent, disinterested party. This verifying call must promptly disclose the nature and purpose of the call. Third, after a change has been executed, the new service provider must send a letter to the consumer, within five business days of the change in service, informing the consumer that the change, which he requested and verified, has been effected. Fourth, the bill mandates that a copy of verification be provided to the consumer upon request. Finally, the bill requires the FCC to finalize rules implementing these mandates within nine months of enactment of the bill.  These procedures should help ensure that consumers can efficiently avail themselves of the phone service they seek, without being exposed to random and undetectable fraudulent switches. If an individual is switched without his or her consent, the mandate of recorded, maintained verification will provide the consumer with the proof necessary to prove that the switch was illegal.  The second main provision of my legislation would provide consumers, or their public representatives, a legal right to pursue violators in court. Following the model of Senator Hollings' 1991 Telephone Consumer Protection Act, my bill provides aggrieved consumers with a private right of action in any state court which allows, under specific slamming laws or more general consumer protection statutes such an action. The 1991 Act has been adjudicated to withstand constitutional challenges on both equal protection and tenth amendment claims. Thus, the bill has the benefit of specifying one forum in which to resolve illegal switches of all types of service: long distance, in-state, and local service.  Realizing that many individuals will not have the time, resources, or inclination to pursue a civil action, my bill also allows state Attorneys Generals, or other officials authorized by state law, to bring an action on behalf of citizens. Like the private right of action in suits brought by public officials damages are statutorily set at $1,000 or actual damages, whichever is greater. Treble damages are awarded in cases of knowing or willful violations. In addition to monetary awards, states are entitled to seek relief in the form of writs of mandamus, injunction, or similar relief. To ensure a proper role for the FCC, state actions must be brought in a federal district court where the victim or defendant resides. Additionally, state actions must be certified with the Commission, which maintains a right to intervening in an action. The bill makes express the fact that it has no impact on state authority to investigate consumer fraud or bring legal action under any state law.  Finally, Mr. President, my legislation recognizes that neither legislators nor regulators can solve tomorrow's problems with today's technology. Therefore, my bill mandates that the FCC provide Congress with a report on other, less burdensome but more secure means of obtaining and recording consumer consent. Such methods might include utilization of Internet technology or issuing PIN numbers or customer codes to be used before carrier changes are authorized. The bill requires that the FCC report to Congress on such methodology not later than 180 days after enactment of this bill.  Mr. President, I appreciate the opportunity to discuss my initiative to stopslamming. Last year we came close to passing significant anti-slamming legislation. I hope that this issue can be addressed quickly this Congress. As a result, I would urge all my colleagues to cosponsor this legislation.  I ask unanimous consent that the full text of the bill be printed in the Record.  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the Record, as follows:                                S. 1527       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of      the United States of America in Congress assembled,     SECTION 1. FINDINGS; PURPOSE.       (a) Findings.--Congress makes the following findings:       (1) As the telecommunications industry has moved toward      competition in the provision of long distance telephone      services, consumers have increasingly elected to change the      carriers that provide their long distance telephone services.      As many as 50,000,000 consumers now change long distance      telephone service providers each year.       (2) The fluid nature of the market for long distance      telephone services has also allowed an increasing number of      unauthorized changes of telephone service providers to occur.      Such changes have been called ``slamming'', a term which      denotes any practice in which a consumer's long distance      telephone service provider is changed without the consumer's      knowledge or consent.       (3) Slamming accounts for the largest number of consumer      complaints received by the Common Carrier Bureau of the      Federal Communications Commission. As many as 1,000,000      consumers are subject to the unauthorized change of telephone      service providers each year.       (4) The increased costs which consumers face as a result of      the unauthorized change of telephone service providers      threaten to deprive consumers of the financial benefits      created by a competitive marketplace in telephone services.       (5) The burdens placed upon consumers by unauthorized      changes of telephone service providers will expand      exponentially as competition enters into the markets for      intraLATA and local telephone services.       (6) The Telecommunications Act of 1996 sought to combat      unauthorized changes of telephone service providers by      requiring that a provider who changes a subscriber without      authorization pay the previously selected carrier an amount      equal to all charges paid by the subscriber after the change.      The Federal Communications Commission has proposed      regulations to implement this requirement. Implementing these      regulations will eliminate many of the financial incentives      to execute unauthorized changes of telephone service      providers. However, under current and proposed regulations      consumers have, and will continue to face, difficulty in      securing proof of unauthorized changes. Thus, enforcement of      the regulations will be impeded by a lack of tangible proof      of consumer consent to the change of telephone service      providers.       (7) The interests of consumers require that telephone      service providers maintain evidence of their verification of      consumer consent to changes in telephone service providers.      This evidence should take the form of a consumer's written      consent or a recording of a consumer's oral consent obtained      by the telephone service provider or a third party.       (8) Both Congress and the Federal Communications Commission      should continue to examine electronic means by which      consumers could most readily change telephone service      providers while ensuring that such changes would result only      from consumer action evidencing express consent to such      changes.       (9) By providing consumers with a private right of action      in State court, if State law permits, against those who have      executed unauthorized changes of telephone service providers,      Congress insures in a constitutional manner that neither      Federal nor State courts will be overburdened with      litigation, while also providing the proper forum for such      actions given that competition will soon come to all segments      of the telephone service market.       (10) The majority of consumers who have been subject to the      unauthorized change of telephone service do not seek redress      through the Federal Communications Commission. In light of      the general responsibilities of the States for consumer      protection, as well as the prosecutions against unauthorized      changes already undertaken by the States, it is essential      that the States be allowed to pursue actions on behalf of      their citizens, while also preserving the proper role of the      Federal Communications Commission in regulating the      telecommunications industry.       (b) Purposes.--The purposes of this Act are--       (1) to protect consumers from unauthorized changes of      telephone service providers;       (2) to allow the efficient prosecution of legal actions      against telephone service providers who defraud consumers by      transferring telephone service providers without consumer      consent; and       (3) to facilitate the ready selection of telephone service      providers by consumers.
