President, I rise today to take note of the 65th birthday of Robert Juliano.  Robert Juliano has spent more time working on Capitol Hill than most Members of Congress. He is a longtime political adviser, labor representative, and champion of philanthropic causes.  He recently received the Sons of Italy in America 2006 Humanitarian Award for his support of charitable causes, including the National Coalition for Breast Cancer, the Lions Club, and the Crusade of Mercy.  I am proud that Bob hails from the city of Big Shoulders, the son of an Italian immigrant. Bob grew up on the West Side of Chicago and worked in that great city's hotel industry in the 1960s and 1970s starting as an elevator operator. From there, he came to Washington, DC, to serve as legislative representative for the Hotel and Restaurant Employees International Union. He served as chairman and vice chairman of the U.S. Government's Travel and Tourism Advisory Board in the 1980s and 1990s. He has worked to protect the health care benefits of retired miners and worked on nearly every major piece of labor legislation over the last 30 years.  It is clear Bob Juliano never forgot his roots. And he never forgot the workers who need a strong voice for their values. One of the reasons Bob has been so successful is his ability to bring people of all political persuasions together to work on the most pressing issues we face. It is a skill that is in great shortage these days.  I wish Bob Juliano well on his 65th birthday.                          ____________________[Page S6627]From the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]                       TRIBUTE TO ROBERT JULIANO
