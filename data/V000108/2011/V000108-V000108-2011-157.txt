Speaker, it is with sincere admiration that I recognize the Asian American Medical Association, which is hosting its 35th Annual Gala on Saturday, November 5, 2011, at the Avalon Manor in Merrillville, Indiana. Each year, the Asian American Medical Association pays tribute to prominent, outstanding citizens and organizations for their contributions to the community. In recognition of their efforts, these honorees are awarded the prestigious Crystal Globe Award at this annual banquet.  The Asian American Medical Association has always been a great asset to Northwest Indiana. Its members have selflessly dedicated themselves to providing quality medical services to the residents of Indiana's First Congressional District and have always demonstrated exemplary service through their many cultural, scholastic, and charitable endeavors.   At this year's Annual Gala, the Asian American Medical Association will present the Crystal Globe Award to one of Northwest Indiana's finest citizens, Frankie Fesko. For her outstanding accomplishments and charitable contributions to numerous organizations, she is worthy of such an honor.  Frankie graduated from Illiana Christian High School and continued her education, earning a bachelor's degree from Depauw University and a master's degree from Purdue University. Frankie then spent many years as a teacher for the School City of Hammond and the School Town of Munster. She also worked as a Supervising Teacher at Purdue University Calumet in Hammond.  Frankie has been a true inspiration when it comes to community service, devoting much of her time and efforts to serving so many in need throughout Northwest Indiana. Her amazing compassion and generosity led her to become involved in many charitable organizations throughout the years. Frankie has chaired many events including: the Perennial Ball, which is a fundraiser for the Community Cancer Research Foundation, the Share and Love annual luncheon fundraiser for the Cancer Resource Center in Munster, and Briarfest, which benefits a different organization every year and has supported the National Kidney Foundation, Hospice of the Calumet Area, the Humane Society, Campagna Academy, and the Boy Scouts of America. Additionally, Frankie serves as a board member for many charitable organizations including: the Munster Medical Research Foundation, the Community Cancer Research Foundation, and the Legacy Foundation. Frankie serves as Chairwoman of the Board for the Community Foundation of Northwest Indiana, which is a non-profit organization that works to improve the health and quality of life for people in Northwest Indiana. The businesses that the foundation operates include three non-profit hospitals in Northwest Indiana: Community Hospital in Munster, Saint Catherine Hospital in East Chicago, and Saint Mary Medical Center in Hobart. The foundation has also been instrumental in the development of The Center for Visual and Performing Arts, the creation and operation of the Community Cancer Research Centre Foundation, and the donation of land to create the Edward P. Robinson Community Veterans Memorial and Hartsfield Village Retirement Community in Munster. For her exceptional dedication and passionate support to so many charitable endeavors, Frankie was awarded the very first Community Leader Award at the Northwest Indiana's Most Influential Women of the Year Awards Banquet in June 2011.  Mr. Speaker, I ask that you and my other distinguished colleagues join me in commending the Asian American Medical Association, as well as this year's Crystal Globe Award recipient, Frankie Fesko, for their outstanding contributions to their communities and beyond. Their unwavering commitment to improving the quality of life for the people of Northwest Indiana and throughout the United States is truly inspirational. For these reasons, the Asian American Medical Association, its members, and Frankie Fesko are to be recognized, and I am proud to serve as their representative in Washington, DC.                          ____________________
