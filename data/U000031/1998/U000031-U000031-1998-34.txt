Speaker, many of you may not have heard of the passing a few weeks ago of our former colleague, Congressman Garry Brown, who represented southwest Michigan. Through more than a decade of service in the House of Representatives, Garry Brown will be remembered as an ambassador from a more genteel era of politics.  Brown served six terms in the U.S. House of Representatives, from 1966 to 1978, where he was known for his hard work and solid command of the issues. Brown's personal foundation was rooted in his high ethical standards. His belief that Members could remain close friends while disagreeing over the issues helped carry him through some of the most difficult times in our Nation's history.  His service to his Nation was not limited to the House. Preceding his congressional career, Brown was a brave member of our armed services during the Second World War in Japan. After the war, he worked for the FBI before he came home to Schoolcraft, MI, to enter State politics. A delegate to the Michigan Constitutional Convention, he played a major role in crafting the present State constitution.  Later in life, Garry Brown returned to his farm in Schoolcraft, MI, where he spoke of the pride and joy he gained in his role as an elder statesman. He will be remembered as the gentleman from Michigan in every sense of the word. He led his life with dignity, served his community with respect, and lived with a profound love for his country.  Mr. Speaker, please join me in sending my condolences to his daughter, Ms. Frances Brown, and to all of Gerry's family and friends. Congressman Garry Eldridge Brown will be sorely missed by us all.                          ____________________
