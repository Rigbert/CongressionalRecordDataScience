 President, following morning business, the Senate will resume consideration of S. 1637. When the Senate resumes the bill in the morning, the Dodd amendment on outsourcing will be the pending business. It is my expectation that a second-degree amendment will be offered to the Dodd amendment tomorrow morning.  For the remainder of the day, we will continue to work through amendments to the bill. Under the previous order, following the disposition of the Dodd amendment, the Senate will take up an amendment by Senator Bunning which would accelerate manufacturing sector tax cuts. Senators will be notified when the first vote is scheduled.                          ____________________
