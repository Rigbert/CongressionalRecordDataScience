'' But if it does not come before the floor of the House, they do not have to make that vote.  Now, we are running out of time. The gentleman from Oregon (Mr. DeFazio) has recently made I think a very important contribution in terms of this whole discussion over Social Security. As the gentleman knows, we hear very often about how Social Security is going bankrupt, there is no money in it, and blah, blah, blah, which happens to be untrue.  Right now, if the United States Congress does nothing, which I think is not a good idea, I think we should act, Social Security will be able to pay out every benefit owed to every eligible American for the next 34 years. So that is not a system on the verge of bankruptcy. But as we become an older society and as people live longer, there are problems that we must address.  I know the gentleman has just recently introduced very, I think, interesting Social Security legislation.  Mr. DeFAZIO. Yes. Just one point beyond that for people who are being stampeded into the idea that we have to destroy the system to save it.  Even if Congress did nothing, as the gentleman says, for 35 years Social Security could deliver on 100 percent of promised benefits and after that 73 to 75 percent of promised benefits into the indefinite future. That means it has a 25-percent that starts 35 years from now.  Does that sound like a system we need to destroy, the most successful social system this country has ever seen that has been responsible for lifting tens of millions of seniors out of poverty?
