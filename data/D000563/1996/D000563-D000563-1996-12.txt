Speaker, I think for a moment here I would like to reflect on what the 104th Congress has not done. This 104th Congress, led by the Republicans for the first time in 4 decades, has not done several things. We can applaud the fact that they have not done a few things. For example, the Gingrich-Dole-Lott plan to cut $270 billion out of Medicare to provide tax breaks for wealthy people, thank goodness President Clinton was there to veto that effort. Because for a lot of senior citizens it would have meant higher premiums and for families it would have meant a greater economic burden. A lot of those families are middle-income families struggling to getby. The people on the Republican side of the aisle argued that these tax breaks for wealthy people would somehow fuel the economy. If you just give the rich more money, they sense that somehow this economy will move forward. Well, President Clinton disagreed with that, I disagreed with it, and many Democratic leaders did as well. What we have to show for that decision to veto the Gingrich plan is an economy that truly is moving forward. We have seen 10 million new jobs created since President Clinton was elected as President. One might say, ``Well, I'm sure every President does something like that, don't they?'' Take a look back at the years of President George Bush. Over a 4-year period of time, we created 2 million new jobs in America, the slowest job creation in 50 years, and the slowest economic growth in half a century. Fortunately President Clinton's plan to reduce the deficit and get the economy moving forward again worked very well in creating jobs and bringing down interest rates.  For a lot of families across America, my own family included, we were able to refinance our home mortgage which meant a lower monthly payment. In fact we now find that we have the highest home ownership rate in 15 years in the United States. If we are talking about realizing the American dream and moving the economy forward, certainly job creation and home ownership are two things that are part of it.  Let me add one other element, reducing the deficit. The Republicans like to talk about being fiscally responsible, reducing the deficit. They tend to overlook the fact that under Presidents Reagan and Bush we had the most dramatic increases in the national deficit in the history of the United States of America. President Clinton came in and said, ``I'm going to push a plan that's going to bring the deficit down and yet not strangle the economy.'' And it worked. We are now about to see the fourth straight year of deficit reduction in Washington, with no thanks to the Republican side of the aisle which did not give the President one single vote in the House or the Senate for his deficit reduction plan. Because of the deficit plan by the President, we have seen the deficit come down 4 straight years. The last time that occurred was the 1840's, over 150 years ago.  Mr. Speaker, things are moving forward. But there are things that this Republican Congress has failed to do which should be done in the closing weeks. There will be a lot of speeches, a lot of efforts by Members on the other side to somehow paint a pretty picture about the days of Newt Gingrich and Bob Dole and Trent Lott. They want to erase the image out of people's minds of this gridlocked Congress with the two longest Government shutdowns in our history. They want to try to get this image out of their minds of petulance and arrogance and say that perhaps we have accomplished great things.  Let us hope that beyond the speeches, they will do a couple of tangible things: First, pass the increase in the minimum wage. How in the world can we say to 500,000 people in my home State of Illinois who got up this morning, went to work, got the kids off to day care or to some summer program, went to a tough job, making $4.25, $4.50 an hour, that that is as good as it gets in America? Over the years we have increased that minimum wage so that young people starting out, so that families working to try to keep things together have a fighting chance. But the Republicans tried to stop us here in the House, they have tried to stop us in the Senate, and that bill even though it has passed both Chambers now, because a few Republicans defected and joined the Democrats, is still stalled. Why in the world have we not passed this minimum wage increase? We owe it to these working families.  Health care. If you talk to families across this country, one of their biggest single concerns is health insurance. The Kennedy-Kassebaum bill, a bipartisan bill by Senator Kennedy and Senator Kassebaum, passed the Senate by a margin of 100 to 0. What it says is you cannot discriminate against people because of preexisting medical conditions when you sell insurance and you ought to be able to move your insurance from job to job and not be afraid to lose it. Simple, honest principles. We should see something positive come out of this Congress for working families across America.                          ____________________
