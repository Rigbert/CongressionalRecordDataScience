President, I rise to introduce a bill today which is cosponsored by at least 20 of my colleagues in the Senate, a bipartisan offering on an issue which I came to be familiar with over 10 years ago. I traveled to the country of Bangladesh. It is not exactly on the itinerary of favorite congressional trips because it is a country which, although it is large and very interesting, has had its share of misfortune. It seems whenever any natural disaster would strike in the world it would stop in Bangladesh. We, of course, conjure an image in our mind of people who have suffered through typhoons and tornadoes and flooding and all sorts of deprivation. It is a very poor country.
