 President, today I am introducing legislation which, when enacted, will modify the treatment of certain veterans benefits received by veterans who reside in State veterans homes and whose careand treatment is paid for by the Medicaid program. I am joined in introducing this bill by Senator Graham.  Veterans residing in State veterans homes, who are eligible for aid and attendance [AA] and unusual medical expense [UME] benefits, veterans benefits provided under title 38 of the United States Code, who are also eligible for Medicaid, are the only veterans in nursing homes who receive, and who are able to keep, the entire AA and UME benefit amounts. This can be as much as $1,000 per month.  Other veterans, who reside in other types of nursing homes are receiving Medicaid, and who are also eligible for AA/UME can receive only 90 per month from the VA.  Yet, other veterans who reside in State veterans homes but who are not eligible for the AA/UME benefits must contribute all but $90 of their income to the cost of their care.  So, even though veterans residing in State veterans homes who are eligible for AA and UME benefits and who qualify for Medicaid have all of their treatment and living expense paid by the State Medicaid program, they nevertheless may keep as much as $1,000 per month of the AA and UME benefits.  It might be useful for me to review how this state of affairs came to be.  In 1990, legislation was enacted, Public Law 101-508, November 5, 1990, which modified title 38, the veterans benefits title of the United States Code, to stipulate that veterans with no dependents, on title XIX, residing in nursing homes, and eligible for AA and UME, could receive only a $90 per month personal expense allowance from the VA, rather than the full UME and AA amounts.  State veterans homes were subsequently exempted from the definition of nursing homes which had been contained in those earlier provisions of Public Law 101-508 by legislation enacted in 1991, Public Law 102-40, May 7, 1991.  The result was that veterans on title XIX and residing in State nursing homes continued to receive UME and AA. Until recently, the State veterans homes followed a policy of requiring that all but $90 per month of these allowances be used to defray the cost of care in the Home.  Then, a series of Federal court decisions held that neither UME nor AA could be considered income. The court decisions appeared to focus on the definition of income used in pre- and post-eligibility income determinations for Medicaid. The court decisions essentially held that UME and AA payments to veterans did not constitute income for the purpose of post-eligibility income determination. The reasoning was that, since these monies typically were used by veterans to defray the cost of certain series they were receiving, the payments constituted a ``wash'' for purposes of income gain by the veterans.  However, the frame of reference for the courts' decisions was not a nursing home environment in which a veteran receiving Medicaid benefits might find himself or herself. In other words, the UME and AA payment received by a veteran on Medicaid are provided to a veteran for services for which the State is already paying through the Medicaid program. The veteran is not paying for these services with their own income. So, as a consequence of the court decisions, these payments to the veteran in State veterans homes represent a net gain in income to the veteran; they are not paid out by the veteran to defray the cost of services the veteran is receiving.  VA does not pay AA or UME to veterans who are also on title XIX and residing in non-State veterans home nursing homes. Those veterans get only a $90 per month personal allowance.  And non-Medicaid eligible veterans who reside in State veterans homes must pay for services with their own funds. If they get UME and AA payments, the State veterans homes will take all but $90 of those sums to help defray the cost of the nursing home care.  Although the written record does not document this, I believe that the purpose of exempting the State veterans homes was to allow the Homes to continue to collect all but $90 of the UME and AA paid to the eligible veteran so as to enable State veterans homes to provide service to more veterans than they otherwise would be able to provide.  In any case, it seems highly unlikely that the purpose of exempting State veterans homes would have been to allow these veterans, and only these among similarly situated veterans, to retain the entire UME and A amounts.  The legislation I am introducing today modifies section 1902(r)(1) of the Social Security Act to stipulate that, for purposes of the post-eligibility treatment of income of individuals who are institutionalized, and on title 19, the payments received under a Department of Veterans Affairs pension or compensation program, including aid and attendance and unusual medical expense payments, may be taken into account.                                 ______                                       By
