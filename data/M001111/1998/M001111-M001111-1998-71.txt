  I rise to join with Senator Burns in fully endorsing this amendment to the Armed Services bill. Chairman Stevens, Senator Byrd, Senator Inouye, Senator Burns and myself have cosponsored this amendment with the sole intention of providing essential quality of life programs and initiatives for our men and women in uniform.  Increasingly over the last few years, military construction has been given the shorter end of the stick in terms of adequate funding. Congress has always stood by our services, and managed to increase funding where we thought an increase was necessary.  Again, this year we face a similar situation, with the budget request at $1.4 billion less than what we appropriated last year.
