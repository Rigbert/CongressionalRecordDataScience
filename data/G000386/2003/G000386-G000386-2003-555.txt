 There are approximately 25 amendments that will need to be disposed of. Following the votes on the pending amendments, additional amendments are possible and therefore this is going to be a very lengthy voting sequence. All Members are urged to remain close to the Chamber during this so-called vote-arama in order to expedite passage of this bill.  I also ask that any Member who intends to offer an amendment during tomorrow's session contact the chairman and ranking member of the Finance Committee. We are not encouraging additional amendments. However, it would be helpful to know in advance the substance of the amendment to be offered. The majority leader has stated that we will finish the jobs and economic growth bill on Thursday.  Under a previous order, following passage of the jobs and economic growth bill, the Senate will begin consideration of H.R. 1298, the Global HIV/AIDS bill. The majority leader has also stated it is his intention to complete action on this vital legislation this week as well.  Finally, I say to my colleagues that tomorrow will be a very busy session, with numerous rollcall votes. With the cooperation of all Members, we can finish our work on these two bills in an orderly way.                          ____________________
