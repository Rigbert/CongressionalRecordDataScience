President. Let me quote a few words from it. This is a letter to me, dated May 2:       Dear Senator Durbin:       We understand that some in the financial services industry      are claiming that the Durbin Amendment exemption from      interchange ``swipe fee'' regulation for financial      institutions with assets under $10 billion will not be      effective in practice because merchants will discriminate      against debit cards with higher swipe fees. On behalf of the      undersigned trade associations, and the tens of thousands of      merchants and retail locations we represent, we are writing      to make clear that we have no contractual or practical      ability to treat debit cards issued by small financial      institutions or credit unions differently than those issued      by large institutions. Furthermore, our member companies are      committed to customer service and it is not in their interest      to discriminate against debit cards that so many customers      carry.       Currently, merchants are subject to Visa and MasterCard      network rules that require us to accept all Visa and/or      MasterCard debit, regardless of which bank or credit union      issues the card. This is called the Honor All Cards rule and      we risk the threat of $5,000 per day fines--or higher--if we      break this rule, so we assure you that merchants have no      intention of violating this term of brand acceptance. These      rules also prevent merchants from pricing goods differently      based on the financial institution that issued the card.  The No. 1 complaint of community banks and credit unions about discrimination against their cards is addressed directly by this letter. I have made this a part of the Record. It is being sent to every Member of the Senate.  There is a second part of this argument. The question is whether Visa and MasterCard, the networks, will continue to allow the community banks and credit unions to charge a higher interchange fee than the big banks. Under our law, there is no reason to change it. So I am challenging Visa and MasterCard and these card networks to state clearly and unequivocally, as this letter has stated, that they will not discriminate against these smaller banks, community banks, and credit unions. The merchants have come forward as a matter of record, and it has been put in the Congressional Record this day, to say there will be no discrimination. At the end of the day, if Visa and MasterCard will make the same promise of no discrimination, then ultimately there is no disadvantage to the community banks and credit unions. None. Now the burden is on the big credit card networks to step up to the plate.  I am sending a letter today to the president and CEO of the Illinois Bankers Association, the Illinois Credit Union League and the Community Bankers Association of Illinois and we are going to send it to their national affiliates as well, sending them a copy of this merchants letter so they can no longer make the claim that they are going to be victims of discrimination by merchants and retailers and asking them to now step up and join us in challenging Visa and MasterCard and the major card networks. That, to me, resolves the most fundamental issue that has been brought to the Members of the Senate. They can no longer claim that these retailers are going to discriminate against them. As a matter of record, they will not.  I think it is important for us to change this system, and I think it is important for these virtual monopolies of Visa and MasterCard to be held accountable. I think what we have done in passing this law and giving the Federal Reserve the authority to establish this rule is the right thing to do.  Now there is a big effort afoot to stop us. The Presiding Officer knows that. They are lobbying such as I have never seen before on Capitol Hill. You would think there was $1 billion a month at stake, and there is. They are determined to stop the Federal Reserve from issuing a rule which says that retailers and merchants across America will be treated fairly. They are going to stop them, if they can, and I am going to fight them all the way. I am hoping my colleagues who joined me in this vote and those who share my feelings about small business across America will stand with me.  I know the alternative. The largest banks in America and the credit card companies have a lot of friends, and they are very powerful, but I think we ought to give the Federal Reserve the chance to issue reasonable final rules.  In fact, talk to any bank across the country, and they are going to tell you that the current system is working just fine. They don't want reform. They don't want any change. Theywant to keep it as is. It is worth billions of dollars to the major banks to keep this charge as is, at the expense of businesses across America.  I favor transparency and I favor competition and I wish we didn't have to bring the Federal Reserve into this conversation. But we looked for a neutral regulatory agency that would establish a reasonable and impartial fee, promulgate a rule, issue it after a public comment period and implement it, and that is what we are striving to do.  The CEO of JPMorgan Chase, who is a friend of mine--or at least he used to be--Jamie Dimon, has called interchange reform downright idiotic. He spent a good portion of his recent annual shareholder letter criticizing this reform. Chase has also sent a letter to its customers warning about my amendment, and Chase is constantly threatening to raise fees on its customers unless they stop the Durbin amendment. A few weeks ago, I sent Jamie Dimon a letter and responded to some of his criticisms. I ask unanimous consent that the letter be printed in the Record.  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in the Record, as follows:                                                      U.S. Senate,                                   Washington, DC, April 12, 2011.     Jamie Dimon,     Chief Executive Officer and President, JPMorgan Chase & Co.,          New York, NY.       Dear Mr. Dimon: In your recent annual letter to your      company's shareholders, you wrote a lengthy and dismissive      critique of the debit interchange fee reform legislation that      I drafted and that Congress enacted last year. You have also      been quoted describing my amendment as ``counterproductive,''      ``price fixing at its worst,'' and ``downright idiotic.'' I      am compelled to respond, and I ask that you share this      response with your shareholders as well as your customers.       Clearly, debit interchange reform has displeased many in      the financial services industry. Your industry is used to      getting its way with many members of Congress and with your      regulators, and my amendment and the Federal Reserve's draft      regulations were not written the way you wanted. But that      does not mean they were written poorly or that the process      that created them was flawed. To the contrary, interchange      reform will carefully but firmly rein in the fee collusion      that your bank and thousands of other banks currently engage      in through Visa and MasterCard. The wisdom of this reform is      confirmed by the irrationality of the arguments that your      industry raises against it--arguments that are based upon      misrepresentations and threats rather than evidence or logic.       The American people deserve to know the real story about      the interchange fee system and the ways that banks in      general--and Chase in particular--have abused that system. I      have said and written much on this topic already, but I will      respond to five of your specific criticisms below.       1. Your letter claims that my reform amendment ``is an      example of a policy that has little basis in fact or      analysis.'' In fact, the amendment was drafted based upon      years of Congressional hearings, Government Accountability      Office reports, academic articles, and published studies by      the Federal Reserve's economists and payment system experts.      These analyses showed that the debit interchange system is      uncompetitive, inefficient, and harmful to consumers. Your      industry often acts like these analyses do not exist, so I      will explain what they reveal.       The debit interchange system is not a properly functioning      market. For years, card-issuing banks like Chase have agreed      to let the Visa and MasterCard duopoly fix the interchange      fee rates that banks receive from merchants each time a debit      card is swiped. The banks get the fees but they do not set      the fees. This system of price-fixing by Visa and MasterCard      on behalf of thousands of banks has gone entirely      unregulated.       There are two core problems with Visa and MasterCard's      fixing of interchange rates. First, centralized rate-fixing      does not give card-issuing banks incentive to manage their      operational and fraud costs efficiently. This is because all      banks in the network are guaranteed the same network-fixed      interchange rate whether they are efficient or inefficient.      Competition is absent and inefficiency is subsidized when      fees are set in this manner.       Second, Visa and MasterCard have incentive to constantly      increase interchange rates and there is no countervailing      market force to temper these fee increases. Visa and      MasterCard want as many of their debit cards to be swiped as      possible because they are paid a network fee by merchants      each time a card is swiped. By raising interchange rates,      Visa and MasterCard can entice banks to issue more of their      cards. Because Visa and MasterCard have enormous market power      and control around 80 percent of the debit cards in      consumers' wallets, merchants cannot realistically say no to      accepting Visa and MasterCard and have no leverage to      negotiate fee rates with them. There is no naturally-     occurring market force in today's interchange system that      would ever lead rates to go down.       So merchants are stuck with ever-rising debit interchange      fees that add up to more than $16 billion each year. These      fees not only affect merchants, but also universities,      charities, government agencies and all others who accepts      debit cards as payment. The fees end up getting passed on to      consumers in the form of higher retail prices for groceries      and gas. Consumers, and particularly unbanked consumers,      ultimately bear the cost of subsidizing the interchange      system.       We owe it to our nation's consumers and businesses to      ensure that the interchange system is efficient, transparent,      and subject to competitive market forces. Studies have shown      that Americans pay the highest debit interchange rates in the      world, and that these rates have continued to increase in      recent years. The Federal Reserve has also found that the      high interchange rates charged today far exceed what it      actually costs to conduct a debit transaction. Nearly every      other industrialized country has established reasonable      regulation over their debit systems, and these countries have      achieved improved efficiency, lower fraud, and consumer      benefits. The time has come for reasonable reform of the      dysfunctional U.S. debit interchange system, and my amendment      will make that reform a reality.       2. You say that ``it's a terrible mistake and also bad      policy for the government to get involved in price fixing.''      Of course, my amendment does not create price fixing--it      constrains the price fixing that Visa and MasterCard      currently perform on banks' behalf. Visa and MasterCard      cannot simply be trusted to fix interchange prices in a way      that is fair for all participants in the debit card system.      They have not proven worthy of that trust.       Last year Congress decided that there should be reasonable      regulatory constraints placed on Visa and MasterCard to      ensure that they cannot use their market dominance to funnel      excessive interchange fees to the nation's biggest banks. A      strong bipartisan majority supported my amendment, which said      that if Visa and MasterCard are going to fix fee rates on      behalf of banks with over $10 billion in assets, those rates      must be reasonable and proportional to the cost of processing      the transaction. It is important to make clear that if Chase      wants to set and charge its own fees in a competitive market      environment, the amendment does not regulate those fees. The      only regulated fees are those fees that banks let card      networks fix on their behalf.       3. You criticize the law Congress passed because it does      not consider ``the cost of fraud.'' Your comment highlights      how the current interchange system, which supposedly does      consider the cost of fraud, creates exactly the wrong      incentives when it comes to fraud prevention. Fraud rates are      far lower for PIN debit transactions than for signature debit      transactions, but Visa and MasterCard set higher interchange      fees for signature debit than for PIN ostensibly to cover the      higher cost of fraud. Banks now urge cardholders to pay with      signature in order to get the higher fees. For example, on      April 21, 2010, the American Banker reported that your own      bank sent a mailing to your debit customers that strongly      suggested they should ``always select'' signature.       Chase's practice of steering American cardholders toward      fraud-prone signature debit stands in stark contrast to      Chase's practices in Canada. The Chase Canada website      indicates that ``chip and PIN technology will become      available for all Chase Canada MasterCard and Visa cards in      2011.'' Your Canadian-based subsidiary Chase Paymentech      Solutions says on its website that chip and PIN technology      provides ``Enhanced Security and Fraud Reduction--Chip      technology is virtually impossible to copy and combining its      use with a PIN helps reduce lost, stolen or counterfeit      transactions.'' It is frankly inexcusable that your bank      would urge your American customers to ``always select'' a      fraud-prone technology while you provide your Canadian      customers with technology that enhances security and reduces      fraud.       In contrast to the current U.S. interchange system which      rewards banks for promoting fraud-prone signature debit, my      amendment will allow interchange fee increases only to those      banks that successfully prevent fraud. The Federal Reserve      can implement this in its final rulemaking by setting target      fraud prevention metrics and allowing increased interchange      for banks that meet those targets.       4. You say that Chase needs debit interchange fees to pay      for the ``fixed costs of servicing checking accounts and      debit cards'' such as ``printing and mailing of the cards,''      ``operational and call center support to service the cards,''      and ``the costs of ATMs and branches.'' Here you are using      the old financial industry trick of first conflating the cost      of conducting debit card transactions with the cost of      offering other checking account-related services, and then      arguing that network-fixed debit interchange rates should be      used to cover this whole basket of costs. It is a clever      argument that aims to justify Visa's and MasterCard's      exorbitant price-fixed rates, but the shortcomings of this      argument are evident.       The costs you cite in your letter are costs which banks      should be incentivized to manage efficiently, and allowing      Visa to fix interchange fee rates across all its member banks      to supposedly cover these costs is a recipe for inefficiency      and excess. Card network companies like Visa are not      positioned to know what the appropriate level of cost is     for operating ``ATMs and branches,'' nor are they equipped to      determine how much of a particular bank's ``printing,''      ``mailing,'' ``operational'' and ``call center'' costs are      attributable to debit cards instead of ATM cards or credit      cards. Further, Visa has no way of knowing if a particular      bank is using debit interchange revenue not to cover      legitimate costs but instead for rewards, ads, profit, or      executive bonuses. Indeed, because Visa itself profits by      incentivizing banks to issue more and more of its cards, Visa      has every incentive to inflate the interchange fees it fixes      to levels that compensate banks far in excess of their costs.      In order to correct these incentives for inefficiency and      excess, my amendment limits network interchange price-fixing      on behalf of the 3 biggest banks to an amount that is      reasonable and proportional to the costs that are necessary      to authorize, clear and settle a particular debit transaction      over the network's wires.       Also, your claim that interchange fees must be high enough      to cover all checking account-related costs is undermined by      the fact that banks also charge many other high consumer fees      under the premise of covering those exact same costs. Banks      like Chase charge consumers many fees for maintaining and      accessing funds in their checking accounts--monthly fees,      overdraft fees, failed payment fees, ATM withdrawal fees,      failure to maintain a minimum balance fees, account closing      fees, and more. Bank revenues from these consumer fees have      not gone down in recent years as interchange fee revenues      have gone up; to the contrary, bank revenues from consumer      fees have also reached record highs. I would draw your      attention to the November 12, 2008, Wall Street Journal      article entitled ``Banks Boost Customer Fees to Record      Highs'' and the July 1, 2009, New York Times article entitled      ``Bank Fees Rise as Lenders Try to Offset Losses,'' both of      which discuss your bank and other banks' efforts to raise      consumer fees long before my amendment was ever written.       5. You say that the amendment ``potentially will harm      consumers'' because ``banks will be forced to lose money on      debit interchange transactions and likely will compensate by      increasing fees in some way for deposit customers.'' This      threat defies both facts and logic.       First, there is no evidence that banks cannot continue to      offer debit cards profitably with reduced interchange. As      Andrew Martin explained in the excellent January 4, 2010, New      York Times article entitled ``How Visa, Using Card Fees,      Dominates a Market,'' up through the early 1990s banks used      to offer debit cards even though they received no interchange      fees. In fact, many banks used to pay merchants for accepting      debit cards, because debit cards saved money for banks when      compared to the banks' costs of processing paper checks. The      current high-fee debit interchange system in this country      only developed because Visa entered into and took over the      debit market the mid-1990s through an antitrust violation,      and Visa then imported credit card-type interchange fees into      the debit space. Studies have shown that many other countries      enjoy vibrant debit systems with interchange fees strictly      regulated or prohibited entirely. In short, past experience      in this country and present examples in other countries      demonstrate that banks like Chase can easily continue to      offer debit card services without the excessive subsidy of      high interchange fees.       Second, if Chase follows through on threats to increase      consumer fees (beyond those increases you have already made      in recent years), market competition would suggest that many      of your deposit customers would take their business      elsewhere. In fact, many of those customers would likely take      their business to the small banks and credit unions who are      exempted from my amendment's interchange fee regulation and      for whom Visa and other debit networks have already agreed to      set a higher tier of interchange rates. And for those who      continue to speculate that my amendment will hurt small banks      and credit unions, I recommend they read Simon Johnson's      excellent analysis in the April 7 New York Times entitled      ``Big Banks Have a Powerful New Opponent.''       In conclusion, I recognize that Chase will likely see      decreased revenue from interchange reform, but I urge you to      keep some perspective. Last year Chase had $17.4 billion in      profits--up 48 percent from the previous year--and a 15      percent profit margin. Your own personal compensation      ``jumped nearly 1,500 percent to $20.8 million in 2010''      according to Reuters. In contrast, middle-class American      families are struggling to get by in a tough economy--an      economy that went south because of the banking industry's      unregulated excesses.       There is no need for you to threaten your customers with      higher fees when you and your bank are already making money      hand-over-fist. And there is no need to make such threats in      response to reform that simply tries to spare consumers from      bearing the cost of interchange fees that are anticompetitive      and unreasonably high.       Interchange reform is necessary and it is long overdue.      Right now the Fed is working diligently to craft a set of      final regulations that will reflect the comprehensive      information it has gathered and that will respond to the      valuable comments it has received. In the coming weeks I am      confident the Fed will produce a reasonable set of reforms      that will enhance the efficiency, competitiveness and      fairness of the debit system. This will neither be      ``counterproductive'' nor ``idiotic.'' It will be good news      for all Americans.           Sincerely,                                                Richard J. Durbin,                                            United States Senator.
