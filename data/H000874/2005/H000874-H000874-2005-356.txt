Speaker, we talk a lot about families on this floor, and properly so. We talk a lot about caring on this floor, and properly so. We talk a lot about relationships on this floor, and properly so.  And I am proud to rise today to say how pleased I am, and I know all Members of the House will be, the youngest Member on our side of the aisle is the gentleman from Oklahoma (Mr. Boren), and the gentleman from Oklahoma (Mr. Boren) this weekend took to himself a beautiful bride from South Dakota, Andrea.  Let us wish them well as they embark upon this new family.                          ____________________
