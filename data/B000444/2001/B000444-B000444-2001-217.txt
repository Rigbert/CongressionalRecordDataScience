 President, today I am reintroducing legislation to authorize the establishment of nonprofit entities to provide grants and other assistance for international educational, cultural and arts programs through the Department of State. This is an initiative that was developed last year in discussions with officials of the Department of State. I am pleased to be joined by Representative Jim Leach of the other body, who is introducing the same bill today.  We are in an era in which cultural issues are increasingly central to international issues and diplomacy. Trade disputes, ethnic and regional conflicts, and issues such as biotechnology all have cultural and intellectual underpinnings.  Cultural programs are increasingly necessary to promoting international understanding and achieving U.S. national objectives. American multinational companies and other Americans doing business overseas welcome opportunities to support the unique cultures of nations in which they do business, as well as telling the story of America's diversity in other countries.  One way they could do this is by helping to sponsor cultural exchange programs arranged through the Department of State. Department officials tells us, however, that there is apparently no easy way to do that. Moreover, many people in our own government are uncertain whether they should engage in presenting the creative, intellectual and cultural side of our nation.  Under this legislation Congress would authorize the Secretary of State to provide for the establishment of private nonprofit organizations to assist in supporting international cultural programs, making it both easy and attractive for private organizations to support cultural programs in cooperation with the Department of State. In so doing, we would affirm support for the promotion and presentation of the nation's intellectual and creative best as part of American diplomacy.  This initiative would support a broad range of cultural exchange programs. Its priority would be to support the organization and promotion of major, high-profile presentations of art exhibitions, musical and theatrical performances which represent the finest quality of creativity our nation produces. These should be presentations that reach large numbers of people, which contribute to achieving our national interests and which represent the diversity of American culture.  The bill would provide authority to solicit support for specific cultural endeavors, offering individuals, foundations, corporations and other American businesses engaged overseas the opportunity to publicly support cross-cultural understanding in countries where they do business.  The non-profit entity would work with the Bureau of Educational and Cultural Affairs as well as the Under Secretary for Public Diplomacy at the Department of State.  I understand that the House International Relations Committee is planning to consider a version of this bill later this week. I look forward to working with my colleagues in the Senate on this legislation in the coming weeks.  I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be printed in the Record.  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the Record, as follows:                                 S. 579       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of      the United States of America in Congress assembled,     SECTION 1. FINDINGS.       The Congress makes the following findings:       (1) It is in the national interest of the United States to      promote mutual understanding between the people of the United      States and other nations.       (2) Among the means to be used in achieving this objective      are a wide range of international educational and cultural      exchange programs, including the J. William Fulbright      Educational Exchange Program and the International Visitors      Program.       (3) Cultural diplomacy, especially the presentation abroad      of the finest of the creative, visual, and performing arts of      the United States, is an especially effective means of      advancing the United States national interest.       (4) The financial support available for international      cultural and scholarly exchanges has declined by      approximately 10 percent in recent years.       (5) There has been a dramatic decline in the amount of      funds available for the purpose of ensuring that the      excellence, diversity, and vitality of the arts in the United      States are presented to foreign audiences by and in      cooperation with United States diplomatic and consular      representatives.       (6) One of the ways to deepen and expand cultural and      educational exchange programs is through the establishment of      nonprofit entities to encourage the participation and      financial support of multinational companies and other      private sector contributors.       (7) The United States private sector should be encouraged      to cooperate closely with the Secretary of State and the      Secretary's representatives to expand and spread appreciation      of United States cultural and artistic accomplishments.     SEC. 2. AUTHORITY TO ESTABLISH NONPROFIT ENTITIES.       Section 105(f) of the Mutual Educational and Cultural      Exchange Act of 1961 (22 U.S.C. 2455(f)) is further amended--       (1) by inserting ``(1)'' after ``(f)''; and       (2) by adding at the end the following new paragraphs:       ``(2) The Secretary of State is authorized to provide for      the establishment of private, nonprofit entities to assist in      carrying out the purposes of the Act. Any such entity shall      not be considered an agency or instrumentality of the United      States Government, nor shall its employees be considered      employees of the United States Government for any purposes.       ``(3) The entities may, among other functions--       ``(A) encourage United States multinational companies and      other elements of the private sector to participate in, and      support, cultural, arts, and educational exchange programs,      including those programs that will enhance international      appreciation of the cultural and artistic accomplishments of      the United States;       ``(B) solicit and receive contributions from the private      sector to support these cultural arts and educational      exchange programs; and       ``(C) provide grants and other assistance for these      programs.       ``(4) The Secretary of State is authorized to make such      arrangements as are necessary to carry out the purposes of      these entities, including--       ``(A) the solicitation and receipt of funds for the entity;       ``(B) designation of a program in recognition of such      contributions; and       ``(C) designation of members, including employees of the      United States Government, on any board or other body      established to administer the entity.       ``(5) Any funds available to the Department of State may be      made available to such entities to cover administrative and      other costs for their establishment. Any such entity is      authorized to invest any amount provided to it by the      Department of State, and such amount, as well as any interest      or earnings on such amount, may be used by the entity to      carry out its purposes.''.                                 ______                                       By
