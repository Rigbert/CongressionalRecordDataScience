President, many of us have advanced or supported campaign finance reform legislation for many years, but without having the votes to prevail or even to obtain a full debate. Successful legislation to reform campaign finance laws usually has had to follow on the heels of particular campaign finance scandals, such as the Watergate affair.  It is different this time. The reason that campaign finance reform has been given a prominent and early place on the Senate's calendar is that sufficient support has risen up from the grassroots to ensure that this debate takes place. Hundreds of thousands of Americans have signed petitions or called their representatives in Congress. Rallies have been mounted in cities and towns from coast to coast. And Senators McCain and Feingold have built enough political capital for this bill that, in a very real sense, on this issue they have become the public's messengers to the Congress.  I commend our Senate leaders, as well as Senators McCain and Feingold, for creating a framework for this debate that has contributed to its constructiveness. This is the kind of open debate that was usual when I joined the Senate 26 years ago but that has become rarer in recent years. The Senate tends to be at its best in open debate like this.  Washington has spent much of the first 3 months of this year fulfilling President Bush's perceived mandate to make the Nation safer for huge corporations. Let us count some of the ways. First, Congress rushed to make its first order of business the repeal of the Department of Labor's 10-year quest to refine and implement ergonomics regulations to make workplaces safer for the American people. Next Congress spent weeks on a bankruptcy bill that lobbyists had convinced us to skew so that it would further increase the record profits of credit card companies. And now, in rapid-fire succession, the White House is rolling back one environmental protection after another, affecting the very air we breathe and the water we drink.  At last, with this debate, we are finally tackling one of the true priorities of the American people: the mandate that Senator McCain earned with his extraordinary grassroots campaign to reform the way we finance our elections. We all owe Senators McCain and Feingold a debt for their dedicated and persistent support of such an important and necessary improvement to our election process, and I am proud to be a cosponsor of their bill.  The main component of the McCain-Feingold bill is a giant step toward eliminating soft money from the electoral process. The raising and spending of soft money proliferated tremendously since we last amended the Federal Election Campaign Act in 1979. In 1984, both political parties raised $22 million in soft money. In the 2000 election cycle, they raised $463 million in soft money alone. The political parties raised more than 20 times as much in soft money last year than they did in 1984. The hundreds of millions of dollars that flow into campaigns without any accountability increase the likelihood that money will have a corrupting influence on our electoral system.  The American people are being bombarded with television advertisements, mailings and newspaper ads funded by soft money. Often, theamount of money being spent by candidates themselves is dwarfed by the amount of soft money spent by others in their own races.  The ban on soft money that the McCain-Feingold bill demands is an essential step to diminish the tremendous amount of money pouring into campaigns. Some opponents of the bill claim that banning soft money is unconstitutional. Senators McCain and Feingold have taken extra measures to ensure that the provisions in this bill comply with the Supreme Court's 1976 decision in Buckley v. Valeo. The court ruled that the Constitution permits the Government to regulate the flow of money in politics to prevent corruption or the appearance of corruption.  Political service remains a worthy calling, but anyone who enters it these days encounters a campaign fundraising system that is debilitating and demeaning and distasteful. The fact that we so clearly have ineffective checks on the spiraling cost of campaigns and on the way campaigns are financed has tarnished our institutions of Government as well as the people we elect to those institutions.  It is important to bring our election process and Government back to the time when elected officials felt accountable to all of the people they represent, not disproportionately to the wealthy few. Our present system gives the wealthy a huge megaphone for expressing their views, while other Americans--the ``financially inarticulate''--are left without an effective voice. That is why I have felt it important to take steps on my own to increase Vermonters trust in how I conduct my campaigns. Though not required by law I have disclosed every nickel in contributions I have ever received since I first ran for the Senate in 1974, and I used no political action committee money in my last two election campaigns. Passing the McCain-Feingold bill--without any amendments designed to weaken it or destroy it--is a fundamental step all of us can take to fix a system that is in dire need of repair. Vermonters and all Americans want to have faith in the campaign and election process. They want to believe that their Government is working in the public's interest, not on behalf of the special interests. Eliminating unregulated soft money will help to give elections and the Government back to the people.  I hope the Senate will not let this opportunity for reform slip away. I hope the Senate will approve this important and long-awaited bill and will refrain from adding any amendments that would jeopardize or kill this important effort.                          ____________________
