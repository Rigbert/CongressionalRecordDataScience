  If the Senator recalls, in our earlier discussions with the Justice Department, we were very concerned that the rights of the accused not be violated, not be diminished, and we quite consciously left out any specific remedy in this situation so that if someone doesn't exercise their right either to be present or to make a statement, in effect, they have no remedy, or after they make their statement, if the facts in the trial are such and the jury comes in with a decision, they have no right of a remedy.  So the basic core rights we provide are, in a sense, certain procedural rights that give them a place in the process.  Let me read what these two law professors have said on this point:       The framers of the Constitution undoubtedly assumed the      rights of victims would receive decent protection, but      experience has not vindicated this assumption. It is now      necessary to add a corrective amendment. Doing so would      neither extend the Constitution to an issue of mere policy,      nor provide special benefits to a particular interest group,      nor use the heavy artillery of constitutional amendment where      a simpler solution is available, nor would it put the      Constitution to a purely symbolic use or enlist it for some      narrow partisan purpose. Rather, the proposed amendment would      help bridge a distinct and significant gap in our legal      system's existing arrangements for the protection of basic      human rights against an important category of government      abuse.  This, I think, goes right to the question of remedy. We don't provide for a remedy, we simply say you have these basic rights to participate in this manner.
