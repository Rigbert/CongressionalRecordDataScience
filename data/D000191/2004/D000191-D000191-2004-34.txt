It is one thing to have a debate about whether we should cut taxes, pay down the debt or maybe spend more on education for our kids and other programs when we had a surplus. But this President has taken us from record surplus to record deficit in 4 short years.  So we are borrowing the money to finance tax cuts. We are borrowing every penny of the Social Security surplus this year. $160 billion more will be paid in out of taxes that fall only on wage- and salary-earning Americans who earn less than $90,000 a year.  We are giving the money they paid in for their retirement, this Congress is going to borrow it and give it substantially to those people you are talking about in much greater amounts. It will flow to the people who earn over $1 million a year. And guess what? They do not even pay the tax. If they are a investor, they do not pay a penny into Social Security. It is only people who work for wages and salary.  So we are going to borrow all that money, and we are going to borrow another $440 billion. We are going to indebt our kids and grandkids for the next 30 years to borrow $600 billion to run the government this year. Every program of the government except for the Defense Department, and almost half of that, is being run on borrowed money. We are borrowing from our future. So we are borrowing that money to invest in trickle-down tax cuts.
