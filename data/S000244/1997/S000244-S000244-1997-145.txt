Speaker, I rise today to introduce H.R. 1903, the Computer Security Enhancement Act of 1997. I would like to thank Technology Subcommittee Chairwoman Constance Morella, and the full committee and subcommittee ranking minority members, Congressmen George Brown and Bart Gordon, for their efforts in crafting a bipartisan bill which should help strengthen computer security throughout the Federal Government.  The lack of adequate security for Federal civilian computer systems is a significant problem. Since June 1993, the General Accounting Office [GAO] has issued over 30 reports detailing serious information security weaknesses at Federal agencies. This year, GAO highlighted computer security as a governmentwide, high-risk issue in its high risk series.  H.R. 1903 is intended to address this problem by strengthening the National Institute of Standards and Technology's [NIST] historic role in computer security. The bill updates the Computer Security Act of 1987 (P.L. 100-235) to give NIST the tools it needs to ensure that appropriate attention and effort is concentrated on securing our Federal information technology infrastructure.  The Computer Security Act gives NIST the lead responsibility for computer security for Federal civilian agencies. The act requires NIST to develop the standards and guidelines needed to ensure cost-effective security and privacy of sensitive information in Federal computer systems.  H.R. 1903 updates the act to take into account the evolution of computer networks and their use by both the Federal Government and the private sector. Further, the bill's authorizations are consistent with authorizations that have already passed the House as part of H.R. 1274, the NIST Authorization Act of 1997.  Specifically, the bill:  Reduces the cost and improves the availability of computer security technologies for Federal agencies by requiring NIST to promote the Federal use of off-the-shelf products for meeting civilian agency computer security needs.  Enhances the role of the independent Computer System Security and Privacy Advisory Board in NIST's decisionmaking process. The board, which is made up of representatives from industry, Federal agencies and other outside experts, should assist NIST in its development of standards and guidelines for Federal systems.  Requires NIST to develop standardized tests and procedures to evaluate the strength of foreign encryption products. Through such tests and procedures, NIST, with assistance from the private sector, will be able to judge the relative strength of foreign encryption, thereby defusing some of the concerns associated with the export of domestic encryption products.  Limits NIST's involvement to the development of standards and guidelines for Federal civilian systems. The bill clarifies that NIST standards and guidelines are to be used for the acquisition of security technologies for the Federal Government and are not intended as restrictions on the production or use of encryption by the private sector.  Updates the Computer Security Act to address changes in technology over the last decade. Significant changes in the manner in which information technology is used by the Federal Government has occurred since the enactment of the Computer Security Act. The bill updates the act, taking these changes into account.  Establishes a new computer science fellowship program for graduate and undergraduate students studying computer security. The bill sets aside $250,000 a year, for each of thenext two fiscal years, to enable NIST to finance computer security fellowships under an existing NIST grant program.  Requires the National Research Council to conduct a study to assess the desirability of, and the technology required to, support public key infrastructures.  It has been 10 years since Congress passed the Computer Security Act. Over that time, computer technology has changed at a breathtaking rate. The Computer Security Enhancement Act of 1997 will help NIST and the rest of our Federal civilian agencies adapt to those changes.  Mr. Speaker, ensuring that our agencies' computer systems as secure is a priority. H.R. 1903 is an important step toward this goal, and I urge all my colleagues to cosponsor this bipartisan bill.                          ____________________
