Speaker, I send to the desk a privileged resolution and ask for its immediate consideration.  The Clerk read the resolution, as follows:                              H. Res. 999       Resolved, That the Clerk of the House inform the Senate      that a quorum of the House is present and that the House is      ready to proceed with business.  The resolution was agreed to.  A motion to reconsider was laid on the table.                          ____________________
