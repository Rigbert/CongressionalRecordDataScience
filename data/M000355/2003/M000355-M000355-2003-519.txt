 President, for the information of all Senators, today, following the period of morning business, the Senate will resume debate on the energy and water appropriations bill. The two managers will be here beginning at 2:30 this afternoon, and Senator Feinstein will offer the first amendment. It is hoped that if other Members have amendments to the legislation, they will be available to offer their amendments as well.  As the majority leader stated last week, there will be no rollcall votes during today's session. Any votes ordered will be held over until Tuesday's session of the Senate. Also, under a previous order, the first rollcall vote tomorrow will occur at around 10:30 a.m. That vote will be on the passage of S.J. Res. 17, which is the FCC rule disapproval resolution.  Also, I remind our colleagues that today the Senate will also debate a motion relative to going to conference with the House on the partial-birth abortion ban bill. That agreement calls for up to 8 hours of debate, and it is the understanding that 2 of those hours will be consumed today. Therefore, following the conclusion of any business on the energy and water bill today, the Senate will consider that motion for up to 2 hours.                          ____________________
