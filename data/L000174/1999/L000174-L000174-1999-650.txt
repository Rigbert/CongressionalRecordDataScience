President, reserving the right to object, and I shall not object, as the leader knows, this is a resolution which I and others had suggested earlier this evening. The leaders know that the Senator from Utah and I have talked probably a dozen times every hour on this, trying to get it through. I have worked with the leadership staff and the whip on this side, our leader, and others, as Senator Hatch has with those on the Republican side, trying to get these numbers down. I tell my friend from Mississippi that we have knocked down the numbers considerably. The Senator from Utah and I will be here this evening to try to get it down more. It is a difficult bill. The last crime bill took 11 days. We have a number of things on which we are unified, and we have some things that are going to require votes because they do divide us. But with good faith it can be done and should be done.  I support the unanimous consent request.  Several Senators addressed the Chair.
