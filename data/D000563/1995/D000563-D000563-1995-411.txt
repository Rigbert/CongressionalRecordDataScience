Speaker, I will be joined by several of my colleagues to discuss some of the legislative issues that are being debated on Capitol Hill at this time.  I would like to start off by noting this Los Angeles Times story this morning, the devastation that is shown here from the flooding in California. I can certainly identify with this. Mine was one of the districts in the Midwest which was flooded in 1993. I worked the sandbag lines, and did my best as a Congressman to try to help many of the families, farmers, and businesses get back on their feet.  It was a devastating loss. I can certainly understand what many families and people in California are facing today.  Let me say that it has been my honor to serve in this Chamber for 12 years. I have at various times been asked by people from across the country to come to their assistance in the midst of a disaster. I have tried to do that. In fact, I have done that every time, whether it was the Loma Prieta earthquake near San Francisco or the Northridge earthquake near Los Angeles, or these floods.  I am sure they will all result in requests for assistance by the Federal Government. I will be there, because I think that is one of my responsibilities, not just to represent the 20th District of Illinois, but to serve our Nation. When some people in our Nation are in need, it is important that this Federal Government, this National Government, rally to their assistance.  Having said that, though, I would like to put into context some of the debate which is going on today on Capitol Hill as part of the Contract with America, and to give the perspective of the Contract with America on which it means to the flood victims of California and victims of future disasters.  First, if you search the Constitution of the United States, you will find no reference to a Federal obligation to pay for natural disaster assistance. It is an obligation assumed by the Federal Government, and an expensive one. In the 1950's, the Federal Government paid about 5 percent of the cost of natural disaster problems and damages across America. Today the Federal Government pays over 95 percent of the cost. We are on the hook.  In the Northridge earthquake near Los Angeles we have already spent more than $5 billion. The Federal Government came to the assistance of the State of California, a deficit-ridden Federal Government rallied to the assistance of the State of California, because the people needed help. More money will be needed because of that earthquake. More money will be needed because of these floods.  Let us talk about two issues we are debating in Congress right now. One is unfunded mandates. Let me give you an example of an unfunded mandate from the Federal Government. The Federal Energy Management Agency [FEMA] which has the responsibility to come in and pay for disasters, establishes guidelines for communities that they should follow to try to reduce flood damage.  For example, they suggest that people should not build in a flood plain if they want to qualify for Federal flood insurance. Is that a Federal mandate? Yes. Does the Federal Government pay for it? No. If the communities follow the mandate, what happens? It lessens the damage that might occur because of flooding or other natural disasters.                              {time}  1310  Why is that Federal mandate important? Because ultimately Federal taxpayers will be left holding the bag when the flood hits the community. And if the community has not lived up to the Federal-mandated guidelines, that cost to Federal taxpayers is higher.  Many people will get up and condemn Federal mandates but they do not look at this perspective, that many of these mandates are necessary to make sure that we lessen the ultimate liability of Federal taxpayers.  The Governor of the State of California, Mr. Wilson, as I understand it, gave his State of the State message yesterday and in the course of that State of the State message, he said, and I quote, that he as the Governor of [[Page H201]] the State was proceeding with his lawsuit to sue the Federal Government because we were not paying for things that we were mandating. In the words of the Governor, he said, ``We are going to sue their butts off.'' In a day or two we will be hearing from this same Governor who is going to ``sue our butts off'' because all the things the Federal Government is not paying for that he is going to need Federal disaster assistance because of his flood in California.  I would suggest that Governor Wilson should pause and reflect that the same Federal Government which he is complaining about, he is now going to turn to, despite our deficit, for assistance badly needed by the people of California. Does the word ``ingrate'' come to mind?  I would submit that the Governor should reflect as every Governor should on the fact that the Federal Government comes to their assistance time and time again in disasters and tries to make up for the losses which States and local governments could never absorb.  We may have debated a few days on next week on eliminating Federal mandates. Will we eliminate the requirement that States like California and my home State of Illinois in the future do things to mitigate disaster damage so that Federal taxpayers will not be holding a bag that is much larger?  Then the next week we will debate the balanced budget amendment. The balanced budget amendment says ultimately we are going to reduce the amount of money available for the Federal Government to come to the assistance of any State that suffers a disaster.  One of the things we as Democrats are insisting on is if the Republicans under their contract want to move a balanced budget amendment, they should in fact tell us where these cuts are going to take place to balance the budget. I do not think that is unreasonable.  Former President Ronald Reagan in dealing with the Soviet Union in terms of disarmament said ``trust but verify.'' I think the same thing is true when the American people look at the Federal Government.  If the Republican leadership in the House can be trusted to bring us a balanced budget amendment, we should ask them to verify the actual cuts that will be necessary to reach that balance.  The new majority leader of the House, the gentleman from Texas [Mr. Armey], said on a television show over the weekend that he did not want to do that because he was afraid that the knees of Congressmen would buckle when they saw the kind of cuts necessary to reach a balanced budget. I would suggest to my friend from Texas that if our knees would buckle, so would the knees of our constituents. They need to be told what is involved in this decision, that it is going to be tough, that it may mean for Governor Wilson after he has ``sued our butts off'' that when he comes to the Federal Government with his hand out for billions of dollars for disaster aid, we are going to say, ``Unfortunately, Mr. Governor, we don't have that money anymore. We now have a balanced budget amendment which lessens discretionary funds available to come to your assistance.''  This is part of the real debate that has to take place. We have got to move beyond the bumper strip slogans of ``End Federal Mandates, Give Us a Balanced Budget Amendment,'' and talk about the real world that will result. What cuts will there be in disaster assistance, money for education, Social Security, Medicare, things which families hold near and dear in this country?  I concede we have to move toward a balanced budget amendment. From my personal point of view, it is not our highest priority. The highest priority in this Nation is sound economic growth. Moving toward a balanced budget amendment is part of it, but only part of it. Equally if not more important is economic growth and economic development, creating more jobs, more opportunities and more capital formation. Insidiously a balanced budget amendment could work against that.  In times of recession when Federal revenues are down and people need help with unemployment insurance, for example, and things to get by that their families can live on, we may not have the money to pay for it, and that I think would frankly deepen the recession, would not bring us out, would not get families back on their feet.  What we are talking about in a balanced budget amendment debate is more veracity, more truth, more frankness. If our knees are going to buckle here on the floor, I say to the majority leader the gentleman from Texas [Mr. Armey] and others, ``So be it. That's the job we accepted. We're supposed to face the tough decisions.''  I think it is critically important that the Republicans in their rush to move these things through in the next 80 or 90 days take the time to do it right. Use common sense. The American people demand that of us. Be honest with the American people. ``Don't be afraid that their knees are going to buckle,'' I say to the Republican party. Tell them honestly what it means to California and Illinois and all across the country.
