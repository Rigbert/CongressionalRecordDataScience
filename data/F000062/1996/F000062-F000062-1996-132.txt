 President, I also ask unanimous consent to have printed in the Record a letter dated April 16 from the Department of Justice, Office of Legislative Affairs, to the majority leader on this subject.  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in the Record, as follows:                                       U.S. Department of Justice,                                Office of Legislative Affairs,                                   Washington, DC, April 16, 1996.     Hon. Robert Dole,     Majority Leader,     U.S. Senate,     Washington, DC.       Dear Senator Dole: I write to express the Administration's      strong opposition to the proposed requirement for triple-tier      fencing contained in S. 269, the ``Immigration in the      National Interest Act of 1995.'' This provision requires the      construction of second and third fences, in addition to the      existing 10-foot steel fence, along the 14 miles of U.S.-     Mexico border in the San Diego Border Patrol Sector. The bill      also requires roads to be built between the fences. Instead,      we support an amendment, to be offered by Senators Feinstein      and Boxer, to replace the requirement for triple fencing      along portions of the Southwest border with an authorization      of funds for the construction and improvement of physical      barriers, lighting, sensors, and other technologies to detect      and deter unlawful entry.       The requirement now in the bill, if enacted, would endanger      the physical safety of Border Patrol agents. U.S. Border      Patrol agent Joe Dassaro, Public Information Coordinator for      Local 1613, U.S. Border Patrol Council, recently stated,      ``There is no support from U.S. Border Patrol agents in the      field for the three tiered fence. We see it as a dangerous      situation. If an agent goes between the three fences and gets      into trouble, there is a longer response time for another      Border Patrol agent to come to his/her aid . . .'' From a      tactical perspective, agents travelling along roads      surrounded by fencing present an easy target for alien      smugglers and others ready to thwart our enforcement efforts.      Our experience has shown that when agents travel in a single,      predictable line, they and their vehicles are susceptible to      attack with rocks and other objects.       Response time to an emergency situation in areas adjacent      to fenced in areas will be greatly and unnecessarily      increased if this provision is enacted. Agents that patrol      between the sections of the fence will not have the ability      to quickly and directly get out of the areas at critical      times. With triple fencing, smugglers can easily block a      Border Patrol vehicle with debris and limit agent mobility to      the fixed path bounded by the fence. In addition, the rocky      terrain and deep canyons in this region of California make a      continuous road impossible to build and use. The challenges      presented by this terrain are better met through the other      tactics currently deployed in the San Diego Sector.       We support physical barriers along the border when and      where they are appropriate and have erected 23 miles of      fences along the California Border as an important part of      our strategic plans. In order to build the fence that is now      in place, it was necessary to construct an access road along      the border. Rather than specifying barriers, we recommend      funding to construct ``all-weather roads'', since the      existing roads become impassable after relatively little      rainfall. The current situation prohibits the Border Patrol      from actually reaching the border and interrupts repair and      maintenance on the fence. Rain also precludes the Border      Patrol from working close to the border in a high visibility,      deterrent posture. Agents must pull back and work from      hardpacked or paved streets during these periods. With an      all-weather road system, Border Patrol agents would have      access to the fence even during the extended rainy season.       We fully recognize the usefulness and need for border      fencing and have been at the forefront of fencing innovations      for many years. Single fencing is a valid deterrent in many      areas and we will continue to use this tool at various      locations to meet the needs of the San Diego Sector Border      Patrol. In some carefully selected areas, multiple fencing      may be appropriate. Other deterrence technologies, such as      enhanced communications systems, lighting, low light      television systems and fixed infrared/daylight cameras also      will compliment the existing and planned fencing. In our      view, the actual deployment of personnel, physical barriers,      technology and operational judgments are decisions best left      to the Border Patrol with responsibility for the day-to-day      operation at the ground level.       Please do not hesitate to contact me if I can be of further      assistance. The Office of Management and Budget has advised      that there is no objection to the submission of this letter      from the standpoint of the Administration's program.           Sincerely,                                                      Andrew Fois,                                       Assistant Attorney General.
