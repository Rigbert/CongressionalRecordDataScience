 President, I ask unanimous consent that the Chair lay before the Senate H.R. 2084, the House-passed fiscal year 2000 Transportation appropriations bill, that all after the enacting clause be stricken and the text of S. 1143, as modified by striking section 321, be inserted in lieu thereof--being amendment No. 1624--that the amendment be considered as original text for the purpose of further amendment, and that points of order against any provision added thereby are preserved.
