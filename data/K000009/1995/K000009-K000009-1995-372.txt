Speaker, it is my pleasure to rise today in honor of the 175th anniversary of the First Presbyterian Church located in Ohio's 9th district.  Beginning on January 9, 1820, with the settlement of 11 pioneers as charter members, the contributions of the First Presbyterian Church have stretched through a rich and diverse history. Built on a site that was once used to house a British battery, the founders of Maumee, Ohio's First Presbyterian Church began a mission to provide spiritual guidance and sustenance that continues today.  Like all churches, First Presbyterian's greatest asset and resource is her congregation. Even as Maumee's prosperity began to shift to the neighboring city of Toledo and membership was declining rapidly, the church members continued their mission. In 1870, when it became impossible to meet the pastor's salary of $900 and he was subsequently transferred to a larger parish, First Presbyterian's congregation pulled together and raised the resources necessary to maintain and continue the church's ministry.  As everyone in this historic Chamber knows, America's greatest strength is her communities and their willingness to contribute in times of national need and emergency. In keeping with this tradition and beginning with the Civil War, and continuing with World War I, World War II, the Korean conflict and Vietnam, the church made innumerable and immeasurable contributions from her congregation and her ministry. Now, this proud history and tradition has become the wellspring of the church's continuing efforts to respond to today's challenges with a new era of service and devotion.  As the congregation of the First Presbyterian Church of Maumee begins to respond to new challenges and create tomorrow's history, let us remember the contributions of its first 175 years--and congratulate them on their willingness to serve their community, their country, and their fellow man.                          ____________________
