Mr. Speaker, I appreciate the gentleman bringing this to the attention of the floor. We cannot address it in legislation. It would not be germane.  But I can assure the gentleman from Alabama that the bill that he voted on and I voted on and which I was a sponsor last year concerning this issue was not in the House bill. In fact, it was a clean bill that would really relieve the ``don't know,'' and have, as Fish and Wildlife was, issuing fines against those people. It was trying to take that away from the Fish and Wildlife.  The Fish and Wildlife Enforcement Group have interpreted the bill on behalf of Senator Chafee, who is no longer with us, may his soul rest in peace, but he put this in the bill in the waning hours, which none of us knew about. We have been made aware of this by the gentleman's hunters and my hunters and the people involved in Fish and Wildlife Conservation.  I have also suggested to the Fish and Wildlife not to interpret the law as the gentleman from Alabama mentioned. But we are going to try to address this issue in the very near future to make sure that the untold fines which are now being suggested be imposed upon individuals will not take place.  I am one that does not believe in the baited field, but many times this could occur unbeknownst to the knowledge of the farmer or, in fact, the hunter itself, and it is unfair to put this type of burden upon those people.  So I will do everything in my power to make sure that we address the fact that we never supported it.
