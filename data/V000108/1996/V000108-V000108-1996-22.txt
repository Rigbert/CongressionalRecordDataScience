Speaker, I rise to congratulate St. Mark Catholic Church, its pastor, the Reverend Robert P. Gehring, and the 421 parish families, on the celebration of St. Mark's 75th anniversary. On September 22, 1996, St. Mark Church, located in Gary IN, will hold a grand banquet at the Hellenic Cultural Center in Merriville, IN, to proclaim its celebration theme, ``Continuing the Mission of Christ.'' This banquet will be preceded by a jubilee Mass at St. Mark Church celebrated by Bishop Dale J. Melczek.  I would also like to congratulate the current Pastoral Council, which include Maria Azcona, Richard Burgess, Joan Bynum, Pat Corgan, Jesse Covarrubias, Alma Erris, Maria Gutierrez, Marcia Mizen, Roni Opong-Duah, Natalie Ousley, Felicia Flowers Smith, and Carl Terlicher. In 1994, this council, which serves as an advisory body to assist the pastor in decisions concerning the operations of St. Mark Church, replaced the former parish council.  Early in this century, traveling missionaries ministered to the needs of Catholics in the northwest Indiana area, and small parishes were formed in scattered villages and towns to aid the missionaries in their work. However, there was a strong need to establish a permanent parish. Without waiting for church authorities to ease a critical situation, a group of laymen collaborated to begin a Catholic parish inGlen Park, IN. Members of that group included: J.J. Kelley, Thomas F. Kennedy, Maurice Cox, John B. Rockford, and John P. Churchill. These men purchased a building from the German Evangelical Church of North America on May 19, 1921, and they moved the building from 20th and Grant Street to a site at 39th and Broadway.  In August of that same year, Father John B. DeVille, an assistant at Holy Angels Parish, told the committee and Bishop Herman J. Alerding that he would accept the responsibility of ministering to the spirtual needs of the fledgling St. Mark Parish. Father DeVille celebrated Mass regularly in the church on Broadway, and he taught religious education classes to children.  On February 4, 1922, the first marriage at St. Mark Church took place between Carlo Terlicher and Aurelia Chiabai. Aurelia Terlicher, who is 92 years old this month, is still a member of the St. Mark Parish family. Albert Antonio Sgambelluri was the first to be baptized at St. Mark on October 2, 1921.  It wasn't until June 17, 1923, that Bishop Herman J. Alerding appointed Father Joseph Ryder as the first pastor of St. Mark Church. Within 5 years of its inception, the rapidly growing St. Mark Parish needed newer and larger facilities. As a result, construction of the combination church, school, and convent began in July, 1926, on the selected site at 501 West Ridge Road. The Right Reverend John Francis Noll presided over the dedication ceremony of the new facility in July, 1927.  At first, Sisters of the Poor Handmaids of Jesus Christ gave their time and service to the schoolchildren of St. Mark. However, after the school building was completed, Father Ryder secured the services of the Dominican Sisters and they assumed the role of faculty at the school and resided in the convent on Ridge Road. The Sisters of the Poor Handmaids of Jesus Christ eventually replaced the Dominican Sisters in September 1931. In June 1986, the Sisters reluctantly announced the end of their ministry at the school. A new principal, Ms. Muriel Lennstrum, was hired along with several other lay teachers.  In April, 1951, a new school building was completed to accommodate the evergrowing enrollment of schoolchildren. In the early years of the parish, St. Mark School originated from religious education classes. As St. Mark celebrates its 75th anniversary, Ms. Maria Vazquez serves as principal of St. Mark School, which boasts an enrollment of 149 pupils enrolled in the grade school. Clare Coppinger and Dorothy Pictor have organized an alumni association with over 1,000 members from the classes of 1932-1957.  Mr. Speaker, I ask you and my other distinguished colleagues to join me in congratulating the current pastor, the Reverend Robert P. Gehring, and the 421 parish families of St. Mark as they celebrate the church's 75th Anniversary. St. Mark is a multiethnic and multicultural parish known for its caring and welcoming of all people. May they continue to celebrate for many years to come.                          ____________________
