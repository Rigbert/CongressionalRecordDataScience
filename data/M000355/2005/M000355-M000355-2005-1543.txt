 President, the Senate will reconvene on Monday at 10 a.m. and immediately begin consideration of the budget resolution. As I mentioned earlier this morning, and I mention again now, it is going to be a long and challenging week. Senators should expect to be here in the evenings. There will, of course, be multiple votes during the course of the week. We typically do what is referred to around here with a wry smile as a vote-a-rama toward the end of the budget week.  I caution all Senators that next Friday will be an unusual Friday, a Friday in which we will, in all likelihood, be here and working throughout the day and up into the evening. If previous years' Fridays of budget week are any indication, that is what we can expect next Friday. I want everybody to be on notice that notions of pulling out early on the Friday before the recess probably will not hold, unless we have incredible cooperation early in the week to move much more quickly. We are looking at an unusual and long Friday with lots of votes next Friday. We are going to try to work our way through the budget resolution as rapidly as possible and get everybody out of here as soon as possible, but anticipate that next Friday will be difficult.                          ____________________[Page S2585]From the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]                                PROGRAM  Mr. McCONNELL.
