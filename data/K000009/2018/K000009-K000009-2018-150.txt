Speaker, I rise to pay tribute to the distinguished life of Fiat Chrysler CEO Sergio Marchionne. I extend my sincerest sympathy to the family, friends and colleagues of this gifted executive and business leader. My heart goes out to his children, Alessio and Tyler, as well as his partner Manuela Battezzato. Sergio and I had many interactions and conversations over the years and he is someone for whom I had the utmost respect.  Thanks to his indefatigable attitude and remarkable dedication, he shepherded the company through very turbulent times. After 2004, he worked closely and gained the trust of the Administration leading to the auto rescue preserving a long tradition and legacy of automobiles in Toledo, and across the region.  It will come as no surprise to the generations of workers in Toledo that Jeep continues to be named the `most patriotic' brand in America. Thanks to the leadership of Sergio Marchionne, today, Toledo's Fiat Chrysler Automobile's Assembly Complex is one of the region's largest and most modern manufacturing plants.  Since 1941 when Willys-Overland first contracted with the United States Military to design the Willys MB, what would become the iconic Jeep Wrangler, Toledoans' life blood continues to run through every Jeep Wrangler in the world. And nearly 80 years later, our region's heritage and connection to Jeep grows stronger each day, being a part of and touching the lives of thousands of families.  Mr. Marchionne uniquely understood the power of the Jeep brand as a sign of America's can-do and industrious culture, tripling annual sales of the brand to 1.9 million automobiles in seven years. As the proud home of the Jeep Liberty, the Toledo community expresses its deepest gratitude to him for his productive life, sparkling imagination and respectful manner to both management and workers. Indeed, he understood in order to create a truly high-quality, global brand, workers need be given first-order priority.  Mr. Speaker, Mr. Marchionne surely left his mark on our community and throughout our auto-producing American Heartland. I am proud to join thousands of workers and others across the region in saluting his life and paying tribute to his legacy.                          ____________________
