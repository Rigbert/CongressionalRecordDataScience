President, I ask unanimous consent that the Senate proceed to consider the following treaty on today's Executive Calendar, No. 22. I further ask unanimous consent that the treaty be considered as having passed through its various parliamentary stages up to and including the presentation of the resolution of ratification; all committee provisos, reservations, understandings, declarations, be considered agreed to; that any statements be inserted in the Congressional Record as if read; and I further ask consent that when the resolution of ratification is voted upon, the motion to reconsider be laid upon the table, the President be notified of the Senate's action, and, following the disposition of the treaty, the Senate return to legislative session.
