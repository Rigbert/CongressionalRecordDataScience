Speaker, it is with great pleasure and sincerity that I take this time to congratulate the individuals who took their oath of citizenship on July 4, 2014. In true patriotic fashion, on the day of our great Nation's celebration of independence, a naturalization ceremony took place, welcoming new citizens of the United States of America. This memorable occasion, coordinated by the League of Women Voters of the Calumet Area and presided over by Magistrate Judge Andrew Rodovich, was held at The Pavilion at Wolf Lake in Hammond, Indiana.   America is a country founded by immigrants. From its beginning, settlers have come from countries around the world to the United States in search of better lives for their families. The oath ceremony was a shining example of what is so great about the United States of America--that people from all over the world can come together and unite as members of a free, democratic nation. These individuals realize that nowhere else in the world offers a better opportunity for success than here in America.   On July 4, 2014, the following people, representing many nations throughout the world, took their oaths of citizenship in Hammond, Indiana: Lucy Lucia Griffith, Susete Margarida Psimos, Ricarda Kurzinski, Salma Mardi, Sulka Tyagi, Andrija Cesljarev, Mira Cesljarev, Juana Cruz Lopez, Teodoro Obien Abadilla, Daliborka Nonkovic, Maria Del Rosari Gonzalez Carrillo, Tyson Francis, Irene Garcia Garcia, Ilija Trajanoski, Jagoda Markovska, Mary Ugonwa Hardin, Daniel Lodewikus Smith, Sophia Johanna Ca Smith, Alma Delia Torres De Gonzalez, Toni Kitevski, Jefferson Marcos Caldeira, Esther Mukabacondo, Alejandro Escobedo Roman, Majid Latif, Xuan Loc Thi Hoang, Paulina Joanna Jagodzinska, Ivy Mwansa Chirwa Cox, Philip Papai Muturi, Maria Soledad Araos De La Fuente, Manuel Garza, Hector Javier Balza Medina, Wladyslawa Skauba, John Munene Njiru, Rosendo Hernandez Fierros, Noreen Nothando Ncube, Dolores Irene De Santiago Martinez, Dmitri Valentinov Boulanov, Haralambos Nikolaos Kladis, Meilute Ona Zinkus, Severo Ramirez Madera, Tatiana Silvia Sanjines Del Llano, Danica Rnic, Janette Atillo Jasmin-Wallace, Ana Ma Galicia Reyes, Angelica Maria Saucedo De La Cruz, Ma Teresa Valdovinos, Gerald Joseph Oblina Rinon, Darshan Lal Wadhwa, and Mustafa Musleh.   Though each individual has sought to become a citizen of the United States for his or her own reasons, be it for education, occupation, or to offer their loved ones better lives, each is inspired by the fact that the United States of America is, as Abraham Lincoln described it, a country ``. . . of the people, by the people, and for the people.'' They realize that the United States is truly a free nation. By seeking American citizenship, they have made the decision that they want to live in a place where, as guaranteed by the First Amendment of the Bill of Rights, they can practice religion as they choose, speak their minds without fear of punishment, and assemble in peaceful protest should they choose to do so.   Mr. Speaker, I respectfully ask you and my other distinguished colleagues to join me in congratulating these individuals, who became citizens of the United States of America on July 4, 2014, the day of our Nation's independence. They, too, are American citizens, and they, too, are guaranteed the inalienable rights to life, liberty, and the pursuit of happiness. We, as a free and democratic nation, congratulate them and welcome them.                          ____________________
