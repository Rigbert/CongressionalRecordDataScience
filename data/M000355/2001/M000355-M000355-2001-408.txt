 President, the Senator from North Carolina is here, and before yielding the floor so he may offer an amendment, I want to make a couple of observations about what he is trying to do, very briefly.  With regard to union members' rights, we have had a vote on getting the consent of members with regard to their dues and how it may be spent. That has been called a poison pill. That has been voted down. We have had a vote on consent.  We have had a vote on disclosure, trying to get the unions to disclose how they spend their money, the biggest player in American politics. There was an effort made on the floor of the Senate to get simple disclosure of how the money is spent. That was described as a poison pill. That went down.  The Senator from North Carolina is now, I am told, going to offer an amendment regarding notification. If union members are denied the right to consent, they are denied the opportunity to learn from disclosure, now the Senator from North Carolina is going to give the Senate an opportunity to see whether at least they can be notified when something is going to happen with their money.  Before he offers the amendment and takes the floor, I appreciate the good work of the Senator from North Carolina and I look forward to supporting his amendment.  I yield the floor.
