President, I also point out that there is a special inspector general overseeing all of these contracts. His name is Stuart Bowen. He does an excellent job. He has been very aggressive in his audits and investigations. He regularly briefs all Members who are interested, and he issues a report every quarter on his findings. So I do believe we have an adequate structure in place, a needed structure to be sure.
