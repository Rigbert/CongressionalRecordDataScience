Perdue, Mr. Brown, and Ms.         Collins):  S. 2026. A bill to amend the Richard B. Russell National School Lunch Act to reauthorize the farm to school program, and for other purposes; to the Committee on Agriculture, Nutrition, and Forestry.  In 2010, Congress passed the Healthy and Hunger-Free Kids Act, which reauthorized child nutrition programs and made healthy meal choices a reality to children nationwide. Far too many children and adolescents in the United States suffer from obesity, which puts them at risk for developing chronic health conditions later in life. One of the best ways to help students make healthy choices is to teach them about their food and how it is grown. Making that connection makes a difference. That is why I championed the inclusion of funding for a farm to school grant program, which was included in the Healthy and Hunger-Free Kids Act.  The program has had tremendous success and interest nationwide, and has awarded grants in all 50 states and the District of Columbia to support programs in more than 33,000 schools. Building upon the success of this program, I am glad to be joined today by Senators Perdue, Brown, and Collins in introducing the Farm to School Act of 2019. In years past, I have championed this important farm to school legislative effort with one of my dearest friends, Thad Cochran, who sadly passed away last month.  We all know that hungry children cannot learn. Studies have shown that healthy nutrition in a young person's diet is crucial to cognitive ability and better health in the long run. Food insecurity and obesity rates are still too high in this country, resulting in poor health, and learning and behavioral difficulties at school. The school meal program has made tremendous strides in recent years to ensure not only that children have access to meals throughout the school day, but that those meals are nutritious. The Farm to School program has given children and schools across the country the tools to craft farm-fresh, healthy, and delicious meals that students enjoy.  The Farm to School grant program offers support to farmers and local economies, while teaching kids about nutritious foods and how they are grown. The program has a strong educational component, making our school cafeterias an extension of the classroom, giving students an opportunity to learn about nutrition, well-balanced meals, and even how to grow the food themselves.  In Vermont, I have seen first-hand how farm to school efforts have better connected children with the food in their cafeteria. Students participate in school gardens, sustainability projects, and taste tests for new school menu items. With the help of a USDA Farm to School grant, the Burlington School Food Project has created a partnership with a local Vermont beef processor and 100 percent of the beef served the last school year was locally sourced, and that will continue next year as well. Organizations in Vermont such as Vermont Food Education Every Day, Shelburne Farms, and the Northeast Organic Farming Association have been able to expand their programs to link more farms to the classroom throughout Vermont.  Farm to school is equally crucial to farmers and ranchers by opening another market to them to sell their locally grown and locally harvested goods. The program links the classroom with the farm to engage students in the importance of farming and contributing to the local economy. Every dollar spent on local food generates up to an additional $2.16 in economic activity.  This program is so popular among school and farmers alike that demand for grants far outpaces available funding. Since the program began in 2013, USDA has received more than 1,900 applications, but has only been able to fund 437 projects. The Farm to School Act of 2019 would build upon the success of the program and expand its reach by increasing the funding for the program to $15 million per year. The bill also recognizes the importance of growing the program to include preschools, summer food service program sites, and after-school programs.  Ensuring children have enough food to eat is an issue that unites us all. There is simply no excuse that in the wealthiest, most powerful Nation on Earth people go hungry. Small changes in eating habits by children will result in lifelong health benefits for generations to come. The Farm to School program empowers children and their families to make healthy choices now and in the future. As the Senate begins considering reauthorizing the child nutrition bill this year, I look forward to including these improvements in the Farm to School program.                                 ______                                       By
