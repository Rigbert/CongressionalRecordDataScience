Chairman, I yield myself 1 minute.  Mr. Chairman, a friend of mine who is a farmer in Jacksonville, IL, who has been in the business for a long time told me that when he started in the early 1950's, after getting out of World War II, it took him up to an hour to cultivate an acre of land. With today's equipment he can do it in a few minutes. He can also find out that his production on each acre has grown dramatically because of the fertilizer and the herbicides and pesticides which we have developed. So now he is farming acreage which used to be farmed by many other farmers. That is the march of science.  I would also say to my friend from Vermont, please do not create the suggestion in anyone's mind that there is anything suspicious about America's milk supply. At the Prairie Farms Dairy in Carlinville, IL, I walked into the sterile room with the stainless steel tanks and was told that that milk is tested no fewer than four different times before it reaches the consumer to find any evidence of impurity or any evidence of antibiotic. If any of it is found, the entire shipment is cast aside.  It is the safest milk supply in the world. To suggest otherwise is unfortunate.  Mr. Chairman, I yield 1 minute to the gentleman from Wisconsin [Mr. Gunderson].  (
