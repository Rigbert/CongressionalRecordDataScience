Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.  Mr. Speaker, nationwide there are an estimated 400,000 torture survivors, most of whom came to the United States as refugees. Worldwide, it is impossible to count the numbers. As witnesses have repeatedly testified before our committee and before the Congress, the paralyzing scars from the physical and psychological wounds of torture can remain for years. Torture impacts not only the individual victim but their families and society as well.  Yesterday, the first witnesses testified in the trial of Saddam Hussein. Demonstrating heroic courage, they described torture on a scale that is almost beyond belief and which is simply too grisly to be repeated here. Although these events described happened many years ago, their testimony painfully illustrates the lasting impact torture has on those who survive it, their families and communities. There can be no doubt that Hussein's systematic torture was intended not only to punish specific victims but to coerce an entire population into silence and into subservience. As we try to bring democracy to Iraq and to other parts around the globe, we must try to heal the victims of torture that was used to prevent democracy from taking hold in the past.  In 1998, Mr. Speaker, Congress took a historic step towards repairing the broken lives of torture victims with the passage of the Torture Victims Relief Act of 1998. I sponsored that legislation, and I was joined by my good friend and colleague (Mr. Lantos), who has also been a hero in this battle to help torture victims. We also sponsored the Torture Victims Relief Reauthorization Act of 1999 and the Torture Victims Relief Reauthorization Act of 2003. As important as these congressional measures have been, there continues to be an enormous need for us to reach out to the victims of torture who oftentimes have no other recourse for their suffering. Therefore, I strongly urge my colleagues to join us today in supporting H.R. 2017, the Torture Victims Relief Reauthorization Act of 2005.  The domestic aspect of this legislation, Mr. Speaker, is designed to ensure that particular attention is given to torture victims in regions with significant immigrant and refugee populations. The measure authorizes $25 million for fiscal year 2006 and $25 million for fiscal year 2007 to the Department of Health and Human Services to assist domestic treatment centers. This maintains the current $25 million authorization funding level for fiscal year 2005 for such centers.  Currently, 27 programs in 16 States are assisted by the Department of Health and Human Services' Office of Refugee Resettlement. In addition to direct assistance, many of these centers are also engaged in training mainstream organizations and personnel in the specialized treatment of torture victims.  The number of survivors seeking treatment at U.S. centers funded through the Torture Victims Relief and Reauthorization acts has steadily increased throughout the years. The client base at just 14 such centers increased from 935 in 1999 to 1,550 in 2000 to 2,579 in 2001. A subsequent survey showed that during 2002, 23 Torture Victim Relief Act-funded centers treated over 3,600 clients. With the additional funding, it is estimated the U.S. centers would have the capacity and the capability to serve an additional 2,800 survivors per year.  Mr. Speaker, H.R. 2017 also authorizes $12 million in 2006 and $13 million in 2007 for foreign treatment centers and programs administered through USAID's Victims of Torture fund. This authorization would maintain the current fiscal year 2005 authorization for 2006 and increase it by $1 million for fiscal year 2007.  The bill gives particular emphasis to supporting centers and programs abroad in emerging democracies and postconflict environments. Nongovernmental organizations that receive this funding provide direct services to survivors, their families, and their communities. They also strengthen institutions on the ground and the indigenous capacity of these institutions to deliver services to survivors. In addition to providing treatment, many of these programs advocate for the elimination of torture itself in these countries.  Lastly, the measure maintains current authorization levels of $7 million for fiscal year 2006 for the U.N. Voluntary Fund for the Victims of Torture. It would increase this funding to $8 million in fiscal year 2007. In 2001, in just that one year alone, the U.N. fund assisted some 77,000 victims of torture. This type of humanitarian assistance provided by organizations which receive grants from the fund consists mainly of psychological, medical, social, legal, and economic assistance.  Again, I urge my colleagues to support this legislation.  Mr. Speaker, I attach for printing in the Congressional Record an exchange of letters between Chairman Hyde and Chairman Barton on the bill H.R. 2017 ``The Torture Victims Relief Reauthorization Act of 2005.''         House of Representatives, Committee on International            Relations,                                Washington, DC, November 29, 2005.     Hon. Joe Barton,     Chairman, Committee on Energy and Commerce, Rayburn House          Office Building, Washington, DC.       Dear Mr. Chairman: On June 30, 2005, the Committee on      International Relations authorized me to seek consideration      of H.R. 2017, the ``Torture Victims Relief Reauthorization      Act of 2005,'' under suspension of the     rules. As you are aware, H.R. 2017 was additionally referred      to your Committee. The bill contains language which falls      within the Rule X jurisdiction of your Committee. Your      Committee's subject matter jurisdiction relates to the      authorization for domestic treatment centers for victims of      torture.       I write to ask that the Committee on Energy and Commerce      waive its opportunity to mark up provisions referred to it.      Timely action by the Energy and Commerce Committee would      allow this Committee to proceed expeditiously to the House      floor. By waiving the opportunity to mark up the bill, I      understand that your Committee does not waive any future      jurisdictional claim over this or similar measures. In      addition, in the event of a conference with the Senate on      this matter, I will recommend that your Committee have the      right to seek the appointment of conferees.       A copy of this letter and your reply will be placed in the      Congressional Record when the bill is considered on the      floor.           Sincerely,                                                    Henry J. Hyde,     Chairman.                                  ____                                         House of Representatives,                             Committee on Energy and Commerce,                                 Washington, DC, December 1, 2005.     Hon. Henry J. Hyde,     Chairman, Committee on International Relations, House of          Representatives, Rayburn House Office Building,          Washington, DC.       Dear Chairman Hyde: Thank you for your November 29, 2005      letter concerning H.R. 2017, the Torture Victims Relief      Reauthorization Act of 2005. As you know, the Committee on      Energy and Commerce was named as an additional Committee of      jurisdiction upon the bill's introduction.       I recognize your desire to bring this legislation before      the House in an expeditious manner. Accordingly, I will not      exercise my Committee's right to a full referral on the bill.      By agreeing to waive its consideration of the bill, however,      the Committee on Energy and Commerce does not waive its      jurisdiction over H.R. 2017. In addition, the Committee on      Energy and Commerce reserves its right to seek conferees on      any provisions of the bill that are within its jurisdiction      during any House-Senate conference that may be convened on      this legislation. I thank you for your commitment to support      any request by the Committee on Energy and Commerce for      conferees on H.R. 2017 or similar legislation.       Thank you for your attention to these matters, and I look      forward to working with you as this legislation moves      forward.           Sincerely,                                                       Joe Barton,                                                         Chairman.  Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.
