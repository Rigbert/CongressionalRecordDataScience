 Chairman, I yield myself 1 minute and say to my friend from Wisconsin, the gentleman has described that he is losing four farms a day; he has described that perhaps no other State in this country has lost more family farms than his great State; he has described the pain and the sadness that the people of his State are feeling in this transition. Yet, we keep talking about that, we keep talking about the loss of farms in the Northeast and then we say, well, this is not perfect.  Well, I have a problem with that, oh, gee, this one does not work in every part of the country. I understand that. But the gentleman is going to lose four more farms tomorrow, and I will lose a farm. We are giving our colleagues a blueprint, an outline. If we reject this, nothing will happen this year, in my view, to protect family farmers; and we are going to continue to lose the farms.  Mr. Chairman, I urge my colleagues to work with us to develop a national policy that works for Wisconsin, that works for Vermont. This is a step forward. It is not the end-all. There are folks in the Senate who are sympathetic to this concept. We have time to refine it. So I would urge the support of my colleagues for this amendment tonight.  The CHAIRMAN pro tempore. The question is on the amendment offered by the gentleman from Wisconsin (Mr. Obey) to the amendment offered by the gentleman from Vermont (Mr. Sanders).  The amendment to the amendment was agreed to.
