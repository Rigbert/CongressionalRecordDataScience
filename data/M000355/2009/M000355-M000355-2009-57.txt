 That is what Senate Republicans have said for quite a while. Let's start over and go step by step to deal with the cost issue. Instead, there is this consuming desire on the other side of the aisle to transform one-sixth of our economy, to have the Government take it over and to make history and, as has been pointed out in this colloquy by many Senators: There are many things that happened in our history that we wish had not occurred. This is certainly going to be one of them.  I am optimistic. We just need one Democrat, just one to stand up and say: Mr. President, I am sorry, this is not the kind of history I want to make. I would love to listen to you but I also want to listen to my constituents and it is very clear where my constituents are. If I have to choose between you and my constituents, with all due respect I am going to pick my constituents. Just one Democrat needs to stand up and say I am willing to listen to the American people rather than arrogantly assume that all the wisdom resides in Washington.  If we figure this out, we are going to do it for you whether you want us to or not.
