Chairman, I thank the gentleman. I read the language also. As a former developer, ``develop'' means, in my vernacular it does mean build. And so I think people would interpret this legislation as building additional infrastructure. And as the chairman mentioned, NASA is trying to get out of the bricks and mortar business.  The fact is we have facilities, space centers throughout this country that have been woefully unmaintained. As we go through the centers around the country and look at them, we are not maintaining the facilities that we have presently. We need to make sure that the facilities that our NASA workers are working in today are maintained in proper order.  I understand what the gentlewoman is trying to accomplish, but we just do not have the resources at this time to develop additional infrastructure, additional buildings and additional maintenance costs throughout this country at this time.  I would ask the committee to oppose this amendment or to work with the chairman to come up with some language that may have a different accomplishment on what the gentlewoman is trying to do.  The Acting CHAIRMAN. The gentlewoman from New York (Ms. Velazquez) has 1\1/2\ minutes remaining.
