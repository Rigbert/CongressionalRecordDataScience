Mr. Speaker, I am introducing a bill to repeal the four-year terms specified by law for certain officials of the Department of Veterans Affairs (VA), and to add a provision that addresses the appointment of directors of principal geographic service areas.  Fourteen years ago, when the Veterans Administration was established as an executive department and redesignated the Department of Veterans Affairs, Public Law 100-527 also established a Chief Medical Director (CMD), a Chief Benefits Director (CBD) and a Director of the National Cemetery Services (the Director). The CMD and the CBD were to be appointed by the President, with the advice and consent of the Senate, while the Director was to report to the Office of the Secretary.  Subsequent laws further restated and reorganized the three key executive positions in the Department as the Under Secretaries for Health, Benefits and Memorial Affairs. Under current law, the Under Secretaries for Health and Benefits are appointed for four-year terms, with reappointment permissible for successive-like periods. There is no such restriction or term provision established in law for the Under Secretary for Memorial Affairs.  I am introducing H.R. 1718 to repeal term appointments for the Under Secretaries for Health and Benefits. This bill will align all three Under Secretary positions as Presidential appointments, by and with the advice and consent of the Senate, and allow the President maximum flexibility in the appointment of these primary executive positions. Current incumbents would not be affected by the enactment of this legislation. The President would also be required to notify Congress concerning the reasons for removal if the President should choose to terminate or remove one of the Under Secretaries of the Department.  These term appointments likewise would be repealed for key officials assigned to the Office of the Under Secretary for Health, who are appointed by the Secretary subject to reassignment at the Secretary's discretion. With this bill, the designation of directors of principal geographic service areas are added to the group of key agency officials appointed by the Secretary and serving at the Secretary's discretion without term restrictions.  As with the three under secretaries, H.R. 1718 requires that the Secretary notify the Committees on Veterans' Affairs of the House and Senate when one of these key officials is removed from one of these subsidiary positions. These officials may be entitled to reassignment, if they held a previous career position within the Department.  Mr. Speaker, this legislation would allow the President and the Secretary of Veterans Affairs maximum flexibility to hold senior officials accountable and to align the agency's top leadership with the vision and goals of the Secretary and the Administration. I urge prompt House action on this important measure.                          ____________________
