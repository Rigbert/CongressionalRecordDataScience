 Why doesn't my colleague just take it out? It is not in the House bill. Then we don't have to conference it, we don'thave to have another fight, we can get the amendments in the bill to strengthen the bill, and we can move on, with the two parties together doing something that is right for the Nation. Why don't we do it?
