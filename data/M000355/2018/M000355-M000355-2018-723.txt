The Presiding Officer laid before the Senate the following message from the House of Representatives:       Resolved, That the bill from the Senate (S. 899) entitled      ``An Act to amend title 38, United States Code, to ensure      that the requirements that new Federal employees who are      veterans with service-connected disabilities are provided      leave for purposes of undergoing medical treatment for such      disabilities apply to certain employees of the Veterans      Health Administration, and for other purposes.''  Mr. McCONNELL. Mr. President, I move to concur in the House amendment, and I ask unanimous consent that the motion be agreed to and the motions to reconsider be considered made and laid upon the table without intervening action or debate.
