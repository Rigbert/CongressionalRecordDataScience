Speaker, I submit for the Record a clarification concerning Section 502(7) on line 16 of H.R. 3295, Union Calendar 201, regarding the term ``error.'' In using the term ``error'', the Committee on House Administration referred to the findings of the National Commission on Federal Election Reform, also known as the ``Ford-Carter Commission.''  The Commission's definition of ``error'' is set forth in the accompanying letter from Philip Zelikow, executive director of the National Commission on Federal Election Reform, to me and dated November 16, 2001. It responds to a letter sent by me dated November 14, 2001. In complying with the Minimum Standard, the Committee on House Administration expects states and jurisdictions to buy voting machines that detect errors of the kind described in the letter, commonly referred to as ``overvotes,'' ``undervotes,'' and ``residual votes.''  The two letters follow:                                         House of Representatives,                            Committee on House Administration,                                Washington, DC, November 14, 2001.     Mr. Philip D. Zelikow,     Executive Director, The National Commission on Election          Reform, Charlottesville, VA.       Dear Director Zelikow: In an effort to craft Federal policy      addressing electoral reform recommendations contained in the      Commission's report, the Commission's use of the word      ``error'' has sparked much attention and debate. I would very      much appreciate a response containing a definition of what      the Commission contemplated in using the word ``error'' in      the context of the Ford--Carter Commission report. I will use      your letter to establish the legislative record regarding      electoral reform legislation.       With kindest regards, I am           Sincerely yours,      Steny H. Hoyer.                                  ____                                           The National Commission                                    On Federal Election Reform                                                November 16, 2001.     Congressman Steny Hoyer,     House of Representatives, Longworth Office Building,          Washington, DC.       Dear Congressman Hoyer: Thank you for your letter of      November 14. You asked how the Commission defined voter error      in the context of the Commission's report.       In its discussions the Commission viewed voter error as      occurring when a voter casts a ballot for a candidate whom      the voter had not meant to choose, or when a voter      unknowingly invalidates a ballot, or when a voter      inadvertently fails to register a choice while having wanted      to make one. Voters being human, not all voter errors can      reliably be detected or avoided. Voter error also presents      itself in many ways, depending on the voting systems and      administrative practices in different jurisdictions. But the      Commission did find that there are ways to reduce the      likelihood of error. These include voter education, better      equipment, improved software and ballot design, and more      uniform and objective definitions of that actions will and      will not be counted as a vote for each category of machine.      All of these subjects are addressed in your current bill,      H.R. 3295.       Please contact me if I can be of any further assistance.           Sincerely,                                                   Philip Zelikow,                                                Eecutive Director.
