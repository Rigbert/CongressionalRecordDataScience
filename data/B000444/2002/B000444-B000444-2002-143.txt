  What I think we should be straight about here--I am not implying in any way the Senator from Virginia is not being straight--is that there is a growing school of thought that reflects the underlying view of my friend from Virginia--and, I might add, is made up of some of the most seasoned Members of the Senate, some of whom are World War II veterans, men who have been strongly supportive of NATO in the past and of our military--who basically do not think NATO is worth much anymore.  The fact of the matter is, the indictment that the Senator paints is equally applicable to Britain, Germany, Spain, Italy--every NATO nation. Not the new guys. It was the old guys who did not let us have the overflight, remember?
