President, I am pleased that today the Senate will unanimously agree to a resolution to honor the service of our Nation's law enforcement officers. With this action we demonstrate the Senate's strong support as we observe and celebrate National Police Week. I thank Senator Sessions, ranking member of the Judiciary Committee, for joining me as the lead cosponsor of this resolution, and Senators Durbin, Specter, Kohl, Klobuchar, Feinstein, Whitehouse, Graham, Grassley, Feingold, Schumer, Hatch and Boxer for lending their support as well.  This week we will reflect on the extraordinary service and sacrifice given year after year by the men and women of our police forces. As thousands of law enforcement officers arrive in Washington this week to pay tribute to those whose lives were lost in the line of duty, I hope they all know that the Senate stands with them and honors their service and their sacrifice. We welcome these men and women and their families and friends to the Nation's Capital.  This year the names of two brave Vermonters who gave their lives in the line of duty will be added to the Memorial: John Henry Collette of the Addison County Sheriffs Office, died July 17, 1932, and Robert Daniel Rossier of the Vermont Highway Patrol, died September 9, 1935. The inscription of their names on the National Law Enforcement Memorial ensures that their service and sacrifice will not be forgotten.  Once again, I am proud that the Senate has unanimously approved this resolution and formally recognized National Police Week and National Peace Officers Memorial Day.
