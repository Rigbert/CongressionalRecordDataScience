Madam Chairman, let me just make a couple of points. First of all, let me respond briefly to my friend from New York on one of the points that he raised. He talked about the visit to Kamchang-Ri by inspectors and they found nothing in that hole. Well, we had a hearing, and the gentleman, I am sure, remembers when Ambassador Lilley, our former ambassador to the People's Republic of China, came and testified and said, as matter of factly as he possibly could have, that we are not going to find anything. They have had about a year to clean it out; there are other caves and caverns and holes where they could put this material.  So this is a Potemkin village, if ever there was one, to have a preannouncement that yes, we are going to come here. We had to buy our way to get into that site to begin with, and wonder of wonders, as predicted, as Ambassador Lilley pointed out so clearly, we know we are not going to find anything.                              {time}  1145  So I think it is very, very disingenuous to raise that somehow North Korea is complying. We were told in advance by the former ambassador to the People's Republic of China, Ambassador Lilley, that we were not going to find anything. And wonder of wonders, we did not find anything. They had plenty of time to move it to one of their other sites, and there are perhaps 11 other sites that have not been checked out where they could have done so.  So, again, that is why I think the language in here where we talk about the IAEA, full access to all additional sites and all information, including historical records deemed necessary by the IAEA to verify accuracy and completeness and so on, that is the kind of unfettered access that is needed. Otherwise we engage in a diplomatic fiction. We buy into a potential big lie of which this regime in North Korea is certainly highly capable.  Let me just say, Madam Chairman, I do rise in strong support of the Gilman-Markey amendment.  The CIA recently reported that, and I quote, ``North Korea has no constraints on its sales of ballistic missiles and related technology,'' close quote.  As we know, that is alarming; but it is not surprising. In 1992, the IAEA concluded that Pyongyang had violatedthe nuclear nonproliferation treaty that it signed in 1985. Furthermore, the North Korean government has avoided cooperating with monitoring efforts by the International Atomic Energy Agency as required by its subsequent 1994 agreement with the United States.  Thus, until Pyongyang reverses its practices and abides by the nuclear nonproliferation treaty, any country that sends nuclear reactors and technology to North Korea should assume that it is exporting these most dangerous technologies to other dangerous regimes around the world.  Madam Chairman, the government of North Korea has egregiously violated the human rights of countless of its own citizens, and I know that Members are aware of that. They may not be aware that food is being used, regrettably, as a weapon, against some of their own people.  There are children--estimated to be somewhere on the order of 500,000 kids--arrested, often incarcerated, because they are poor.  We have these children who are just being arrested. The government is so contemptuous of its own people that these kids are dying; and when they escape, sometimes they even escape to China to try to get a meal, they are brought back and arrested. The international community has no access to them, and that includes UNICEF, which has tried.  So that is the kind of government we are dealing with. I just put that in as a parenthetical because I think it gives a backdrop to what we are talking about here.  Let me just say also, Madam Chairman, before we have any U.S. exports of nuclear reactors, technology and the like to North Korea, we believe--I believe and the chairman believes and the gentleman from Massachusetts (Mr. Markey) believes--the President should be required to certify that North Korea is fully complying with its obligations under NPT.  The Congress must shoulder its responsibility to ensure that the North Korean government has kept its agreement not to develop or to export nuclear technology and weapons. When dealing with a country whose record on so many issues has been so poor as North Korea's and with such weighty issues as nuclear technology transfers, we have a responsibility to do no less.
