When you reduce the ability of students to go to college, you necessarily reduce the opportunities to create tomorrow's teachers. We need to hire 55,000 new teachers in my State of Illinois over the next 4 years. What the Bush administration proposed was to make it more expensive for students across America to go to college.  Students who are working hard and sacrificing would have paid more were it not for the efforts of the Senator from Massachusetts and many on this side of the aisle that forced the Bush administration, in the last few days, to back off that.  But let me ask the Senator, if I may, this one last question because my colleague from Minnesota would also like to participate in this. Is this not, in this budget this year from this Bush administration, the smallest proposed increase in K through 12 education since 1988?
