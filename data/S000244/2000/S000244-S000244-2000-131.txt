Chairman, I thank the gentlewoman from Texas for yielding.  Mr. Chairman, let me say I am going to support the gentlewoman's amendment. Any Member can request a GAO study. Placing the language in the bill I think is a constructive addition because whether the GAO responds to the House as a whole or to an individual Member, this is an issue that has got to be addressed, and it has got to be resolved as we figure out how to make the rising tide of information-technology applications lift all of the boats in our society. So I thank the gentlewoman from Texas, and I hope the committee adopts her amendment.
