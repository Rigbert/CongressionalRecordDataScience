Speaker, in light of the fact that both of us are brand new in this job and this is the first time we are doing this, I want the gentleman from Texas (Mr. DeLay) to know that I am pleased to yield to him today and will be pleased to yield to him in days to come. I want him to stay leader; I would just like to change the designation, the adjective, but I yield to the majority leader.  Mr. DeLAY. Mr. Speaker, I appreciate the gentleman yielding to me, and I appreciate his interest in changing my title, but that will not happen for another 2 years, at least.  Before I discuss next week's schedule, I would like to note for the gentleman and other Members of the House a very significant historical event that took place in the House of Representatives during this week back in 1815. Mr. Speaker, the Library of Congress was established back in 1800, and the Library was housed here in the Capitol, as many of us know, until 1814 when the British troops set fire to the building and destroyed most of the books in our collection. Retired President Thomas Jefferson graciously offered his personal library from Monticello as a replacement, and Congress purchased the library 188 years ago today for the sum of $23,950.  Now, after the job he did in the Louisiana Purchase, one would have thought Mr. Jefferson would have negotiated a little higher price from us, but, in any case, it was a great deal for America and a gracious gesture for our great champion of ideas.  Mr. Speaker, if the gentleman would continue to yield, the House will convene on Tuesday in pro forma session. On Wednesday we hope to consider the conference report on H. Res. 2, which will finish up the 2003 appropriations process. However, if the conference report is not ready for floor consideration, the House will need to consider another continuing resolution on Wednesday.  In addition, we may consider some measure under suspension of the rules. A list will be provided to all offices by Monday evening. There will be no votes in the House before 6:30 p.m. on Wednesday, and on Thursday we expect to consider H.R. 395, the Do Not Call Implementation Act, to restrain rampant telemarketers, and finish with legislative business for the week by 1 p.m.                              {time}  1330  Mr. Speaker, I am happy to answer any questions.
