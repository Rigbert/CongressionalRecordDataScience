Speaker, today I rise in sad acknowledgment of the passing from this life of a national heroine and true Toledo treasure. Millie Benson, author of the original Nancy Drew series of books and lifelong adventurer, passed away on Tuesday, May 28, 2002 the age of 96 years. She had spent the day at her desk at The Blade newspaper completing her regular column. That last column, published on May 29, 2002, discussed the history and importance of the public library system. It is a fitting end to the storied career of a woman who inspired a lifelong passion for reading, as she herself had, in generations of youngsters.  Millie Benson was born in the town of Ladora, Iowa to Dr. J.L. and Lillian Augustine on July 10, 1905. In addition to being a voracious reader, she also excelled at athletics. She pursued both while a student at the University of Iowa, where she was a champion diver, a reporter for the local newspaper, and a published author. Her first story was published in 1919 in The Nicholas Magazine of New York. It was when completing her Master's Degree that she began her famous book series, and under a pen name wrote the first 23 books of the Nancy Drew mysteries. Paid little and required to sign away the rights, Mildred Benson remained in obscurity as the books' author until a legal battle in 1983 revealed her identity.  In the meantime, Mildred Benson, who had married Asa Wirt in 1928, kept busy with many other pursuits including the writing of several other series for children and novels, obtaining both commercial and instrument rated private pilot licenses (in her sixties!), and traveling into such remote outposts as the jungles of Mexico and South America and archeological sites in Central America, where she pursued her hobby exploring Mayan civilization. After Mr. Wirt's passing, in 1950 she married George Benson. Mr. Benson was editor of the Toledo Times newspaper. Thus began her revived career as a reporter. When the Toledo Times ceased publication in 1959, she began working for The Blade.  The 1990s brought her renewed acclaim as the author of the Nancy Drew series. Although in her eighties and nineties, she was a guest of many national and worldwide conferences, publications, and televised broadcasts. In 1993, she was the feature of the University of Iowa's Nancy Drew conference. Recognized by her alma mater not only for her journalism, she was also remembered as the first woman to receive a master's degree in journalism from that institution, an accomplishment she achieved in 1927. She was inducted into the Iowa Women's Hall of Fame and received her alma mater's highest alumni award. Other recognitions included lifetime achievement awards from the Ohio Newspaper Women (1997) and The Blade (1999), an honorary Doctor of Letters Degree from Adrian College in Michigan (1999), and the Ohio Library Association's recognition of her ``distinguished and creative contributions to children's literature'' (1989). Even while living this full and creative life, Millie Benson never forgot her fans. She answered every single letter, honored each request for an autograph, and always had time to talk to her fans.  Everyday of Mildred Benson's life was spent living to life's absolute fullest. Her example inspired those around her. Her unflagging enthusiasm for her chosen profession was infectious and her zest for life unsurpassed. Perhaps Blade publisher John R. Block summarized her best, saying ``Millie Benson was one of the greatest women writers and journalists of the 20th century. She was gutsy and daring, a living embodiment of her Nancy Drew heroine.'' Our deepest condolences go now to her daughter Peggy. Yet Mildred Benson's lasting legacy remains through her books and the millions of lives her writing and her life have influenced.  In a 1973 issue of Books At Iowa describing her career, Millie Benson wrote of writing for the ages and not just a place in time, but her essay ``The Ghost of Ladora'' is actually the finest tribute to her life's passage, ``So now it is time for the final chapter, seemingly one destined from the beginning. A fadeout becomes the most difficult of all, for the story is finished, the reader led to believe that the very best lies directly ahead. New worlds to conquer! New horizons to explore! . . . and all the pilots of fantasy suddenly take shape before our eyes, their waggling wings flashing the personal message: `Come fly with me.' Such challenge cannot be denied. Work forgotten, we hasten to the nearby airport where a small plane awaits its all-too-willing passenger. Eagerly we take off, climbing high above the smog, the petty perplexities of life. The sky is blue. The wind blows free, Here at last, far above the earth, age and youth imperceptibly blend, and stem reality dissolves into the ultimate Magnificent Dream.''                          ____________________
