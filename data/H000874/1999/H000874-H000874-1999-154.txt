Chairman, if the gentleman would continue to yield, what I essentially said was that the money spent on the Federal Employee Health Benefit Plan, in other words, the gentleman is saying Federal tax dollars, the money we spend toward the retirement program and the salary, are all a part of the compensation package of the employee.  Now, the salary is paid directly. I put it in my pocket. No one could refer to that as Federal tax dollars that were given to me and put in my pocket. But surely my point would be, my colleague would not tell me or anybody else tell me that I can only spend that money in this way or that way. In fact, a woman could spend her part of her salary to accomplish a legal objective with which my colleague would disagree, I understand.  My question to my colleague is, how do we differentiate that part of the compensation package, albeit it is paid directly to the insurance company, because it is put all together?
