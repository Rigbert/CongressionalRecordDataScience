President. I thank the Senator from Wyoming for giving me some time to talk about this.  I do not think there is any subject nor any issue in America right now that people are more concerned about than what is happening with the budget and with the deficit.  I just had an experience a minute ago with two very dear people, and I would like to deviate a little. It fits very well into this. Two of the most beautiful women in America are Yvonne Fedderson and Sara O'Meara. They started many years ago an effort to address the problem of child abuse. This blue ribbon is in recognition of Child Abuse Prevention Month that is taking place right now. Here is a bumper sticker. They started many years ago a program outside of Government to do something effectively about the problem of child abuse in America.  We saw just yesterday a bill which passed the House of Representatives that also recognizes that the problems of this country are not going to all be addressed by Government. In fact, in many cases, Government is the problem.  This particular program, which was started by Sara O'Meara and Yvonne Fedderson many years ago, has a hotline throughout the Nation. Anyone who has an idea about or knowledge of child abuse can call 1-800-4-A-CHILD.  The reason I bring this up, Mr. President, is because this is a national problem. It seems to me that in the last 40 years the very liberal Congress in both Houses has felt that you had to respond to these problems by starting some new Government program. I suggest to you that most of the programs which address the problems in the Nation today are not Government programs, they are programs in the private sector. This program is a perfect example. They have in every State and every contiguous State--and perhaps the others too--a program where people can call a hotline and do something about one of the most serious problems in America, which is child abuse.  The Government has a number of programs. But I suggest to you when you look at the effectiveness of these programs it is far more effective to have one that is run by the private sector, that is staffed by volunteers, than having one that is a Government program. Our problem is we have become accustomed to assuming that the problems can be addressed by the Federal Government better than by the private sector.  In the bill that was passed yesterday in the House of Representatives, there is a tax incentive for families to take care of their own children as opposed to Government taking care of them. There is a tax incentive--not many people are aware of this--of $500 for people to take care of the elderly. This is something that many people did not know was in that bill, which just passed yesterday. The idea is families in this country can take on a lot of responsibilities that Government has learned to assume.  I read something with interest the other day. It is an article by Thomas Sowell. Thomas Sowell is an editorial writer. The name of his article is ``A Dishonest Slogan.'' This ``Dishonest Slogan'' is the one that is called trickle down. It seems as if the liberals feel that with Government, higher taxes are the answer to our problems--and this was said, by the way, on this Senate floor by the distinguished Senator from West Virginia, Senator Byrd--that we need higher taxes in America. Then when they talk about the fact that they are giving tax reductions, they try to use slogans like ``trickle down.''  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that, at this point in the Record, this article by Thomas Sowell be printed.  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in the Record, as follows:                           A Dishonest Slogan                           (By Thomas Sowell)       If there were a prize for the most dishonest phrase in      politics, the competition would be fierce and the outcome      very uncertain. However, my nomination would be the phrase      ``trickle-down economics.''       The trickle-down theory is supposedly the notion that the      way to benefit the poor is to have the government provide      benefits to the rich, which will then trickle down to the      poor. But there is simply no such theory--not in Adam Smith,      not in John Maynard Keynes, not in Milton Friedman. Not in      anybody.       My specialty within economics is the history of economics      theories--but there is no history of any such theory.       Still, no political campaign is complete without liberals      accusing conservatives of applying trickle-down theories to      benefit the rich, instead of having the government give      benefits directly to the poor. With Republicans likely to      raise the issue of reducing the capital gains tax in the next      Congress, Democrats will no doubt cry that this is a ``tax      break for the rich'' based on ``trickle-down economics.''       Let's go back to square one. There is no investment income      to tax until after an investment has been made and people      hired--and after it all works out successfully, which is by      no means guaranteed. In short, the benefits to investors come      after the benefits to those they employ, not before.       When investments finally pay off, perhaps years later, it      would make no sense to call the eventual profit simply income      for the year in which it is received. That is why capital      gains are taxed differently from ordinary income.       Often there is no real capital gain at all, except on      paper. If you bought an asset back when the price level was      half of what it is today, and you sold the property for twice      what you paid for it, then you have just kept up with      inflation. If you sell it for 50% more than you paid for it,      you have actually lost part of the real value.       Even when your capital ``gain'' does not keep up with      inflation, the government still taxes you on it. Moreover,      these kinds of ``gains'' go into the statistics supposedly      showing that ``the rich are getting richer and the poor are      getting poorer.''       Despite tilting against the windmills of a nonexistent      trickle-down theory, the last thing the liberals want to do      is to give benefits directly to the poor. They may not have a      trickle-down theory, but in practice they make sure that any      benefits to the poor trickle down through layers of      bureaucracy and are siphoned off to pay the salaries,      consulting fees and research grants of all sorts of      ``experts'' with degrees.       That is why studies have shown that every man, woman and      child in America could be raised above the official poverty      level by direct transfers of money, at less than half the      cost of all the government's antipoverty programs. Lots of      people who are not poor by any stretch of the imagination      have to be taken care of out of antipoverty money.       Proposals to replace public housing programs,      ``retraining'' programs and other social experiments with      hard cash given directly to the poor have repeatedly run into      a buzz saw of opposition from liberals. They don't mind more      money being given to the poor--or to anybody else--but not at      the expense of programs that employ bureaucrats and      ``experts.''       These anomalies are not accidental. The welfare state is      ultimately not about getting more money into the hands of the      poor but about getting more power into the hands of      government. In program after program, the poor are to benefit      only insofar as they allow themselves to be directed and      manipulated by their self-anointed saviors.       When people get private sector jobs instead of government      handouts, the situation is completely different. Capital      gains tax reforms are needed simply to stop the government      from discouraging the investment that provides employment.       It is nonsense to call this ``trickling down'' because the      investment has to happen first, and workers have to be hired      first and paid first, before the investor has any hope of      reaping any gains. Since capital gains come last, not first,      they do not ``trickle down.''       Obviously, the higher the capital gains tax rate, the less      the incentive to invest and hire. If you want more Americans      employed, you don't punish people for employing them.      Otherwise, the investors have every incentive to invest their      money in some other country that doesn't have such high      capital gains taxes--or doesn't have capital gains taxes at      all.       But the liberals are so politically dependent on class      warfare, and on their own role as saviors of the poor, that      they are very slow to admit that there wouldn't be so many      poor for them to save if there were more jobs created by the      economy. On the other hand, if they are not playing the role      of saviors of the poor, how are they to get re-elected?
