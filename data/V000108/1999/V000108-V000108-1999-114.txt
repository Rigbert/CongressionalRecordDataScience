Speaker, it is with the greatest pleasure that I pay tribute to an exceptionally dedicated, compassionate, and distinguished member of Indiana's First Congressional District, Chancellor Hilda Richards of Gary, Indiana. After serving as Chancellor of Indiana University Northwest for six years, Hilda Richards will be retiring next month. On June 5, 1999, Chancellor Richards will be honored with a final, formal salute for her service, effort, and dedication, at Innsbrook Country Club in Merrillville, Indiana.  Born in St. Joseph, Missouri, Chancellor Hilda Richards received her Diploma in Nursing from St. John's School of Nursing in 1956 and continued her education in New York City, New York, where she graduated cum laude from Hunter College with her Bachelor of Science degree in 1961. Chancellor Richards continued her education at Columbia University, where she received her Masters in Education in 1965, Masters of Public Administration in 1971, and her Doctorate of Education in 1976. Chancellor Richards understands that a solid educational foundation will challenge one's mind, empower one's sense of well-being, and rekindle one's heart, with a commitment to values and beliefs essential to becoming and being a whole individual. In the words of Chancellor Hilda Richards herself, ``I knew I wanted to make a difference--and I needed a good education to do that. My personality would not allow it to be any other way.'' Chancellor Richards has continued to challenge herself by doing post-doctoral work at Harvard University.  Chancellor Hilda Richards began her professional life as a staff nurse at Payne Whitney Clinic of New York Hospital in 1956. Four years later she became an instructor of nursing in the Department of Psychiatry at City Hospital in New York, where she also rose to the position of head nurse in the Department of Psychiatry. From 1971 to 1976 she served as the Director of Nursing Programs and Chair of the Health Science Division at Medgar Evers College in New York City, and from 1976-1979 she served as the Associate Dean of Academic Affairs for Medgar Evers College. Chancellor Richards continued her professional career as Dean of the College of Health and Human Services at Ohio University in Athens, Ohio. Before coming to Indiana University Northwest to serve as Chancellor, she served as Provost and Vice President for Academic Affairs at Indiana University of Pennsylvania from 1986-1993.  Though extremely dedicated to her academic work, Chancellor Hilda Richards selflessly gives her free time and energy to her community. Chancellor Richards is a life member of the National Association for the Advancement of Colored People and a member of the American Nurses Association. She also serves as a board member for several organizations in Northwest Indiana, including: The Gary Education Development Foundation, Inc.; Tradewinds Rehabilitation Center, Inc.; Boys and Girls Club of Northwest Indiana; WYIN-Channel 56; and the Northwest Indiana Forum. Additionally, Hilda Richards has volunteered countless hours of service to the Times Newspaper Editorial Advisory Board, the Indiana Youth Institute, and The Methodist Hospital.  Mr. Speaker, I ask that you and my distinguished colleagues join me in commending Chancellor Hilda Richards for her dedication, service, and leadership to the students and faculty of Indiana University Northwest, as well as the people of the First Congressional District. Northwest Indiana's community has certainly been rewarded by the true service and uncompromising dedication displayed by Chancellor Hilda Richards.                          ____________________
