 I know that Senator Boxer made much ado about the fact that Justice Brown had dissented 31 times on the California Supreme Court. But our good friend from California neglected to mention that this puts Justice Brown about in the middle of the pack, in terms of the number of dissents issued on the California Supreme Court. In addition, I would point out to my good friend from Alabama--because of the esteem in which she is held by her peers out there on the California Supreme Court--Justice Brown was selected to write the second-highest number of opinions on the court, second only to the Chief Justice of that court. And numerous California jurists have, to put it mildly, enthusiastically endorsed this nomination--the people who know her best.
