President, I commend particularly Senator Byrd and Senator Kerry for their leadership in this area and say I come to the floor as a U.S. Senator from a State that is the first State in the country to put mandatory limits on carbon dioxide, the primary manmade source of global warming. We have shown in our home State that it is possible to have a thriving, prosperous economy and take steps to limit these environmental problems that our colleagues have talked about.  The fact is, our country can help play a leadership role in controlling global warming without causing an economic meltdown. There are, really, three approaches that the State of Oregon has used, as the first State in the country to have mandatory controls on carbon dioxide emissions.  First, as Senators Byrd and Kerry have talked about, we give great emphasis on market mechanisms. We are not talking about a big government approach. We are talking about using the market.  Second, we have taken steps to build these new approaches into new powerplant design. It is prospective, so that all those who are constructing our new powerplants understand the rules.  Third, we have given special rewards, credits, for innovative approaches such as proper management of our forests.  I conclude by saying that properly managed forests can be very effective in helping to capture greenhouse gases, carbon dioxide, and removing them from the air. Our Northwest forests are some of the very best carbon sinks in the world. The older forests are estimated to be two to three times as effective in capturing carbon dioxide emissions as new growth.  I have heard several of my colleagues talk about some of the alternatives. Carbon taxes----
