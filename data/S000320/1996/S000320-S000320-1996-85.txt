 President, I am concerned at the moment, as one of the managers of the bill, not about the study that the Senator from Massachusetts and the Senator from California discussed, because in a lot of ways that makes a lot of sense. I am concerned about the offsets--how are we going to pay for it? I understand the Senator is proposing to pay for this study.  Because of that, as I indicated, Senator Kerrey and I at the appropriate time would move to table the amendment. Mr. President, this amendment proposes to appropriate $21.3 million for this study, and it is probably going to cost a lot of money to do a proper study of this kind. The offset, Mr. President, I remind my colleagues, would come from reductions in the IRS.  Now, the Secretary of the Treasury and the Commissioner of the IRS are already calling and imploring us to try to put some more money in the IRS. Senator Kerrey and I believe we are properly funding the IRS, but to take an additional $21.3 million out, I think, would not be the proper time to do it, and it would not be the proper thing to do. I do not believe it is the appropriate thing to do on this bill.  I was wondering if the Senator from Massachusetts and California could find some other way to fund the study?
