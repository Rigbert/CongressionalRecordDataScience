Rather than let it expire and these 1,700 students and their families be disadvantaged, we extended it for a year in this bill. What is going to happen in the course of that year? Senator Lieberman's committee is going to take a close look to see if the over $70 million we spent on this program has worked. Are the students getting a good education, better than they would in public schools, better than in charter schools? Are the teachers competent in this program? Are the schools they are learning in safe buildings?  These are fundamental questions we should ask of every school program. I do not understand reluctance on the other side to have an honest evaluation of the program that has cost us over $70 million in taxpayer funds.  At the end of the day, those schools that are doing a good job will be given good grades. Those that are failing in this process do not deserve to be renewed. I have extended this program for a year in the bill, and the other provision, which I am going to allow Senator Schumer to address, gives to the DC City Council the same thing you would want the Las Vegas City Council to have if Congress tried to impose a program on them.  I yield my remaining time to Senator Schumer.
