Speaker, on March 9, I was having dinner at a nearby restaurant with the Oregon State labor commissioner and apparently my electronic beeper malfunctioned and I missed a recorded vote on the Cox amendment to H.R. 956 which would cap non-economic pain and suffering damages in health care liability cases at $250,000. If I had been present I would have voted ``no.''                          ____________________
