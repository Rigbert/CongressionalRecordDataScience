Speaker, I rise today to recognize the Maryland District 7 Softball Team--this year's winners of the 2003 Softball Big League World Series.  This softball powerhouse breezed through the tournament to win their fifth championship title in seven years at the Big League Softball World Series. In eight innings, Maryland defeated Puerto Rico in the Championship Game by a score of 3-1. I want my colleagues to know about the hard work ethic and determination these outstanding young athletes possess.  Mr. Speaker, this is a sports success story and fans were thrilled by the championship effort and heart displayed by these young women from Maryland. Mr. Speaker, please join me in congratulating the Maryland District 7 Softball Team on their triumphant season.  The Maryland District 7 Softball Team: Jamie Baden, Lacy Cochran, Kim Fowler, Heather Hall, Heather Holley, Carrie Higdon, Cory Karcesky, Amanda Mitchell, Caryn Moreland, Lindsey Preuss, Kelly Seger, Maris Smith, Danielle Sturman, Jamea Waltersdorff, Abbey Welch, along with coaches Andy Adams, and Mike Kriner and manager Tommy Morrison.                          ____________________
