As he is aware, we have received over a dozen letters in support of S. 1699, the Stop Counterfeiting in Manufactured Goods Act of 2005. I ask unanimous consent to have several of these letters printed in the Record.  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in the Record, as follows:                                   Lexmark International Inc.,                                  Lexington, KY, November 4, 2005.     Hon. Patrick J. Leahy,     U.S. Senate,     Washington, DC.       Dear Senator Leahy: I am writing to the members of the      Senate Judiciary Committee to express Lexmark's strong      support for Senate Bill 1699 (the ``Stop Counterfeiting in      Manufactured Goods Act''), and to urge your support for its      passage. S. 1699 creates a much-needed deterrent targeting      traffickers in counterfeit labels and goods--illegal acts      which plague not only our business, but many others. S. 1699      amends 18 U.S.C. 2320 to strengthen the application of this      statute to include those who traffic in counterfeit labels      and goods, thus greatly helping our fight against      counterfeiters.       Unfortunately, counterfeiting continues to grow out of      control because it is seen as a lucrative, yet low risk,      crime that some even try to paint as a victimless crime.      Nothing could be farther from the truth--not only are the      illicit profits being funneled into other criminal      activities, but law abiding citizens around the world are      made victims when they unwittingly buy illegitimate products.      Intellectual property owners, their counsels, private      investigators and law enforcement fight counterfeiting every      day. We must be able to send a message to counterfeiters that      the theft of intellectual property is intolerable and that      the battle against counterfeiting will be fought with      stronger weapons. S. 1699 accomplishes that precise goal, by      strengthening forfeiture and destruction remedies.       Counterfeiting costs the United States billions of dollars      each year in lost intellectual property, revenues, profits      and ultimately, jobs. These criminals must be stopped, and      this bill seeks to take away some of the tools they use to      manufacture counterfeit goods. If S. 1699 is enacted into      law, it will also help the United States seek reciprocal      legislation abroad.       I urge your personal support for S. 1699 both in Judiciary      Committee deliberations and in promotion of its passage in      the full Senate. Thank you for your consideration in      addressing this very serious problem.           Yours sincerely,                                                Patrick T. Brewer,     Director, Government Affairs.                                  ____                                  Zippo Manufacturing Company,                                   Bradford, PA, November 2, 2005.     Hon. Patrick J. Leahy,     Ranking Democratic Member, Russell Senate Office Building,          Washington, DC.       Dear Senator Leahy: I am writing to express my absolute      support for Senate Bill 1699, the ``Stop Counterfeiting in      Manufactured Goods Act'' S. 1699 creates a necessary      disincentive in the criminal code for traffickers in      counterfeit labels and goods. We urge you to endorse S. 1699      and promote its passage in the full Senate.       First, the S. 1699 amendments to 18 U.S.C. 2320 will help      our fight against counterfeiters by strengthening the      application of this statute to those who traffic in      counterfeit labels and goods. We are pleased that S. 1699      recognizes the need to strengthen the effectiveness of 18      U.S.C. 2320.       Second, S. 1699 strengthens forfeiture and destruction      remedies that are necessary to deter counterfeiting.      Unfortunately, counterfeiting continues to grow out of      control because it is seen as a lucrative yet low risk crime.      Intellectual property owners, their counsels, private      investigators and law enforcement fight counterfeiting every      day. We must be able to send a message to counterfeiters that      the theft of intellectual property is intolerable and that      the battle against counterfeiting will be fought with      stronger weapons. S. 1699 accomplishes that precise goal.       Counterfeiting will continue to cost the U.S. hundreds of      billions of dollars each year if U.S. law does act as a      deterrent. This bill takes the very equipment out of the      hands of counterfeiters who would perpetuate the manufacture      of illicit goods. Once S. 1699 is enacted into law it will      allow the U.S. to seek similarly strong legislation abroad as      it enters into trade negotiations with other countries.       We ask you to support S. 1699 as written in your next      Executive Business meeting and promote its passage in the      full Senate. Thank you for attending to a serious problem      that undermines U.S. intellectual property.           Sincerely,                                             Charles Jeffrey Duke,     Corporate Secretary and General Counsel.                                  ____                                                      WARNACO,                                   New York, NY, November 2, 2005.

Senator Arlen Specter,     Chairman, Senate Committee on the Judiciary, Hart Senate          Office Building, Washington, DC.     Senator Patrick J. Leahy,     Ranking Member, Senate Committee on the Judiciary, Russell          Senate Office Building, Washington, DC.       Dear Senator Specter and Senator Leahy: On behalf of the      more than 2,100 people employed in the U.S. by The Timberland      Company. I am writing to express my support for S. 1699, the      ``Stop Counterfeiting in Manufactured Goods Act'' which      creates necessary disincentives in the criminal code for      traffickers in counterfeit labels and goods. This bill is an      essential step toward protecting our trademark, our brand,      and our company's identity. I urge you to endorse this bill      and promote its passage in the full Senate.       As you know, the elicit counterfeiting of legitimate      products is a serious problem, both internationally and in      the United States. This bill, which is similar to H.R. 32,      which was passed by the U.S. House of Representatives in May,      will strengthen efforts to combat counterfeiting in the U.S.      in two very important ways. Specifically, S. 1699 would:       Amend Title 18 of the United States Code to close the      loophole in the criminal trademark infringement statute,      which currently does not criminally prohibit the trafficking      of labels, patches, and stickers, and other counterfeit      marks; and       Ensure that counterfeit goods and marks seized in violation      of this statute are properly disposed of and do not make      their way back on the street.       Counterfeiting costs the U.S. hundreds of billions of      dollars each year, and will continue to do so if our laws do      not act as a deterrent. Not only would S. 1699 take the very      equipment out of the hands of counterfeiters who would      perpetuate the manufacture of illicit goods, it would allow      the U.S. to seek similarly strong legislation abroad as it      enters into trade negotiations with other countries.       I appreciate this opportunity to address this critically      important issue, and I hope you will continue the fight      against elicit counterfeiting of U.S. products by supporting      S. 1699 and promoting its passage in the full Senate.           Sincerely,                                             Danette Wineberg,                                                   Vice President,                                    General Counsel and Secretary.
