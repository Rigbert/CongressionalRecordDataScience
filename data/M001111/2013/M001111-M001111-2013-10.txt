 There is no other legislation that can be brought before us at this time to prevent a government shutdown. As we know, the House of Representatives has gone home for the year. We know without the bipartisan agreement before us, the impacts across the country would be untenable. We have kind of been there. On top of that, if we do not have this budget agreement, the military itself will take another $20 billion hit, so those very military personnel whom all of us passionately care about would be facing layoffs, would be facing uncertainty, would be facing furloughs, would be facing tremendous hardship to themselves and to their families. So, yes, the Senator from Arizona is absolutely correct.  Mr. McCAIN. I would further ask the chairperson if she has, as I have, heard from every single uniformed service leader of the four armed services, including the Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, that further effects of sequestration will do unsustainable damage to our national security, that the pain inflicted because of the way that sequestration acts in 2014, the really significant effects, are that we will destroy or certainly dramatically impact our ability to defend this Nation? Is that not the unanimous opinion of our uniformed service commanders to whom we give the responsibility to defend this Nation? I would ask the chairperson if she has heard from our military leadership in uniform as well on this entire proposal, particularly its effect from sequestration?
