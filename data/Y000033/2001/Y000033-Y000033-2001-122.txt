Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.  In somewhat of a response, let us keep in mind that, unfortunately, we keep talking about the past. We all admit, including Secretary Mineta, President Bush, and myself, the chairman of the subcommittee, that the existing system does not work. What we are trying to do is pass the best system that will work.  I said it last week and I will say it this week: if I thought for one moment that the so-called bill from the other body, I am not going to say whatever it was, if I thought it would do a better job than what we have been able to put together, the gentleman from Minnesota (Mr. Oberstar) and myself, the gentleman from Florida (Mr. Mica), then I would have been supporting the other bill. It is that simple.  I hope we keep this on a level playing field tonight. In fact, what we are trying to do, and why I support the motion, is we are trying to expedite the process and send a message to the Senate to get off what they had, because in my heart, it will never happen on my watch, 100 percent their bill, because it does not do the job.  I want good security. We have a good product. We will go to conference. If they can improve it for better security, then I will support it. But I am not in this business just to make the talk shows on Sunday. A lot of that has been going on. I think that is not good for either body. Let us get the security that is necessary for the traveling public.  Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.
