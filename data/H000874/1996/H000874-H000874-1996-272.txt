Speaker, we have to love the chairman of the Committee on the Budget. He is trying to snatch victory from the drum beat of retreat to cutting education, cutting the environment, cutting programs that the American public have communicated to my colleagues, ``Do not touch them. Do not take our cops off the beat, do not take our teachers out of school, do not take our chapter 1 students and put them without any kind of help, because that is not good for the country.''  And I congratulate the gentleman from Ohio [Mr. Kasich]. He spins it as well as anybody in this House. But, my colleagues, I am pleased to see us abandon the CRs that I used to refer to as completely ridiculous to CRs that say completely, and perhaps that overstates it, but resolved the 1996 budget. Yes, it is 7 months late. Yes, it is after an unprecedented 25 days of shutdown. But, I say to my friend, the chairman of the Committee on the Budget, he pointed out incorrectly, as the gentleman from Wisconsin [Mr. Obey] has noted, that it was not since 1945, and I hear the complaints that Bill Clinton has stood in the door of progress and vetoed legislation.  Where was Ronald Reagan to accomplish this great objective of which the chairman speaks in 1981, 1982, 1983, 1984, 1985, 1986, 1987 and 1988, and our friend, Mr. Bush in 1989, 1990, 1991 and 1992? Where was he when it was profligate spending? Where were they to say ``no.'' We never overrode one of their vetoes on spending. Not once.  So, yes, now we have a bill that we are going to vote for; I hope everybody votes for this because it does, in fact, try to meet the needs of the American public, whether it is for education, public safety, health, or senior citizens health care. It tries to say we understand that we need to invest in the welfare of our people. This bill does it.
