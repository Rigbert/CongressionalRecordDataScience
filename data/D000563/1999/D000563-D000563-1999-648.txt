President, I will close by saying I am happy that the majority leader, Senator Lott, has made this commitment publicly on the floor of the Senate that within 2 weeks we will have debate on legislation such as I have described here. The important thing about that debate is not what is said on the floor of the Senate between Senators. What is important between now and that 2-week deadline is what is said by the American people to those who serve in the Senate.  For those who are watching the proceedings of the Senate or who read the Record, I hope you will understand that if you are not part of this debate, if you do not pick up your telephone, if you do not take a pen and write a letter, if you do not send an e-mail saying, ``For goodness sake, do something about violence in our schools and the proliferation of guns in the hands of children,'' I can guarantee you that the outcome of this debate is going to be a disappointment to families across America.  Do not give up on Congress. This is an institution which is serving this country and all of the American families in it. The families have to come forward now. They have to be heard from. It is not enough to say the school year is coming to an end, so that will be the end of school violence. There will always be another school year, history tells us, sadly, always an opportunity for another tragedy. Let us learn something valuable from the suffering of the families in Littleton, CO. Let us vow, Democrat and Republican alike, that we will do everything in our power to reduce school violence and make this a safer place for our children.  I yield back my time.  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Crapo). Who yields time?                          ____________________
