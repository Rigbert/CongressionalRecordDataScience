President, I ask unanimous consent that the following amendments be called up and reported by number: Senator Manchin's amendment No. 3553, Senator Paul's amendment No. 3543. I further ask consent that at 5:45 p.m. today, the Senate vote in relation to the Manchin and Paul amendments in the order listed and that there be no second-degree amendments in order to the amendments prior to the votes. Finally, I ask that there be 10 minutes, equally divided in the usual form, between the two votes.
