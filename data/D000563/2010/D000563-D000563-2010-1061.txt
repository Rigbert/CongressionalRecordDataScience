If the Senator is correct, I will make that point in the record.  I would like to notify the Senator from Kentucky about Joetta from Ferguson, who wrote:       I have been laid off since October 31, 2008. When I was      laid off, I lost my health insurance coverage. The COBRA plan      offered cost so much, I could not keep the insurance. I     was told if business picks up in the spring, I could get      called back to work. However, since I was laid off from the      concrete company, there have been two other office personnel      laid off this past January, so I doubt I will be called back      to work. I am 58 years old. I have a high school education. I      am finding it extremely difficult to find a job, even though      I apply for work and am registered with the local      unemployment office. I am not one to seek after handouts.      However, I have worked all my adult life and have paid taxes      as most everyone else has. And I do not expect favors from      anyone. I am completely down and out and can hardly pay      bills, buy food, et cetera, let alone medical expenses. My      husband has insurance through his employment but the cost to      add me onto his plan is so high, we simply cannot afford it.      Also, he makes $10 per hour, so it isn't as if we have an      abundance of money to live on. And I am a very economic      person.  It is hard to imagine why we would say no to unemployment benefits for Joetta from Ferguson under the circumstances. If we want to fight this budget and deficit battle, why would we hurt her in the crossfire of the conversation? Why wouldn't we extend these unemployment benefits for her and thousands like her in Illinois and Kentucky and other States?
