 This provision is section 105(c)(3)(B), which sets forth an exception to the general requirement that parties must participate in the administrative review process before raising claims in Federal court. I don't understand the conference report and statement of the managers as doing anything to change the parties' preexisting obligations as to environmental review except as explicitly provided in the statute. Do you agree, as the ranking member on the Subcommittee on Public Lands and Forests of the Senate Committee on Energy and Natural Resources?
