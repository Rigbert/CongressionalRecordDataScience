President, I am sure Judge Paez had no interest in being assigned that case or the case against a former Member of Congress, Republican Representative Jay Kim, or any other high-profile case. I suspect any judge who has a pending confirmation would be delighted to avoid such high-profile cases, but they follow the rules. If the machine comes up and says ``you are assigned,'' then that judge hears that case. Judge Paez ought not continue to be penalized for doing his job in ruling in those assigned cases.  There is no allegation--no credible allegation, no believable allegation, no factual allegation, no whisper of an allegation--outside this Chamber that he did anything to obtain jurisdiction over those matters. None whatsoever. That ought to settle this matter once and for all.  It is the same as buying a lottery ticket and having the machine pick the numbers for you. It is done automatically. He did not win the lottery on this because he did not want a high-profile case, but he did his job, the job he was sworn to do. We ought to do the job we are sworn to do and vote up or down on these two people and not, as some have suggested, have a vote to suspend indefinitely. That is the Senate saying: Notwithstanding we are being paid to vote yes or no, we decide to just vote maybe.  Let's vote up or down. In this particular case that has been talked about, Judge Paez sentenced John Huang to 1 year probation, 500 hours community service, and a $10,000 fine after he pled guilty to a felony conspiracy charge on August 12, 1999. He agreed to plead guilty after he reached an agreement, not with the judge but with the prosecution for the Department of Justice. Based on that agreement, the prosecutors recommended no jail time in exchange for the defendant's cooperation. Judge Paez's approval of the prosecutor's recommendation was not unusual.  During my years as a prosecutor, I can think of a number of times when I said to the judge: Would you give this type of a sentence because we are getting cooperation from this person? I am after bigger fish; I have bigger fish to fry. I need their cooperation. Will you please sentence him to what might appear to be a lighter sentence?  Judge Paez did put the sentencing off for 10 days, from August 2 to August 12. Why? To consider a request by a Republican Congressman, Dan Burton, who asked Judge Paez to delay sentencing until Huang testified in front of his committee investigating campaign finance abuses. The Congress asked him to delay. The Federal prosecutors objected to Representative Burton's request for the indefinite suspension of sentencing, and having delayed to consider the matter, Judge Paez proceeded with the sentencing on August 12. I believe he was correct in doing so. Huang's lawyer told the prosecutor he would cooperate with Representative Burton's committee, notwithstanding sentencing. My recollection is that is exactly what he did.  When it became clear, in virtually unprecedented fashion, Judge Paez and Marsha Berzon would have to leap over a 60-vote margin in cloture, and when it became clear the Senate would not add to the disgrace and humiliation of holding them up this long, that we would invoke cloture they want to suspend it indefinitely. After four years we should be more than prepared to vote for him for the Ninth Circuit.  Suspending a vote on this nomination would be a tragedy. Here is a remarkable man: a Hispanic American who has reached the Federal bench, has the highest rating that bar associations can give for a nominee, one of the most qualified people I have seen before the committee, Republican or Democrat, in my 25 years here. He has been waiting, dangling, for 4 years, humiliated by the actions of the Senate.  Now they ask to delay him again. It does not match up to what should be the standards of a body that calls itself the conscience of the Nation. Let us be clear, the Huang plea agreement, the transcript of the sentencing and related documents are not new. They have been in the possession of the Judiciary Committee since at least September of 1999. Six months they have been here.  The sentencing, his postponement, and the position of sentence did not happen in secret. It was in the glare of nationwide publicity. Thousands of sentencings go on every year in this country in all kinds of courts rarely covered by the press. This one was. These events extend back to last August and before. It is not a justification for asking for new information. It has been here.  I think the opponents misdirect their complaints about the plea agreement between the Government and Mr. Huang at Judge Paez. Complain about the Government's recommendation. That is one thing. Do not blame the judge who followed them.  Moreover, in spite of the impression sought to be created here, the plea agreement, dated May 21, 1999, expressly provides that Mr. Huang is not immune from Federal prosecution under ``laws relating to national security or espionage'' but covers only that conduct he had disclosed to prosecutors. In fact, his own attorney acknowledged at the time of sentencing that this plea agreement, OK'd by the prosecutors and the judge, leaves Mr. Huang open to further prosecution.  As far as the sentencing, let's be clear what happened. The Senate should know, pursuant to the agreement, Mr. Huang pled guilty to one count of conspiracy, a charge that carries the maximum penalty of up to 5 years. As for the calculation of the sentencing guidelines, both the Government and the probation office agreed on that calculation. They further agreed that in light of his substantial cooperation, he should receive a sentence of 1 year's probation and 500 hours of community service.  In fact, the only disagreement between the prosecutors and the probation office was on the amount of the fine. In this case, Judge Paez disregarded what the probation office recommended and went with the prosecutors' recommendation, the higher fine, and he imposed that fine.  If you read the sentencing transcript, you see the judge acted in a conscientious manner. He insisted on a probation officer's report and recommendation before proceeding. He did not proceed until he was advised of the extent and nature of Huang's cooperation that was expected. The Government informed the court that Huang provided substantial, credible information helpful in task force investigations. The judge emphasized that Mr. Huang was expected to continue to cooperate after his sentencing.  I mentioned being a former prosecutor. I can tell you, when I was prosecuting cases nothing was more infuriating than when people did not know the facts of a case or the extent of cooperation or the value of the plea agreement, and they would try to pick apart an agreement after the fact.  I can think of cases where people would say: Oh, my gosh, how can this person get a light sentence? Why? Because they helped us catch five other people we would not have caught without them.  It is easy enough to criticize and second-guess. It is always easy to say someone else settled too cheap, that they made a bad deal. That undermines the role and morale of good prosecutors. We all know how clogged the already overloaded courts would be if prosecutors could not use their bestjudgment and enter into plea agreements.  We have 75 vacancies in the Federal court. Prosecutors are under pressure all the time to move cases through because we have not confirmed the judges; we have not added the extra judges they need. The courts are backlogged. You cannot get civil cases heard because of all the criminal cases. Prosecutors have to make their best judgment.  Whether one agrees or disagrees with the agreement, no one can say, with a straight face, that we suddenly found out about it, or that now we have to have a last-minute postponement. We do not need such a thing.  This has been pending for 4 years. The facts have been here for 4 years. The nomination has been here for 4 years. Local law enforcement has strongly backed Judge Paez for 4 years. His home State Senators have strongly backed him for 4 years.  He is supported by the Los Angeles district attorney, the Los Angeles Police Protective League, the National Association of Police Organizations, the Association for Los Angeles Deputy Sheriffs, the Los Angeles County Police Chiefs' Association. This guy sounds like the kind of judge I would have liked to have had my cases assigned to when I was a prosecutor.  We have made this highly qualified man jump through hoops for 4 years. He was required to review his criminal sentences for his whole career on the Federal bench. This is what we asked him to do after he was pending for 4 years. He had two confirmation hearings, and had been voted out twice by the Republican-controlled Judiciary Committee.  A lesser person would have said: Enough is enough. This is such petty harassment. He did not complain. He complied. What do the facts show? He is a tough sentencer. Those are the facts, not the comment of some reporter thrown into a political story here in Washington.  The people of California, the people who know him best, named him the Federal Criminal Law Judge of the Year in 1999. He has had sentences within the sentencing guidelines more often than the national average for district judges. We ought to be praising him for that. People say district judges don't follow the guidelines. We ought to praise him for being above average in that.  We talk about his criminal judgments appealed. There were 32 criminal judgments appealed. He was affirmed 28 times. Two of the appeals were dismissed for lack of jurisdiction; one was remanded. Only 1 of the 32 was reversed, in part.  We talk about how we want people who are going to be upheld on appeal. There isn't a district court judge--Republican, Democrat, or anything else--who would not be delighted to have a record on appeal like Judge Paez.  He is a tough judge, a really tough judge. He is also a good judge, a well-trained judge, a highly intelligent judge, and a judge who wins on appeals.  Obviously, every Senator has a right to vote how he or she wants, but at least vote. I do not think it is right to hold somebody up. It would certainly be an outrageous mark of shame on the Senate if we took the unprecedented step, for a Federal judicial nominee, after cloture, to move to indefinitely postpone. It would be the first time that sequence would be followed in the Senate. That would be a mark of shame on us.  But what bothers me is the way people look for any reason--real or imagined--to vote against Judge Paez.  There seems to be no interest in looking at his whole record of public service. I have heard no mention of Judge Paez's decision in the Great Western Shows, Inc. case. That was a controversial case. I am sure he did not ask to be assigned to it. But he applied the law fairly and objectively. Let's mention this case.  We heard he may be a liberal judicial activist, whatever that is. It must mean, like the majority in the Supreme Court in the last year or so, taking away more rights from the States and people in patent cases, and so on. But let's talk about this.  In the Great Western Shows case, he heard and granted a motion for a preliminary injunction against a Los Angeles county ordinance that would have effectively banned gun shows, the sale of firearms and ammunition on county property. He went against those who wanted to ban the gun show because he found substantial questions that the ordinance was preempted by State law. So he granted an injunction so the gun show could proceed.  To me, that does not sound like a judicial activist. It reminds me of the courage that a Vermont district court judge showed back in 1994 when his nomination to the Second Circuit Court of Appeals was likewise pending before the Senate. At that time, Judge Fred Parker handed down his decision in the Frank case in which Judge Parker held the 10th amendment prohibited Congress from usurping the power of Vermont's Legislature and declared certain provisions of the Brady law unconstitutional.  I remember that very well because it was about the same time I was down asking the President of the United States to appoint Judge Parker, a conservative Republican, who served as the deputy attorney general of our State. I was asking the President to appoint Judge Parker to the Second Circuit. I also knew Judge Parker was an extraordinarily brilliant person. He was a classmate of mine in law school. He is highly honest. Usually he had supported my opponents.  I had to tell the President, who was strongly supporting the Brady law: This judge I want you to appoint to the Second Circuit Court of Appeals has just found a hunk of that law unconstitutional. The President said: Anything else you want me to do for you today?  But to Bill Clinton's credit, he did appoint Judge Parker to the Second Circuit. Oh, just as a little footnote, to Judge Parker's credit, the U.S. Supreme Court upheld him. They said he was right, that the way it was drafted, that part of the Brady law--which we have since changed--was unconstitutional.  The point is, both these judges, Judges Parker and Paez, acted with courage to do their duty. They applied the law to the facts, and they did their judicial duty. They did so at some personal risk while their nominations to higher courts were still pending before the Senate. I think the strength they show is commendable. They are the kinds of judges we need in our Federal courts to act with independence and in accordance with the law. All the Senators who were in the Senate at that time voted for Judge Parker.  I hoped they would give the same with respect to Judge Paez. He doesn't tailor rulings or sentences to please political supporters. He is not soft on crime. This is a man who gets upheld on virtually all his criminal cases. He is a person with great resolve and temperament and intellect. Those who seek to diminish this man or his record should reconsider and support his prompt confirmation.  I understand why people support him so strongly. I ask that a sampling of letters from the Hispanic National Bar Association, national Hispanic Leadership Agenda and its more than 30 constituent organizations, the League of United Latin American Citizens, and the U.S. Hispanic Chamber of Commerce in support of Judge Paez be printed in the Record.  There being no objection, the letters were ordered to be printed in the Record, as follows:                            Hispanic National Bar Association,                                Washington, DC, February 20, 2000.     Hon. Patrick Leahy,     Courthouse Plaza,     Burlington, VT.       Dear Senator Leahy: It is the understanding of the Hispanic      National Bar Association that Majority Leader Trent Lott has      agreed to call a floor vote on the nomination of Judge Paez      by March 15. Therefore, as the Regional President of the      Hispanic National Bar Association with jurisdiction over the      State of Vermont, I am writing to inquire into your position      on the nomination of Judge Richard A. Paez to the United      States Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit.       The Hispanic National Bar Association is a non-partisan      organization with over 22,000 members that has as one of its      goals to promote the appointment of qualified Hispanic      candidates to the Bench. We have reviewed the qualifications      of Judge Paez and strongly support his confirmation. In fact,      his confirmation is one of our top priorities for this year.       I will contact your office within the next few days to see      if you, or your staff, are available to meet with us to      discuss this important nomination. If you have any questions,      please feel free to contact me at (617) 565-3210.       For your information, I have attached a copy of a Los      Angeles Daily Journal article on Judge Paez which, upon your      perusal,     should clear up any misconceptions and incorrect labels that      are currently the foundations of objections to his      nomination.       I appreciate your attention to this request.           Sincerely,                                              R. Liliana Palacios,     Regional President.                                  ____                                                 National Hispanic                                            Leadership Agenda,                                    Washington, DC, March 3, 2000.       Dear Senator: As members of the Board of Directors of the      National Hispanic Leadership Agenda (NHLA), we are writing to      reiterate our strong support for Judge Richard Paez to the      Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals and our request that you vote      to confirm him.       About two weeks ago, you should have received a letter from      the NHLA signed by our Chair, Manuel Mirabal. Because we wish      to convey to you fully the importance of this matter to the      Latino community, we have decided to send you this additional      letter with our individual signatures.       The NHLA represents a highly diverse and important cross-     section of the national Latino community. Our organizations      have offices and constituents throughout the country, and we      come together when we find issues of mutual concern. We      submit this letter on behalf of the organizations we      represent, and we sign this letter as individuals prominent      in various fields, including business, legal, labor, health,      scientific, among others as well.       We come together to support a highly qualified candidate to      the Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals--Judge Richard Paez. In      1994, Judge Paez became the first Mexican American appointed      to the Central District Court of California in Los Angeles.      This was a milestone for the Latino community. Now that Judge      Paez has been nominated to the Ninth Circuit, we believe he      will serve well not only the 14 million Latinos living in the      Ninth Circuit, but all Americans who seek a fair review of      the matters they bring to court.       Thank you again for considering our strong backing for      Judge Paez, and we urge you to support his confirmation.           Sincerely,         Elena Rios, MD, National Hispanic Medical Association;            Kofi Boateng, Executive Director, National Puerto Rican            Forum; Elisa Sanchez, CEO, MANA, A National Latina            Organization; Delia Pompa, Executive Director, National            Association for Bilingual Education; Manuel Oliverez,            President & CEO, National Association of Hispanic            Federal Executives; Guarione M.

Hon. Patrick Leahy,     U.S. Senate,     Washington, DC.       Dear Senator Leahy: On behalf of the League of United Latin      American Citizens, the oldest and largest Hispanic      organization in the United States, I urge you to vote to      confirm Judge Richard Paez to the Ninth Circuit Court of      Appeals. Judge Paez was first nominated to serve on the Ninth      Circuit on January 25, 1996--more than four years ago. This      is an unusually long time to wait, especially considering      Judge Paez's qualifications for the position.       Judge Paez currently serves with distinction as a Federal      District Judge in the Central District of California, where      he has been for over five years. Before that he served as a      municipal judge in Los Angeles for thirteen years. When first      considered by the Senate, Judge Paez was confirmed      unanimously. Many of the Senators who agreed to his      nomination in 1994 are still in office. Since he was      nominated to the Ninth Circuit, Judge Paez has been through      two hearings to review his qualifications and both times he      was voted favorably out to be considered by the full Senate.      He has been rated well-qualified by the American Bar      Association and is supported by a wide array of individuals      and organizations, including representatives from the      business and law enforcement communities.       By March 15, 2000, Senate Majority Leader Trent Lott will      move for a vote on Judge Paez. I strongly urge you to support      his confirmation. His confirmation is important to LULAC not      only because we have the opportunity to place an excellent      judge in this important position, but as a Latino, he      represents one of a very few opportunities for our community      to be present at this level. It is also important to our      judicial system, both how it operates and how it is perceived      to operate, that individuals who have worked hard, played by      the rules, and are qualified receive a fair chance just like      others who may be different from them. Judge Paez has done      everything it takes to be qualified for the position on the      Ninth Circuit; he deserves your vote.       I hope we can count on you to support Judge Paez. LULAC      will be recommending that this vote be include in the      National Hispanic Leadership Agenda scorecord which will be      published at the conclusion of this session.           Sincerely,                                                    Rick Dovalina,     National President.                                  ____                                            United States Hispanic                                          Chamber of Commerce,                                  Washington, DC, October 6, 1999.     Hon. Trent Lott,     Senate Majority Leader,     U.S. Capitol,     Washington, DC.       Dear Senate Majority Leader: On behalf of the Board of      Directors of the United States Hispanic Chamber of Commerce      (USHCC). I urge you to encourage a vote on the nomination of      Federal District Court Judge Richard Paez to the Ninth      Circuit Court of Appeals. I urge you to consider the views of      the United States Hispanic Chamber of Commerce and of the      Hispanic, small-business community as we await a decision      from the Senate on the nomination of Judge Paez.       As you may know, the USHCC's primary goal is to represent      the interests of over 1.5 million Hispanic-owned businesses      in the United States and Puerto Rico. with a network of over      200 Hispanic chambers of commerce across the country, the      USHCC stands as the preeminent business organization that      effectively promoters the economic growth and development of      Hispanic entrepreneurs. In addition, the USHCC provides and      advocacy on many issues of importance to the Hispanic      community. Hispanic entrepreneurs are interested in promoting      the growth and development of Hispanics in the United States.      For this reason, the USHCC supports the confirmation of Judge      Paez to the Ninth Circuit.       Judge Paez was nominated to the Ninth Circuit Court of      Appeals in 1996. He has been awaiting confirmation by the      United States Senate for three and a half years, one of the      longest pending nominations in history. Judge Paez has      demonstrated the leadership and accomplishments that are well      suited to a candidate for a Ninth Circuit Court Judge. He      served as a judge in the Los Angeles Municipal Court for 13      years. While serving on that court, he was selected to serve      in various leadership positions, including Presiding Judge.      He was also elected to serve as Chair of the Los Angeles      County Municipal Court Judges Association. In 1994, he was      confirmed to the Central District Court of California where      he currently serves.       Judge Paez would be a great asset to the Ninth Circuit      Court of Appeals. He has the support of many civil rights,      law enforcement and community groups, including that of the      National Hispanic Leadership Agenda (NHLA) of which the USHCC      is a member organization. The NHLA is a coalition of over 30      national and leading. Hispanic organizations in the United      States. The USHCC has been supportive of NHLA's efforts      regarding the confirmation of Judge Paez. I therefore urge      you to listen to the voice of the Hispanic community and      confirm Judge Paez to the Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals.       Respectfully submitted,                                               George Herrera,                                                     President and                                          Chief Executive Officer.
