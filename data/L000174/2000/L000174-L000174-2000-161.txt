President, I rise today to again urge the Senate to bring up and pass, S. 2787, the Violence Against Women Act of 2000, VAWA II--we are quickly running out of time to reauthorize it. The authorization for the original Violence Against Women Act, VAWA, expires at the end of this week on September 30, 2000. There is absolutely no reason to delay this bill which has overwhelming bipartisan support.  I have joined Senators from both sides of the aisle at rallies and press conferences calling for the immediate passage of this legislation. The bill has 70 co-sponsors and is a significant improvement of the highly successful original VAWA which was enacted in 1994. There is no objection on the Democratic side of the aisle to passing VAWA II. Unfortunately, there have been efforts by the majority party to attach this uncontroversial legislation to the ``poison pill'' represented by the version of bankruptcy legislation currently being advanced by Republicans. I do not agree with stall tactics like this one and believe we should pass VAWA II as a stand-alone bill, without further delay.  Yesterday, in New Mexico, where he was releasing funding made available through VAWA for one of the country's oldest battered women's shelters, the President made a public plea for Congress to reauthorize VAWA, claiming, ``[T]his is not rocket science. Yes we're close to an election . . . But it is wrong to delay this one more hour. Schedulethe bill for a vote.'' I urge my colleagues to heed the cry of the President as he speaks on behalf of the almost 1 million women around this country who face domestic violence each year.  The President called domestic violence ``America's problem'' and I could not agree with him more. When we talk about reauthorizing the Violence Against Women Act we are not just talking about a big bureaucratic government program the effects of which we can't really see. With this bill we are talking about reauthorizing critical programs that have had a tremendous immediate effect on how this Nation handles domestic violence and its victims. We are at risk of jeopardizing what has been one of the most effective vehicles for combating domestic violence if we let this law expire.  I have heard from countless people in Vermont that have benefitted from grant funding through VAWA programs. VAWA II ensures the success of these crucial programs such as the Rural Domestic Violence Grant program. These grants are designed to make victim services more accessible to women and children living in rural areas. I worked hard to see this funding included in the original VAWA in 1994, and I am proud that its success has merited an increased authorization for funding in VAWA II. Rural Domestic Violence and Child Victimization Enforcement Grants have been utilized by the Vermont Network Against Domestic Violence and Sexual Assault, the Vermont Attorney General's Office, and the Vermont Department of Social and Rehabilitation Services to increase community awareness, to develop cooperative relationships between state child protection agencies and domestic violence programs, to expand existing multi disciplinary task forces to include allied professional groups, and to create local multi-use supervised visitation centers.  I witnessed the devastating effects of domestic violence when I was the Vermont State's Attorney for Chittenden County. In those days, long before the passage of the Violence Against Women Act, VAWA, there were not support programs and services in place to assist victims of these types of crimes. Today, because of the hard work and dedication of those in Vermont and around the country who work in this field every day, an increasing number of women and children are being aided by services through domestic violence programs and at shelters around the Nation. Lori Hayes, Executive Director of the Vermont Center for Crime Victim Services, and Marty Levin, Coordinator of the Vermont Network Against Domestic Violence and Sexual Assault, have been especially instrumental in coordinating VAWA grants in Vermont.  Let the Senate pass S. 2787, the Violence Against Women Act 2000 without further delay before its critical programs are jeopardized. It was cleared for passage by all Democratic Senators two months ago and should be passed today. It is past time to reauthorize and build upon the historic programs of the Violence Against Women Act and do all that we can to protect children from the ravages and lasting impact of domestic violence.  A Washington Post editorial today called the failure to pass the reauthorization of the Violence Against Women Act, ``inexplicable neglect,'' claiming that ``[t]here seems to be no good reason practical or substantive, to oppose reauthorization of the Violence Against Women Act.'' That could not be more true Mr. President. I ask unanimous consent that the editorial from the September 26, 2000 edition of the Washington Post be printed in the Record.  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in the Record, as follows:               [From the Washington Post, Sept. 26, 2000]                          Inexplicable Neglect       There seems to be no good reason, practical or substantive,      to oppose reauthorization of the Violence Against Women Act.      Originally passed in 1994, the act provides money to state      and local institutions to help combat domestic violence. It      is set to expire at the end of the month. Its reauthorization      has overwhelming bipartisan support. But House and Senate      leaders have yet to schedule a vote.       Versions of the bill have been favorably reported by the      judiciary committees of both chambers. Both would expand      programs that during the past five years have helped create      an infrastructure capable of prosecuting domestic violence      cases and providing services to battered women. Since the      original act was passed, Congress has devoted $1.5 billion to      programs created by it. The House and Senate bills differ,      but both would authorize more than $3 billion in further      support during the next five years. There is room to debate      the proper funding level relative to other priorities, a      matter which will be determined later by appropriators; and      the programs won't end immediately if the act lapses, because      funds have been approved for the coming year. But failing to      reauthorize would send the wrong message on an important      issue and, more important, could threaten future      appropriations.       With time in the 106th Congress running out, the Violence      Against Women Act may become a casualty of neglect rather      than of active opposition. But that's no comfort. Congress      ought to find the time to pass it before leaving town.                          ____________________
