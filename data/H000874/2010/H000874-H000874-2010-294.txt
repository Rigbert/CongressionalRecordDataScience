Mary's College of Maryland Varsity Sailing Team on winning the Inter-Collegiate Sailing Association's Team Race National Championship. This year's event was held May 29-31 on Lake Mendota in Madison, WI.  Unlike traditional fleet sailing, the team race event pits three boats against three boats. This event is often described as ``chess on water'' as sailors use unconventional tactics like slowing down and trapping their opponents to help teammates who are trailing to catch up. To win a race, the team of three must have a winning combination of finishes which total 10 points or fewer.  In the first round of competition, in which each team competes in six races, the Seahawks went undefeated in Group 1. In the second round among the top eight teams, the Seahawks had the best record with 11 wins and three losses. At the end of final round of the four winningest teams, the Seahawks went one and two, had a final record of 12 wins and 5 losses, and won the event.  I want to extend my congratulations to the following members of the Varsity Sailing Team who competed in this event: Ted Hale, Francis Kupersmith, Michael Menninger, Kelly Wilbur, Jesse Kirkland, Madeline Jackson, and Mike Kuschner. I want to commend Head Coach Adam Werblow, who has been with this program for 22 years, and Bill Ward, Director of Sailing, for their leadership of this team.  I urge my colleagues to join me in congratulating the entire St. Mary's College sailing team for their diligent training, teamwork and dedication to the sport, and for continuing the legacy of excellence in racing at the college.                          ____________________
