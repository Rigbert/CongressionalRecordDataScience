 President, if there is no further business to come before the Senate, I ask unanimous consent that it stand adjourned under the previous order under the provisions of S. Res. 609.  There being no objection, the Senate, at 4:33 p.m., adjourned under the previous order and pursuant to S. Res. 609 until Monday, August 20, 2018, at 3 p.m. and has done so as a further mark of respect for former Senator Paul Laxalt.                          ____________________
