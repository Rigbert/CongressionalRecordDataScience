 President, in the struggle for freedom in Burma, I am becoming increasingly convinced that Thailand is on the side of the representative junta in Rangoon.  To with, the Foreign Minister of Thailand was recently quoted: ``We are trying to find an exit for the Myanmar Government, the also reduce pressure from the international community.''  Instead of trying to find an ``exit'' for the repressive State Peace and Development Council, SPDC, Thailand should be trying to secure the release of democracy leader Daw Aung San Suu Kyi and other democrats jailed in the wake of the brutal May 30 attack on the National League for Democracy, NLD.  Thailand's ``business-as-usual'' approach places that country at odds with other Associated of Southeast Asian Nation, ASEAN, members--including Malaysia. Given the SPDC's refusal to release Suu Kyi and other Burmese democrats, Malaysian Prime Minister Mahathir rightly commented that Burma could be expelled from ASEAN ``as a last result.''  Thai Prime Minister Thaksin Shinawatra must defend democracy in Burma and should join with Malaysia and other ASEAN members in holding the SPDC accountable for their actions.  Thailand should take note that I included a provision in S. 1426, the fiscal year 2004 Foreign Operations appropriations bill, that conditions United States assistance to that country on a determination by the Secretary of State that Thailand: one, supports the advancement of democracy in Burma and is taking action to sanction the military junta in Rangoon; two, is not hampering the delivery of humanitarian assistance to people in Thailand who have fled Burma; and three is not forcibly repatriating Burmese to Burma.  It is past time for Thailand to prove its commitment to the cause of freedom and the rule of law in Burma. The Thai Foreign Minister has an opportunity to set the record straight in Bali this week. He should not miss it.                          ____________________
