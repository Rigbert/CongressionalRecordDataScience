 It is ready to go down to him for signature. If we add the Ex-Im Bank to it, we only delay the passage of this bipartisan JOBS bill, and we send it back to the House, and we don't know how they feel about the Ex-Im extension. We do know that here in the Senate, as I just indicated, there is a significant majority in favor of passing this legislation, which we ought to be able to do very quickly.  I do not think there is any particular reason for delaying a jobs bill that is overwhelmingly supported on a bipartisan basis; therefore, I say to my friends on this side who are in favor of the Ex-Im Bank, I am in favor of moving to that rapidly. I can say to the majority leader, as I said before, we would be willing to agree to very few amendments related to the subject matter. I encourage him to turn to that soon, even though it doesn't expire, I believe, until sometime in May.  With that, I yield the floor.
