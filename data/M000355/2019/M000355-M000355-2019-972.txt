 They passed a symbolic resolution opposing efforts to delegitimize the State of Israel and condemn the BDS movement.  It is too bad all of this, of all things, couldn't have been a unanimous vote. It is too bad that 16 Democrats voted against condemning BDS. Sixteen Democrats voted against condemning BDS over in the House yesterday.  It is regrettable that some of the Democrats who claim to represent thefuture of their party lobbied against the measure that should be completely without controversy.  Even more broadly, I am sorry the bipartisan Senate-passed bill that would actually do something about BDS--in other words, action, not mere rhetoric--is still languishing over in the House without a vote, bipartisan legislation that passed with the support of 77 Senators, including my friend the Democratic leader--77 votes in the Senate, thoroughly bipartisan, but the Democratic House has found a way to fumble the ball.  Several months back, it took days of throat-clearing and a whole lot of watering down before they could even halfway condemn anti-Semitic remarks by one of their own Members. Now this symbolic BDS resolution is held up as a major victory, while Senate-passed legislation that would actually take action--actually do something against BDS--doesn't even get a vote. They will not even give it a vote over there in the House.  House Republicans have called for a vote on S. 1 over and over and over again, but the Speaker of the House doesn't seem interested.  I understand that picking fights with the President seems to be a higher priority across the Capitol than joining with the Senate to get bipartisan legislation actually made into law, but surely taking action to combat anti-Semitic efforts to delegitimize Israel shouldn't be too much to ask.  I suggest the absence of a quorum.
