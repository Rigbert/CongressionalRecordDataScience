President, I want to take a moment to speak about troubling actions by the Government of Bangladesh against the Grameen Bank.  Founded in 1983 by Professor Mohammed Yunus, the Grameen Bank has been a model of the immense potential of microfinance for economic development. By providing small loans to the world's poorest people who possess the skills but not the financing needed to start a small business, microcredit institutions have shown to be successful in promoting the most effective means of poverty reduction, the empowerment of women. The Grameen Bank, about which volumes have been written, has been a leading example of these successful borrower-owned banks, and the model has spread from Bangladesh throughout Southeast Asia and beyond.  The proposal of the Government of Bangladesh to dissolve the Grameen Bank into 19 separate entities would curtail one of the best mechanisms for reducing poverty in Bangladesh. This radical restructuring would fragment Grameeen's governance structure, essentially rendering it powerless. It would move ownership of the bank from the people with a vested interest in its success to an assortment of agencies with no legal relationships with the public.  The force behind the efforts to weaken the Grameen Bank is none other than Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina, who has clashed with Professor Yunus since the latter won the Nobel Peace Prize in 2006 and expressed interest in running for public office himself. Threatened by Professor Yunus' popularity, the Prime Minister has tried for years to undermine his authority and influence.  The Grameen Bank has been targeted by the government-created Grameen Bank Commission, and Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina was instrumental in Yunus' removal from his position as Grameen's managing director through an age mandated retirement although no such mandate exists for the country's private banks. Most recently, the government has accused several microcredit companies founded by Professor Yunus of failing to pay taxes, which he has denied as baseless. The Prime Minister's vendetta against Professor Yunus seems to have no limit.  I want to echo the sentiments of my friend Senator Durbin who has spoken about this, as well as 17 Senators, who sent a letter to Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina last year. I join them and leaders of goodwill around the world in supporting the Grameen Bank and Professor Yunus. They have been bright spots in one of the world's poorest countries whose own nationalized banks are failing.  Millions of Bangladesh's poorest people, particularly women, need access to the credit the Grameen Bank provides. Rather than continue to persecute Professor Yunus, the Prime Minister and her government should learn from his example and redirect their efforts to helping improve the lives of the people they have a responsibility to serve.                          ____________________
