President, I am sorry to see Republican obstructionism in the Senate return with such a vengeance. Just last November, the American people voted for change. They sent a new President to the White House to lead our government and sent a strong message that they expected Washington to put aside pettiness and work on their behalf on the serious problems facing them and the country. After only 6 months, it seems Republicans in the Senate have already forgotten that message.  The Senate majority leader has spoken about the difficulties he is having getting any semblance of reasonable cooperation from across the aisle. The Republicans' obstruction of Presidential nominees is a stark example. Just a few years ago, they were intent on employing the ``nuclear option'' and risking destruction of longstanding Senate rules and practices in order to ensure that every one of President Bush's nominees was confirmed. This year, with President Obama making the nominations, they have reverted to the anonymous holds that characterized their actions during the Clinton years. It is impossible to find a principle that justifies this obstruction. It is likewise difficult to see what ``extraordinary circumstances'' exist to justify filibusters and unwillingness to proceed to consider these nominations.  The Senate's last week in session before the July 4th recess witnessed a Republican filibuster of the President's nominee to serve as the Legal Advisor at the State Department. The target was Harold Koh, the distinguished dean of the Yale Law School, a former high-ranking official in the State Department as well as a former official at the Office of Legal Counsel at the Justice Department. That filibuster was unsuccessful, although 31 Republican Senators supported it. That was not the first attempt by Senate Republicans to filibuster executive branch nominees. Earlier this year, the Senate was forced to file for cloture to avert a Republican filibuster against the nomination of David Ogden to serve as the Deputy Attorney General.  The destructive strategy culminated on June 25 when Republicans objected to confirming nine executive branch nominees reported by the Judiciary Committee for action by the Senate. They included five U.S. attorneys, 3 Assistant Attorneys General and the Chairman of the U.S. Sentencing Commission. In addition, the Judiciary Committee has reported 3 judicial nominees to begin filling the 74 vacancies in our Federal courts around the country. Republicans are turning the clock back to 10 years ago, when their obstructionism led to more than 100 judicial vacancies and earned rebukes from Chief Justice Rehnquist.  In an editorial entitled ``Call It Obstructionism,'' the New York Times on June 28 noted that the Senate adjourned for the July 4th recess with ``21 nominees for important posts awaiting confirmation.'' Thirteen had been reported by the Senate Judiciary Committee but remained stalled before the Senate by Republican objections. I hope this work period sees the cooperation from Senate Republicans that the American people have demanded.                          ____________________
