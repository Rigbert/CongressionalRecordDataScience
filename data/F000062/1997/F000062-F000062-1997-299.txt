 President, I ask unanimous consent to have printed in the Record a speech that this Senator made to the Asia Society yesterday morning entitled, ``China: The Future.''  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in the Record, as follows:                           China: The Future                     (By Senator Dianne Feinstein)       As a Californian, I have been surprised to discover how      Washington, and the whole East Coast foreign policy      establishment tends to look primarily across the Atlantic to      Europe, and how little it looks to Asia and the Pacific.       But the fact is that U.S. interests are no longer primarily      in Europe. You've heard the phrase ``the dawning of the      Pacific Century'' many times. Well, the Pacific Century is      here.       Consider these facts: The Pacific trading theater has long      since overtaken the Atlantic. Overall trade with Asia stands      at $570 billion. With Europe it is $270 billion. Trade with      Asia accounts for more than 30 percent of U.S. exports and      close to 40 percent of U.S. imports. And today, more than 60      percent of the world's population lives on both sides of the      Pacific Ocean.       All of this illustrates what Secretary of State John Hay      meant when he said nearly a century ago: ``The Mediterranean      is the ocean of the past; the Atlantic, the ocean of the      present; and the Pacific, the ocean of the future.'' That      future is now.                           china's importance       The single most important question facing the future of      peace and prosperity in Asia is how China develops.       And there is no more important challenge facing U.S.      foreign policy than the question of how to peacefully engage      China in the international community.       China's influence is felt in so many ways: China's      population of 1.25 billion, is nearly one quarter of the      world's inhabitants; China's sheer size--her geographical      reach includes common borders with such key nations as      Russia, Japan, Korea, and India, and includes vast quantities      of untapped natural resources; China's expanding military      prowess, including a 3 million-man army, and her status as      one of the five declared nuclear powers in the world today;      China's permanent seat on the U.N. Security Council; and      China's remarkable economic growth of roughly 10 percent a      year, which has vaulted it to the position of the world's      11th largest exporter--China is where Japan was in 1980, but      growing much faster.       For all of these reasons, the U.S. relationship with China      is probably our single most important undeveloped bilateral      relationship in the world today.       In 1997, Sino-American relations are entering a crucial new      phase, ripe with both danger and opportunity.       Events in the next year, and how they are handled by      Washington and Beijing, will determine for some time to come      the nature of the relationship between our two countries.       I was very pleased to hear our new Secretary of State,      Madeleine Albright, articulate the Administration's policy in      clear terms during her confirmation hearing before the      Foreign Relations Committee. She said: ``Our goal is to      expand areas of cooperation, reduce the potential for      misunderstandings and encourage China's full emergence as a      responsible member of the international community.''       And, while she recognized that our two nations have      important differences, the Secretary also stressed that we      have a multifaceted relationship with China.       I want to make some comments this morning on what I believe      to be the central issues in the U.S.-China relationship      today: the question of engagement versus containment; the      China-Taiwan relationship; nuclear proliferation; human      rights; the trade imbalance; trade issues such as Most-     Favored Nation status, Intellectual Property Rights, and      China's accession to the WTO; and the transition of Hong      Kong.               The ``Engagement vs. Containment'' Debate       This question should be settled by now, but unfortunately      it is not. There are still those who see China as an enemy,      and who want the U.S.-China relationship to be modeled on      Cold War strategies of the past, Containment is their mantra.      But there are two problems with this approach:       First, it has not and will not work. No other country will      join us in trying to contain the largest country and one of      the fastest growing economies in the world.       Second, containment is not in the interest of the United      States. We have far too many mutual interests with China--     interests which far outweigh our differences, including:      preserving stability, and preventing arms races in Northeast      and Southeast Asia; a peaceful, non-nuclear Korean Peninsula;      preventing nuclear escalation between India and Pakistan;      preventing the introduction of nuclear or other destabilizing      technology into the Persian Gulf; keeping sea lanes open for      international commerce; maintaining the prosperity of Hong      Kong and Taiwan; and curbing the trafficking of narcotics.       Attempting to influence these critically important issues      by isolating China is a fruitless and very dangerous course      of action. The only way we can make progress on these issues      is through active engagement.       I have been saying for the past four years that I have been      in the Senate that the U.S. needs to develop a long-term,      strategic framework for building a relationship with China,      based on our many mutual interests.       No single issue should be a litmus test for the entire      U.S.-China relationship.       Managing and developing a positive relationship with China      does not mean we must ignore the importance of key issues of      concern with China--such as human rights, the transition of      Hong Kong, or the issue of Taiwan. It does, however, mean      that we should not allow our entire relationship to be called      into question each time an incident occurs.       The United States must develop a long-range, strategic plan      for our relationship with China.       The US must engage China. This engagement must be ongoing,      it must be consistent, and it must be formed at the highest      levels.       To date, interaction at the Presidential, Vice      Presidential, Secretary of State, and Secretary of Defense      level has not been frequent or deep enough. There is no ``red      telephone'', no ability for the two Presidents to talk and      work with each other during a crisis.       We cannot engage China solely at a second-tier level. Talks      at the Deputy Assistant Secretary level are not sufficient,      and, in the absence of regular higher level contacts, are      probably counter-productive in the message it sends to      China's leaders.       Secretary Albright will be meeting soon with Foreign      Minister Qian Qichen, and she is committed to regular contact      with her counterparts in Beijing. Vice President Gore will be      traveling to Beijing this spring, setting the stage for an      exchange of presidential visits this fall and next year.       These are positive steps that I hope will lead to      development of sustained communication at the very highest      levels.       President Clinton has an opportunity to shape the future      course of Sino-American relations by developing a positive      working relationship with Chinese President Jiang Zemin and      other leaders, I hope he will seize this opportunity.       Congress also has an important role to play in this      process.       It is critical that more members of Congress travel to      China, meet with those in the Chinese leadership and others,      and develop a working dialogue with those who are creating      the China of the 21st century.                     the china-taiwan relationship       Taiwan remains the one issue with the greatest potential to      seriously disrupt efforts to stabilize the U.S.-China      relationship. It is impossible to overstate the depth of      Chinese feelings about Taiwan's role in the U.S.-China      relationship. They are real, visceral, and deep.       During my trip this past November, Chinese officials and      citizens made it clear: If the Taiwan issue is handled well,      everything is possible in Sino-American relations; if it is      mishandled, it will continue to shock, and possibly derail,      U.S.-China relations.       The United States should, I believe, consistently and      authoritatively reaffirm, both to Beijing and to Taipei, its      commitment to the long-standing and bipartisan ``One China''      policy, as outlined in the three Joint Communiques.       It must be remembered that the status quo has been      beneficial to all three parties, allowing Taiwan to become      prosperous and democratic, and the U.S. and China to develop      normalized relations befitting two world powers.       So Taiwan must understand that its efforts to assert itself      internationally cannot be a guise for moving towards      independence.       For its part, China should consistently make clear that      reunification would take place only through peaceful means,      and should refrain from any aggressive military actions and      rhetoric.       Any impression that China might try to settle the Taiwan      issue by the use of force presents a challenge not just to      Taiwan but also, under the Taiwan Relations Act, to the      United States as well. We could not stand idly by and      countenance a military attack.       At the same time, Washington must make clear to Beijing      that U.S. interests require continued robust--albeit      unofficial--ties with Taipei, which are consistent with the      ``One China'' policy.       Such unofficial access, however, should not be confused in      either Beijing or Taipei as an invitation for official      recognition by the U.S. We must not allow another incident      such as the issuance of a visa to President Lee Teng-hui two      years ago to needlessly provoke a crisis.       The United States should encourage Taiwan and China to      resume the Cross-Straits Initiative that was conducted by      China's Association for Relations Across the Taiwan Straits      and Taiwan's Straits Exchange Foundation, which showed such      promise until it was derailed a year and a half ago.                            nonproliferation       One of the most important areas of concern in our      relationship with China is nuclear nonproliferation.       Clearly China's record on nonproliferation is mixed. China      has ratified the Chemical Weapons Convention--something the      U.S. Senate has not yet done--and signed the Comprehensive      Test Ban Treaty, as well as cooperated in efforts to extend      the Nuclear Nonproliferation Treaty (NPT) indefinitely.       China has made important commitments, such as abiding by      the guidelines of the Missile Technology Control Regime      (MTCR) and not providing assistance to unsafeguarded nuclear      facilities.       Nevertheless, we continue to have concerns about nuclear      and missile technology that China has provided to Pakistan,      and the possibility of similar sales to Iran.       It is vital that China be engaged in a new security      partnership, one that is cooperative rather than      confrontational. As I said earlier, isolating a nation of      China's growing power and influence makes little sense.       China has recognized our mutual interest in preventing      nuclear proliferation in North Korea. It is also clearly in      the interests of both China and the United States to ensure      that tensions are de-escalated in South Asia, where both      India and Pakistan have the ability to launch nuclear devices      in a matter of days.       We should encourage China to join us in the development of      a coherent nuclear non-proliferation strategy, as a co-     guarantor of stability and security in these regions.       We must try to convince China that arms control regimes      should be adhered to not for ideological or legalistic      purposes, but because they are in China's own best interest.       If China is willing to become an active and responsible      party to international treaties and regimes, China should be      granted an equal say in setting the ``rules of the game.''      China must, of course, then agree to abide by those rules      along with every other nation.       A partnership between China and the United States toward      nuclear non-proliferation and stability is the key to success      in these regions.                              human rights       As I said earlier, no issue should be a litmus test in our      relationship with China. But at times, human rights has been      just that.       The U.S. has tried lecturing China on human rights; We have      expressed outrage, and our relationship has zigged and zagged      with each arrest, newly reported case of torture, or other      egregious happening; And we have tried linking human rights      to Most Favored Nation trading status.       These efforts have clearly been unsuccessful.       Let me speak about the negatives first.       I am remain deeply concerned by China's treatment of      dissidents and its constant persecution of Tibetans in Tibet.      I have talked with Tibetan refugees personally--some in Napal      this past November--and I believe their stories to be true.       I believe there has been a tightening by the Chinese      government on human rights in the last year.       For those of us who watch China closely, there are a number      of signs. There has been a recent crackdown on religious      liberties.       In Jiangxi province in November, 80 Catholics were      arbitrarily arrested without warrants, beaten, and jailed.       There have been many recent arrests of leading dissidents,      often resulting in disproportionately long sentences. Fro      example: Wei Jingsheng was sentenced for 14 years; Chen Xi      was sentenced for 10 years; Wang Dan was sentenced for 11      years in prison plus two years deprivation of political      rights.       I cannot conceive of a reason why it is in China's      interests to do these things. But whatever the reason, it is      very disturbing, and it portends real danger for Hong Kong,      which is a very religious Chinese community.       But let me also mention the positive side.       It must be recognized that progress is taking place in      China. For example, the National People's Congress just      enacted legislation intended to: help protect individuals      from arbitrary punishment by police and government agencies;      limit the practice ``administrative detention'' to thirty      days; and require the State Council to secure the approval of      the National People's Congress before declaring martial law.       As one who has traveled to China dozens of times over the      last 20 years, it is clear to me that there have been      remarkable changes: an increasing standard of living,      increased wages, and savings, and improved education of the      people; greater mobility and a freer lifestyle for the      average Chinese; local and provincial governments that are      more independent from Beijing--with over 300 million Chinese      participating in direct local and provincial elections; a      growing web of private property ownership in the provinces,      and greater legal protection for the owners and investors in      private enterprises; a more accessible court system for      Chinese citizens to contest government actions that infringe      on their freedoms and property.       To appreciate the scope of these changes one only needs to      look back a mere 35 years to the Cultural Revolution and      Great Leap Forward, during which millions of Chinese lost      their lives in unprecedented brutality.       Yes, these changes are in their infancy compared to Western      standards, but it is important to understand that China is a      $5,000 year old nation--a nation governed by the rule of man      for most of its history. It will not transition to the rule      of law overnight--no matter how much pressure is applied from      outside forces.       It was interesting for me to read an article by Henry Rowen      entitled ``The Short March,'' in which he describes      conducting a Lexis-Nexis search on China and human rights in      five major U.S. publications.       For the period January 1991 through June 1996 he found ``on      the one hand, 356 stories on abuses of various kinds, and on      the other hand, 3 on local elections, 16 on efforts to      introduce a rule of law, and 10 on the liberalizing of the      mass media: in short, an overall ratio of 12 to 1.''       So clearly, the bad gets reported and the good does not.       I believe that China will not change its ways merely to      please America. The real key to change is convincing China      that it in China's interests to change. And I believe that      this can be done.       Most importantly, the U.S. should work with China to      develop a modern legal system with an independent judiciary,      due process of law and a modern penal and civil codes. China      is receptive to our help in this area.       Through engagement and assistance such as this we can do      more to advance the cause of human rights in China in the      long run than through constant castigation, or isolation.       I would like to make a proposal that may be acceptable to      both sides. I would propose a presidential human rights      commission or forum. This commission would be appointed by      both presidents, with the mission of charting the evolution      of human rights in both countries over the last 20 to 30      years.       In reports to be delivered to both presidents, the      commission would point out the successes and failures--both      Tiananmen Square and Kent State--and make recommendations for      goals for the future.                      The Growing Trade Imbalance       Another area of increasing concern is the growing trade gap      with China.       What is essentially a trade problem today will become an      acute political problem in the U.S.-China relationship if it      is left unaddressed.       I have communicated my concern about this issue to the      Chinese leadership. They agree that this is a potential      problem, but they dispute the size of the trade imbalance.       The United States calculates the imbalance at about $38      billion, while the Chinese figure is closer to $10 billion.       When I was in China in November I proposed to Zhu Rongji,      the Executive Vice Premier, who is in effect China's economic      czar, that the United States and China establish a joint      working group to sit down and establish once and for all a      common method of calculating the trade imbalance, especially      after Hong Kong's reversion to Chinese rule. Zhu Rongji told      me he would support such a proposal.                       Most Favored Nation Status       Another constant flashpoint is the annual battle over      China's Most Favored Nation Trading status.       Every summer Congress and the Administration go through a      sort of ritual dance over the extension of MFN status to      China. Congress had never overridden a President's decision      to extend MFN for China, but we have often voted on it      anyway.       Last year, the House, by a resounding vote of 286-141,      rejected an attempt to deny or condition China's MFN status.      It would be helpful to have that vote settle it once and for      all, but, unfortunately, we are less than five months away      from the next go around, which I suspect may not be any less      rancorous.       The political implications of revoking MFN for China are      great. For a country such as China, where face and respect      are such central issues, the debate over revoking MFN is seen      as tantamount to the United States telling China that we are      still unsure whether to accept them as a member of the family      of nations.       Denying MFN would seriously impair our ability to work with      China on just about any issue.       Clearly, linking human rights with MFN has been a failure.      I hope we do not make the same mistake twice by linking it to      something else, like the negotiations on China's accession to      the WTO.       MFN is our standard trading status, and it is granted to      all but seven rogue states.       It is time to put an end to this destructive debate year      after year. I support making MFN for China permanent.                               HONG KONG       In the short run, the transition of Hong Kong is seen by      some as a bellwether for China's willingness to act as a      responsible great power.       It is key and critical that ``one country, two systems'' be      carried out. The world is clearly watching to see whether in      fact it is possible to have within China an autonomous region      that charts its own domestic policy.       The Sino-British Joint Declaration and the Basic Law      provide the foundation for the transfer, and for the future      governance and economic life of Hong Kong.       I am troubled by the legislation submitted last week to the      National People's Congress that would undo the Hong Kong bill      of rights. Lu Ping, the Chinese official in charge of the      Hong Kong transition, told me directly in Beijing in November      that the question of public protest and assembly was a matter      for the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region (SAR), and if      SAR law permitted public expressions of dissent, China would      have no objection.       If the central government of China reverses Hong Kong's      Bill of Rights, and other civil liberties, it would be a blow      to the credibility of ``one country, two systems.''       Additionally, I would hope that the provisional legislature      meeting this week in Shenzhen is sensitive to the pledge of      domestic autonomy for Hong Kong.       I strongly agree with Secretary Albright when she said that      the way events play out in Hong Kong will have an important      effect on the overall U.S.-China relationship.                               CONCLUSION       With this new Congress, and an Administration now seasoned      in its second term, we now have the opportunity to move      beyond some of the events that have soured Sino-American      relations in the past several years.       President Clinton and Secretary Albright must immerse      themselves fully in the details of this most delicate and      critical of American relations.       In the final analysis, the goal of American policy must be      to encourage China toward a full and active relationship with      the West and to work together toward a China that is able to      take its role as a stable leader of Asia and a guarantor of      peace and security in the world.                          ____________________
