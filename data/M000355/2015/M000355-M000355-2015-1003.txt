 President, this morning we are all thinking of the many Kentuckians who have been impacted by severe flooding over the past couple of days. Eastern Kentucky has been especially hard hit. Governor Beshear has declared a state of emergency, and the Kentucky delegation stands ready to assist in this effort.  The tragic flooding has already claimed two lives in Johnson County. Six remain missing. Others were forced to watch as homes and cherished memories were swept away. We can only imagine what these Kentuckians and their families must be going through.  This has been an especially trying task for our first responders as well. They have had to battle against debris and downed power lines. They have worked to rescue Kentuckians from trees. It hasn't been easy, but it reminds us again of why we owe these men and women so very much. I join Kentuckians in thanking them for all they have done and all they continue to do.                          ____________________
