Mr. Speaker, I would say to the gentleman from California [Mr. Riggs], he invoked the name of Martin Luther King, Junior, and his niece, Alveda King Bill. I knew Martin Luther King, Junior. He was my mentor, my friend, and my leader. If he were alive today, he would be ashamed of what his niece did and said.
