 President, I ask unanimous consent that the Senate proceed to executive session to consider the following treaties en bloc: Calendar Nos. 2, 3, 4, and 5. I further ask unanimous consent that the treaties be considered as having passed through their various parliamentary stages up to and including the presentation of the resolutions of ratification; that any committee-reported conditions, declarations, or reservations be agreed to as applicable; that any statements be printed in the Record; further, that when the resolutions of ratification are voted upon, the motions to reconsider be considered made and laid upon the table; that the President be notified of the Senate's action, all en bloc; and that following the disposition of the treaties, the Senate return to legislative session.
