 President, I rise today to introduce the Public Utility Holding Company Act of 2001. This bipartisan bill is designed to help America's energy consumers by repealing an antiquated law that is keeping the benefits of competition from reaching our citizens. I am pleased to be joined by Senators Gramm and Sarbanes, chairman and ranking member of the Committee on Banking, Housing, and Urban Affairs, Senator Murkowski, chairman of the Energy and Natural Resources Committee, Majority Leader Lott, and Senators Dodd, Craig, and Crapo in introducing this important legislation. Our bill, which closely tracks legislation voted out of the Senate Banking Committee with bipartisan support in the 106th Congress, repeals the Public Utility Holding Company Act of 1935, PUHCA.  The original PUHCA legislation passed over 60 years ago in 1935. At that time, a few large holding companies controlled a great majority of the electric utilities and gas pipelines. However, such a limited number of providers no longer offer a majority of the utility service. In fact, over 80 percent of the utility holding companies are currently exempt from PUHCA.  This legislation implements the recommendations that the Securities and Exchange Commission, SEC made first in 1981 and then again in 1995 following an extensive study of the effects of this antiquated law on our energy markets. In the 1995 report entitled. ``The Regulation of Public-Utility Holding Companies,'' the Division of Investment Management recommended that Congress conditionally repeal the Act since ``the current regulatory system imposes significant costs, indirect administrative charges and foregone economies of scale and scope . . .'' In the end, the report serves to highlight the fact that the regulatory restraints imposed by PUHCA on our electric and gas industries are counterproductive in today's competitive environment and are based on historical assumptions and industry models that are no longer valid.  In order to ensure that ratepayers are protected, this bill provides the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission and the States access to the books and records of holding company systems that are relevant to the costs incurred by jurisdictional public utility companies. As a result, the regulatory framework to protect consumers is not only protected in this bill, but enhanced.  Let me be clear about the effect of PUHCA repeal: it eliminates redundant and burdensome regulation while enhancing existing consumer protections.  Mr. President, we are at a time in our nation's history when we are going to have to make some critical choices regarding our national energy policy. The fact is, future technological innovation and economic growth is contingent upon this country's ability to meet its ever increasing demand for energy. In order to do this, we need to modernize production systems, increase market competition, and strip away unnecessary regulations. Achieving these goals is going to be a difficult and time consuming process. However, repeal of this law would be the first step in the right direction.  Mr. President, it has been a very long time since it first became clear that this out dated, Depression-era law had become an unnecessary constraint on the ability of American gas and electric utilities to compete. Unfortunately, the many bipartisan efforts to repeal PUHCA have not been successful. However, strong support still exists for its elimination. I believe that it is imperative that we achieve this goal in the 107th Congress.  I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be printed in the Record.  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the Record, as follows:                                 S. 206       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of      the United States of America in Congress assembled,     SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.       This Act may be cited as the ``Public Utility Holding      Company Act of 2001''.     SEC. 2. FINDINGS AND PURPOSES.       (a) Findings.--Congress finds that--       (1) the Public Utility Holding Company Act of 1935 was      intended to facilitate the work of Federal and State      regulators by placing certain constraints on the activities      of holding company systems;       (2) developments since 1935, including changes in other      regulation and in the electric and gas industries, have      called into question the continued relevance of the model of      regulation established by that Act;       (3) there is a continuing need for State regulation in      order to ensure the rate protection of utility customers; and       (4) limited Federal regulation is necessary to supplement      the work of State commissions for the continued rate      protection of electric and gas utility customers.       (b) Purposes.--The purposes of this Act are--       (1) to eliminate unnecessary regulation, yet continue to      provide for consumer protection by facilitating existing rate      regulatory authority through improved Federal and State      commission access to books and records of all companies in a      holding company system, to the extent that such information      is relevant to rates paid by utility customers, while      affording companies the flexibility required to compete in      the energy markets; and       (2) to address protection of electric and gas utility      customers by providing for Federal and State access to books      and records of all companies in a holding company system that      are relevant to utility rates.
