President, I am pleased to join with my colleague from New York in introducing the Positive Aging Act, which will help to increase older Americans' access to quality mental health screening and treatment services in community-based care settings.  The legislation we are introducing today is particularly important for States, like Maine, that have a disproportionate number of elderly persons. Maine currently is our Nation's seventh ``oldest'' State. Moreover, our older population will continue to grow in the future and, by the year 2025, one in five Mainers will be over the age of 65.  One of the most daunting public health challenges facing our Nation today is how to increase access to quality mental health services for the more than 44 million Americans with severe, disabling mental disorders that can devastate their lives and the lives of the people around them.  What is often overlooked, however, is the prevalence of mental illness among our Nation's elderly. Studies have shown that more than one in five Americans aged 65 and older--including more than 32,000 Mainers--experience mental illness, and that as many as 80 percent of elderly persons in nursing homes suffer from some kind of mental impairment.  Particularly disturbing is that fact that the mental health needs of older Americans are often overlooked or not recognized because of the mistaken belief that they are a normal part of aging and therefore cannot be treated.  While older Americans experience the full range of mental disorders, the most prevalent mental illness afflicting older people is depression. Ironically, while recent advances have made depression an eminently treatable disorder, only a minority of elderly depressed persons are receiving adequate treatment. Unfortunately, the vast majority of depressed elderly don't seek help. Many simply accept their feelings of profound sadness and do not realize that they are clinically depressed.  Those who do seek help are often underdiagnosed or misdiagnosed, leading the National Institute of Mental Health to estimate that 60 percent of older Americans with depression are not receiving the mental health care that they need. Failure to treat this kind of disorder leads to poorer health outcomes for other medical conditions, higher rates of institutionalization, and increased health care costs.  Untreated depression can even lead to suicide. The sad fact is that Americans over 65 are more likely to commit suicide than any other age group. Among those over 85, the suicide rate is twice the national average. What is particularly disturbing about these statistics is that studies have shown that 40 percent of older people who commit suicide have had a visit with their primary care provider within one week of their death. Seventy percent of these elderly suicide victims had a primary care visit within 30 days of their death.  Fortunately, important research is being done that is helping to develop innovative approaches to improve the delivery of mental health care for olderadults by integrating it into primary care settings. This research demonstrates that older adults are more likely to receive appropriate mental health care if there is a mental health professional on the primary care team, rather than simply referring them to a mental health specialist outside the primary care setting. Multiple appointments with multiple providers in multiple settings simply don't work for older patients who must also cope with concurrent chronic illnesses, mobility problems, and limited transportation options. The research also shows that there is less stigma associated with psychiatric services when they are integrated into general medical care.  The Positive Aging Act builds upon this research and authorizes funding for a range of projects that integrate mental health screening and treatment services into community sites and primary health care settings, including community health centers, senior centers, and assisted living facilities. Moreover, the evidence-based services under this legislation will be provided by interdisciplinary teams of mental health professionals working in collaboration with other providers of health and social services.  Among other provisions, our legislation authorizes the creation of an Office of Older Adult Mental Health Services in the Administration on Aging to develop and implement initiatives to address the mental health needs of older adults. In addition, the Administration on Aging would be authorized to provide grants to States for the development and testing of model mental health delivery systems for the diagnosis and treatment of mental illness and the elderly. It would also be authorized to award demonstration grants to projects targeted to providing screening and mental health services for seniors residing in rural areas, as well as grants to encourage the collaboration between mental health and other health and social services providers in providing screening and treatment services.  The legislation also authorizes the Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration (SAMHSA) to award demonstration grants which would support the integration of evidence-based mental health services by geriatric mental health specialists into primary care settings and support the establishment of community-based mental health treatment outreach teams in settings where older adults reside or receive social services.  The Positive Aging Act will help to promote the mental health and well-being of our older citizens. It is an investment that will return tremendous dividends in terms of improved quality of life, better patient outcomes, and more efficient use of health care dollars. The legislation has been endorsed by the American Association for Geriatric Psychiatry, the National Council on Aging, the American Nurses Association, the American Psychological Association, the American Psychiatric Association and the National Association of Social Workers, and I urge all of our colleagues to join us as cosponsors.                                 ______                                       By
