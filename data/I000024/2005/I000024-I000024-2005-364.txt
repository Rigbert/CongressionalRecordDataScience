President, section 403 of the Congressional Budget and Impoundment Control Act requires that a statement of the cost of the reported bill, prepared by the Congressional Budget Office, be included in the report. At the time of filing of the report, the statement was unavailable. The statement has since been received by the committee. I ask unanimous consent that the statement be printed in the Record.  There being no objection, the material ordered to be printed in the Record, as follows:     S. 864, Nuclear Security Act of 2005, As reported by the          Senate Committee on Environment and Public Works on July          1, 2005       Summary       S. 864 would amend the Atomic Energy Act of 1954 to      establish several new programs designed to protect the      nation's nuclear infrastructure. Based on information from      the Nuclear Regulatory Commission (NRC), CBO estimates that      implementing S. 864 would have a gross cost of $10 million in      2006 and $64 million over the 2006-2010 period. Under current      law, the NRC is authorized to collect fees to offset 90      percent of most of its budget authority provided from the      general fund (a portion of funds are provided from the      Nuclear Waste Fund) in 2005 and 33 percent for each year      after 2005. After accounting for those collections, CBO      estimates that S. 864 would have a net cost of $5 million in      2006 and $41 million over the 2006-2010 period.       S. 864 would impose both intergovernmental and private-     sector mandates as defined in the Unfunded Mandates Reform      Act (UMRA) by requiring expanded security procedures at      certain nuclear facilities, new guidelines for tracking spent      fuel rods and segments at nuclear power plants, and a      mandatory tracking system for radiation sources in the United      States. The bill also would impose a private-sector mandate      on persons who import and export radiation sources by      requiring them to meet new requirements. Finally, the bill      would preempt State laws restricting the use and transport of      certain firearms and may preempt State regulation of the      disposal of certain types of byproduct material by      transferring that authority to the NRC. CBO estimates that      the aggregate cost of the mandates in the bill would be below      the annual thresholds established in UMRA for      intergovernmental mandates ($62 million in 2005, adjusted      annually for inflation) and for private-sector mandates ($123      million in 2005, adjusted annually for inflation).     Estimated Cost to the Federal Government       The estimated budgetary impact of S. 864 is shown in the      following table. The costs of this legislation fall within      budget function 270 (energy).

To estimate the net change in NRC costs under S. 864, that 33 percent rate  was applied to the estimated cost of the programs under S. 864.NOTE: Details may not sum to totals because of rounding.     Basis of Estimate       For this estimate, CBO assumes that the bill will be      enacted near the start of fiscal year 2006, that the      necessary amounts will be appropriated for each year, and      that outlays will occur at historical rates for similar      programs.       S. 864 would require the NRC to update and adopt      rulemakings and programs related to security at the nation's      nuclear power plants. The bill would set new criteria for      preparing and evaluating security response plans at nuclear      facilities, require a tracking system for radiation sources,      and set requirements for the transport and disposal of      radioactive byproduct material, firearms use by certain      security personnel, background checks for certain security      personnel, and guidelines for tracking the location of spent      fuel rods. Under current law, the NRC is authorized to      collect annual fees to offset 90 percent of most of its      general fund appropriation. When this authority expires at      the end of fiscal year 2005, the NRC will be authorized to      collect annual user fees from its licensees of up to only 33      percent of its budget.       Based on information from the NRC, CBO estimates that      implementing S. 864 would have a gross cost of $64 million      over the 2006-2010 period, assuming appropriation of the      necessary amounts. After accounting for offsetting      collections, CBO estimates that S.     864 would have a net cost of $41 million over the 2006-2010      period.                 Evaluation of Security-Response Plans       S. 864 would require the NRC to evaluate the security      response plans at designated nuclear facilities at least once      every 3 years. The evaluations would simulate the threats      that nuclear facilities must be able to defend against. We      expect that the NRC would use contractors to conduct mock      exercises known as force-on-force. Under S. 864, the NRC      also would revise its ``design basis threats'' or the      attack scenario nuclear facilities must be capable of      defeating. Based on information from the NRC, CBO      estimates that the NRC would incur a gross cost of about      $5 million in 2006 and $27 million over the 2006-2010      period to revise those requirements.                    Radiation Source Tracking System       Under S. 864, the NRC would have to establish a system for      tracking radiation sources in the United States that is      compatible with the Secretary of Transportation's tracking      system of radiation shipments. S. 864 also would establish a      task force on radiation source protection and security to      recommend measures to protect radiation sources from      potential terrorist threats. The bill also would require the      National Academy of Sciences to conduct a study on the      industrial, research, and commercial uses for radiation      sources. Based on information from the NRC, CBO estimates      that this program would have a gross cost of $4 million in      2006 and $21 million over the 2006-2010 period.              Treatment of Radioactive Byproduct Material       S. 864 would establish regulations for the transport and      disposal of radioactive byproduct material and expand the      definition of radioactive byproduct material to include      naturally occurring or accelerator-produced radioactive      material (known as NARM). Under current law, 35 States have      entered into agreements with the NRC that authorize them to      treat and dispose of certain radioactive byproduct materials,      including NARM. S. 864 would require the NRC to prepare a      transition plan for States to transfer regulatory authority      over NARM byproducts to the NRC. CBO estimates that the NRC      would incur a gross cost of $14 million over the 2006-2010      period to oversee disposal of NARM in the 15 States without      waste disposal agreements with the NRC. Under the bill, those      States may opt to obtain a waiver allowing them to retain      oversight of NARM disposal. In that event, NRC costs would be      lower.                   Firearms Use and Background Checks       S. 864 would authorize the NRC to permit certain security      employees at nuclear facilities to use several types of      firearms and would establish guidelines for checking the      background of those security personnel. Based on information      from the NRC, CBO estimates that the one-time cost of      establishing those procedures would be about $1 million in      2006.     Intergovernmental and Private-Sector Impact       S. 864 would impose both intergovernmental and private-     sector mandates as defined in UMRA by:       Increasing costs borne by licensees to pay for fingerprint      checks by increasing the number of individuals requiring      background checks;       Requiring certain nuclear sites to correct any security      defects identified during NRC's force-on-force security      evaluations;       Establishing new guidelines for tracking and controlling      individual spent fuel rods and segments by nuclear power      plants; and       Requiring NRC licensees that possess or transport certain      radiation sources to identify those sources and report any      loss or change in the location to the NRC.       The bill also would impose an additional private-sector      mandate on individuals who import and export radiation      sources by requiring them to meet new requirements. The bill      would impose an additional intergovernmental mandate by      preempting State laws restricting the use and transport of      certain firearms, and may preempt State regulation of the      disposal of certain types of byproduct material by      transferring that authority to the NRC. CBO estimates that      the aggregate cost of the mandates in the bill would be below      the annual thresholds established in UMRA for      intergovernmental mandates ($62 million in 2005, adjusted      annually for inflation) and for private-sector mandates ($123      million in 2005, adjusted annually for inflation).                     Requirements on NRC Licensees       Additional Fee for Background Checks. Section 103 would      require fingerprinting of additional individuals connected      with nuclear facilities (public and private) as part of      criminal background checks done through the U.S. Attorney      General's Office. The cost of the government background      checks would be borne directly by licensees. The duty to pay      the increased cost would be both a private-sector and      intergovernmental mandate under UMRA, but because the cost of      each background check is small and many persons associated      with nuclear facilities have already undergone background      checks, CBO estimates that the aggregate cost of the mandate      would be small.       Security Evaluations. Section 104 would require the NRC to      conduct security-response evaluations at certain nuclear      facilities. Those evaluations would include force-on-force      exercises and would require facilities to remedy any defects.      Given that NRC is already conducting those evaluations, CBO      estimates that the incremental costs of such legislated      requirements would be minimal.       New Tracking System for Spent Fuels Rods and Segments.      Section 109 would require NRC to establish uniform guidelines      for tracking and controlling spent fuel rods and segments at      nuclear power plants. Current NRC regulations include similar      guidelines for tracking and controlling spent fuel rods and      segments, and CBO estimates that any additional cost to NRC      licensees resulting from this provision would be minimal.       New Tracking System for Radiation Sources. Section 201      would direct the NRC to establish a mandatory tracking system      for category 1 and 2 radiation sources (as defined by the      International Atomic Energy Agency) in the United States.      Category 1 and 2 radiation sources are held by both public      and private NRC licensees and are used for medical and      industrial purposes. The tracking system would include      identification by serial number, reporting of changes in      ownership or location of radiation sources, reporting of lost      sources, and reporting through a secure Internet connection.      According to the NRC, identification of radiation sources      already is being done to some extent, and the agency expects      to take on most of the cost of creating the tracking      system. Based on this information, CBO expects that, while      there would be some personnel costs for certain NRC      licensees to comply with the monitoring and reporting      requirements of the new tracking system, any additional      costs would be small.      Requirements on Importers and Exporters of Radiation Sources       Section 201 would prohibit the import and export of      radiation sources in the United States unless certain      requirements are met. The bill would require that exporters      of radiation sources verify that the recipient country may      receive and possess the radiation source and has the      capability to securely manage the source; send notice to the      recipient country prior to shipment; and obtain notification      upon receipt of the shipment. Importers of radiation sources      would be required to prove that they are lawfully authorized      by the NRC to receive the radiation source. Those      requirements would constitute private-sector mandates under      UMRA. However, the costs of those mandates would be small.      According to NRC, similar regulations already have been      proposed by the agency. An analysis of those proposed      regulations by the Office of Management and Budget indicates      that the aggregate cost to all importers and exporters would      be approximately $130,000 annually.               Preemptions of State Laws and Regulations       Authorization of Firearm Possession. Section 102 would      preempt State laws restricting the use and transport of      certain firearms. That provision would expand existing NRC      authority that allows the agency to authorize certain      security employees to use and transport several types of      firearms, regardless of State or local regulations. Such a      preemption would not impose significant costs on State or      local governments.       Waste Disposal Provisions. Depending on future action by      the NRC, section 202 could preempt State regulation of the      disposal of certain types of radioactive byproduct material.      Specifically, this section of the bill would transfer      regulatory authority for the disposal of naturally occurring      and accelerator-produced radioactive byproduct material to      the NRC. Currently, States have this authority by default      because the NRC does not expressly regulate such material.      For those States with direct agreements with the NRC      (agreement States), the authority to regulate the disposal of      NARM would be returned to the State per those agreements.      However, in non-agreement States, that authority would remain      with the NRC. NRC sources have expressed an intent to      maintain the status quo across all States for the disposal of      NARM, and therefore, CBO estimates that the costs of this      potential preemption would be insignificant.     Previous CBO Estimate       On April 19, 2005, CBO transmitted a cost estimate for H.R.      1640, the Energy Policy Act of 2005, as ordered reported by      the House Committee on Energy and Commerce on April 13, 2005.      S. 864 includes provisions similar to sections 662 through      665 of H.R. 1640. The estimated costs for those similar      provisions are identical.
