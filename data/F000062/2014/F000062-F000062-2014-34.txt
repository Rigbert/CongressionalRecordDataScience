 President, I rise today to voice my disappointment over yesterday's vote to increase the Federal minimum wage. It is vitally important that working families receive a long-overdue pay increase, but once again the Senate failed to move forward on a crucial piece of legislation.  At $7.25 per hour, today's Federal minimum wage fails to provide a living wage for many Americans. Working a standard 40-hour week, 52 weeks a year, with no time off and no sick days, the minimum wage pays just over $15,000 a year.  In many parts of the country, including California, that salary is nowhere near enough for an individual to subsist, let alone a family.  It is difficult to fathom how a single mother working a minimum wage job--or jobs--can survive. These are the Americans who would benefit from this bill.  To get a better idea of what the standard 40-hour-a-week worker must earn to meet basic necessities, I had my staff look at the cost-of-living in various California cities.  In San Francisco, a single adult with no children would need to earn over $12 an hour to meet basic necessities.  In Los Angeles, they would need to make over $11 dollars an hour. The same goes for San Diego. That amount only increases for families.  By one measure, a single mother with two children living in San Francisco would have to earn almost $30 an hour just to meet basic necessities.  I would add that we aren't debating an exorbitant increase. Moving from $7.25 to $10.10 would still leave many low-income working families well short of a living wage. But it is a start, and it would benefit millions of low-income working Americans.  According to the Congressional Budget Office, the proposed minimum wage increase would increase incomes for 16.5 million low-wage workers; 97 percent of the low-wage working population would benefit from this increase; 900,000 low-wage workers would move above the poverty line; and the increase in the federal minimum wage could reduce demands on other Federal assistance programs.  A lot of attention has been given to CBO's estimate that increasing the minimum wage would lead to 500,000 job losses for low wage workers. It is important to note that CBO's estimate is the median in a wide range of estimates on the employment effects of increases in the minimum wage.  When you study the report, you find that most estimates of job losses related to increases in the minimum wage are clustered around zero, which means that most studies have found that increasing the minimum wage has a negligible effect on employment.  This isn't to say businesses won't have to make some adjustments. Some will have to raise prices, some might see slightly reduced profits, and some might slow hiring or choose to reduce their workforce.  But the effects will not be devastating, as opponents of the minimum wage increase suggest. In fact, cities and States throughout the country are natural experiments for the effects of a minimum wage increase on jobs.  The minimum wage in San Francisco is currently $10.79 per hour. Far from an economic catastrophe, San Francisco is enjoying a sustained period of economic growth and employment. San Jose, which has a similar minimum wage, also has a robust labor market.  Bloomberg has also researched the effects of minimum wage increases on employment and found that employment effects are negligible and, in general, States that have recently raised the minimum wage are actually creating more jobs than those that haven't.  Washington State increased its minimum wage in 1998 and tied the wage to increases in inflation. The minimum wage is currently the highest in the country.  Since that time, annual job growth in Washington has outpaced the rest of the country, and the service industry has added thousands of jobs. There are many other examples of localities that exceed the Federal minimum wage and continue to experience sustained job growth.  It is clear to me that businesses are capable of adjusting for an increase in the minimum wage in a way that will allow them to thrive.  And a minimum wage increase would not only alleviate some of the burdens and obstacles facing the low wage work force, it would also put more than $30 billion in the pockets of workers struggling to get by, those most in need of a pay raise.  According to many economists, that additional income could spur local economies, more than offsetting any negative effects from a minimum wage increase.  In a time of nearly unprecedented income inequality--during which the wealthy have actually made even more money--it is vitally important that Congress enacts laws to allow allAmericans to benefit from economic advancement.  Increasing the minimum wage is certainly not the only option. Congress should be looking elsewhere to do even more to ensure that children born into low income families aren't locked into a life of poverty. But increasing the minimum wage would be a step toward that goal. It would also serve as an indication that Congress appreciates the daunting challenges posed by income inequality and is willing to confront them.  Mr. President, I fully support an increase in the minimum wage and I hope that we can come together to find a way to reconsider the minimum wage bill and move it forward.                          ____________________
