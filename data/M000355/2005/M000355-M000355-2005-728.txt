 President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for the quorum call be rescinded.  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Martinez). Without objection, it is so ordered.  Mr. McCONNELL. Mr. President, I want to make a report to Republican Members of the Senate. We are down to a handful of amendments. I am aware of only one at the moment that may require a rollcall vote. So let me announce to our Republican colleagues that time is running out for them to come over and let me know for sure whether they need to offer an amendment so we can find out whether it can be worked out.  As I indicated, at this moment, there is only one Republican amendment we know that will require a rollcall vote, and we have a tight time agreement on it that the author is willing to enter into.  I know my friend and colleague Senator Leahy has worked hard to reduce the possible number of amendments on the Democratic side. I will yield the floor and hope we get a report to him on how we stand and see if he is making the same progress.
