President, today, we are asked to consider the nomination of Dora Irizarry to the United States District Court for the Eastern District of New York. There was some controversy with her nomination stemming from interviews conducted by the American Bar Association. A majority of the ABA Standing Committee members concluded that Judge Irizarry was ``not qualified'' for the Federal bench. I believe we must give considerable weight to such peer reviews.  Unfortunately, Judge Irizarry is one of 28 judicial nominees of this President to receive a partial or majority rating of ``not qualified'' from the ABA committee that conducts a peer evaluation of judicial nominees. When the ABA advises us that even a minority of the members of its review committee consider a nominee to be ``not qualified,'' that is cause for concern. I know that the ABA representatives take their work very seriously.  Last October, the Judiciary Committee held a hearing on the nomination of Judge Irizarry, with the consent of both of the Senators from her home-state of New York. The senior Senator from New York, Senator Schumer, served as the ranking member at the hearing. On behalf of the Democratic minority, I worked with Chairman Hatch to allow that hearing to be scheduled on shorter notice than would normally be required under Senate rules. That was one of a series of accommodations Democrats have made to the Republican majority and to this administration without receiving acknowledgment or credit. At the hearing, the committee explored the nomination and the unfavorable recommendation of the ABA. We heard from the nominee, Judge Dora Irizarry, ABA representatives, and the witnesses speaking in support of her qualifications.  The Democratic members of the Judiciary Committee look very closely at the peer review ratings provided by the ABA. Nevertheless, we consider the views of the ABA an important but not a dispositive piece of information as part of our evaluation. We may not always agree with the recommendation.The Senate proceeded to confirm nominees with majority ``Not Qualified'' ratings from the ABA, and during the course of this administration the Senate has confirmed a number of nominees with partial ``Not Qualified'' ratings.  There are other factors that are critical considerations for these lifetime positions in the Federal judiciary beyond a favorable ABA rating. For example, in the judgment of some Members of the Senate, some of this President's judicial nominees do not have records that demonstrate that they will be fair judges and, instead, their backgrounds suggest precisely the opposite: that they were chosen with the hope that they would prejudge areas of constitutional law in order to move the law in a certain direction in tune with the political views of the right wing of the Republican party.  I have no concerns about the impartiality of the ABA member, Pat Hynes, who conducted the interviews in connection with the nomination of Judge Irizarry. Ms. Hynes, who is of counsel at Milberg Weiss, chaired the ABA standing committee during the beginning of the Bush administration and also served as the ABA's Second Circuit representative from 1995 to 2000. She is currently Chair of the Merit Selection Panel for Magistrate Judges for the Southern District of New York and serves on the Second Circuit Court of Appeals Rules Committee. She was chosen as a Fellow of the American College of Trial Lawyers and has been named one of the Top 50 Women Litigators in the United States and one of the 50 Most Influential Women Lawyers in America.  The Senate Judiciary Committee's practice has been to invite the ABA's testimony in connection with a nomination when a circuit or district court nominee has earned a majority or unanimous rating of ``not qualified.'' In providing such testimony, I know that the ABA takes pains to preserve the confidentiality of the attorneys and judges they interview as part of their review. I do wish the ABA would provide similar information, informally or formally, about other ratings they provide. Before President Bush ejected the ABA from the process of providing an informal rating before a nomination was made, the fact that temperament or ethics concerns were raised was conveyed, and sometimes past White Houses chose not to proceed after making further inquiry into such concerns. Additionally, when the ABA was involved in the process before nomination, I am confident that members of the legal community were more candid before a judicial candidate was given the imprimatur of the President.  I understand that in connection with the nomination of Judge Irizarry, the ABA heard a number of candid assessments from the lawyers and judges Ms. Hynes interviewed, some very positive and some troubling in the area of judicial temperament.  Judge Irizarry, who was born in Puerto Rico, is an attorney with the New York firm of Hoguet, Newman & Regal. A 1979 graduate of Columbia Law School, she was appointed to the Bronx County Criminal Court in 1996, and then served on the New York County Criminal Court, on the New York Supreme Court, which, despite its name, is a trial level court, in New York County and Kings County, and on the New York Court of Claims. She served as a judge until May 2002, when she resigned to run an unsuccessful campaign for State Attorney General against Eliot Spitzer. As I mentioned, based on concerns about temperament, a majority of the ABA committee found her to be ``not qualified'' for a Federal judgeship and a minority voted to find her ``qualified.'' The New York City Bar Association's Judiciary Committee also found Judge Irizarry to be unqualified for a position on the Federal bench, citing a lack of Federal experience and complaints about her judicial temperament.  I have concerns about the serious temperament allegations that were made to the ABA standing committee but I trust the judgment of the senior Senator from the State of New York and I am prepared to support Judge Irizarry's confirmation to this lifetime position. I trust that she will conduct herself on the Federal bench in a way that is above reproach.                    Nomination of George Schiavelli
