Speaker, it is with great pleasure that I congratulate one of Northwest Indiana's most distinguished citizens. Dr. Juan Andrade, Jr., of Griffith, Indiana, was recently selected to receive the 1998Hispanic Magazine's Lifetime Achievement Award. The award was presented to Dr. Andrade in San Francisco on August 25, 1998. Presented by Bank One, this award is in recognition of Dr. Andrade's career as a community organizer, national leader, television commentator, motivational speaker, and co-founder of the United States Hispanic Leadership Institute (USHLI).  Born in Brownwood, Texas, Dr. Andrade began his lifelong quest to empower Hispanic Americans while still a youth. He credits his mother, Julia Andrade, for instilling in him a sense of humor and a strong work ethic. Dr. Andrade utilized both while working through twelve years of public school and five years of college. Since beginning his distinguished career over thirty years ago, Dr. Andrade has made headlines as the first Latino in the nation to be arrested for using his Spanish-language skills to teach high school civics, the first Latino State Director for nonpartisan voter registration in Texas, the youngest Chairperson of a Community Action Agency in Texas, and the only Latino political commentator on an English-language television station (WLS-TV, ABC's Chicago affiliate) in the nation for six years. In addition, Dr. Andrade was an influential organizer of the United States Hispanic Leadership Conference (USHLC), now in its sixteenth year.  Indeed, through his outreach, political expertise, and motivational speaking, Dr. Andrade has influenced a whole generation of young Hispanic American leaders. To further their education and opportunities, the ``Juan Andrade Scholarship for Young Hispanic Leaders'' was established in recognition of his tireless efforts to motivate and train young Hispanic leaders. Since 1994, this fund has awarded over one hundred thousand dollars in scholarships to young Hispanic leaders. Moreover, Dr. Andrade has not only influenced many of our nation's future leaders, he has influenced and helped mold many of today's business, civic, and national leaders. His exemplary efforts have been acknowledged by many; he has been named the ``Chicagoan of the Year'' by the Chicago Sun-Times, one of the ``100 Most Influential Hispanics in America'' three times by the Hispanic Business Magazine, and a ``Distinguished Alumni'' by Howard Payne University. Though Dr. Andrade has been honored for his lifetime achievement, he intends to continue his endeavors. In addition, he plans to spend time with his wife, Maria Elenia, and their four children and two grandchildren.  As President John F. Kennedy said, ``It is time for a new generation of leadership, to cope with new problems and new opportunities. For there is a new world to be won.'' His words are as poignant now as they were on that Fourth of July in 1960. As our country heads into the twenty-first century, we must address many new problems and issues. Dr. Andrade is preparing tomorrow's leaders to deal with these multi-faceted problems and issues.  Mr. Speaker, I ask that you and my other distinguished colleagues join me in congratulating Dr. Juan Andrade, Jr. for his selection as the 1998 recipient of Hispanic Magazine's Lifetime Achievement Award. Dr. Andrade's efforts to train a new generation of leaders to solve our future problems and create new opportunities for our nation is the work of a true visionary. His vision and self-sacrificing labors to accomplish his goals have positively changed our country for the better. From Indiana's First Congressional District to Washington, D.C., we have seen the Hispanization of America. I am confident that with dedicated, upstanding citizens like Dr. Andrade helping our young people mature into adult leaders, the future of the United States is safe and in good hands as we enter the twenty-first century.                          ____________________
