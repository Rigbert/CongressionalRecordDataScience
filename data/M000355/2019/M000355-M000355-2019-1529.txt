 Our colleagues across the aisle, particularly over in the House, have given top billing to the legislation that would end Medicare as seniors know it, eliminate every private healthcare plan American families have chosen to meet their needs, and replace all of it--all of it--with a one-size-fits-all, government-run insurance system while piling heavy taxes on the middle class. And, of course, they have touted a proposal to drop an anvil--an anvil--on a high-speed U.S. economy and shove a host of new Federal rules between American citizens and their everyday life choices--all in the name of going ``green.''  Now, most of my colleagues across the aisle know full well what would happen if the supposed Green New Deal actually became reality. They know what winding down our affordable forms of domestic energy and the millions of jobs that support their production would do to a U.S. economy that is currently firing on all cylinders. They know what turning families' own choices about where to live, what to drive, and how to make a living into Washington, DC's official business would mean for the historic levels of job opportunities and the wage growth that we have seen over the past 2 years. All of that would come to a screeching halt.  Remember, our Democratic colleagues tried to claim this outlandish proposal--this truly outlandish proposal--was just a conversation starter from the farthest left fringes. But, then, push came to shove. Then, theAmerican people really saw the score because we brought the thing up for a vote. Right here on this floor we had the vote, and only 4 out of 47 Senate Democrats actually voted no. Only 4 of the 47 voted against this plan to bring our economy to a screeching halt. Forty-three of our Democratic colleagues couldn't bring themselves--couldn't bring themselves--to vote even against this--not even as Republican policies, taking the exact opposite approach, have helped the U.S. job market to drive unemployment lower than it has been in half a century--lower than it has been in half a century. They want to bring all of that to a screeching halt--not even as 19 different States have hit new record low State unemployment rates in just the year and a half since Republicans passed comprehensive tax reform.  Well, I have good news for the American people. This Republican majority is going to keep fighting for you. We will not let these far-left dreams get in the way of more progress for middle-class families.                          ____________________
