Madam Speaker, I take this time to bring to the attention of the floor, my colleagues, and those that might have the opportunity to hear what I have to say why the Endangered Species Act should be improved. That is the subject of this hour of debate. I will be joined by other Members that were directly involved in trying to improve the Endangered Species Act.  Madam Speaker, I came to this House as a Representative in 1973. Later that same year, I voted, one of the few remaining individuals that voted for the Endangered Species Act of 1973. There were only two hearings on the bill. There was no objection in the committee, and it very nearly passed unanimously on the floor. Those of us who voted for it never dreamed that some day it would be used by this Federal Government, the Government of the people, by the people, and for the people, supposedly, to control vast amounts of privately owned land, that it would be used by extremists to throw thousands of families on to the welfare roll.  The Government has said they want to improve the lot of the people, allowing this bill to be misused. And, Madam Speaker, that is what has happened to the Endangered Species Act. It is a tragedy. It is a law with good intentions, a good goal, but it has been taken to the extremes that the American people no longer support thus endangering the species and why we must improve the act.  This law has resulted in some people losing the right to use their land, their land, not your land, not the Federal Government's, but their land, because an agency, the Fish and Wildlife Service, has ordered them to use their land as a wildlife refuge. These landowners have not been compensated in any way, shape, or form, as our Bill of Rights requires. They still must pay their taxes on this federally controlled land and are singled out unfairly to bear the burden of paying for, supposedly, the public benefit. This has hurt not only the private landholder, the basis of our society, but it has also hurt the wildlife that depend on that land.  Because of the way that these Washington bureaucrats, primarily in the Fish and Wildlife agencies, have treated landowners, and particularly farmers, wildlife is no longer considered an asset by the landowners. Now the presence of wildlife is feared. A lucky few of these landowners have been able to file suit or fight the bureaucrats and extremists in court, a lucky few, those that have extremely great amounts of wealth. However, there are many people who have not been so lucky and have had to suffer the loss of their property or their livelihoods in silence without the tens of thousands of dollars needed to defend their rights in court.  Since I became chairman of the Committee on Resources, I have tried to ensure full and fair public debate on how to protect our endangered species and our threatened species while protecting the private property owner. Our committee held seven field hearings andfive Washington, DC, hearings on this issue, the Endangered Species Act, and the revision of said act. We heard over 160 witnesses. Over 5,000 people attended and participated in these hearings.  Through our hearings all over the country, we gave the American people an opportunity to help us write our recommendations for repairing the Endangered Species Act. What we learned from these hearings is that American people love wildlife and have a true appreciation for our natural resources. However, the American people also love and cherish our Constitution, our way of life, and our freedom. The American people want a law that protects both wildlife and people. They want a law that is reasonable and balanced. They want a law that uses good science to list the species. Right now, today, all it takes is someone to file a petition saying they think, in fact, it is endangered, and then the Fish and Wildlife or Forest Service, Park Service, whoever it may be, will have to make a massive study even though that species may never reside there. That is how this act has been misused.  The American people are willing to make sacrifices if those sacrifices make sense and accomplish the goal of protecting truly endangered or threatened species. However, the current law on species, subspecies, and small regional subspecies, is based only on the best currently available science. That means, even though a species or subspecies may be thriving and abundant in various areas around the Nation, one small geographic population can be listed and can be used to stop the property owners from using their land in that area.  This is not America. The number of frivolous lawsuits that have been filed under the ESA have exploded. These lawsuits result in friendly settlements between the Government and extremist groups. Then the Government can use the excuse of court orders to shut down entire industries, put thousands of people out of work, and deprive landowners of their rights.  Lawyers are making millions of dollars, paid for by the taxpayers, by filing these suits, since the ESA requires judges to pay lawyers from the Federal Treasury.                              {time}  1500  The result is entire communities are devastated while environmental groups get richer. Who is filing these suits? Only environmentalists are allowed to file these suits in most of the country. If a private citizen may be harmed economically and wants to file a suit to protect their own land or job, the courts have closed the door in their faces. The ESA has been identified recently by a government commission as the worst unfunded mandate on States and local governments.  The Fish and Wildlife Service and the courts are imposing exorbitant costs on species protection and on small local towns and districts which they cannot afford. These small towns either pass on these costs to their taxpayers and property owners or reduce important public safety, health, and educational services. There are other serious problems with the way the Federal Government is using the law.  Now, do I, do we, does the committee support gutting or repealing the Endangered Species Act? Absolutely not. Contrary to what you may read in the paper or is being reported by this administration, we do not believe in eliminating or gutting ESA. But the American people are not going to continue to support and pay for our efforts to protect their wildlife unless we make the ESA work for the people and the wildlife. We need to make necessary repairs in a law that has become broken.  We spend hundreds of millions of dollars in this country for the protection of our great natural resources. Our good Secretary of Interior, Bruce Babbitt, has a $6 billion budget, a $6 billion budget, to protect our natural resources, but he says that is not enough. He wants more land under Government control, more money under Government control, and more power. Let us not forget that word, power.  We want to keep a good Endangered Species Act that truly protects our wildlife and our people, but we want to give more to do these good things back to the people who can do it best, the American public.  I trust the American people to be good stewards. They have in the past and will be in the future. When Federal action is needed to protect our wildlife that migrates across State lines, to protect our parks and refuges, to protect our waters and the air we breathe, we will continue to fund the millions to do the job, but we want to do it right.  Mr. Speaker, I take this time today because we need to make the Endangered Species Act work. We can only do that if we take up this important law and repair the damage that has been done.  Mr. Speaker, may I say, before I yield time to my colleagues, there is a case in California where a gentleman in fact is taking care of a small acreage of land and protects all species around it because he wanted to do so. Now he is under threat by the Fish and Wildlife Service saying because there are certain species on the small acreage of land, that he can no longer till the land around it. In fact, he is prohibited from making a living, without compensation. They would be taking his livelihood away.  Why do you think those species are there? It is because he has protected them. He has provided them shelter. He has provided them with food and the love that takes to maintain the species. But along comes this Government and says, ``Now, we know what is best. You must not disturb their habitat.'' He was the one who protected the habitat.  He is being told by this Government that no longer has the sensibility to get out of the rain, that they know what is best for species. And he has a very serious choice to make: Is he in fact going to continue to protect those species, as he has done in the past, or will he retain his livelihood and eliminate that species? He does not want to do that.  It is time we review this act and improve this act, to make it work for the people of America, and for the species.  Mr. Speaker, I yield 5 minutes to the gentleman from Utah, Mr. [Hansen].
