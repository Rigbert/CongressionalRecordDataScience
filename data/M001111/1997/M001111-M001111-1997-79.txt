 President, Washington State lost a visionary leader, a passionate advocate, and a remarkable woman with the passing of Jerline Ware. As a citizen activist and as a public servant, Jeri Ware worked tirelessly for social justice and to ensure a brighter future for our community's children.  Jeri Ware may best be remembered as the chairwoman of the Seattle Human Rights Commission. This position gave her the opportunity to do in an official capacity what she had done her entire life: fight against discrimination and for equality and human rights. She never gave up believing in a just society and never shied away from speaking out for those who had been wronged. Just last December, the Seattle Human Rights Commission honored Jeri for her tireless commitment and dedication.  Jeri's other passion was our community's young people. She recognized that the future well-being of our community depended on our having a shared sense of responsibility for all our children and giving them the best possible start in life. She put this conviction into action by working in the tutorial program at the University of Washington and as a parent coordinator at Seattle's Leschi School.  We will miss not only Jeri Ware the activist and community leader, but also Jeri Ware the friend. She was a woman who was always willing to open her heart and home.  Jeri leaves her husband of 49 years, John, sons Anthony Muhammed and John Ware, daughters Joan Ware and Falicia Green, six grandchildren and two great-grandchildren; to whom our thoughts go out.  Jeri Ware's passing at the all-too-young age of 73 leaves a great void. However, her courage, commitment and unending faith in a just society will continue to be an inspiration to all those who share her vision.                          ____________________
