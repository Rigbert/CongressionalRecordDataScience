 President, I would like to pay tribute today to the life of TSgt Joseph G. Lemm who was killed while serving his country in Afghanistan. It was his third tour of duty in Afghanistan. Joe was born in Dubuque, IA, and lived in the nearby town of Bernard as a young child.  He was a police officer in New York City and served in the New York Air National Guard. Clearly, his was a life of public service, defending his fellow Americans both at home and abroad. His willingness to repeatedly put himself in harm's way speaks volumes about his courage and character.  I am told that he was often called Superman, and like Superman, Joe spent his life defending ``Truth, Justice, and the American Way.'' He will be remembered for his extraordinary love of country and family.  My prayers go out to his wife, Christine; his daughter, Brooke; his son, Ryan; as well as his mother, Shirley, and his father, Charles. Their premature loss will leave an enormous hole in their lives, but they can be very proud of the life Joe lived.                          ____________________
