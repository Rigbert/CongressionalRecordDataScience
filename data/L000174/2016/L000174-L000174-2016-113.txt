President, in response to the remarks of the senior Senator from Texas, I just wonder, if we had had a real conference where things were discussed, where would we be. That was impossible because the Republican leadership took the House of Representatives out of session. Had they stayed and done their work, as we are, I am sure we could have worked something out. But that, of course, was their decision.                  Genetically Engineered Food Labeling  Mr. President, on another matter, this week marks a historic moment in Vermont. This coming Friday, July 1, Vermont's Act 120, the first-in-the-Nation labeling law for genetically engineered--so-called GE--foods will take effect. But unfortunately for consumers everywhere, it could be a short-lived celebration.  Late last week, a so-called deal was reached on a national mandatory labeling law. During the weekend, I had the chance to review this proposal closely. Vermonters have reviewed it closely. I can say this: It falls short.  This is an extremely complex issue--from how we define genetically engineered foods, to how we treat animal products; from the impact on the organics industry, to how small businesses respond.  It is actually not something you just talk about; the details matter here. That is why the Vermont Legislature, Republicans and Democrats working together, spent 2 years debating it. They had over 50 committee hearings featuring testimony from more than 130 representatives on all sides of the issue.  The Senate has not held a single hearing on labeling. They had only one hearing on the issue of biotechnology, and they have had none on the issue of labeling foods or seeds.  I would note that the proposal unveiled late last week--and we were able to review it this weekend--is an improvement over the legislation the Senate wisely rejected in March. That bill, the one we rejected, would continue the current status quo. It proposed a meaningless ``volunteer-only'' approach, a thinly veiled attempt to block Vermont's labeling law and to keep any other State from acting. This current proposal at least acknowledges that States like Vermont have enacted in this area. That is why I stayed on the floor and blocked that first bill. I thank those Senators who joined with me.  We heard from the organic industry, expressing reservations about how they might be treated under a Federal GE-labeling program. Some of those concerns have been addressed, and the proposal reinforces that the USDA Organic seal remains the gold standard.  The proposal follows what Vermont's Act 120 does with respect to animal products, and it addresses the gap in the Vermont law for processed foods inspected by USDA, specifically those foods with meat.  The proposal now before us also acknowledges at long last what I have been saying for the past year. In many rural parts of this country, including most of Vermont, we have significant technological challenges that make it nearly impossible for consumers to access the electronic or digital disclosure methods allowed in this bill. By requiring the Secretary of Agriculture to complete a study on this issue, I believe these difficulties unavoidably will be recognized, and the Secretary should be given the authority the needs to require additional disclosure options. I do hope, however, that proponents of this proposal will not try to put the burden on our retail establishments to install costly digital scanners.  The proponents of this deal were sent back to the drawing board after we derailed them on March 16. As I said, I was very proud to be the Vermonter leading that effort. While it is true that this new attempt is an improvement in several ways, it is clear that this revised proposal is driven more by the perspectives of powerful special interests, than by a commitment to honor consumers' right to know. Consumers' right to know merits only grudging acceptance in this plan; consumers are far from this plan's highest priority. We see evidence of that in the broad loopholes included in the definitions for which GE foods this proposal would apply to.  While this proposal makes some positive, though modest, improvements, I remain deeply concerned that it is not going to offer transparency for consumers. Transparency is something that many companies have already opted to provide.  Look at these products. I bet most Americans can go to their cupboards and find them. Campbell's, General Mills, Frito-Lay, Cheez-It, and the iconic Wonder Bread. All of them are already putting on their labels that they are produced with genetic engineering or partially produced with genetic engineering. It is easy. Just print it on there. Print it on there in the same way--if you have a child or a grandchild who has a peanut allergy or who requires gluten-free, you can go look for a label, and immediately, you know what you are feeding them.  Thanks to the citizen-led efforts in Vermont, we are seeing more and more consumer-friendly information easily accessible to shoppers. No scanning some code. No calling an 800 number. You don't pick up a product and say, ``Gee, I have to scan a code in here'' or ``I have to call an 800 number.'' No. You just pick up the product and look, and you find out what it has in it, everything from water, to celery, corn, cottonseed, and genetic engineered ingredients. We have seen countless pictures sent in by shoppers finding these labels. Labeling is not complicated or cost-prohibitive in practice. They are constantly printing new labels. You just add a line.  Of course, to make matters worse, the bill we have before us has absolutely no enforcement mechanism. The negotiators of this proposal seem to think public pressure would be enough to force these multimillion-dollar corporations to comply. What they are saying is ``You guys be the cop on the beat. You be the ones to tell them what to do.'' Surely families squeezing every minute out of every day will not have time to hold companies accountable in the court of public opinion. Public pressure is not enough. You cannot ask consumers to go around and try to figure out whether they can buy something and then bring pressure. That is what we have legislatures for.  At the end of the day, each of us have different reasons for wanting to know what is in our food. The fact is that, without labeling of GE foods, consumers cannot make informed choices. This purported deal does not go far enough to give consumers what they are asking for, which is a simple, on-package label or symbol.  Of course, the bill does more than just block States from enacting GE-food labeling laws like Vermont's Act 120; it also blocks a longstanding seed-labeling law in Vermont, one that Vermont's organic farmers appreciate, as do conventional farmers and even backyard-hobby gardeners. This is a law that has been on the books since 2004. It ensures clear, meaningful information for farmers to know exactly what they are buying, and that is why they buy it.  Perhaps in a State such as Kansas, where the last organic farm survey in 2014 counted only 83 organic farms, or Michigan, a State which is 10 times the size of Vermont and has some 332 organic farms--maybe in States that don't have organic farms, having access to that seed information is not considered useful or important, but in a State such as Vermont with only 626,000 people, where, our Northeast Organic Farming Association of Vermontassures me, we now have over 600 organic farms, our seed-labeling law is important. The industry has complied with it the last 12 years; yet, with no hearings and no debate, this bill will block Vermont's seed law and will prevent any other State from enacting one.  When I was chairman of the Senate Agriculture Committee, I was proud that I wrote the law that set the national organic standards and labeling program. I was proud of that. It started out following a discussion across the kitchen table with organic farmers in Vermont; it is now a $40 billion industry nationwide.  I continue to closely monitor and work to protect the high standards for the organic program. They have given consumers confidence in the organic label. They have given organic producers the strong, clear, and meaningful standards they have demanded. They have worked hard to follow these standards, but they want to know what the standards are such that those who work hard and follow the rules are not going to have somebody come in and say, ``Well, we followed the rules,'' with no proof that they actually did.  Labeling of genetically engineered products is an outgrowth of the organic movement. As a watchdog of the organic program, I simply cannot support this proposal. I don't support it. We are not saying you cannot have these genetically engineered foods; just let consumers know. Label it. Then they can decide whether to buy it, just as a parent with a child who may require a gluten-free product knows when they come in whether a product is gluten-free when it says so on the label. It doesn't say you outlaw products with gluten in them; it says to give people a choice--the same as those with a peanut allergy. In this case, people want to know how their food was produced, and they want it on the label, not in some electronic code.  Vermonters have a long tradition of leading the debate on issues crossing the spectrum. Vermonters stand for transparency the consumer's right to know. Vermonters want to make informed decisions for their families and with their limited grocery budgets. I acknowledge--we Vermonters acknowledge that powerful interests are allied against Vermont's law and against the Nation's consumers, as has been the fact from the beginning.  The proposal released last week does not respect the work that Vermont has painstakingly done in this space. This Vermonter reflects the feelings of my constituents. I will not and cannot support it. Vermonters deserve better and so do all Americans.  Mr. President, I see my good friend from Oregon, Senator Merkley, on the floor. He knows how important Vermont's work has been in this national public debate. I have been proud to cosponsor his legislation that recognizes and respects Vermont's law.  I yield to my good friend from Oregon.  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Cruz). The Senator from Oregon.
