 President, as we close the first day of debate on the Chemical Weapons Convention, I wanted to insert into the Record an explanation of the 28 conditions to the resolution of ratification that we adopted this afternoon, so we can create a legislative history.  Mr. President, the Chemical Weapons Convention is a fine arms control agreement. It can stand on its own.  But the U.S. Senate has a constitutional duty to consider carefully all the implications of treaties submitted for its advice and consent to ratification. Such careful consideration often enables us to spot aspects of an agreement that merit clarification, or implementation matters on which we would be well advised to require particular executive branch policies.  The Chemical Weapons Convention is no exception to this rule. Over the years since its signing over 4 years ago, near the end of the Bush administration, we have identified several areas in which clarifying the convention's intent or establishing requirements regarding executive branch implementation would be useful.  In addition, there were several areas in which some of my colleagues wanted assurances that went beyond those that the executive branch or I could give them, even though we thought that such reassurances ought to suffice. In many such cases, the easiest way of providing the needed assurances was to codify them in a condition to the resolution of ratification.  The convention enters into force on April 29, with or without the United States. To be an original state party, therefore, the President must deposit the instrument of ratification by midnight on April 28. As a technical matter, the Senate's vote is not the final word, because the Senate does not ``ratify'' a treaty; it provides advice and consent to it. Once that occurs, the President then must formally ratify--an indication to our treaty partners that the United States is consenting to be legally bound to its terms--by signing an ``instrument of ratification.'' The President then directs the Secretary of State to deposit that instrument at a central location designated by the convention; then, once the convention enters into force, the United States is bound under international law to abide by its terms.  The Senate's role in providing consent to a treaty is not that of a rubber stamp. The Senate may attach amendments or reservations to the treaty--essentially changing the terms of the original bargain between the United States and its treaty partners, or it may adopt conditions, which are, in effect, a binding contract between the Senate and the President which will govern how the treaty will be implemented or interpreted under U.S. law and practice.  In the case of the Chemical Weapons Convention, no amendments to the convention's text have been, or will be, offered; the Senate has already moved beyond the stage in its consideration of treaties in which such amendments would be in order. Neither have any reservations been put forth--although article XXII of the convention purports to prevent a party from doing so. The Senate has gone on record several times, and does so again in condition 17, that the President's agreement to such a prohibition cannot constrain the Senate's constitutional right and obligation to give its advice and consent to a treaty subject to any reservation it might determine is required by the national interest.  Instead, we have a set of 28 conditions which were agreed to by those involved in the negotiations to date, and which the Senate approved by voice vote earlier this afternoon. These conditions, as stated before, are binding upon the President.  Several conditions will be debated tomorrow which are tantamount to killing the treaty. For example, any condition which requires a renegotiation of the treaty--as condition 32 does--is a killer, plain and simple, because there is no way that this treaty can be renegotiated. Additionally, any condition which requires the President to make impossible certifications before depositing the instrument of ratification will prevent the United States from formally entering the convention.  As I described earlier, there have been several stages of negotiation to work out agreed conditions to the resolution and to narrow our areas of disagreement. The Senator from North Carolina and I engaged in many hours of negotiation as part of this process.  The end result of our negotiations, of the negotiations between the White House and the task force established by the majority leader, and of discussions directly between the White House and the majority leader is a set of 28 agreed conditions to the resolution of ratification. I would like to summarize and comment upon those agreed conditions, so that my colleagues may understand what we have achieved.  For I think that we have achieved quite a lot. I also think that Members should study the many agreed conditions that the Senator from North Carolina was able to propound. Frankly, virtually all of the concerns that have been raised regarding the CWC have been addressed in these agreed conditions, in a manner that should substantially ease those concerns.  So I would like to summarize, Mr. President, what the Senator from North Carolina and I, along with other Members and the executive branch, have been able to achieve.                   providing protection for industry  The CWC contains a number of built-in protections for U.S. businesses, largely because industry helped write many of the convention's provisions. A number of conditions have been added, however, to provide even greater protection for business.  Condition 16 provides that if an employee of the organization for the prohibition of chemical weapons, or OPCW, willfully discloses U.S. confidential business information that causes financial harm to a U.S. business, the President must inform Congress. If the director-general does not waive the employee's diplomatic immunity from prosecution, which may be done pursuant to paragraph 20 of the CWC's confidentiality annex, within 9 months of the President's reporting the matter to Congress, the President is required to withhold half of the U.S. contribution to the OPCW until that employee's immunity from prosecution is waived. This will serve as a strong deterrent to breaches of confidential information. You might call it a ``don't mess with our trade secrets'' condition.  Condition 18 is a further protection for proprietary information. This condition prohibits any samples collected during inspections in the United States from being analyzed in a foreign laboratory. This will greatly reduce the risk of industrial espionage. I frankly have concerns about this condition. I hope it does not lead to every country keeping all its samples in-country, so that all of Iran's samples are analyzed in Iran and all of Russia's samples are analyzed in Russia. But there is no question that this is a major concession to some of my colleagues' concerns regarding the need to protect confidential business information.  Condition 9 requires the President to certify, both now and annually, that the CWC's limits on the production and use of the most toxic chemical weapons and their precursors are not significantly harming the legitimate commercial activities and interests of chemical, biotechnology, and pharmaceutical firms. The administration is fully prepared to make that certification.  The Reagan, Bush, and Clinton administrations have all taken extraordinary measures to limit the impact ofthe CWC upon U.S. businesses. For example, the Bush administration made sure that challenge inspections would be subject to ``managed access,'' in which a firm will be able to limit the access of inspectors to the minimum necessary to disprove any allegations of CWC violations by that firm. And the Clinton administration worked with other countries in the CWC Preparatory Commission to make sure that most of the businesses covered by the convention will only have to fill out a short form to comply with the requirement for data declarations.  Condition 21 puts the Senate on record supporting the provision of assistance to U.S. businesses by the On-Site Inspection Agency--or OSIA--an arm of the Department of Defense. OSIA has years of experience in helping protect sensitive information during inspections of Government-run facilities and defense contractors. This Agency lacks authority to aid other U.S. businesses, however. Following through on this provision with authorizing legislation--which I would hope we could do in the CWC implementing legislation--would ensure that American businesses have the full benefit of OSIA's expertise available to them.  Under condition 23, the Senate will be informed promptly of the proposed addition of a chemical to any of the CWC's schedules of chemicals. A report from the President will indicate the anticipated effect of such proposal on U.S. industry. If a proposed addition should appear to promise too great a burden on U.S. industry for too little gain in protection against chemical weapons, Congress will then have time to convince the executive branch to force that proposed addition into a CWC process that requires two-thirds vote of the states parties to adopt the change.                        holding down u.s. costs  Allegations have been made that the CWC will create a massive U.S.-style bureaucracy that will cost U.S. taxpayers hundreds of millions of dollars. Several conditions have been agreed upon to keep U.S. costs to a minimum and ensure a well-managed organization.  Under condition 22, regular U.S. contributions to the Organization for the Prohibition of Chemical Weapons, or OPCW, have been capped at $25 million annually. Any increase to this cap must cross two high hurdles. First, the President must make a ``national security interest'' waiver. Second, the Congress must enact a joint resolution approving the President's waiver.  Fortunately, condition 22 allows a periodic inflation adjustment to the regular U.S. contribution. In addition, the United States will be permitted to contribute funds to help the OPCW handle the costs of monitoring U.S. destruction of chemical weapons. Those are costs that we originally intended to fund for implementation of the 1990 bilateral destruction agreement between the United States and the Soviet Union, and they have not been included in the regular OPCW budget.  Condition 2 provides that any U.S. contributions to the OPCW will be subject to congressional authorization and appropriation. This means that not one dollar can be transferred to the organization by the U.S. Government without congressional approval.  Pursuant to condition 3, the OPCW must create an independent inspector general within its first 9 months of operation. Otherwise, half of the regular U.S. contribution to the OPCW budget will be withheld. An inspector general will ensure rigorous oversight of OPCW activities and expenditures.  While it is in the U.S. interest for the CWC to have a strong verification regime, we should not have to foot the bill for all of the research and development that goes to improving verification. That is why condition 4 was included, to require that any research and development by the United States that is designed primarily to improve the verification provisions of the CWC--including the training of OPCW inspectors--must be pursuant to an agreed cost-sharing arrangement that spreads the costs of such R equitably between the United States and the organization.  A cost-sharing arrangement will also be required in order to share items or services that were developed through U.S. research and development. It will still be possible, however, for U.S. agencies to pursue R programs so as to improve U.S. monitoring of chemical weapons, and cost-sharing arrangements need not be in place unless and until the United States wants to share the results with the OPCW.  We would also not want to be stuck with the bill for Russian destruction of their vast chemical weapons stockpile. So there is agreement on condition 14, under which the United States shall not accept any Russian effort to condition its ratification of CWC upon United States guarantees to pay for Russian implementation of chemical weapons destruction under the CWC or the 1990 bilateral destruction agreement.       ensuring improved monitoring, verification and enforcement  Some opponents of CWC have alleged that the convention will lead to a ``dumbing down'' of U.S. intelligence and that the United States will shy away from taking tough actions when faced with instances of noncompliance. Three conditions address these concerns head-on.  We all know that monitoring and verification of some aspects of CWC compliance will be difficult. This fact of life has prompted understandable concern on the part of some Members, and the administration has accepted a condition-- No. 10--that requires both periodic reports and prompt notice regarding world chemical weapons programs and the status of CWC compliance. The executive branch would also offer briefings on current compliance issues, including issues to be raised in OPCW meetings and the results of those meetings.  The careful reader of condition 10 may note some hyperbole in it. Thus, the first subparagraph states that ``the convention is in the interests of the United States only if all parties * * * are in strict compliance * * *, such compliance being measured by performance and not by efforts * * *''  In truth, of course, there may be major violations or minor shortfalls. If a party is delayed in its sincere efforts to clean up the vestiges of a long-inactive chemical weapons program, that will hardly constitute a threat to U.S. national interests. But the drafters of this condition are on to something; even minor violations by a few parties could erode the commitment of other parties to strict compliance with the convention.  The important thing is that the administration is not afraid to keep Congress in the loop on CWC compliance issues. Condition 10 requires briefings at least four times a year for the Congress on U.S. actions taken to address compliance issues. This regular flow of information will allow the Congress to keep abreast of chemical weapons programs and to judge for itself whether the United States is doing enough to detect and respond to noncompliance.  It may be in our interest at times to share intelligence with the OPCW, especially so as to maximize the effectiveness of the CWC's on-site inspection regime. All agree that we should take steps to protect U.S. sources and methods when sharing intelligence information.  Thanks to the work of the senior Senator from Alabama, which I am happy to commend, condition 5 has been added to do just that. It requires the intelligence community, at the interagency level, to fully sanitize and to approve all intelligence information before it is released to the OPCW.  The Director of Central Intelligence can waive this requirement for particular documents on a case-by-case basis, but that must be promptly reported to the Foreign Relations and Intelligence Committees of the Congress. The Director must also report on the procedures set up to protect classified information and on any unauthorized disclosures of information provided to the OPCW.  The Senator from Alabama's condition makes a real contribution to the verification of compliance with the CWC. The ability of the United States to share information with the OPCW is vital to catching would-be violators of the convention. I hope that this condition will not only ease the Senator's concerns over the protection of intelligence sources and methods, but also reassure him that the overall convention is in the national interest.  All of us want the executive branch to act effectively in the event that a State party should violate the CWC in any manner that threatened U.S. national security interests. Condition 13will require the executive branch to report to and consult with the Senate regarding such violations and to make effective use of CWC provisions for challenge inspections, high-level diplomacy and U.N. sanctions. The executive branch also agrees that any sanctions required by U.S. law should be implemented in such a case.  Pursuant to subparagraph (A)(vi), if the noncompliance should persist for a year, the executive branch will be bound to consult with the Senate for the purposes of obtaining a resolution of support of continued adherence to the convention. This seems unduly rigid; a country may well need more than a year to come into compliance if it must destroy chemical weapons stocks or facilities. Frankly, I do not know what is to be gained by requiring the executive branch to consult each time on a possible resolution of support for continued adherence to the CWC. But condition 13 does not require that such a nonbinding resolution be introduced or voted upon in every case, so there is little potential for harm in this.  Some other aspects of condition 13 merit additional explanation. For example, several of the mandated executive branch responses to CWC violations must be undertaken on an urgent basis. This does not mean that they must all proceed concurrently. Thus, in some cases high-level diplomacy will suffice and there will be no need to seek a challenge inspection or U.N. sanctions.  In some cases, it might be necessary to prepare the groundwork carefully for a challenge inspection or a diplomatic approach. The Senator from North Carolina and I are agreed that the executive branch could proceed with such preparations on an urgent basis, even though they may take many months to come to fruition.  Finally, the requirement in subparagraph (A)(ii) that the executive branch seek a challenge inspection should not be read as requiring that the United States must always be the party that initiates such a request. There might well be other States parties with an equal or greater interest in a given country's apparent violation of the CWC, and it might be more fruitful in some cases for the executive branch to work with those other States parties to secure the common objective of a challenge inspection.                  maintaining robust chemical defenses  Some have asserted that if the United States joins the CWC, we will be lulled into a false sense of security and drop our guard against the continuing threat of chemical weapons. This concern is frankly a bit mystifying. Aside from the risk that any arms control treaty might be violated by a State party to it, U.S. military leaders are quite aware that such potential military adversaries as Iraq, Libya, and North Korea are not planning to sign the convention. The Joint Chiefs of Staff support CWC not because it will automatically remove the need to defend against chemical weapons, but rather because CWC is a vital step toward reducing and combating that threat.  While the opponents' argument ignores the fact that the Pentagon has requested $225 million in additional funds for chemical weapons defenses over the next 5 years, a condition has nonetheless been added to address their concerns. Pursuant to condition 11, the Secretary of Defense shall ensure that U.S. forces are capable of carrying out required military missions in U.S. regional contingency plans, regardless of any threat or use of chemical weapons. In particular, U.S. forces must be properly trained, equipped, and organized to operate in chemically and biologically contaminated environments. This means not only improving the defensive capabilities of U.S. forces, but also initiating discussions on chemical weapons defense with likely coalition partners and countries whose civilian personnel would support U.S. forces in a conflict.  The administration has also agreed to assure that the U.S. Army Chemical School remains under the supervision of an Army general. Finally, the President is required to submit exhaustive annual reports to Congress on the State of Chemical and Biological defense efforts.                        CONSTITUTIONAL CONCERNS  Some opponents of the CWC have alleged that it will violate the U.S. Constitution by permitting international inspectors to conduct warrantless searches of U.S. facilities. Actually, a number of legal scholars have noted the specific constitutional protections written into the convention. To ease any members' lingering concerns, however, two important agreed conditions have been added.  Condition 28 makes it crystal clear that no warrantless searches will be permitted when access to inspectors is denied. All challenge inspections will require a criminal warrant based upon probable cause when consent to that inspection is withheld. An administrative warrant will be required for routine inspections of declared U.S. facilities when consent has been withheld. Both of these warrants must be issued by a Federal judge--either a U.S. District Court judge or a U.S. magistrate judge.  Condition 28 was reached through the combined efforts of the majority leader, Senator Helms, the administration and myself. It represents a significant concession by the administration, as the Constitution does not require administrative warrants in cases of highly-regulated industries. Condition 28 reflects the executive branch's confidence that any challenge inspection mounted in the United States will, indeed, be based on sufficient evidence to justify a criminal search warrant.  I want to compliment the majority leader, in particular, for his efforts on condition 28. I would certainly hope that the concessions he obtained from the administration on this major issue would reassure him that the CWC's important contributions to the national security will be achieved without any violation of people's constitutional rights or any undue costs or harm to U.S. persons.  Condition 12 makes clear that nothing in the CWC requires or authorizes anything that is prohibited by the U.S. Constitution, as interpreted by the United States. No administration would agree to a treaty that violated the constitution, no treaty ever takes precedence over the constitution, and only the United States interprets our Constitution. The administration is quite willing, therefore, to accept a condition stating these facts.                          RIOT CONTROL AGENTS  Concerns were raised that the administration planned to amend Executive Order 11850 of 1975 to prohibit the use of tear gas in times of war to rescue downed pilots and to fend off attacks by combatants using civilians as human shields. Condition 26 has been added to lay this concern to rest.  Pursuant to condition 26, the President is prohibited from taking any action to alter or eliminate Executive Order 11850 of 1975. In other words, all uses of tear gas by U.S. Armed Forces that are permitted today--including rescuing of downed pilots and against combatants when they use civilians to shield attacks--will continue to be permitted after the CWC enters into force.  In addition, condition 26 makes clear that nearly all uses of riot control agents in peacekeeping operations will be permitted. The sole exception to that permission would be in the most unlikely case that the U.S. role in a peacekeeping operation reached such a military scope and duration that the laws of war would pertain to it.                 TRANSFER OF CHEMICAL WEAPONS DEFENSES  Some opponents of CWC have asserted that article X of the convention would require the United States to provide financial assistance and equipment to countries such as Iran and Cuba in order to improve their chemical weapons defense capabilities. This is an understandable misconception of paragraph 7 of article X, which states that ``each state party undertakes to provide [such] assistance through the organization.'' Paragraph 1 of article X defines ``assistance'' to include ``detection equipment and alarm systems, protective equipment; decontamination equipment and decontaminants; medical antidotes and treatments; and advice on any of these protective measures.''  The rest of paragraph 7 of article X makes clear, however, that each state party is not required to provide all such assistance. A state party may contribute to a voluntary fund for assistance, or agree to provide assistance through the OPCW on demand, or simply declare what assistance it might provide in response to an appeal by the OPCW. So CWC does not compel theUnited States to give any country, let alone an enemy like Cuba, anything more than medical assistance or advice.  The Senator from North Carolina has proposed in condition 15 that the Senate bind the executive branch not to provide anything more than medical antidotes and treatment to a rogue state pursuant to article X of the convention. While there is no real need to so bind the executive branch, this proposal is certainly consistent with current administration policy. As such, it may usefully allay the suspicions that article X has aroused in some quarters, and is therefore worth supporting.                 maintaining stringent export controls  Some opponents of the CWC see article XI of the convention as requiring the Australia group--an informal alliance of potential supplier states--to relax its export controls, which are a bulwark of nonproliferation. I have never shared that concern, because the Australia Group has steadfastedly told the world that it viewed its export control regime to be fully consistent with the CWC. Nevertheless, condition 7 has been added to reassure those who worry that the Australia Group would be hobbled by the CWC.  Pursuant to condition 7, the President must certify that he has obtained authoritative assurances from all other Australia Group members that they agree with the United States view that the CWC will not weaken any Australia Group controls--and these assurances have, in fact, been received. In addition, the President is required to do what it takes to prevent any backsliding in the years to come. If the Australia Group is weakened, the President will be required to consult with the Senate for the purposes of obtaining a resolution of continued adherence to the CWC.                  protecting the senate's prerogatives  Senators on both sides of the aisle wish to preserve the Senate's constitutional role in treaty-making. Several conditions address this issue.  Condition 1 asserts that the Senate reserves the right to add reservations to the resolution of ratification, despite the ban--in article XXII of the convention--on reservations to the convention. This condition asserts the Senate's right under the U.S. Constitution, but does not exercise it. It requires the administration to inform all other states parties that the Senate reserves the right to give its advice and consent to ratification of the convention subject to reservations. Although the Senate has not exercised this right at this time, it could do so in ratifying future amendments to the convention; this condition puts all parties on notice.  If the United States decided not to cast its vote--one way or another--on a proposed CWC amendment at an amendment conference under the convention, it would be possible for such an amendment to be passed without a vote in the Senate. So condition 6 will bind the executive branch to vote on every proposed CWC amendment and to submit any amendment to the Senate for its advice and consent.  As explained in the discussion of condition 1, the CWC includes a provision barring states parties from attaching reservations to their ratification of the convention. A sense-of-the-Senate condition warns U.S. negotiators that they should not include such provisions in any future treaty.  The Biden condition on treaty interpretation, which has been attached to all arms control treaties since the INF treaty was approved in 1988, is reaffirmed in condition 24. It states the constitutionally-based principle that the shared understanding that exists between the executive branch and the Senate about the terms of the treaty at the time the Senate gives advice and consent to ratification can be altered only subject to the Senate's advice and consent to a subsequent treaty or protocol, or the enactment of a statute.  Another condition is included which has been attached to major arms control treaties in recent years, setting forth the Senate position that any international agreement that would obligate the united States to limit its forces in a militarily significant way will be considered by the Senate only pursuant to article II, section 2, clause 2 of the Constitution. This is condition 25.  Condition 20 also purports to preserve the rights of the Senate, by asserting the sense of the Senate that the United States should not be denied its vote in OPCW organs if Congress fails to appropriate the full amount of funds assessed to the United States.  It should be noted that although paragraph 8 of article VIII of the convention allows the Conference of States Parties to permit a state party to retain its vote if the conference is satisfied that the state's arrears are due to conditions beyond the control of the state party, this is clearly a decision left to the states parties acting in that conference.  I sincerely doubt that any international body will see the actions of Congress as conditions beyond the control of the United States, although sometimes the American people may sympathize with that concept. Condition 20 merely states the nonbinding sense of the Senate, however, so it does no harm.                     Foreign Policy Considerations  Some people are concerned that the CWC has been oversold as a defense against the use of chemical weapons by terrorist groups. The Senator from North Carolina proposes, therefore, condition 19, by which the Senate will find that the CWC would not have stopped the Aum Shinrikyo Group in Japan and that future terrorist groups will likely seek chemical weapons. Both of these statements are probably quite accurate, and no harm is done by attaching them to the resolution of ratification.  Condition 8 deals with the matter of so-called negative security assurances. Despite the fact that the United States decided long ago to destroy its chemical weapons stockpile, some are concerned that one impact of the CWC will be to undermine the ability of the United States to adequately retaliate against a state that used chemical weapons against us, if that state has received U.S. assurances to non-nuclear weapons states that the United States will not be the first to use nuclear weapons against them--Such assurances are known as negative security assurances--This condition requires the administration to submit a classified report on the impact of this new reality upon U.S. retaliatory options in such a case and upon the whole policy of negative security assurances.                   u.s. chemical weapons destruction  Condition 27 is the result of negotiations between the administration and the senior Senator from Kentucky. It is an important effort to ensure citizens concerned about the environment that the United States will do all it can to select the safest methods for the destruction of our own stockpile of chemical weapons.  Condition 27 assures that the United States will be able, under CWC, to give full consideration to alternatives to incineration as the means to destroy U.S. chemical weapons pursuant to the convention. Since alternative means may be feasible only if we take the full time allowed by the CWC, which is more than the time allotted under current U.S. law, this condition states that the CWC time allotment may supersede that in section 1412 of Public law 99-145.   Mr. President, this has been a lengthy explanation of what we are accepting in the 28 agreed conditions to the resolution of ratification. It is lengthy for a good reason: because the senior Senator from North Carolina and I have truly reached many elements of agreement, and because several of those agreements are truly significant. In addition, given the absence of a report from the Foreign Relations Committee, this statement is intended to create some legislative history for the 28 conditions on which the Senator from North Carolina and I have agreed.  It is my sincere belief, Mr. President, that the adoption of these 28 agreed conditions, will answer many of the most vexing concerns that have been raised by Members who find it difficult to decide how to vote on advice and consent to ratification. I hope that my colleagues will study carefully how much we have achieved.  I trust they will understand that the remaining issues are ones on which we cannot accept the proposed conditions without killing U.S. ratification of the convention or seriously impeding its implementation. And finally, I urge my colleagues, in light of what we have accomplished thus far, to take the culminating step and support final passage of this historic resolution.
