President, I want to call the Senate's attention today to yet another outstanding Vermont business: Seventh Generation. Seventh Generation unveiled its line of environmentally friendly consumer household products more than 25 years ago. Today it has expanded to become one of the dominant businesses in this continuously emerging market.  I have visited Seventh Generation many times, and I am consistently impressed with how the company continues to find new ways of expanding its business and offering Americans affordable and more sustainable alternatives to standard household products.  Since 2011, Seventh Generation has seen its business grow year after year and has unveiled some 100 new products in the last 4 years alone. President and CEO John Replogle has reinvigorated the company, further defining its purpose and leadership in the competitive marketplace.  Seventh Generation has long been a company that fosters the business principles and ideals that so many Vermonters value: to make products locally, to keep it sustainable, to leave no footprint, and make products accessible. From its Burlington offices that overlook the shores of Lake Champlain to the shelves of the retail giants now promoting its products, Seventh Generation is yet another Vermont company leading the way in corporate responsibility.  I ask unanimous consent that the August 27, 2015, article from the Burlington Free Press entitled ``Seventh Generation: `Bursting at the seams' '' be printed in the Record.  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in the Record, as follows:            [From the Burlington Free Press, Aug. 27, 2015]              Seventh Generation: `Bursting at the Seams'                          (By Dan D'Ambrosio)       Seventh Generation in Burlington has been on a tear since      John Replogle took over as president and CEO in 2011. Sales      are up more than 60 percent, from about $150 million when      Replogle arrived to about $250 million projected for this      year. Annual growth is in the ``low double digits,'' says      Replogle.       That's a lot of toilet tissue made from recycled paper and      natural, cold-water laundry detergent, not to mention the      dozens of other products in Seventh Generation's expanded      line of ``green'' disinfectants, dishwashing and hand soaps,      surface cleaners, diapers and baby wipes and feminine hygiene      products. Seventh Generation has added about 100 new products      under Replogle.       The company today dominates the market for natural cleaning      products, according to Replogle, who says the other leaders      in the industry are Method and Mrs. Meyers Clean Day.       ``Adding our sales together we have a half-billion dollar      business,'' said Replogle. ``I would love to see the three      brands grow to a billion dollars over the next few years.''       In typical Reploglian fashion, Replogle declines to      criticize his two closest competitors in any way, going so      far as to refer to them as ``frenemies.'' And he points out      that the three brands together have less than a 5 percent      share in any category they sell in, leaving a long way to go      before they begin to threaten the Procter & Gambles of the      world.       ``What they're trying to do is very much in the spirit of      what we're trying to do,'' Replogle said. ``Use fewer      ingredients, be less toxic, be more sustainable in      manufacturing and packaging. So there's a lot of commonality      among our brands.''                         `A really smart dude'       Replogle, 49, is the former president of Guinness in the      United States and United Kingdom. From there he went to      Unilever, where he ran the North American skin care business,      with brands including Dove, Ponds, Caress and Lever 2000.      Next, in 2006, Replogle took the helm at Burt's Bees,      bringing the quirky natural skin care company to the masses.       ``We launched at Target, CVS and Walgreen's,'' Replogle      said. ``We built a national brand. I put great people on the      team, and gave them a lot of freedom. We set up core values      and principles to run the company and we invested behind it,      and it took off.''       Which is a pretty good description of what Replogle has      done at Seventh Generation. Alan Newman, founder of Magic Hat      Brewing Co., launched the original Seventh Generation catalog      business more than 25 years ago. Newman has been watching      Replogle from his latest perch in the Maltex Building on Pine      Street, where Newman is running a new craft beer company for      The Boston Beer Co., a.k.a. Samuel Adams. Newman likes what      he sees on the waterfront, where Seventh Generation is      headquartered at Main Street Landing.       ``John's a really smart dude who knows how to bring focus      to an organization, who knows how to re-enthuse the      mission,'' Newman said. ``From what I can tell from the      outside, he's a really good delegator and manager.''       In Newman's estimation, Seventh Generation had largely lost      sight of its mission four years ago when Replogle took over.       ``I did not pay a lot of attention to Seventh Generation,      but whenever I did they were scattered all over the place,''      Newman said. ``They didn't seem to have any mission left.''       Sales were also flat, Replogle said.       ``I just knew this company stood for something greater and      that it needed leadership,'' Replogle said. ``The company was      at a crossroads. We were very nearly at the end of our rope      frankly.''       Replogle began drawing that rope in by putting a laser      focus on what Seventh Generation stands for--natural,      sustainable, environmentally sensitive cleaning products, the      only segment of the retail category showing significant      growth.       ``We're really in tune with the consumer today,'' Replogle      said. ``The millennial consumer in particular, people trying      to avoid chemicals, who are more conscious about not only      what's in their product but also the practices of the company      itself. More and more young consumers are understanding the      company behind their product matters. We're winning with      those consumers.''                            A pioneer brand       As an example of a best manufacturing practice at Seventh      Generation, Replogle points to the fact that the company      contracts all of its manufacturing to about 22 factories      across the nation. ``You will always have the most      sustainable footprint on a dispersed model,'' Replogle said.      ``If we can manufacture closer to the market, we'll do a lot      better. A lot of companies have one large-scale manufacturing      site. Then you have to ship everything in and ship the      products out.'' Second, Replogle said, Seventh Generation      continues to innovate.       ``We've upgraded every product in our portfolio in the last      four years,'' he said. ``Every product has been improved in      some material way. We never stop and we're innovating into      new spaces. Plus, we've taken our brand from a few categories      into several categories. We're not only in dish soap and      laundry detergent, we're in hand wash, diapers and wipes and      feminine care. We've gone across all the categories.''       Target has taken notice. Spokeswoman Erica Julkowski said      Seventh Generation is one of a ``handful of vendors'' the      giant retailer works with closely to ``ideate and develop      products.'' ``Seventh Generation is a pioneer brand in      natural cleaning and has been a valued partner to Target by      providing ongoing innovation and thought leadership,''      Julkowski said in an email. ``Through Seventh Generation's      deep understanding of the naturals cleaning industry, they      continue to provide expert knowledge on the market and      insight into up-and-coming products that might resonate with      the Target guest.''       In Seventh Generation's soothing offices overlooking Lake      Champlain--all earth tones and wood paneling with an open      center staircase festooned with greenery and the company's      principles emblazoned on dangling wooden signs--John      Fitzgerald is working on a shelf layout for Target. The      products are dish soaps and detergents.       In the computer generated ``plan-o-gram'' on his big      screen, Fitzgerald proposes a display layout of not only      Seventh Generation's products, but also of Method's and Mrs.      Meyer's offerings, as well as giants like Cascade and Finish.      Finally, Fitzgerald proposes shelf positions for Target's      own house brands, all based on data collected by a third      party.       ``Our goal is to be objective, to share the facts and give      them a recommendation,'' Replogle said. ``Our goal isn't to      convince them our way is the right way.''       Nevertheless, working so closely with Target is a pretty      good relationship builder, Replogle adds.                        Born here, staying here       Seventh Generation is bursting at the seams at Main Street      Landing, with most of its approximately 140 employees working      in Burlington. Replogle plans on adding another 15 employees      to the staff by the end of the year.       ``We have maximized our space in here,'' he said. ``Growth      is a wonderful thing, but right now we're fully utilized in      this building.''       That doesn't mean, however, that Seventh Generation is      going anywhere.       ``Burlington is our long-term home,'' Replogle said. ``We      were born here, we're growing up here and will will remain      here. No question. We're committed to that.''       Seventh Generation has a small office in Toronto, and a      satellite office in Raleigh, North Carolina, where Replogle      lived as CEO of Burt's Bees, and where his family still      lives.       When he was recruited to run Seventh Generation, Replogle      and his wife decided against uprooting their four children,      so he has been commuting, returning to his home in Raleigh      every other week.       A native of Boston and a graduate of Dartmouth and Harvard,      Replogle feels he has the best of both worlds, maintaining      his life in Raleigh and returning to New England for more      than a visit. Replogle said it's going to feel even better      when his daughter starts at Dartmouth as a freshman this      fall.       ``She'll be right down the road as well,'' he said.       Replogle expects to open an office in California soon, and      earlier this year he launched the business in China with an      office in Hangzhou.       ``There's demand for our products over there,'' Replogle      said. ``We're in Japan, Hong Kong, of course mainland China.      We're in Korea, Vietnam, Australia. That's been growing over      the last five years.''       Replogle said Seventh Generation will also be in Europe      within three years.       ``How we get there we're still working on right now,'' he      said. ``Whether it's a direct model where we create Seventh      Generation Europe or whether we partner into that market we      haven't determined yet.''                           The latest venture       Seventh Generation's office in Raleigh is home to the      company's venture arm, with nine employees who look for new      business opportunities beyond natural cleaning products.       ``We created Seventh Generation Ventures about three years      ago with the idea of     partnering with like-minded companies and helping them      accelerate their growth,'' Replogle said.       The acquisitions began with Bobble, a filtered water bottle      company Seventh Generation bought in 2013. The plastic water      bottle features a replaceable charcoal filter, and sells for      $10, with a new filter that costs about $3. It's marketed as      a way to reduce disposable water bottle use.       Next, Seventh Generation Ventures picked up Presse, a      travel coffee mug with built-in French press, which is being      marketed under the Bobble name. Call it a K-Cup killer.       ``This is our answer to Keurig,'' said Replogle, holding a      stainless steel Presse in his hand. ``We looked for mission-     aligned companies like this that are trying to solve a      problem like, end the incredible waste of single-serve water      bottles or, end the incredible waste of K-Cups.''       Seventh Generation Ventures was boosted considerably by a      $30 million investment last September from former Vice      President Al Gore's investment fund, the London-based      Generation Investment Management LLP. Seventh Generation      returned to private ownership about 15 years ago after a      brief flirtation with being a publicly owned company.       The company's nine board members own about 70 percent of      the company, Replogle said, with new shareholders      periodically invited in, and existing shareholders offered an      exit. The $30 million from Gore's foundation was mostly used      to retire existing shareholders who wanted to exit.       ``There's a long list of investors and companies that would      love to put their money into Seventh Generation,'' Replogle      said. ``We're pretty fortunate. We have a good thing      happening right now.'' Seventh Generation is also debt-free.       ``John has re-energized the business,'' Alan Newman said.      ``He has them on clear objectives. He's done the things that      you do to be successful in business.''                          ____________________
