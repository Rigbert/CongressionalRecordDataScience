Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.  I want to thank Mr. Gallegly for offering this resolution. I think it is a very timely and a very important one.  I rise in support of House Resolution 639, which commends the German Government for its cooperation with our American intelligence community inapprehending several terrorists in Germany who were bent on killing large numbers of Americans and Germans.  Just last week, this House and the American people took time to commemorate and to remember the tragic loss of life of almost 3,000 American lives killed 6 years ago in the cowardly attacks on the World Trade Center and the Pentagon. Due to the cooperation of the intelligence agencies in the U.S. and Germany, many Americans are alive today who might well have suffered a similar fate in just the past few days who, quite likely, would have been killed or injured in explosions masterminded by extremists who care nothing for innocent civilians that they are intent on destroying.  We are fortunate, Mr. Speaker, to have allies in Europe who are working with us in this important fight against terrorism as well as our own intelligence community that is working around the clock to protect not only Americans but people around the world.  This resolution expresses to both our friends in the Federal Republic of Germany and to the hardworking people of our intelligence agencies the profound thanks and gratitude for saving American lives  Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.
