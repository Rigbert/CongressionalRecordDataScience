Chairman, I thank the gentleman from Florida for yielding me this time, and I also thank him for his statement and his continuing willingness to work with all of us for a mission that he thinks is very important and we share and we know is going to require money. He is going to be a critical player in that effort. We very much appreciate his role.  I rise, however, to pass along a paragraph that would have been in the statement of the gentleman from Ohio (Mr. Ney) had he been able to stay. Unfortunately, he had an engagement he could not get out of. If the gentleman from Ohio (Mr. Ney) were here, the chairman of the Committee on House Administration, he would have said this:  ``These programs will cost money.'' ``These programs'' being the election reforms which are being discussed on the floor today. ``I want to assure the gentleman from Florida (Mr. Hastings) that I am fully committed to ensuring that the necessary funds are authorized and appropriated.''  I know that the gentleman from Ohio (Mr. Ney) has talked to the gentleman from Florida (Mr. Young). I know that they are working together, that we are working together. This is a critical issue. I will have a few words to say on it later. But I am pleased that the gentleman from Ohio (Mr. Ney), although he could not be here, wanted me to make these remarks so that his commitment and his view of the importance of this issue was clearly on the record during the consideration of the Hastings amendment.  I might say at this point in time that the Hastings amendment's sum of $600 million is very close to the sums that are in most of the Senate bills and that the gentleman from Ohio (Mr. Ney) and I have been discussing will be necessary to effect the ends that I think all of us seek.  I thank the gentleman for yielding this time, and I thank him for his leadership on this issue.
