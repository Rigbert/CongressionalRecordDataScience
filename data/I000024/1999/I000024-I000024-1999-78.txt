President, I would like to enter into a brief colloquy with the Chairman regarding some weather observation equipment for the FAA.  As the Chairman will remember, last year he was very helpful in getting money in the Department of Transportation Appropriation bill for FY 99 to begin testing of the Automated Observation for Visibility Cloud Height, and Cloud Coverage (AOVCC) system. Using high resolution digital imaging, laser ranging and high performance computing technology, the AOVCC system augments the current ASOS by adding the capability to detect fast-moving weather systems in a timely and representative manner. Is it my understanding that FAA is currently testing this equipment and it appears that AOVCC is performing up to expectations.  Would the Chairman agree that if testing of AOVCC is successful, FAA would make every effort to purchase the AOVCC system to enhance existing weather observation?
