Mr. Chairman, I yield myself such time as I may consume.  Let me just say in answer to the previous speaker, opposition to abortion funding has nothing whatsoever to do with politics. Such charge is insulting today, we seek, to the maximum extent possible, to safeguard human rights for unborn children who cannot defend themselves.  Let me also say that every time we deal with pro-life text including language that proscribes funding for abortion, the issue, we are told is never about abortion. When we deal with the D.C. approps bill, it is about home rule. When we deal with the Hyde amendment on the health and human services appropriations bill, it's rich versus poor, rather that subsidizing the extermination of poor children by abortion. Our opponents on the issue always try to muddy the water suggesting that the debate is about something other than abortion. And today we're told it is a matter of Federal employees benefit packages. Sorry--that argument just doesn't cut it. Abortion is not a health benefit--it's the killing of a baby. Regrettably, the gentlewoman is offering an amendment today that would strike current law, that is to say, law that has been in effect this year, last year, every year except 2 years since I first successfully offered this back in the early 1980s.                              {time}  1730  So let me emphasize my hope that Members will reject this misguided, anti child amendment.  Mr. Chairman, with violence so commonplace nowadays, with our sensibilities accosted and numbed almost every day of the week by yet another outrageous act of violence at home or abroad or both, perhaps it is any wonder why we, as a society, continue to live in denial, for some it is very deep denial, about the inherent violence of abortion.  Abortion, Mr. Chairman, is not some benign act designed to cure or to mitigate a disease. I will never forget, I read a paper some years ago by Dr. Cates from the Center for Disease Control Abortion Surveillance Unit, and it was entitled ``Pregnancy, the second most prevalent sexually transmitted disease.''  Mr. Chairman, that is sick. A pregnancy, a maturing, living unborn child is not a disease. He or she is not a wart or a cancerous tumor or something that should be excised. Every one of us once were unborn children.  We should look at birth as an event that happens to each and every one of us, it is not the beginning of life. Unborn children when they are sufficiently mature and developed move on to a new address. Life is a continuum; birth is not the beginning but an event along the way.  But here is the CDC abortion surveillance authority demanding of everyone's early months calling pregnancy a sexually transmitted disease. I think that is as Orwellian and downright stupid as it gets.  Abortion, Mr. Chairman, is the antithesis of compassion and of nurturing. Abortion methods are acts of violence imposed on innocent boys and girls for whom the womb should be a place of refuge, hope, sanctuary--not an execution site.  Abortionists kill their human prey by either injecting poisons into their bodies directly or by putting high concentrated salt water into the amniotic fluid to snuff out the child's life.  High concentrated salt solutions injected into the baby's amniotic sac is barbaric--child abuse. The baby breathes in the caustic salty liquid, dies a slow, excruciatingly painful death. It usually take about 2 hours to kill the baby. The mother then goes into delivery and gives birth to a dead and very badly scalded body as a result of the corrosive effects of the salt.  These are commonplace abortions, and it would be paid for if the DeLauro amendment is approved.  Let me also remind Members that the most common method of child killing is dismemberment. A few minutes ago my good friend and colleague the gentleman from Virginia (Mr. Wolf) showed us this picture, of a 2-year-old victim of the revolutionary united front the RUF, who had her arm sheared off by thugs. This was a horrible deed by the RUF in Sierra Leone.  Abortionists do the same to children in the womb every day in America. Amazingly, there are a few lucky ones who survive. Not so long ago The New York Post featured this picture of Ana Rosa Rodriguez, almost 2 years old, with her arm sliced off. Although the abortionist tried hard he did not kill her, she survived. She is one of those fortunate ones who somehow evaded the abortionist's deadly scalpel. She is a survivor, sans an arm.  Of course, all of us are aware of what happens in a partial birth abortion, which is child abuse in the light of day. Yet, such brutality too could be paid for if the DeLauro amendment is successful.  Mr. Chairman, since 1973, over 40 million children have been slaughtered mostly by dismemberment or chemical poisoning in America. That is the equivalent, Mr. Chairman, to the entire populations of 22 States in America combined from Connecticut to Maine to New Hampshire to Oregon. If we want to look at the bigger more populus States 40 million abortions is the equivalent of the entire populations of Pennsylvania, Ohio, Michigan and New Jersey combined. Such staggering loss of children's lives should sound alarm bells--not foster denial or acquiescence. Clearly abortion has been sanitized. The cover up of abortion take the prize for ``most euphemisms.'' It has been marketed with great skill, cleverness, and deceit by the abortion lobby. The result 40 million dead children in America. 40 million kids, Mr. Chairman, who have had every hope and dream, every aspiration, every possibility of living obliterated by abortion. Their mothers too have been very much wounded by abortion.  I have been working in the pro-life movement for 28 years. I work with crisis pregnancy centers. There has been an increase in healing outreaches, Project Rachel reaches out to women in distress, who have had abortions, who are in great need of healing and reconcilliation. Many of those women are the walking wounded. Abortion hurt them physically, emotionally and psychologically.  Since 1973, Mr. Chairman, 40 million kids killed by abortion will never know the thrill of a sunset, the simple joys of life, like eating and drinking or sleeping in on a Saturday morning, a snow day. They will never have that. They have been terminated. They will never know the joy of playing sports, soccer or baseball. They will never know what it is like to date or marry or raise kids or to give of oneself for others. They will never know the power of prayer, or power of faith in God to usher in his will on earth, as it is in heaven.  All of this and more has been denied these kids because of abortion. The so-called right to choose robs children of their birthright and a lifetime of meaning and challenges have been snuffed out as a result of abortion.  Mr. Chairman, the other day in Middlesex County, New Jersey, I attended a crisis pregnancy dinner. Two of the ladies got up to the microphone and thanked the director of that center who helped them avert abortion through love and genuine concern. Both women were going in to get abortions. But both of them had the child instead. They gave very strong and compelling comments on what it was like to be reached out to and to love. What I found to be unexpected was that just a few moments later, two young teenage girls stepped up to the microphone. They too thanked the director of that crisis pregnancy center and their moms who had just spoken, because their lives had been saved from certain death.  They were articulate. Both had dreams and hopes, all because they were alive. Abortion Mr. Chairman takes the life of a child. There are alternatives--crisis pregnancy centers, adoption--so let us help you. If we subsidize abortion and facilitate abortion girls like those two potential victims are less likely to survive and are more likely to be aborted.  I do believe, Mr. Chairman, that some day, researchers, sociologists and historians and others will marvel how the best and the brightest of our day, many of those in positions of power in government, our judiciary, the media, the medical profession, and academia, could have embraced the killing of 40 million children and demanded that it not only be sanctioned, and regarded as a woman's right, but paid for by the U.S. taxpayer. Just as we look at the pro-slavery crowd of yesteryear, and say ``how could they'' they too will be aghast at our moral obtuseness and callousness.  With the bill before us today, at least we can take a stand against funding the killing of unborn babies. The underlying language that the gentlewoman from Connecticut (Ms. DeLauro) would strike continues, as I said at the outset, current law that proscribes the Federal employeeshealth benefits program from subsidizing most abortions.  I respect each Member on the other side of this issue but find it extremely disappointing and vexing that you fail to understand the terrible wrong you do to children and their mothers.  Vote no on DeLauro.  Mr. Chairman, I reserve the balance of my time.  Ms. DeLAURO. Mr. Chairman, may I inquire of the remaining time on both sides?
