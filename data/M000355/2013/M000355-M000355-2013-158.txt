 Arnold Lee Watson of Letcher County, KY. Watson voluntarily devotes his time and skills to raise money for the Veterans Program Trust Fund.  Mr. Watson is the father-in-law of Letcher County Clerk Winston Meade. Together they have created a service that is becoming popular among many Kentucky counties. As license plates are dropped off in the Letcher County office, Watson turns the old plates into pieces of art. Meade and Watson build and sell license plate birdhouses statewide in an effort to raise money for veterans' homes in eastern, central, and western Kentucky.  Meade first saw these birdhouses after he purchased two at a meeting with the Kentucky County Clerks Association. Mr. Watson is retired and saw that he could spend time making birdhouses to raise money for H.A.V.E, or Help A Veteran Everyday. His interest in helping veterans is inspired by his brothers, all who have served our country.  Help a Veteran Everyday, or H.A.V.E, is a program that was adopted in 2005 by the County Clerks of Kentucky. Across the Commonwealth, counties are taking actions to collect donations for the organization which helps ensure that Kentucky's 339,000 veterans are provided for.  I ask unanimous consent that an article from a local publication extolling the work of Mr. Watson be printed in the Record. Since this article was published, Watson has built more than 7,000 birdhouses and raised $140,000 in proceeds for Kentucky veterans. In addition, he placed third in an arts-and-crafts competition at the Kentucky State Fair in 2010.  Mr. Arnold Lee Watson's dedication and hard work not only helped Letcher County raise the most funds across the State, but also provided Kentucky veterans with the support and benefits they deserve.  ``He loves working on them,'' Meade said of Watson in regard to building the license plate birdhouses.  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in the Record, as follows:                [From the Mountain Eagle, Jan. 21, 2009]                      Turning Old Plates into $$$                            (By Sally Barto)       If old newspapers can be used to line birdcages, then old      license plates can be used to build birdhouses--about five a      day, in the case of one Letcher County man.       Arnold Lee Watson has been building birdhouses using old      license plates as a roof, then selling them to raise money      for the Veterans Program Trust Fund on behalf of the Letcher      County Clerk's Office.       Watson, of McRoberts, is the father in-law of Letcher      County Clerk Winston Meade. He decided to begin building the      unique and colorful birdhouses after Meade attended a meeting      of the Kentucky County Clerks Association and brought home      two similar birdhouses that were made elsewhere.       Watson has made about 50 birdhouses so far and the clerk's      office has sold 19, with proceeds going to the Help a Veteran      Everyday, or H.A.V.E. program.       Meade said Watson, who has three brothers who are veterans,      donates the materials and time used to make the birdhouses.       ``He wanted to do something to help veterans and this is      his way to help,'' said Meade.       The birdhouses, which are being sold for $20 each, are made      to resemble a mailbox and have a painted wooden base with an      old license plate draped over the top.       Depending on the specialty license plates obtained by      Meade, the roofs of the birdhouses have different themes      including nature, colleges, and volunteer fire fighting.      Meade said the most popular style of birdhouse is made using      an old University of Kentucky license plate.       Meade has traveled to several counties looking for unique      plates to use for making more birdhouses. People can donate      old plates to the clerk's office for the birdhouse project.       Selling license plate birdhouses is the latest effort by      Meade's office to raise money for the H.A.V.E. program. All      money raised through H.A.V.E., created by the Kentucky County      Clerk's Association, goes to the Kentucky Veterans Program      Trust Fund. The trust fund, established by the Kentucky      General Assembly in 1988, helps support projects and programs      for Kentucky veterans.       The Homeless Veterans Transitional Treatment program in      Lexington was established with funds from the trust. Money      from the fund was also used to purchase 10 vans for the      Disabled American Veterans organization, to purchase land for      a state veterans cemetery, and to enhance state veterans'      nursing homes.       ``Every penny is spent on the veterans,'' said Meade.      ``None of it is spent on salaries or anything like that.''       Meade was named 2008 clerk of the year for the H.A.V.E.      program for his efforts of raising money for the program.       ``This county has raised more money for the H.A.V.E. fund      than any other county in the state,'' said Meade. ``I was      real honored to receive this. I give the girls in the office      the credit for the funds they have raised for H.A.V.E.''       The clerk's office hosted a golf scramble at Raven Rock      Golf Course in September in which funds raised from the      scramble were used to finance a Christmas party for the East      Kentucky Veterans' Center in Hazard. During that time, the      center served seven residents from Letcher County.       When people purchase the veterans' specialty license plate,      $5 of the cost of the plate goes into the H.A.V.E. fund. The      clerk's office also welcomes cash donations to H.A.V.E.       ``This is one way to give back and to thank (veterans) for      what they have done for us,'' said Meade.                          ____________________
