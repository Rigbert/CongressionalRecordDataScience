President, it is disheartening to be back on the floor of the Senate again to talk about the looming humanitarian catastrophe in the Darfur region of Sudan. Despite the partial peace agreement signed in May between the Sudanese Government and one rebel faction, the 3-year civil warin Darfur has intensified in recent months. By any account, the situation is rapidly deteriorating.  Today, Darfur faces a more complex and brutal environment where rebel groups have splintered, and one has joined forces with the Sudanese Army, strengthening jingaweit militias that have long used rape, murder and mayhem to gain control of the region.  On August 28, Sudanese Government forces launched a major offensive in Darfur to finish off any opposing rebels, in direct violation of the Darfur Peace Agreement and cease-fire accord. As a result, tens of thousands more civilians have been forcibly displaced, bringing the total to more than 2 million people. And, of course, for those who have been displaced, disease and dysentery are rampant, causing the death rate to increase.  Relief organizations that have not already left the region face near impossible hurdles to reach hundreds of thousands of desperate people in need of food, water, and medical attention who are also vulnerable to the intensifying and indiscriminate aerial bombings. It is a scene straight out of Hell.  The well-intentioned, 7,000-member African Union peacekeeping force is understaffed, under-equipped, and has been unable to stop the violence in Darfur. The fact is they don't even have the communications, airlift, mobility, or support that most military would have. Estimates of the number of people who have died from war and disease in Darfur range as high as 450,000. That is 75 percent of the population of my own State of Vermont.  The United Nations Security Council adopted Resolution 1706 that would replace the African Union force with a much larger U.N. force empowered to protect civilians. The Sudanese Government not only rejected the resolution but demanded that the African Union withdraw from the country after its mandate expires at the end of this month.  While the United Nations, the African Union, and most of the international community are united in support of a larger U.N. peacekeeping force, the government in Khartoum has repeatedly refused. I think they probably fear that the U.N. can pose a challenge to its own ability to act with impunity and its own ability to carry out murder and mass extinction of people.  It is ludicrous that a lone despot, Sudan's President Omar Hassan al-Bashir, can obstruct the deployment of a U.N. peacekeeping force to stop genocide from continuing in his country. He has even gone so far as to threaten to attack any U.N. force that enters Sudan. This is a man who has made it very clear he supports the genocide and will try to stop anybody who wants to bring a halt to it.  Despite the Bush administration's diplomatic efforts in pressing for urgent international intervention to ease the Darfur crisis, China and Russia managed to thwart passage of a stronger U.N. Security Council resolution. And on August 20, the Arab League Committee on Sudan backed the Sudanese President's refusal of a U.N. peacekeeping force. They further distanced themselves from any responsibility for the situation in Darfur. It is amazing. People are dying. People are being killed. They are being raped. They are being murdered. They are being starved and they are dying of all kinds of diseases. Nobody takes responsibility. All the forces that can do something about it--Russia, China, the Arab League, Sudan itself, that could stop this--wash their hands of it.  The diplomatic inertia on Darfur is illustrative of just how much America's credibility and influence has eroded in the eyes of the world, largely because of our misguided policy in Iraq. We can't threaten anybody. We can't cajole anybody. We have lost our credibility. We have squandered the trust and confidence of our allies, particularly those in the Arab world, and now the administration's leverage with which to solve other regional and global crises has weakened. Darfur is one example. The impasse over Iran's nuclear program is another.  It is tragic how much damage this administration's policies have caused to America's leadership on so many issues that require the cooperation and support of other nations. The price in Darfur is an emboldened Sudanese regime that has managed to defy U.S. diplomatic pressure and the deaths of thousands of innocent people. Urgent and immediate action is essential to save Darfur from further catastrophe.  First, the President will today finally appoint a Presidential Special Envoy to Sudan. Many of us here, myself included, called for the designation of a Special Envoy for Sudan for months, so this long overdue decision is welcome.  Secondly, although the African Union troops are too few and lightly equipped to stop the violence, they are serving as witnesses for the rest of the world at a time when the government in Khartoum commits atrocities and makes it more difficult for humanitarian organizations and journalists to operate.  The United States and other nations must continue to support the African Union until a U.N. peacekeeping force is deployed, knowing that could take 4 to 6 months.  There should be no doubt that our first priority is to get U.N. peacekeepers on the ground as soon as possible. But in the interim, if African Union troops are forced to leave at the end of September, the last line of protection will be lost and an even worse period of lawlessness and slaughter will begin.  Third, the administration should call upon the European Union and United Nations Security Council to impose financial, travel, and diplomatic sanctions against the Sudanese leadership, rebel forces, and others responsible for the atrocities in Darfur.  Fourth, we must increase diplomatic pressure on countries friendly to Khartoum--particularly Russia, China, members of the Arab League--to use their influence to convince Sudan to support a United Nations peacekeeping force. If they don't, Russia, China, and members of the Arab League also have to bear complicity for genocide. Unfortunately, these are the same countries where our own influence has weakened dramatically over the past 5 years.  Fifth, the administration should urge all United Nations member states to accelerate implementation of Security Council Resolution 1706 for the deployment of U.N. peacekeepers to Darfur. The White House should be working vigorously to persuade other countries to commit troops and funds for the U.N. force.  Finally, in circumstances such as these, the United Nations should be empowered to deploy troops to prevent the mass murder of civilians, irrespective of stubborn, self-serving opposition of the government of the country.  When a country's corrupt, abusive leader, lacking any legitimate mandate from the people, flagrantly violates U.N. resolutions and a cease-fire agreement and embarks on a scorched Earth campaign which threatens the lives of countless innocent people, the U.N. should be able to go in.  If Darfur was not in Africa but it was in Europe, we would have responded differently. Although belated, our response, as the leader of NATO, to the ethnic cleansing in the former Yugoslavia put a quick end to that ethnic cleansing.  Darfur is on a different continent, but the forcefulness of our response to genocide should not depend on where genocide occurs or the race or ethnicity or nationality of the victims. Human beings are dying, irrespective of their color or their ethnicity or their nationality. The United States should stand up and do all we can to stop genocide.  I have no illusions about the difficulties of ending this conflict, nor do I question the sincerity of those who tried. But the efforts so far have been woefully inadequate. The situation calls for more intensive, sustained, high-level attention than our country and other countries have provided so far. It is genocide whether it is White people or Black people, whether it is Europeans or Africans. Genocide is genocide.  I yield the floor.                          ____________________[Pages S9692-S9693]From the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]                   HUMANITARIAN CATASTROPHE IN DARFUR
