 REID. First of all, I literally mean that. I don't know what States they are from. I don't know whether the Senators are Democrats, Republicans, States with both. We have not let that stand in our way in the past with district court judges, but there may be somebody who doesn't like one of them for some reason. You know how things go around here. I can't imagine it would be all of them.  Mr. McCONNELL. I would ask my friend further, are district judges now controversial, too, particularly those who have been reported out of the committee and been on the calendar for 6 weeks or so?
