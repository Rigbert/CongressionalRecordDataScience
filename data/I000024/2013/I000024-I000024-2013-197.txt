President, first of all, the idea that we would have to go to the international body to decide whether we would trade arms with Israel is pretty disgusting. I want to make sure everyone understands. This is the first time--probably the last time this year that we are going to have a chance, an opportunity to vote for our second amendment rights. I think my colleagues should take advantage of it.
