 Can you imagine how many decent paying jobs we could create right here at home rebuilding our economy, both the public sector and the private sector, if we had loan guarantees right here. But apparently, uplifting the poor people of America--I always get a kick, I get a kick out of hearing how good it would be for our economy if we can improve the standard of living of Mexican workers. I happen to be very strongly pro-Mexican and very concerned about the problems and the poverty that exists in Mexico, and we all want to uplift the Mexican people.  But how ironic that that same argument is not used here in the United States of America. Fourteen percent of our people live in poverty. Now maybe if we invested in a jobs program, maybe if we rebuilt our cities and towns and our infrastructure and provided decent jobs for our people and uplifted them, maybe they would also be able to purchase the goods and services that right now corporate America wants to sell to Mexico.  But apparently that is a very, very radical idea to suggest that we might want to uplift the poor people in America rather than the poor people in Mexico.  Mr. DeFAZIO. Did not the gentleman identify an article yesterday that said that because of the economic straits that our country is in that we are going to have to lower the loan guarantees made available to small businesses in this country?
