Chairman, I am prepared to accept this amendment, but I think it needs a little bit of work on it. I am concerned about the drafting and application of the provision and am concerned about what might be construed as, quote, personally identifiable information of a person who is under age 18.  The amendment requires clarification of these issues, but I am willing to work with my colleague on this amendment to possibly modify or clarify the language at a conference later on. So I am prepared to accept the amendment and hope that it passes.
