Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.  Mr. Speaker, H.R. 1550, the U.S. Fire Administration Authorization Act of 1999 reauthorizes training, research, data collection and analysis, and public education programs at the United States Fire Administration, which includes the National Fire Academy. It was passed out of the Committee on Science by a voice vote on April 29, 1999.  This year marks the 25th anniversary of the Fire Prevention and Control Act establishing the Fire Administration. Since its formation in 1974, the Fire Administration has played an important role in reducing the loss of life and property from fire. These declines can be traced in part to research sponsored by the USFA that led to affordable smoke detectors and its work in promoting sprinkler systems.  Recently, many in the fire-fighting community have begun questioning the value of a Fire Administration that appears to have lost its way. These concerns were raised in the recent Blue Ribbon Panel report that identified a number of deficiencies that have undermined the agency's effectiveness.  The Committee on Science shares these concerns and is dedicated to assuring that the report's recommendation, which reflect the consensus of the fire-services community, are implemented in H.R. 1550. This is the first step to getting the Fire Administration back on track, especially in research.  The bill provides a significant increase in funding, authorizing a total of $95.6 million over fiscal years 2000 and 2001. Of this amount, $5.2 million has been set aside for research, $500,000 for outsourcing of data analysis, and $14 million for antiterrorism training.  The bill also requires the Fire Administration to certify that funds obligated in fiscal year 2001 are consistent with the strategic plan required in section 3 of the bill.  The strategic plan provision of the bill matches closely the language's strategic plans in the Government Performance and Results Act. Additional elements of the plan include coordination with other Federal agencies, especially the Department of Defense; a plan for disseminating information and materials to State and local fire services; and an assessment of the use of the Internet in delivering training courses.  In addition to the increased authorization for research funding, the bill also requires the Fire Administration to establish research priorities and to develop a plan for implementing a research agenda.  The bill also directs the Fire Administration to make available the State and local fire and emergency services information on excess Federal equipment and on setting up cooperative agreements with Federal facilities, such as military bases; conduct an assessment on the need for additional counterterrorism training for emergency responders; review the content and delivery of the curriculum offered by the National Fire Academy; and to post abstracts of research grants it awards on its Internet homepage.  In addition, H.R. 1550 repeals obsolete sections of the Fire Administration statute. It also repeals, as of 1 year after enactment, a provision in law that exempts Federally-funded housing built in New York City from sprinkler requirements.                              {time}  1500  Before closing, Mr. Speaker, I want to commend the gentleman from Michigan (Mr. Smith), chairman of the Subcommittee on Basic Research of the Committee on Science, and the gentlewoman from Texas (Ms. Eddie Bernice Johnson), who is the rankingminority member of the subcommittee, for all their hard work in producing a balanced bill that will rejuvenate and strengthen the Fire Administration. It is a bill that deserves broad bipartisan support. I urge its passage.  Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.
