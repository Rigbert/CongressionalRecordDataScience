Madam Speaker, last week Congressman Trent Franks and I had an important meeting with Reis Emeritus Dr. Mustafa Ceric, the former Grand Mufti of the Islamic community of Bosnia-Herzegovina.  Dr. Ceric is internationally recognized and renowned as a man of peace, a leader in interreligious dialogue. For example, in 2008, he led the Muslim delegation to the Catholic-Islamic Forum,and he did that kind of work on many, many occasions.  Last week, we talked about Bosnia since the conflict and the genocide of the 1990s, about where Bosnia is today and where it needs to go.                              {time}  2045  I would like to share with my colleagues what Reis Ceric had to say. Dr. Ceric briefed and updated us on Bosnia's struggle to hold itself together, build its economy, and integrate into NATO and the European Union.  He talked about a country where, 19 years after Srebrenica and the horrific genocide that occurred there and the Dayton Peace Accords, ethnic divisions remain strong and, in many ways, have hardened as a generation has grown up in a system that classifies people into one of three ethnic communities--Bosniak, Serb, or Croat--and in a system that diminishes the rights of anyone that doesn't belong to one of those communities, including Jews and Roma.  In Bosnia today, only ethnic Bosniaks, Serbs, and Croats can be elected to the legislature--the House of Peoples--or to the Presidency. This structurally-embedded discrimination is a legacy of the Dayton Peace Accords brokered under American watch.  While this design was probably necessary at the time to stop the genocide and aggression, in today's time and expanding Europe, it clearly violates our basic values of freedom and equality.  As a result, in Bosnia today, all persons are not equal and--based on race, religion, and ethnicity--entire segments of the population are excluded from full political participation.  The Dayton Peace Accords were a tourniquet to end the genocidal conflict in 1995. However, that is all they were really intended to be. Dayton was never intended to operate as Bosnia's Constitution, certainly not for 19 years.  As a result of Dayton's severe limitations on its democracy, Bosnia cannot be fully integrated into Euro-Atlantic structures. Without amending the Dayton Accords to respect basic human rights and political rights of one person-one vote, Bosnia will never even be a candidate for the European Union.  So a question mark hangs over Bosnia's future, as ethnic activists continue to agitate to partition the country and threaten daily to secede, taking large swaths of ethnically-cleansed territories with them. Such action might lead to a revival of hostilities.  What further aggravates the condition is a sustained campaign of mischaracterization and outright denial of genocide by some government officials of the Republika Srpska, the smaller of Bosnia's two entities.  Milorad Dodik, the President of the Republika Srpska, is publicly calling for the naming of public squares, roads, and boulevards after indicted war criminals such as Ratko Mladic and Radovan Karadzic; yet Dayton provides no mechanism by which Bosnia, Madam Speaker, can be fully democratized.  Significant leadership by Bosnian leaders is going to be absolutely necessary to break through the stalemate created by ethnic interests, and, of course, the United States must do its part to ensure that the Bosnian dream of a robust democracy, respect for the fundamental human rights, and rule of law is reached. I respectfully submit that delay is denial and that the Bosnians deserve better.  Madam Speaker, the United States has a special responsibility to Bosnia. We could have done more for them in the 1990s. I know, I was here.  I held hearing after hearing, traveled to the former Yugoslavia repeatedly, joined by other colleagues like Frank Wolf, trying to get this country to stand up and assist those who were being victimized by an invasion; instead, we left it to the Europeans in the 1990s, and, unfortunately, it was a train wreck.  We could have lifted the arms embargo on Bosnia earlier, which may have prevented the genocide.  I would note, parenthetically, that I was the sponsor of legislation to lift the egregiously-flawed arms embargo that hindered both the Croats' and the Bosnians' ability to defend against aggression.  Only after the tragic and preventable Srebrenica genocide in early July 1995--and thanks to the leadership of some of us in the House and Senate--did our government swing into action and broker the peace deal.  Bosnians, Madam Speaker, of every ethnicity and faith look to the United States to help move the country forward. I agree with Reis Ceric that, without American leadership and help to evolve the Dayton Accords toward a democratic constitution, the situation will likely fester and get worse.  Madam Speaker, in the 1990s, throughout the darkness of the Balkan war, Reis Ceric was a powerful, persistent, reasonable, and dynamic voice for peace, human rights, the rule of law, and accountability for genocide.  Reis Ceric is a good friend of mine and truly an inspiring man of God.                       Tax-Payer-Funded Abortion
