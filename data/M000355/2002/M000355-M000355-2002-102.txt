 President, we are very close to completing this bill. By invoking cloture we are going to be shut out of an opportunity to offer a few more amendments, just a handful as the Republican leader has indicated, that need to be considered. On the liability question, we have a clear letter from the administration indicating that if we don't deal with that properly, this bill will not become law. I do not think any of us believe, at this already late stage of the session, we ought to be clogging up legislative days with exercises in futility. So there are a couple more amendments on the liability issue that need to be voted upon.  I strongly urge our colleagues to vote against cloture and then let the Republican leader and the Democratic leader talk about how we can wrap this bill up in short order.
