 Nevertheless, having put the Iraq issue back before the Senate, there are a number of members of my conference, many of whom have been to Iraq recently, who were anxious to discuss the undeniable progress that has occurred in Iraq over the last 6 months.  We had a good discussion yesterday. I have more members who would like to continue the discussion today.
