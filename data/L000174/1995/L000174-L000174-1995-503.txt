President, I join as a cosponsor of this amendment and commend my colleagues for their leadership. Just last year, Senator Thurmond and I proposed an amendment along the same lines to promote consumer availability of converter boxes. We were delighted when our colleagues from Maine took up the fight and previously noted our support when they appeared before the Antitrust Subcommittee earlier this year.  This amendment seeks to encourage consumer options and competition. It uses regulatory authority only as a last resort when competition is not working, when consumer choice is not available, and where the private sector and the marketplace fail to develop standards that ensure competition. It is, of course, our hope that this regulatory authority never need be exercised.
