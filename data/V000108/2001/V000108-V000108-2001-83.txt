Speaker, it is with great pleasure and high regard that I congratulate a very special group of women within Indiana's First Congressional District. On Friday, November 9, 2001, the members of Church Women United of Gary, Indiana will be holding their Recognition Dinner at Turkey Creek Banquet Facilities in Merrillville, Indiana.  Church Women United is a national ecumenical movement of Christian women whose life centers around prayer, Bible study, advocacy and action. Founded in 1951, Church Women United is organized in over 1,400 local and state units in the United States and Puerto Rico.  The members of Church Women United are Protestant, Roman Catholic, Orthodox and other Christian women who are called by the Holy Spirit to act for justice on behalf of women and children throughout the global community. Biblically based through their shared Christian faith, the women are gifted by their diversity of race, economics, age, culture and theology.  Church Women United brings Christian women together for spiritual nourishment and faith based advocacy. The Church Women United local and state units are active in a broad spectrum of community ministries, including prison ministries, food pantries, tutoring and child care, and job skills training. On a national level, Church Women United works in coalition with partner groups around common issues and concerns.  On Friday, the Gary Chapter of Church Women United will honor all of its past presidents for their devotion to Christianity. Those being honored include: Clara Guster Nicholson, elected in 1971; Mary Glidewell, elected in 1980; Mynette Cope, elected in 1987; Maxine Watts Levels, elected in 1992; Velma Richardson, elected in 1996; Susie Threatt, elected in 1999; and current president, Madlyn C. Adams, elected in 2001. These women have come together in fellowship to witness to their faith in Jesus Christ and, enabled by the Holy Spirit, to go out together in every neighborhood as instruments of reconciling love.  Mr. Speaker, I ask you and my other distinguished colleagues to join me in congratulating the past presidents of Church Women United of Gary, Indiana for their strong commitment to social justice, to human rights, to civil rights and to the welfare and benefit of women and children so that all may flourish.                          ____________________
