Res. 285       Whereas the personal exemption allowance is a vital      component of trade and tourism;       Whereas many border communities and retailers depend on      customers from both sides of the border;       Whereas an United States citizen traveling to Canada or      Mexico for less than 24 hours is exempt from paying duties on      the equivalent of $200 worth of merchandise on return to the      United States, and for trips over 48 hours United States      citizens have an exemption of up to $400 worth of      merchandise;       Whereas a Canadian traveling in the United States is      allowed a duty-free personal exemption allowance of only $50      worth of merchandise for a 24-hour visit, the equivalent of      $200 worth of merchandise for a 48-hour visit, and the      equivalent of $750 worth of merchandise for a visit of over 7      days;       Whereas Mexico has a 2-tiered personal exemption allowance      for its returning residents, set at the equivalent of $50      worth of merchandise for residents returning by car and the      equivalent of $300 worth of merchandise for residents      returning by plane;       Whereas Canadian and Mexican retail businesses have an      unfair competitive advantage over many American businesses      because of the disparity between the personal exemption      allowances among the 3 countries;       Whereas the State of Maine legislature passed a resolution      urging action on this matter;       Whereas the disparity in personal exemption allowances      creates a trade barrier by making it difficult for Canadians      and Mexicans to shop in American-owned stores without facing      high additional costs;       Whereas the United States entered into the North American      Free Trade Agreement with Canada and Mexico with the intent      of phasing out tariff barriers among the 3 countries; and       Whereas it violates the spirit of the North American Free      Trade Agreement for Canada and Mexico to maintain restrictive      personal exemption allowance policies that are not      reciprocal: Now, therefore, be it       Resolved, That it is the sense of the Senate that--       (1) the United States Trade Representative and the      Secretary of the Treasury, in consultation with the Secretary      of Commerce, should initiate discussions with officials of      the Governments of Canada and Mexico to achieve parity with      respect to the personal exemption allowance structure; and       (2) in the event that parity with respect to the personal      exemption allowance of the 3 countries is not reached within      1 year after the date of the adoption of this resolution,     the United States Trade Representative and the Secretary of      the Treasury should submit recommendations to Congress on      whether legislative changes are necessary to lower the United      States personal exemption allowance to conform to the      allowance levels established in the other countries that are      parties to the North American Free Trade Agreement.
