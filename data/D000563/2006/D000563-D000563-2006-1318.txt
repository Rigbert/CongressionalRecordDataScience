President, if the Senator will yield for a question, I understand the Senator's explanation, and I have to go back to a point that I think if he would clarify his language in his amendment, it would allay some of the fears we have.  Let me give an example of why we are concerned. In the original Cornyn-Kyl bill that was introduced, it was a question about the ineligibility of aliens, or deferred mandatory departure, or a similar circumstance where they would not be recognized and given this opportunity. Your language in that instance said it would be an alien who would be ``ordered, excluded, deported, removed or to depart voluntarily from the United States.''  There was specificity there. The decision had been made. I think that is a lot clearer and more consistent with the explanation you have given us than the words ``subject to a final order'' which I think is much more general in scope and perhaps too broad, maybe leading to my conclusion that may not be consistent with your intent.  I ask you if you would consider tightening your language here as you did in the original bill with Senator Cornyn so we know exactly what we are dealing with.
