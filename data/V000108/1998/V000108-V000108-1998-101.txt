Speaker, it is my distinct pleasure to commend to true sportsman from Indiana's First Congressional District, Ted Karras, Sr., for his induction into the Indiana Football Hall of Fame. A resident of Gary, Indiana, Ted is one of nineteen inductees in the 1998 Indiana Football Hall of Fame class.  Ted Karras began his role as an important part of Indiana's football legacy during his days as a student at Emerson High School in Gary, Indiana. After graduating from Emerson and attending Purdue University for a semester, Ted transferred to Indiana University and played for Coach Bernie Crimmins. In 1956, Ted graduated from I.U. and joined the San Diego Marines where he played both offense and defense.  Ted's hard work and determination payed dividends when he was subsequently picked up by the Pittsburgh Steelers as an offensive linemen, and he helped his team to a second place finish during the 1957 season. After his short tenure with the Steelers, Ted Karras was signed by the Chicago Bears and played with them for five years. His determination and motivation again helped lead his team to success. This time though, the Chicago Bears won the championship in 1963. Ted eventually finished his career with the Detroit Lions in 1965.  While Ted Karras may have retired as a player, he never retired as a student of the game. Ted came home to Northwest Indiana and shared his knowledge with other students of the game. He remains heavily involved in football and helps mold young athletes into sportsmen as an Assistant Football Coach at Andrean High School in Merrillville, Indiana. From the beginning of his football career as a young student and athlete to his current post as an assistant coach, Ted Karras, Sr. has served as an inspiration to thousands of students, fans, and players of football in the State of Indiana.  Since its founding in 1973, the Indiana Football Hall of Fame has been honoring prominent coaches, players, officials members of the press, and citizens who have made lasting contributions to the advancement of football and sporting excellence. The Hall of Fame commemorates Indiana's prestigious football history throughout the century. Whether they were involved in football during the early twenties or the present day, the Indiana Football Hall of Fame is dedicated to recognizing those who were instrumental in creating, fostering, and adding to Indiana's excellent football legacy.  Mr. Speaker, I ask you and my other distinguished colleagues to join me in commending Ted Karras, Sr. on his induction into the Indiana Football Hall of Fame. His lifetime of service, dedication, and success has left an indelible mark on Indiana football and Indiana's First Congressional District.                          ____________________
