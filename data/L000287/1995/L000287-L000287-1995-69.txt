Mr. Speaker, I rise today to express my concern over Monday's Supreme Court decision on affirmative action. I believe this ruling sends the wrong message.  I believe there is no justification in diminishing the power of the Federal Government in building a diverse workplace and ensuring opportunity for all Americans.  Mr. Speaker, the American people should know that affirmative action does not promote unqualified people and firms into jobs and institutions. Instead, it has provided minorities and women equal access to education, jobs, and contracts.  Affirmative action is an important tool to address the persistent dilemma of racial and gender inequality and discrimination. Now more than ever before, we need affirmative action because the scars and stains of racism and bigotry are still deeply embedded in the American society. We cannot go back and we must not go back.                          ____________________
