 As we engage in measures designed to strengthen exports, at the same time Congress must continue to provide assistance to those whose jobs may be lost in the process. We need to do whatever we can to help get our people back to work and safeguard American jobs.  I urge a vote in favor of the trade adjustment assistance. That will be the last item we will consider. And I indicate my support of all three of the agreements.  In May of '07, we made definite progress with Mr. Levin's leadership and the leadership in a bipartisan way of saying workers' rights were going to be recognized in these agreements. In my view, that is the case in these three agreements. Are they perfect? I think no agreement is ever perfect. But do they move us in a position where the United States will be better able to make it in America and sell it abroad? I think they do; and, therefore, I will support these agreements.  I thank the gentleman for yielding me the additional minute.
