Speaker, I thank the gentlewoman for yielding me time.  Mr. Speaker, I rise in opposition to the rule and the conference report. Those who were here who remember the timber salvage rider, or those who were here in support of the timber salvage rider, one of the worse environmental votes of recent Congresses, and in fact something that was even disastrous for the industry that promoted it because of the backlash, will love this bill. Because this bill is rife with special interest, antienvironment riders, in addition to a rider which effectively repeals the ban on the export of Federal logs.  That is right, we are now going to supply the Japanese with logs from ourFederal lands. There is deep denial on the part of a few who promoted this amendment, particularly our colleague from Washington State, but that is true. I will read later from a report which documents that.  It has a provision that would prevent the Forest Service from updating and revising its forest management plans. No matter which side of the forest debate you are on, you should be opposed to that provision. Even if you want higher harvest on the Federal lands, you would freeze in place the current regime. You will not update the plans. You will fall in conflict with other Federal laws.  It overturns a court injunction against the Forest Service on one-half of the grazing leases on 11 southwestern national forests. It has a provision delaying the completion of the Pacific Northwest interior Columbia ecosystem management process, which may well put us again in conflict with the Endangered Species Act and bring more court injunctions against activities in the Pacific Northwest. It has a provision preventing the reintroduction of grizzly bears into the Bitter-root ecosystem and on and on.  Also, for the first time, it takes land and water conservation funds and not acquiring lands that we need to protect the wildlife of this country, sensitive wetlands and others that are threatened with development, taking things from the huge list of backlogs and land and water conservation funds. No. It gives $10 million to Humboldt County in the district of the gentleman from California [Mr. Riggs], and $12 million for a road maintenance fund in Montana for the gentleman from Montana [Mr. Hill], and $10 million to the State of Montana in terms of Federal mineral holdings. Why? To offset the impact of actual land water conservation purchases promoted by the administration for the headwaters area and in the new world mine.  These are payoffs, these are unprecedented, and a very, very bad use, and an unauthorized use of land and water conservation funds, but they are protected by the rule, as are these other unauthorized provisions in this bill.  But the worst and least understood provision is one that the Department of Agriculture's own inspector general, despite what some here will protest, who are apologists for the log exporters, say, and I quote, ``They will effectively gut the 1990 law banning the export of unprocessed logs from National Forests in the West.''  Let me repeat that. Effectively gut the 1990 law. She goes on to say? Her opinion, it would basically make enforcement dependent upon voluntary compliance, voluntary compliance, when there are millions of dollars to be made by diverting these scarce Federal resources into export to the Japanese, who do not harvest a single log. Fifteen thousand mills operating in Japan, 350 struggling to operate in the Pacific Northwest.  And, guess what? They do not cut any trees. Why? Because we give them the logs. And under this bill we will give them more logs and they will come off of our Federal lands. It will increase pressure on those Federal lands.  This is a horrible provision, a horrible precedent. Again, the apologists will say, no, we are just fussing it up a little bit. These 12 pages that we put in there, these provisions that the inspector general says will gut the law, they will not really gut the law; do not worry about it, or we will fix the problems later. Not a single hearing was held in the House or Senate by the authorizing committees. Not a single hearing. No discussion on things previously stuck in by the Senate. We are being told we cannot control the Senate.                              {time}  1015  Two Senators from Washington State and one Representative from Washington State are particularly promoting this provision. Again, they are denying the reality of it. We have the opposition of 60 national and local environmental groups to the provisions of this bill; we have the opposition of the National Carpenter's Union to this bill.  Mr. Speaker, I include for the Record these statements in opposition.  The material referred to is as follows:                                  United Brotherhood of Carpenters                                       and Joiners of America,                                Washington, DC, September 4, 1997.     Representative Peter A. DeFazio,     U.S. House of Representatives, Rayburn House Office Bldg.,          Washington, DC.       Dear Representative DeFazio. The United Brotherhood of      Carpenters and Joiners has always supported a ban on the      export of raw, unprocessed timber from public lands. In      response to our calls and those of American workers across      the country, Congress approved a ban in 1990. Recently,      language was inserted into the Senate FY 1998 Interior      Appropriations bill that weakens this bill.       Through the practice of substitution, log exporters can      export private, unprocessed timber while buying public timber      to make up for the shortfall caused by their own exports.      This practice was restricted in the 1990 legislation and any      attempts to weaken it should be opposed.       The current Senate rider impacts the anti-substitution      aspects of the law. These substitution limitations were      included to prevent companies from circumventing the intent      of the law by exporting private raw logs and then buying      public timber to substitute for the exported logs. This      policy was set to encourage companies to make a choice,      within any given ``sourcing area,'' between supplying their      mills with federal timber or exporting private, unprocessed      timber, not both.       The rider would alter the definition of these geographic      sourcing areas and render the anti-substitution rules      ineffective. The high economic value of these logs and the      growing practice of transporting them long distances, between      sourcing areas, have diluted the sourcing area limitations.      This, along with the Senate rider will make it possible for      companies to more easily export raw logs and purchase and      process public timber.       Workers suffer when raw logs are exported. Not only do we      lose the commodity itself, we lose the manufacturing jobs      that turn the raw logs into lumber used for construction and      other value-added activities like furniture making.       Representative Peter DeFazio is circulating a letter to      President Clinton and the Interior Appropriations Conferees      urging them to oppose this weakening of the 1990 log export      ban. On behalf of the 500,000 members of the Carpenters      Union, I ask you to add your signature to this very      worthwhile request.           Sincerely,                                              Douglas J. McCarron,     General President.                                  ____                                                September 5, 1997.     President Bill Clinton,     The White House, Pennsylvania Avenue NW, Washington, DC.       Dear Mr. President: We urge you to oppose any amendments      that may be included in the fiscal year 1998 Interior and      Related Agencies Appropriations bill that would weaken the      1990 law banning log exports from federal and state lands in      the West, or otherwise prevent the Forest Service from      property enforcing the export ban.       As you know, in 1990 Congress overwhelmingly approved a      permanent ban on the export of unprocessed timber from      National Forests, Bureau of Land Management and state-owned      lands in the Western United States. An important part of that      law prohibits a log exporting company from purchasing federal      timber for its mills as a replacement for private timber the      company is exporting. This practice, known as      ``substitution,'' is little more than the backdoor export of      federal timber.       A Washington State trade group representing the interests      of large exporting firms is attempting to significantly      weaken the 1990 law. The group has asked members of the House      and Senate Appropriations Committees to support an amendment      that would make it legal for a company to purchase federal      timber as a direct substitute for private timber the company      is exporting. Apparently, the Forest Service has drafted an      amendment aimed at satisfying the log export lobby's      concerns.       Every log exported from the Pacific Northwest increases the      economic and political pressure to log the region's federal      forests. The Northwest Forest Plan is already under severe      stresses and strains from attacks from the timber industry      and the 104th Congress. Overcutting federal lands resulted in      wild salmon and ancient forest dependent wildlife headed for      extinction. Now is not the time to allow for a backdoor to      open for cutting down the forests owned by U.S. citizens.       The ban on log exports from public lands enjoys      overwhelming support in the Pacific Northwest. Not only is      export ban hugely popular, it is critical to the health of      the Northwest's forest ecosystems. We urge you to defend the      integrity of the 1990 log export ban by insisting that the      total prohibition on federal and state log exports continue      and that the Forest Service property implement the ban on      substitution.

Mr. Speaker, there are also a number of mills in the Pacific Northwest, including Boise Cascade, and 20 small independent companies in Oregon and Washington, who oppose the log export provisions.  Again, who supports it? Five very powerful large log exporting companies led by Weyerhauser in Washington State, two U.S. Senators from the State of Washington, and our colleague, the gentleman from Washington. That is about it. Those are the people who are promoting this, overturning the intent of Congress, a long-standing Federal law that says we are not going to take our logs and export them from Federal lands to a country, Japan, which does not harvest any trees of its own, and does not allow freely our finished products into its markets; no tariffs on our logs, but big tariffs and barriers on our finished wood products.  This is not a minor technical revision in the law. Again, according to the Department of Agriculture's inspector general, it will force the forests to rely on the voluntary compliance of timber exporters in order to enforce the ban. The ban will still stand, but they will not be able to enforce it. In fact, the IG's office states that this provision would allow exporters to directly export Federal timber, in the full knowledge that their chances of getting caught are near zero.  Mr. Speaker, I include for the Record the opinion of the inspector general from the Department of Agriculture into the Record, Ms. Rebecca Batts, director of the Rural Development and Natural Resources Division of the Department of Agriculture's IG office.  The material referred to is as follows:Review of the Forest Resources Conservation and Shortage Relief Act of                                   1997       As requested by Jim Lyons, I have reviewed Title VI, H.R.      2107. I was requested to provide the quickest possible      assessment, as the bill is currently in conference.      Therefore, this evaluation reflects my preliminary      conclusions only and does not reflect an ``in-depth''      assessment of the myriad factors that could affect      implementation.       Implementation of the proposed bill will effectively gut      the ``Forst Resources Conservation and Shortage Relief Act of      1990.'' In essence, that act prohibited export of unprocessed      logs harvested on Federal land and established limitations on      the ability of an exporter to substitute unprocessed Federal      timber for unprocessed timber exported from private lands.      The amendments currently under consideration allow some      direct substitution in Washington State, west of the Colville      National Forest, the area where we have been told that most      of the exports originate. A person could acquire federal      timber, and, in the same area, export private timber if the      timber originates from land he does not own or have an      exclusive right to harvest timber for more than seven years.      The Act also would allow a purchaser of federal timber to      export private timber immediately after disposal of federal      timber, without regard to the calendar year restriction      currently in place. Under current law, this would have been      deemed substitution. Further, the Act subjects certain basic      internal controls (e.g., log branding and record keeping) to      a cost-benefit test that may make restrictions difficult or      impossible to enforce. Without these basic internal controls,      the risk of commingling federal and non-federal timber      escalates dramatically. With comingling comes an increased      opportunity to divert non-export logs into the export market.       Enforcement of proposed bill will be so difficult that the      Department will be dependent on the voluntary compliance of      timber purchasers, exporters, and mills. Regulations      developed to implement the current law were suspended by      Congress, in part because of the perceived adverse effect on      the Western Forests Products industry. The suspended      regulations included key internal controls to enable the      Department to enforce the ban on export or substitution. The      controls were not significantly different than many currently      in place as part of Forest timber theft prevention plans. For      example, the suspended regulations required branding and      painting of federal timber and reporting information about      transactions involving federal timber.       The proposed law subjects the key controls of timber      marking and reporting to a cost/benefit analysis--perhaps      making it more difficult for the Forest Service to establish      these controls which are specifically aimed at the detection      of non-compliance. In essence, it will be necessary to      demonstrate the existence of violations to obtain support for      implementation of the controls. However, demonstrating      violation will be nearly impossible, as the controls to allow      detection of violations will not be in place. An additional,      unintended effect of the requirement could result in Forest      Service inability to enforce extant marking requirements      aimed at ensuring compliance with domestic timber measurement      issues (i.e., branding to ensure proper scaling and payment      for federal timber.)       Current requirements mandate reporting of all federal      timber acquired and each subsequent transaction involving      that timber. The proposed bill would subject the requirement      to a cost/benefit analysis and, if the requirement is      imposed, allow for waivers in instances where audits have      demonstrated substantial compliance during the preceding year      or where the tranferor and the transferee enter into an      advance agreement to comply with domestic processing      requirements.       It will be extremely difficult for an audit to demonstrate      that an entity had complied with domestic processing      requirements in the absence of an effective system of      internal control. Further, the conditions for a waiver will      be almost impossible to assess in the subsequent years, when      transaction reporting is no longer required, based on      demonstrated compliance in the initial year. As a ``worst      case scenario'' a purchaser could determine to strictly      comply with domestic processing requirements for one year,      carefully document compliance for that year, obtain a waiver      for the subsequent year, and intentionally fail to document      subsequent transactions. Without documentation and      concomitant branding, it will be nearly impossible to      identify noncompliance, and a purchaser may be able to      violate the act with a reasonable certainty that he cannot be      caught and prosecuted.       The second basis for a waiver is also problematic--an      agreement between the transferor and the transferee to comply      with domestic processing requirements. In essence, the      Secretary will be saying ``You do not have to report if you      agree beforehand to obey the law.'' It would be an unusual      timber purchaser or processor who would not be willing to      state an intention to comply with federal law, regardless of      actions the individual planned to take.       An additional area of concern is the definition of a      violation to mean ``with regard to a course of action.'' This      could be interpreted to mean that enforcement official must      demonstrate a pattern of behavior before taking action. As a      result, even egregious ``one-time'' offenses very difficult      to address.       A new category of violation is created in the proposed      bill. A ``minor violation'' involving less than 25 logs and a      total value of less than $10,000 is to be redressed through      the contract. In effect, this allows for lower fines to be      assessed. It is unclear what effect ``minor violations''      would have on demonstrating a ``course of action.'' If a      pattern of minor violations was not sufficient to demonstrate      a ``course of action,'' then enforcement officials could be      put in the very difficult position of documenting a series of      events, each one individually exceeding 25 logs and $10,000      in value, before prosecution.       The proposed bill requires a hearing prior to debarment--     even in cases where a criminal conviction has been obtained      (e.g., timber theft) or where a civil judgement has been      obtained and no material facts are in dispute. Current      debarment regulations permit debarment in these situations      based on the administrative record. By changing this      provision, the Act will allow a person convicted of timber      theft, with outstanding civil judgements, to continue to bid      on and be awarded federal timber contracts during the period      of the proposed debarment. This course of actions seems      unwise, at best.  Mr. Speaker, the radical overhaul of the law banning log exports from our public lands could never stand the light of day. That is why it is stuck into this bill with no hearings, no deliberation, and it was only done by a couple of Senators who we cannot control, along with the other antienvironment riders in this bill.  This is a bad precedent for the U.S. House of Representatives. Are we going to allow the Senate to do these sorts of things repeatedly on these bills, or arewe just going to let this cruise by by protecting those things in this rule? I hope not. Future conference reports will be even worse, more rife with special interest riders, if we in the House do not stand up for our prerogatives and oppose this rule.
