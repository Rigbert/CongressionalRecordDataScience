 President, I would like to recognize and honor the service of Thomas H. Miller as he retires as the executive director of the Blinded Veterans Association. Mr. Miller has been an outstanding servant to his country and an advocate for his fellow veterans. He is truly an example of courage and perseverance. He has demonstrated throughout his career that the blindness he sustained through combat injuries does not impede his ability to have an impact here at home.  Mr. Miller served his country honorably in Vietnam and lost his eyesight during a 1967 combat mission. He was honorably discharged a year later and returned home to find limited resources for veterans suffering from blindness. Following his own struggle to adjust to life at home, Mr. Miller dedicated himself to ensuring that all blinded veterans share in the resources, services, and support than can bring new hope and opportunities.  As executive director of the Blinded Veterans Association, Mr. Miller helped dramatically improve the lives of blinded veterans nationwide. In 2006 he helped launch Operation Peer Support a program aimed at ending the isolation suffered by many blinded veterans returning from combat in Iraq and Afghanistan. This program provides veterans with valuable information regarding rehabilitation, employment, and self-help activities. Most importantly, Operation Peer Support has provided many blinded veterans with the opportunity to interact with one another and make lifelong friendships here at home.  Mr. Miller was also instrumental in raising awareness for blinded veterans. During his time with the Blinded Veterans Association, Mr. Miller worked with the Veterans Health Administration to improve care for the vision impaired. He testified before the House Committee on Veterans' Affairs about the challenges facing blind veterans and served as the chair of the Federal Advisory Committee on Prosthetics and Special Disabilities Programs. In 17 years of leadership, the Blinded Veterans Association made vital contributions to legislation that has greatly expanded benefits and services for vision impaired veterans.  Our Nation is fortunate to have veterans as selfless and dedicated as Mr. Miller. While he could have allowed his combat injuries to slow his career, Mr. Miller instead saw his experience as an opportunity to help improve the lives of thousands of his fellow veterans. He has given honest and faithful service to his country and those wounded veterans transitioning to life back at home.                          ____________________
