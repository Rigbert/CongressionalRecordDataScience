Before he rushed off for dinner, the Senator from Oklahoma suggested if that was the case, he would eat the paper. I suggest my friend from Nevada save that. Perhaps we can send it along for lunch tomorrow for my colleague because I stand by that estimate. I have no reason to believe it is not true. For him to suggest the cost of this program is $56 billion whether it is 5 years in length or 10 years in length really does not square with my understanding.  It certainly is going to cost us taxpayers more over a 10-year period of time than it did over a 5-year period of time. I believe that is what the Joint Committee on Taxation is telling us.
