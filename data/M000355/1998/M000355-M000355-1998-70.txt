 President, over the last decade, the Senator from Kentucky asked numerous witnesses at hearings on campaign finance to define what a special interest is. I say to my friend from Utah that I have not yet gotten a good answer. So I have concluded--and I ask the Senator from Utah if he thinks this is a good definition of a special interest--I say to my good friend from Utah that I have concluded that a special interest is a group that is against what I am trying to do. Does the Senator from Utah think that probably is as good a definition of special interest as he has heard?
