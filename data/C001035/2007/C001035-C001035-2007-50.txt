President.  Mr. President, an alert citizenry is one of our best defenses against terrorist attacks. That is why the New York City subway system has signs saying: ``See Something, Say Something.'' That is just what a group of airline passengers did recently in reporting suspicious activity they thought represented a terrorist threat. What was the result? Those passengers, the pilot, the airline, and the airport were all sued. The Collins-Kyl-Lieberman amendment would protect individuals from lawsuits when they, in good faith, report reasonable suspicious behavior that may reflect terrorist activity.
