I think the point whether or not CBO scores it or not is irrelevant. We are talking about a very huge investment of Federal dollars into an employee program that I am a part of, and perhaps every Member of this Congress, over which we have jurisdiction.  OPM has made it very clear, their general counsel year in and year out, that we can limit or we can provide, if the body so chose, to provide abortion on demand. We have that capability. It seems that where we can save even one life, we ought to step in on behalf of that individual, especially when we are facilitating it by tax dollars.
