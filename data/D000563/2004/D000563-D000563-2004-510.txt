President, as the Senate convenes for its first session of the new year, I would like to call attention to a milestone reached 4 days ago by a financial institution with a long history in Lincoln, IL: the State Bank of Lincoln.  On Friday, January 16, 2004, the State Bank of Lincoln celebrated the completion of 100 years of financial service to the community of Lincoln and the people of Logan County. The bank first opened its doors for business on January 16, 1904, and it has operated as an independent bank ever since.  When the bank began to serve the people of Lincoln, it had $50,000 in starting capital. By the end of its first year, the bank's assets had nearly doubted to $93,000. That growth has continued through the years. Today, the bank has total assets in excess of $170 million, serves the community in four locations, and has received an A+ rating from the Weiss Rating Service.  The State Bank of Lincoln has more than $140 million in local deposits, and has provided more than $100 million in loans to businesses, farmers, and other individuals, to help them achieve their goals and dreams. The bank also has invested in the bonds of local school districts, colleges, and public entities.  As the State Bank of Lincoln passes this important milestone in its history, I would like to extend my congratulations to all who have helped this financial institution serve the community for so many years, along with my best wishes for another 100 years of committed service to the people of Lincoln and Logan County.                          ____________________
