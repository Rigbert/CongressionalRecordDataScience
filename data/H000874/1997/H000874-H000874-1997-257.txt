Chairman, this amendment is an amendment that has passed the House, has passed the Senate. I believe there is agreement on both sides of the aisle, and it deals with emergency leave for Federal employees adversely affected by a disaster such as we are dealing with in this bill, and any time that the President declares a disaster.  Mr. Chairman, on behalf of Ms. Norton, I am pleased to offer an amendment to set up a leave bank for Federal employees affected by the recent flood disasters in the Midwest.  This amendment would allow the Office of Personnel Management to establish a leave transfer program whenever the President declares a major disaster or emergency.  No one can question the need to help the men and women who are affected by these disasters.  They may have injuries or illnesses that require extensive recovery periods.  Or they may simply need additional annual leave to rebuild their home, help neighbors replant crops, or stay with children while damaged schools are repaired.  It makes sense to let other Federal employees help those who are in need. There would be no cost to the Government under the amendment.  Federal employees are generous people.  They contribute millions each year to the Combined Federal Campaign. In fact, since 1964 CFC has collected almost $3 billion in voluntary contributions for a wide range of charities.  They volunteer in their communities--such as Treasury's program to help provide mentors for the D.C. public schools.  And it might surprise a few of my colleagues who love to denigrate Federal workers, that many actually give back annual leave at the end of each year--voluntarily working days they don't have to because of their dedication to their jobs.  It makes sense to allow such employees to share that leave with others who need it.  This leave bank is a great idea and I urge adoption of the amendment. Talking Points on Norton Amendment to the Supplemental Appropriations                                   Bill       1. This amendment would simply allow the President to      direct the Office of Personnel Management to set up a special      leave transfer program to assist Federal employees adversely      affected by a major disaster or emergency. It would allow      individual employees and agency leave banks to donate leave      which could be reallocated to those in need within the same      or other agencies.       2. This amendment is noncontroversial. It is based upon a      proposal sent to the Congress by OPM on behalf of the Clinton      Administration. Its provisions are identical to legislation      introduced in 1995 by Senate Appropriations Chairman Ted      Stevens which passed both the Senate and the House during the      104th Congress. Senator Stevens' bill was not enacted because      unrelated legislation (Rep. Mica's veterans preference bill)      was attached to it on the House floor and the Senate failed      to take up the amended bill before adjournment.       3. The Congressional Budget Office prepared an estimate of      this legislation prior to its consideration by the House last      September. CBO determined that it would not affect direct      spending or receipts and would otherwise have no significant      budgetary impact. Mr. Chairman, I ask unanimous consent that      CBO's letter be made a part of this hearing record.       4. Civil Service Subcommittee Chairman John Mica supports      this legislation and is for it being attached to the      Supplemental Appropriations bill.
