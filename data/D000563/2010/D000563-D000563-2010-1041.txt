 Mr. President, I will attempt to make this unanimous consent request again. I ask unanimous consent that following my remarks, the remarks of the Senator from Tennessee, Mr. Corker, who will make a unanimous consent request and then engage in debate only beyond that, and the remarks of the Senator from Kentucky, following those remarks, the Senate adjourn until 9:30 a.m., Friday, February 26; that following the prayer and pledge, the Journal of proceedings be approved to date, the morning hour be deemed expired, the time for the two leaders be reserved for their use later in the day, and the Senate proceed to a period of morning business with Senators permitted to speak therein for up to 10 minutes each. I didn't make it clear that the Senator from Kentucky would speak in debate only.
