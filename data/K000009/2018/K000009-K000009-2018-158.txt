Speaker, I rise today to reintroduce my bill, the Fairness in Political Advertising Act. It's time to level the playing field for viable candidates to compete against campaigns bankrolled by special interests. My bill would provide this access. It would require television stations to make available 2 hours of free advertising broadcast time during each even-numbered year, to each qualified political candidate in a statewide or national election.  The direction we are headed, only millionaires or corporate interests will have a seat at the representative table. This is unacceptable in our democracy.  Of the money raised in political campaigns, the largest expense for campaigns is advertising. Even today in this internet world, most dollars are still spent on television ads. In the 2014 midterms, $2.8 billion was spent on political television ads. In 2018, Cook Political Report estimates $2.4 billion will be spent on local broadcast and another $850 million for local cable.  The math is clear: to be a viable candidate in America today, you need an incredible amount of capital. Our Fathers would be ashamed of this truth.  We must return to an era of access for all. Mr. Speaker, I urge you to bring the Fairness in Political Advertising Act to the floor for a vote today and work to level the playing field for all candidates who want to participate in our democracy. Access should not require a campaign bankrolled by special interests. I urge all my colleagues to support this legislation.                          ____________________
