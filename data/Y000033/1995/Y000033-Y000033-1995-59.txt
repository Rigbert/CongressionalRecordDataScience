Mr. Speaker, I yield such time as he may consume to the gentleman from California [Mr. McKeon].  (Mr. McKEON asked and was given permission to revise and extend his remarks.)  Mr. McKEON. Mr. Speaker, I rise in strong support of the conference report on S. 395.  As a Member from the State of California, I particularly want to express my support for language to repeal the ban on the export of Alaska North Slope crude oil. While this prohibition seemed like the right thing to do during the 1970's, it violated free-market principles and inhibited domestic oil exploration in the western United States at a time when it should have been encouraged. The forced introduction of Alaskan oil to the west coast was particularly harmful to my own State of California.  Lifting the export ban will also increase revenue to the Treasury once the Elk Hills Naval Petroleum Reserve in California is sold by the Government. I have worked on the National Security Committee in support of this sale, and since repeal of the Alaska export prohibition will result in an increase in the price of California crude oil, the value of the price of California crude oil, the value of the reserve will also rise.  Mr. Speaker, the Clinton administration and Congress both agree that repealing the export ban is the right thing to do. I share this belief and urge support of the rule and the legislation before us today.
