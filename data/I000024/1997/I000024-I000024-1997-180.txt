President, I rise today to introduce legislation that attempts to level the playing field for transit donor States across the country. In addition to myself, Senators Tim Hutchinson, Helms, Cochran, Nickles, and Sessions are all original cosponsors.  Federal Transit dollars are distributed according to the Federal Transit Act as amended by the Intermodal Surface Transportation Efficiency Act [ISTEA]. Similar to highway dollars, transit dollars are collected at the gas pump and are distributed by both formula and discretionary grants.  States such as Oklahoma that do not receive back all of the revenues that they send to the Federal mass transit account are considered donor States. Unfortunately, these States are not getting nearly as much back in Federal funding as they contribute. In 1995, Oklahoma contributed about $30 million and only received back about $8 million from the mass transit account of the highway trust fund. This inequity allows for States with more urban centers to receive more dollars back than they actually contribute to the Federal account. Basically, donor States are subsidizing large metropolitan areas with the portion of the funds that we never get back. This puts smaller and rural areas at a disadvantage in trying to maintain transit systems whether it be buses or light rail. Rural areas are, too, interested in conserving fuel and contributing to better air quality.  My proposal is designed to address this critical transit problem as we move deeper into the ISTEA reauthorization debate. Under my bill, each State that contributes $50 million or less into the Federal Mass Transit Account will be guaranteed to receive back no less than 80 percent of its apportionment.  States should reasonably be able to expect that local dollars will be used for local transit needs. A large portion of Oklahoma-generated revenues should be remitted back to our State to provide for improved public transportation in Oklahoma--not urban mass transit systems in other States. My bill will put equity into the mass transit apportionment system by returning locally generated dollars home.  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be printed in the Record.  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the Record, as follows:                                 S. 556       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of      the United States of America in Congress assembled,     SECTION 1. ALLOCATION OF MASS TRANSIT ACCOUNT FUNDS.       (a) Minimum Allocation.--The Secretary of Transportation      shall take such actions as may be necessary to ensure that,      in each fiscal year, each State's percentage of the total      apportionments to all States from the Mass Transit Account of      the Highway Trust Fund established by section 9503 of the      Internal Revenue Code of 1986 is not less than 80 percent of      the State's estimated tax payment attributable to highway      users in the State paid into that Account in the most recent      year for which data are available.       (b) Applicability.--Subsection (a) does not apply to any      State whose contribution to the Mass Transit Account of the      Highway Trust Fund established by section 9503 of the      Internal Revenue Code of 1986 in the applicable fiscal year      is greater than or equal to $50,000,000.                                 ______                                       By Mr. McCONNELL (for himself and Mr. Inhofe):  S. 557. A bill to amend the Clean Air Act to exclude beverage alcohol compounds emitted from aging warehouses from the definition of volatile organic compounds; to the Committee on Environment and Public Works.  the clean air act amendments distilled spirits clarification act of                                   1997  Mr. McCONNELL. Mr. President, today I rise to introduce legislation which will correct an oversight in the Clean Air Act Amendments of 1990. This legislation will clarify the treatment under the act of beverage alcohol compounds emitted from aging warehouses.  Under the current statute, EPA classifies beverage alcohol emissions (ethanol) as a volatile organic compound [VOC]. VOC's react in the atmosphere to form ozone. Ethanol, however, has been proven to play an insignificant role in ozone formation because of its low reactivity.  Despite scientific evidence proving the minimal value of these controls (at exorbitant cost) the EPA has wrongly refused repeated requests regarding removal of restrictions on beverage distillation. If control technology is implemented, this would mean process changes in the historical aging process that makes each beverage unique.  Aging is arguably one of the most important components of the production process. For example, Bourbon whisky, which is a distinctive product of the United States, and Kentucky, must be aged at least 2 years in wooden barrels according to Federal regulation. This process involves natural oxidation which requires the passage of air and ethanol vapors into and out of the barrels. Any effort to alter this natural aging process through controls on temperature, ventilation patterns, and humidity, could change the actual physical properties of Bourbon whisky, thus altering the distinguishing taste associated with certain brands.  Mr. President, I agree that we must protect the environment that we all share. However, when extremist, inflexible regulation threatens an entire industry at minimal, if any, environmental return, we must reevaluate our priorities. I urge my colleagues to join me in restoring a little sanity to our regulatory process.  I ask unanimous consent for the bill to be printed in the Record.  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the record, as follows:                                 S. 557       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of      the United States of America in Congress assembled,     SECTION 1. DEFINITION OF VOLATILE ORGANIC COMPOUNDS.       Section 302(s) of the Clean Air Act (42 U.S.C. 7602(s)) is      amended by adding the following at the end thereof: ``Such      term shall not include beverage alcohol compounds (ethanol)      emitted from aging warehouses.''.                                 ______                                       By
