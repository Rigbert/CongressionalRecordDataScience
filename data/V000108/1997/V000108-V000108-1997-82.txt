Speaker, today I am introducing legislation that will cut an estimated $35.3 billion in corporate welfare over the next 5 years. My bill, the Corporate Responsibility Act of 1997, eliminates or reforms 12 Federal programs that currently use billions of taxpayers dollars to subsidize corporate America.  I am introducing this legislation because I am extremely concerned about the hundreds of billions of taxpayer dollars spent every decade on special interests and Fortune 500 corporations. Estimates of current total corporate welfare expenditures range from $200 billion to $500 billion over 5 years, money that would go a long way toward balancing the budget and investing in our future. Last year, the Congress passed important legislation to reform the welfare system. It is time to reform the corporate welfare system by getting dependent companies off the Government dole.  In the 104th Congress, I introduced similar corporate welfare legislation. That bill, H.R. 3102, took aim at seven of the worst corporate welfare programs in the Federal budget, including the Market Promotion Program, the U.S. territorial possessions tax credit, and the Export Enhancement Program. I was extremely pleased when legislation was signed into law last year, Public Law 104-188, that eliminated the territorial possessions tax credit. Eliminating this program, which gave companies a tax break for sending good U.S. job abroad, will save taxpayers $10.6 billion over the next 10 years.  While the premise of my new bill remains the same--to reduce corporate welfare--I have expanded the scope of my legislation, and added a lockbox mechanism to ensure that all savings and revenue go directly toward deficit reduction. This bill would save $35.3 billion over 5 years by ending eight corporate welfare programs and reforming four others. Because I've limited this legislation to the most egregious examples, my bill is a litmus test for anyone is serious about ending corporate welfare. In short, this bill puts a balanced budget, jobs, education, and a clean environment ahead of handouts to Fortune 500 companies and special interests.  The legislation I am introducing today represents an important step in the effort to end wasteful spending and balance the Federal budget. I urge you and my other House colleagues to cosponsor and support the Corporate Responsibility Act.  The Corporate Responsibility Act of 1997 would:  Eliminate the Export Enhancement Program [EEP]: The U.S. Department of Agriculture [USDA] subsidizes the export of agricultural commodities by paying exporters cash bonuses to export agricultural products. Since its inception in 1985, EEP has paid out more than $7 billion in bonuses, mostly to giant agribusinesses. Taxpayers should not be asked to hand out these corporate giveaways or subsidize the purchase of food products by foreign consumers. Estimated savings: $2.1 billion over 5 years.  Eliminate the Market Access Program [MAP]: USDA subsidizes foreign advertising costs of multinational and U.S. corporations, such as McDonalds and Wrangler. MAP--formerly known as the Market Promotion Program--funds consumer-related promotion of products through trade shows, advertising campaigns, commodity analysis, and training of foreign nationals. Taxpayers should not be asked to pick up the tab for the advertising costs of large companies that can afford to advertise on their own. Estimated savings: $350 million over 5 years.  Overhaul the 1872 Mining Act: Allowing foreign companies to buy public land for $2.50 per acre and pay no royalties on the valuable minerals extracted is a license to steal that should be revoked. Many of the mining interests that benefit from this system are not even U.S. companies. My bill would establish a leasing system and require these companies to pay an 8-percent royalty on the valuableminerals extracted from Federal land. Estimated savings: $300 million over 5 years.  Eliminate the subsidy for the Tennessee Valley Authority [TVA]: TVA receives $106 million each year in a direct Federal subsidy. In this era of power deregulation and deficit reduction, the Government can no longer afford to subsidize the TVA in this way. Even TVA's chairman, Craven Crowell, has said that his agency can make due without its annual appropriation. Estimated savings: $500 million over 5 years.  Reform irrigation subsidies: Under current law, USDA gives farmers--often large agribusiness--Freedom to Farm payments along with irrigation subsidies for the same crops on the same land. My bill would end this double dipping by requiring recipients to pay for irrigation costs if they are already receiving Freedom to Farm subsidies. Estimated savings: $500 million-$1 billion over 5 years.  Eliminate the Tobacco Program: The Federal Government aids producers of tobacco through a combination of marketing quotas, price-supporting loans, and restrictions on imports. Tobacco is the sixth largest cash crop in the country and most of the price-supports and marketing quotas benefit huge companies like Phillip Morris and RJR Nabisco. Estimated savings: $200 million over 5 years.  Eliminate the Advanced Technology Program [ATP]: ATP gives away nearly half a billion dollars a year in research and development grants to huge high-technology firms like Caterpiller, General Electric, and Xerox to help develop new products. These companies are very well financed and should be using their own money for R Estimated savings: $1.1 billion over 5 years.  Reform process for developing timber roads in national forests: Timber companies profit tremendously from the use of roads in national forest lands, but they pay virtually none of the cost of building them. My bill would stop subsidizing the construction of roads which are mainly used by timber companies go gain access to timber. Estimated savings: $250 million over 5 years.  Reform the U.S. role in the General Arrangements to Borrow: The General Arrangements to Borrow [GAB], part of the International Monetary Fund [IMF], are intended to prevent any future internal monetary crisis caused by developing countries that are unable to pay their bills. We are bailing out these countries--and the banks that support them--despite the fact that they have enough capital to spend vast amounts of money on money-losing State-sponsored industries, huge bureaucracies, and large militaries. My bill would prevent increased U.S. participation in the GAB. Estimated savings: $3.5 billion over 5 years.  End special tax treatment of alcohol fuels: Manufacturers of gasohol, a motor fuel composed of 10 percent alcohol, received a tax subsidy of 54 cents per gallon of alcohol used. Archer-Daniels-Midland--which produces most of the country's gasohol--has made billions of dollars from this tax break. These subsidies have a dubious balance of public versus private benefits, and they are an inefficient use of our energy resources. Estimated savings: $2.4 billion over 5 years.  Eliminate the Foreign Sales Corporation [FSC] tax break: The Tax Code's FSC provisions permit U.S. exporters to exempt 15 percent of their export income from U.S. taxation. This encourages U.S. companies to form subsidiary corporations in a foreign country--which can just be a mailing address--to qualify as an FSC. A portion of the FSC's own export income is exempt from taxes, and the FSC can pass on the tax savings to its parent company because domestic corporations are allowed a 100-percent dividends-received deduction for income distribution from an FSC. Estimated savings: $7.5 billion over 5 years.  Eliminate the ``title passage'' tax break: Companies can treat sales income as foreign source income--therefore realizing a tax break--by passing title to the property sold offshore even though the sales activity may have taken place in the United States. The title passage rule allows a company with excess foreign tax credits to classify more of its income as foreign source, then the company receives an implicit tax subsidy. My bill would put an end to this practice by closing this tax loophole. Estimated savings: $16.6 billion over 5 years.  Total estimated savings: $35.3 billion over 5 years.  Deficit reduction lock box: This bill includes a deficit reduction lockbox to ensure that all savings/revenue go directly toward deficit reduction and are not used to finance other programs.                          ____________________
