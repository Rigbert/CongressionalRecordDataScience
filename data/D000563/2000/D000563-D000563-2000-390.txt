And if I am not mistaken, 12 or 13 high school students were killed, and more were injured during the course of that time. America was fixed on this event as no other event, despite all the gun violence, when we consider it could happen at a high school such as Columbine.  Is the Senator from New Jersey able to tell me what the response was of the Senate to that tragedy?
