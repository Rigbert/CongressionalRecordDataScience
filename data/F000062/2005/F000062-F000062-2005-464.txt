 President, I rise today to commemorate the life and work of Marla Ruzicka, a remarkable woman and humanitarian who was killed last Saturday in a car bomb blast in Baghdad.  My thoughts and prayers go out to her parents, Cliff and Nancy, her siblings, and her friends and coworkers. She will be sorely missed.  Born and raised in Lakeport, CA, Marla dedicated her life to helping the innocent victims of war who needed a voice and needed a champion.  She traveled to war zones like Afghanistan and Iraq on her own and at her own risk to document civilian casualties and find ways to provide the needed humanitarian assistance.  Two years ago, at the age of 26, she founded the Campaign for Innocent Victims in Conflict to ``mitigate the impact of the conflict and its aftermath on the people of Iraq by ensuring that timely and effective life-saving assistance is provided to those in need''.  A tireless and relentless advocate for her cause, she talked to anyone who would listen and would win over doubters with her smile, kindness, and compassion.  In fact, in no small part to her own initiative, she helped convince Congress and the U.S. military to provide $30 million for innocent victims of the wars in Afghanistan and Iraq, something that had not been accomplished before.  Few have done so much and helped so many at such a young age.  Her father said he would remember her as a ``lady with a tremendously open heart and warm feelings toward the people who've been in conflict and war.''  As we mourn the loss of a loving and caring American, let us also celebrate the life of Marla Ruzicka and rededicate ourselves to the cause she personified. In her memory, let us reach out to Afghan and Iraqi civilians who have suffered in silence and be their voice and champion.  I can think of no finer tribute.                          ____________________
