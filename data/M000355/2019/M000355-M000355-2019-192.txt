 No. 1, our Democratic colleagues, particularly over in the House, seem eager to pour the vast majority of their time and energy into their 3-year-long journey to impeach the President the American people elected. As a consequence, No. 2, Congress has yet to fulfill a number of its core governing responsibilities for this year.  At this late date, several crucial, must-pass bills remain undone. For months, my fellow Republicans and I have been stressing the need for productive, bipartisan cooperation on these pressing subjects: funding for the Federal Government, Defense appropriations--the money for our troops--and the National Defense Authorization Act. Yet, for months, our calls for the Democrats to join us in serious negotiations have gone largely unanswered as the Democratic leadership has opted for a different political playbook--to obsess over impeachment and obstruct this core business that we must do every year.  Earlier this year, the House Democrats pushed through what we believe was their first purely party-line NDAA that either Chamber has ever passed in the 58-year history of the legislation. This is the legislation that puts forward Congress's priorities for equipping, training, and maintaining the greatest fighting forces in the world. It has never been used before as a purely partisan weapon--that is, not until this year. Reassuringly, the past few days have finally brought an end to bipartisan talks and produced a compromise NDAA. The end result should be able to pass both Chambers and earn the President's signature. Believe me, it will not come a moment too soon.  The NDAA authorizes resources to keep crucial military installations--like Fort Campbell, Fort Knox, and the Blue Grass Army Depot in Kentucky--running smoothly. It is similarly important to facilities in many of our colleagues' home States as well. Nationally, of course, it directs readiness efforts, prioritizes research and development programs, and enacts vital reforms at the Pentagon.  I look forward to sending the final, bipartisan product by the conference committee to the President for his signature soon. In addition to that authorizing legislation, Congress, of course, needs to actually appropriate funds for our national defense and for all other functions of our Federal Government.  Just a few months ago, when leaders on both sides put their names to a bipartisan-bicameral roadmap for the appropriations process, it looked as though we might keep partisan disputes out of this process and finish up the appropriations with time to spare. Unfortunately, our Democratic colleagues decided that picking fights with the White House was a higher priority, and we spent the autumn being mired in disputes over exactly the kinds of poison pills and Presidential authorities the Speaker and the Democratic leader had previously promisedwould be off limits. Yet, as we speak, Chairman Shelby and appropriators in both Chambers are trying to bring months of near stalemate to a close. Last month, a bipartisan-bicameral agreement was reached on subcommittee allocations, and talks continue this week on outstanding issues.  Thanks to the months of delay, we have a long way to go and a very short time in which to do it. I hope that our Democratic colleagues can finally stick to the terms of the budget agreement and keep partisan policy fights out of this process. That is the only way both Chambers will have a chance of being able to vote on funding bills before the end of this year.  That brings us to the USMCA. For the better part of the past year, President Trump's landmark agreement to update North American trade policy has been languishing as Speaker Pelosi and the House Democrats have indulged further and further in impeachment. There are 176,000 new Americans jobs that have sat waiting on ice as the Speaker has offered lukewarm assurances month after month that her caucus is hoping to be ``on a path to yes.'' This week, at long last, it appears that the House Democrats may finally be willing to take action for American workers and job creators and let the House vote on the President's deal. I was pleased to hear that U.S. negotiators, led by Robert Lighthizer, were to head to Mexico today to finalize the details on this important win for the American economy. I hope this forward momentum continues.  So that is the state of play. There is a lot left to do for the American families we represent if our Democratic colleagues will simply allow it, and it will certainly take a great deal of cooperation and consent right here in the Senate if we intend to consider and pass these measures before the end of the year.  Obstruction and stalemate have brought us to the eleventh hour. I hope that, now that we are here, both Chambers will be able to set aside the Democrats' impeachment parade long enough to get the people's business finally finished.                          ____________________
