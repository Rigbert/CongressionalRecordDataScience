President, if this is agreeable with the distinguished Senator from Kentucky, why don't we have the vote, say, at 9:45, either a vote on it or a vote on tabling. I expect it will be a vote up or down. I just don't want to give up that right. I am sure the Senator from Arizona can understand that. And maybe have, prior to the vote, 20 minutes on each side. Will that be agreeable?  Mr. McCAIN. That is certainly agreeable. I only need 10 minutes on this side.
