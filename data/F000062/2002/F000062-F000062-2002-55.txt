 President, just over four years ago, the U.S. Postal Service began issuing semipostal stamps to raise money for breast cancer research. The breast cancer research stamp is the first postal stamp in our Nation's history to raise funds for a special cause. Since its inception in the summer of 1998, the program has raised over $27.2 million for research.  The stamp is just as strong today as it was 4 years ago when Congress passed legislation I introduced based on a creative idea of my constituent, Dr. Ernie Bodai, and the hard efforts of others, including Betsy Mullen of the Women's Information Network Against Breast Cancer and the Susan G. Komen Foundation.  The price of a breast cancer research stamp recently increased to keep pace with the cost of first class mail, ensuring that breast cancer research will continue to reap the benefits of the stamp's success.  It has also focused public awareness on a devastating disease and provided a symbol of hope and strength to breast cancer survivors, their loved ones, and others who care about eradicating breast cancer as a life-threatening disease.  I am pleased to announce today that the concept of a semipostal breast cancer research stamp has now spread across international borders. The country of Italy recently has followed the United States lead and is issuing a semipostal stamp for breast cancer research.  Breast cancer is not just an American problem, but it is also a global problem. Approximately 250,000 new cases of breast cancer are diagnosed annually in the European Union. Each year, in Italy alone, more than 30,000 women are diagnosed with breast cancer and 11,000 die of this disease.  Modeled after the U.S. version, the Italian stamp is priced above the value of a first class letter with proceeds dedicated to the battle against breast cancer. Converted into U.S. dollars, approximately 20 cents for each letter sent with the new semipostal will be used to fight breast cancer. In total, Italy expects to raise approximately $2.5 million dollars for breast cancer research, education, screening and treatment programs throughout the country.  Italy's new semipostal stamp, which will be available through 2003, commemorates the 50th anniversary of the death of Queen Elena di Savoia, whose philanthropic efforts included funding the first cancer center in Italy. Approximately 12.5 million stamps will be produced.  I am pleased that lessons we have learned from the launch of the U.S. breast cancer stamp are being applied in Italy. I would especially like to commend the Susan G. Komen Breast Cancer Foundation for its efforts to make the Italian stamp the success that it is here in the United States. In the words of Nancy Macgregor, the Komen Foundation's International Director: ``Breast cancer knows no boundaries, and Italy is no exception.''  I wish Italy the same success with its semipostal that we continue to enjoy here in the United States. Working together and building on each other's successes, we increase our strength in the battle against breast cancer.                          ____________________
