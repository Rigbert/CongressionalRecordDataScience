President, I am glad to see my friend from South Carolina used a tiny part of a quote of mine. I am always glad when somebody quotes me, even when they don't do it accurately.  What I was referring to, if you look at the quote, was the one-person filibusters of 63 of President Clinton's nominees, where one person, one Republican, usually anonymously, would object to President Clinton's nominees and then those nominees would never get a vote at all. Those were filibusters by one person done anonymously, not in the open.  Here, of course, unlike what was done to President Clinton, the Democrats have cooperated to make sure that 168 of President Bush's nominees to the Federal judiciary have gone through and only 4 have not. We can see only 4 have been blocked. We have confirmed 168 and only blocked 4. That contrasts to the 63 anonymous filibusters doneby the Republicans--63 done by the Republicans when they were in charge.  As I walked over this morning, I thought: Finally, the Republican leadership is bringing to a conclusion three really ``Alice in Wonderland'' kind of days, really wasted days in the history of the Senate. During those days, as much as the Republican leadership wanted to waste the Senate's time, at a cost of hundreds of thousands of tax dollars, I am proud of our Democratic Senators who had to endure endless criticism for objecting to a handful of the President's most extreme, controversial, and divisive nominees.  What they have tried to do is get the Senate's attention back on the unfinished legislative business of this session that is of such concern to the lives of so many Americans. As I said, we have cooperated in the confirmation of 168 of this President's judicial nominees. We confirmed 100 in the 17 months I was chairman and confirmed another 68 in the 17 months my distinguished colleague from Utah was chairman. I am not going to criticize him that he didn't get as many confirmed as I did, but there are the numbers, 168 to 4. That is more judges than President Reagan, the ``all-time champ,'' appointed his entire first term in office when he had a Republican majority. So in less than three years, we have already eclipsed President Reagan's four year total.  Among the 168 confirmations are more circuit court confirmations than for any of the last three Presidents at this stage in their first terms. The scorecard is 168 to 4.  After this week, the total of those blocked could increase by two, but the number of confirmations will not have been increased. Rather than work with all Senators to confirm those nominees who can be confirmed after a vote or who may be confirmed after a reasonable debate and a vote, the Republican leadership has remained fixated on the most controversial and most divisive nominees.  During this 40-hour talkathon, the Republican leadership of the Senate has taken what could have been productive days at the end of this year's legislative session and decided to abandon work on the real priorities of the American people. I understand that the reason they have been spending so much of the taxpayers' dollars in doing this talkathon is that some of the Republican campaign committees have tried to use this to raise money. If they are, instead of charging the taxpayers for this, I wish they would do it themselves.  But what we have are our friends on the other side engaging in repetitive speeches about promoting a small handful of controversial nominees to lifetime positions as Federal judges. These are people who already have good well-paying jobs. They do not want to talk about the legislation that might help the more than 3 million Americans who have lost their jobs since President Bush assumed office.  Unlike President Clinton's term, where a million new jobs were created every year, in the 3 years of President Bush's term, 3 million jobs have been lost, but they do not want to talk about that.  The Republican leadership has already overshot the Senate's adjournment date by more than a month. We have already had to enact three continuing resolutions just to keep the Federal Government going because we have not passed our appropriations bills. The law says we have to enact our 13 appropriations bills by the end of September. The Republican Congress has enacted only 5 of the total 13. They ignore the law on that, but then they waste this time and hundreds of thousands of taxpayer dollars to have a campaign talkathon.  They do not want to vote on the appropriations bills and, instead, they want to waste time on this? They want to waste time giving lifetime jobs to three or four people but they do not want to do anything about the 3 million Americans who are out of jobs.  Here is what they are not talking about, here are the issues that are not being voted on, here are the bills that the Republican leadership will not bring up: Funds that go to improve our schools. Funds that NIH uses to advance our medical knowledge in fighting disease and illness. The resources used by EPA to enforce our clean air and water laws. They do not want to bring up appropriations for our veterans and for law enforcement. These are things that all people should be able to agree on, Republicans and Democrats, but we are told there is no time to bring up money for our law enforcement or for our veterans.  In fact, during the first evening of this exercise in the wind chambers, the senior Senator from West Virginia was trying to get the Senate to do its work. Senator Byrd, as the ranking Democrat on the Appropriations Committee, urged the Senate to complete its work on the appropriations bills that fund services for our military veterans. He said, Why do we not finish this? This administration has cut money for veterans benefits. It has cut money for veterans hospitals. It has cut money for disabled veterans. He said, Can we not at least take a couple of hours more--if you are going to spend 40 or so hours talking about four judges, can we do something, can we take 2 more hours to finish the bill that will affect millions of America's veterans?  He said we could do it in 2 hours. The Republican leadership objected. Those few minutes at the beginning of this debate may be the most telling of this entire so-called debate. Republicans chose to sacrifice the work of the Senate, the priorities of the American people and the interests of American veterans so they could pull a partisan political stunt.  In one of their many press conferences on this diversion, on November 6, the Republican leader committed to ``complete the appropriations process'' before beginning this charade. Even the junior Senator from Pennsylvania agreed with him and said: ``The leader's right. What we are about to embark in next week, after the appropriations process has run its course, is to enter into a debate. . . .'' Well, when given the chance to honor that commitment, the Republican caucus chose partisan theater over the work of the Senate.  We said can you not take 2 hours out of these 40 hours to at least do the appropriations bill for our veterans? I mean, you are not going to do the appropriations bills for our law enforcement. You are not going to do it for medical research. You are not going to do it for anything else. If you could just take 2 hours out of this, at a time when we are creating a lot more veterans, many of them horribly disabled and disfigured from the war in Iraq, we are told, no. We do not have 2 hours for that.  There is the unfinished business of the Nation's unemployment and lack of job opportunities that confound so many American families. With millions of Americans having lost their jobs in the last three years, the Republican Senate has, instead, insisting on spending these final days of this session on a handful of highly controversial judicial nominations that divide the Senate and the American people and ignoring the needs of the almost 10 million Americans who are out of work, including those more than three million Americans who have lost their jobs since President Bush took office.  Instead of working together on such important matters, we are being forced to repeat another cloture vote on the nomination of Priscilla Owen. The Senate has voted three times on this nomination, and three times, the Senate has decided against granting consent. Her nomination had been fairly and thoroughly considered by the Judiciary Committee last year, and her nomination was rejected on the merits. Never before has a President renominated a judicial nominee who was rejected on the merits by the Judiciary Committee.  She has shown herself to be a judicial activist and an extremist even on the very conservative Texas Supreme Court where her conservative colleagues have criticized her judging. All that has occurred since the cloture votes during the spring and summer is that Republican partisans have ratcheted up their name calling and Justice Owen has been made to serve as a political prop for the White House.  In fact, I commend to my colleagues an insightful article by David Margolick that appeared recently in Vanity Fair magazine entitled ``Bush Scored Advantage.''  The second in this series of votes is to be on Judge Carolyn Kuhl. This nomination to the 9th Circuit has been opposed by both the home-state Senators from California and for good reason. From her days seeking to changefederal policy and provide tax breaks to Bob Jones University, to her efforts to overturn Roe v. Wade, to her recent decisions seeking to excuse the invasions of the privacy of Ms. Sanchez-Scott, a breast cancer survivor, Carolyn Kuhl has been extreme.  Finally, the Senate will be required to vote in relation to a nomination that has been whisked through the Judiciary Committee in the last several days, that of Janice R. Brown. This controversial nomination is opposed by the Congressional Black Caucus, the National Bar Association, the California Association of Black Lawyers and a long list of African-American and civil rights leaders and organizations. Former Senator and former ambassador Carol Moseley Braun has recently written to us opposing this nomination. I ask that her November 12 letter be made part of the Record.  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in the Record, as follows:      Women's Organizations Opposing Nomination of Priscilla Owen     National Organization for Women     National Organization for Women, Texas Chapter     NOW Legal Defense & Education Fund     Religious Coalition for Reproductive Rights     National Abortion Federation     National Women's Law Center     NARAL Pro-Choice America     National Council of Jewish Women     National Council of Jewish Women, Texas     American Association of University Women     American Association of University Women of Texas     National Family Planning and Reproductive Health Association     National Women's Political Caucus     Texas Women's Political Caucus     Texas Freedom Network     Women's Issues Network--Dallas     Women's Health and Family Planning Association of Texas     Republican Pro-Choice Coalition     Gender Justice Action Group     Feminist Majority     National Partnership for Women & Families     Greater Dallas Coalition for Reproductive Freedom     Texas Abortion and Reproductive Rights Action League     Planned Parenthood Federation of America     Planned Parenthood Association of Hidalgo County     Planned Parenthood Association of Lubbock     Planned Parenthood of Cameron and Willacy Counties     Planned Parenthood of Houston and Southeast Texas     Planned Parenthood of North Texas     Planned Parenthood of San Antonio & South Central Texas     Planned Parenthood of South Texas     Planned Parenthood of the Texas Capital Region     Planned Parenthood of West Texas                                  ____   Women's Organizations Opposing Nomination of Janice Rodgers Brown     National Organization for Women     California National Organization for Women     NOW Legal Defense & Education Fund     Religious Coalition for Reproductive Rights     National Abortion Federation     National Women's Law Center     NARAL Pro-Choice America     National Council of Jewish Women     National Council of Jewish Women, California     National Council of Jewish Women, Los Angeles     American Association of University Women     National Family Planning and Reproductive Health Association     National Partnership for Women and Families     Feminist Majority     Planned Parenthood Federation of America     Planned Parenthood of Golden Gate     Planned Parenthood of Los Angeles     Women Lawyers Association of Los Angeles     Women's Reproductive Rights Assistance Project     Pacifica Institute for Women's Health     Black Women Lawyers of Los Angeles     California Abortion and Reproductive Rights Action League     California Women's Law Center                                  ____       Women's Organizations Opposing Nomination of Carolyn Kuhl     American Association of University Women     Breast Cancer Action     Breast Cancer Fund     California Abortion and Reproductive Rights Action League     California National Organization for Women     California Women Lawyers     California Women's Law Center     Center for Reproductive Law and Policy     Coalition of Labor Union Women (CLUW)     Feminist Majority     Los Angeles African-American Women's Political Action          Committee     NARAL Pro-Choice America     National Abortion Federation     National Council of Jewish Women     National Organization for Women     National Partnership for Women and Families     National Women's Law Center     National Women's Political Caucus--California     Pacific Institute for Women's Health     Planned Parenthood Federation of America     Planned Parenthood Affiliates of California     San Diego County National Organization for Women     Women's Committee, Labor Committee for Latin American          Advancement     Women's Leadership Alliance Women's Political Committee     Women's International League for Peace and Freedom     Women's Reproductive Rights Assistance Project.                                  ____                                                November 12, 2003.     Hon. Bill Frist,     Majority Leader, U.S. Senate, Russell Senate Office Building,          Washington, DC.     Hon. Tom Daschle,     Minority Leader, U.S. Senate, Hart Senate Office Building,          Washington, DC.       Gentlemen: Respect for the rule of law, and the      impartiality of the judiciary are almost synonymous concepts.      It is out of concern for both that I want to convey my most      serious concern about the State's consideration of the      nomination of Justice Janice Rogers Brown for the United      States Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit.       Justice Brown has not demonstrated the balance and judicial      temperament and prudence that are central to a respected      judiciary. Indeed, she has spoken to an organization of my      own alma mater, the University of Chicago Federalist Society,      in terms so radical as to bring into question her own regard      for the position she currently occupies. The extremism of her      views has been publicly demonstrated time and time again,      particularly concerning matters of settled law regarding the      national government's responsibility to protect civil and      political rights of women and minorities. Such extremism      undermines the confidence any citizen might have in the      capacity of this nominee to fairly interpret and administer      the law.       I am the only African American woman to have served in the      United States Senate, or on its Judiciary committee. As such      I have not only an appreciation for the gravity of the      Senate's role and responsibility in regards to the      appointment process, but I also have a keen appreciation for      the diversity of opinion among African Americans. Not all      black people think alike, and I have no doubt that there is a      constituency that would be happy to see an African American      of any political persuasion confirmed for such an important      position as the D.C. Circuit Court of Appeals. However, it      does both the black community as well as the courts a great      disservice to confirm to such a position an individual who      has so clearly demonstrated a disregard for the balance and      impartiality required of the members of the bench.       I appeal to our President to exercise greater respect for      the traditions of the judiciary in making future nominations.      Justice Brown should be given an opportunity to mature in her      demeanor and her judicial conduct, but not as a member of the      Circuit Court. As such, I urge the members of the Committee      to reject this nomination.           Sincerely,                                              Carol Moseley-Braun.
