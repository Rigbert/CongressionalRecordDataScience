President, this article speaks of one National Guard unit, the 1544th Transportation Company from Paris, IL. This unit of the Illinois National Guard has sustained almost half of the deaths and more than half of the injuries that our National Guard in Illinois has sustained, and just this last week two soldiers were killed and 15 wounded after another attack in Iraq.  It is a grim reminder that we are in a situation in Iraq with no end in sight. With 140,000 of our best and bravest in the field offering their lives every day for America, the fact that we would invade this nation of Iraq without a plan to deal with its reconstruction and pacification is the strongest condemnation of any government, and yet that is where we are today.  This morning it was reported on the news that if there is an election in Iraq--and I pray there will be--somesections of that country will not even be able to vote because they are under the control of terrorists and guerrillas. That is an indication of how far we still have to travel before the day arrives when our troops can come safely home from Iraq, realizing that in reality their mission has been accomplished.  As we reflect on 9/11, we reflect on our values. As we reflect on the heroes of America and think of those on 9/11, remember, too, the thousands still serving our Nation overseas from towns such as Paris, IL, and many just like them who offer their lives every day in defense of the values of this Nation.  I yield the floor.
