Leader, am I correct it would be our hope collectively, both sides of the aisle, to be able to give definitive information to the Members at least by 5 p.m. as to what they might expect for tomorrow?  Mr. DeLAY. Mr. Speaker, if the gentleman would continue to yield, I would hope we can give it sooner than that. In talking to the gentleman from Wisconsin (Mr. Obey) and the gentleman from Florida (Mr. Young), we should have some sort of sense as to what direction the conference will be going in the next hour or two.
