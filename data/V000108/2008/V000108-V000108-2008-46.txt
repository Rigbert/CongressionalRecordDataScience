Alan Harre. Having known Alan for many years, I can truly say that he is one of the most committed, knowledgeable, and honorable citizens in Northwest Indiana. Nowhere has his knowledge and commitment been more evident than in his faithful service as President of Valparaiso University. Alan has served Valparaiso University with two decades of dedicated leadership, and he has been a constant fixture in the Valparaiso community. For his efforts, I would like to thank him and extend my best wishes for his retirement. A celebration honoring Dr. Harre's leadership and service will be held at Strongbow Inn Restaurant in Valparaiso, Indiana, on Thursday, June 26, 2008.  Dr. Alan Harre has spent his professional career improving the quality of life at Valparaiso University. Dr. Harre's Strategic Plan set goals for the university in every aspect of campus life. During his tenure, the university has built several new facilities, including: the Center for the Arts, Kallay-Christopher Hall, the Christopher Center for Library Information and Resources, and has broken ground for a new student union. Valparaiso University has also ranked within the top four in its class in U.S. News and World Report's rankings of America's Best Colleges under Harre's leadership. Dr. Harre also contributed to the development of three new Master of Science programs and established a Valparaiso University Phi Beta Kappa honor society chapter. Perhaps Dr. Harre's greatest on-campus achievement is the increasing of the endowment fund from $37 million to over $200 million.  During his time at Valparaiso University, Alan has shared his unrivaled expertise and knowledge of his field with local organizations. Alan has served two terms on the Board for the Greater Valparaiso Chamber of Commerce and was named Distinguished Community Leader by the Chamber in 1998. He was a founding member of the Porter County Community Foundation and a co-founder of the non-profit group Rebuilding Together. Alan also has served as the Chairman of the Quality of Life Council, and in 2007, received the Council's Lifetime Achievement Award. Dr. Harre and his wife, Diane, are also creating the Alan and Diane Harre Scholarship Fund for Valparaiso University.  Madam Speaker, Dr. Alan Harre has devoted his life to improving Valparaiso University and to serving the people of Northwest Indiana. At this time, I ask that you and all of my distinguished colleagues join me in commending him for his lifetime of service, perseverance, and dedication. I also ask that you join me in wishing him the best of health and happiness in the years to come.                          ____________________
