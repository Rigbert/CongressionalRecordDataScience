Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.  Mr. Speaker, first of all, I want to thank so many people for working so hard on this piece of legislation: my good friend,  Jim McGovern, the principal cosponsor and just a great friend, on fighting tyranny in China. He chairs the China Commission. I am the ranking member. Previously, I have chaired it, and so we have gone back and forth in working that leadership. I want to thank him especially for that.  Mr. Speaker, I also want to thank, of course, Chairman Engel and Ranking Member McCaul, Chairman Sherman and Ranking Member Yoho for their strong support for this bipartisan legislation.  Mr. Speaker, there are a number of staffers who I will speak about in a moment. No. I will do it now: Scott Flipse for his great work on this bill, it is landmark work going back to 5 years ago; Jon Stivers; Reva Price from the Speaker's office, who has been tenacious on this legislation; Jennifer Hendrixson-White; Bryan Burack; Janice Kaguyutan; Theresa Lou; Darrow Godeski Merton; Doug Anderson; Piero Tozzi; Sabrina Tsai. Just so many very good people who have all pulled together in a bipartisan way to make sure that this legislation comes to the floor and becomes law.  Mr. Speaker, since the 1989 Tiananmen Square massacre 30 years ago, I have had the privilege of working with colleagues on both sides of the aisle, including Speaker Pelosi, on human rights, the rule of law and democracy for the People's Republic of China.  Mr. Speaker, I also want to thank Kevin McCarthy, the minority leader here in the House, the Republican leader, who has put me on as his selection on the China Commission and for his strong support for this legislation as well.  We have always believed, Mr. Speaker, that every person in China deserves better than the brutality so many endure every single day and the systematic violations of their universally-recognized human rights.  Tragically, under President Xi Jinping, human rights abuses throughout China have significantly worsened, including the pervasive use of torture, religious persecution, and human trafficking.  Solemn promises made by Beijing are rarely kept, and far too many leaders of the free world are far too eager to blindly accept fiction over fact.  Broken promises are the rule, not the exception under Xi Jinping, and the people of Hong Kong are suffering because of it.  During the 2014 Umbrella Movement, the world saw the courageous people of Hong Kong demanding that Beijing not renege on promises made to ensure universal suffrage, basic rights, and authentic elections in 2017.  Despite President Xi Jinping's brutal crackdown on protesters then and now, triggered this time by an outrageous proposed policy to facilitate extradition, the resolve, the courage, the tenacity, and clarity of purpose of the people of Hong Kong shines through the darkness like the Sun.  Two days ago, Reuters reported that President Xi Jinping told leaders in Nepal, ``Anyone attempting to split China in any part of the country will end in crushed bodies and shattered bones.''  President Xi's government excels in crushing bodies, shattering bones, torturing dissidents, and filling concentration camps, massive crimes against humanity, for which there has been little or no accountability or sanctioning.  But today, Mr. Speaker, we are simply urging the Chinese President and the Hong Kong Chief Executive--and we have that obligation under our own laws--to faithfully honor the government's promises.  Honor the promises made in the 1984 Sino-British Joint Declaration that facilitated the conveyance of Hong Kong from the United Kingdom to China beginning on July 1, 1997, that autonomy, human rights, including press, assembly, association, and religion, would be exactly the same as before the handover for at least 50 years.  Honor the promises made in the ``Basic Law'' of Hong Kong adopted by China's National People's Congress in 1990, before the giveback of Hong Kong, that autonomy and rights would be protected.  Even before the latest round of protests, Mr. Speaker, the U.S. State Department has noted that rights and liberties in Hong Kong have diminished. They are not living up to their solemn promises made in order for the Hong Kong conveyance to occur.  You know, the great young leader, Joshua Wong, reminded us that a fourth of the population of Hong Kong, about 2 million people, turned out for one of the peaceful protests. Mr. Speaker, where has that ever happened?  Five years ago, Mr. Speaker, in 2014, joined by Mrs. Pelosi, I introduced the bipartisan Hong Kong Human Rights and Democracy Act. We did it again in 2015, in 2017, and again this year, again, with my good friend from Massachusetts.  Our new bill, the Hong Kong Human Rights and Democracy Act, is a blueprint for meaningful action. Specifically, the act directs the Secretary of State to certify to Congress annually whether Hong Kong continues to deserve special treatment under U.S. law different from mainland China in such matters as trade, customs, sanctions enforcement, law enforcement cooperation, and protection of human rights and the rule of law.  It encourages the State Department not to deny visas based on an applicant's arrest or detention for participating in nonviolent activities in Hong Kong.  It requires an annual report from the Commerce Department on whether the Hong Kong Government adequately enforces U.S. export controls and sanctions laws, including on those goods and services transshipped to North Korea, Iran, or other countries relating to the proliferation of weapons of mass destruction, violations of human rights, narcotics trafficking, and more.                              {time}  1600  It requires an assessment of whether U.S. origin items, including software, technology, and services, have been transferred from Hong Kong to China in violation of U.S. law and have been used by China for mass surveillance, predictive policing, or for the social credit system.  Now, some people might ask: What is this social credit system? Mr. Speaker, it is a ubiquitous, totalitarian ``brave new world'' system scheduled for implementation by 2020 that will use public records, online activities, and other tools of surveillance to aggregate data on every single, solitary Chinese citizen and business and use that data to monitor, shape, and rate financial, social, religious, or political behaviors.  It requires the Secretary of State to submit a strategy to Congress to protect U.S. citizens and businesses in Hong Kong from the erosion of autonomy and the rule of law because of actions taken by the Chinese Communist governments.  It requires the President to identify and sanction persons in Hong Kong or in mainland China responsible for the erosion of Hong Kong's autonomy and serious abuses of human rights.  It tracks the Magnitsky Act, which Mr. McGovern and I worked so hard to enact into law, so that we deny visas and also deny the ability to do business here to the people who are responsible for these egregious abuses.  And it requires a waiver provision that helps ensure that our actions protect the great people of Hong Kong and enhance the autonomy rather than inadvertently harming it. So it gives real flexibility to the President and to the State Department to make the right call.  Finally, Mr. Speaker, I have heard it said that the business of Hong Kong is business. It is that. But it is also clear to me, now, that the business of Hong Kong is freedom and democracy.  Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.
