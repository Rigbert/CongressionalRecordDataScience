Chairman, just because legislation isn't passed in the House and the Senate and made into law doesn't mean that the President can then go out and create an executive order. We have a Constitution, and we have a process we must abide by. For that and other reasons, I strongly oppose this amendment, and I urge a ``no'' vote.  Mr. Chairman, I yield back the balance of my time.  The Acting CHAIR. The question is on the amendment offered by the gentleman from California (Mr. Lowenthal).  The question was taken; and the Acting Chair announced that the noes appeared to have it.
