Speaker, it is with sincere admiration that I recognize the Asian American Medical Association, which hosted its 37th Annual Gala on Saturday, November 9, 2013, at Avalon Manor in Merrillville, Indiana. Each year, the Asian American Medical Association pays tribute to prominent, outstanding citizens and organizations for their contributions to the community. In recognition of their efforts, these honorees are awarded the prestigious Crystal Globe Award at this annual banquet.   The Asian American Medical Association has always been a great asset to Northwest Indiana. Its members have selflessly dedicated themselves to providing quality medical services to the residents of Northwest Indiana and have always demonstrated exemplary service through their many cultural, scholastic, and charitable endeavors.   At this year's Annual Gala, the Asian American Medical Association presented the Crystal Globe Award to one of Northwest Indiana's finest citizens, Theresa Ann Mayerik. For her outstanding contributions to her community, she is to be commended.   In 1976, Theresa Mayerik graduated from the University of Saint Francis in Fort Wayne with a bachelor's degree in Spanish and Physical Education. She began her teaching career with the Centerville School Corporation in central Indiana. While working in Centerville, Theresa started the school's first women's basketball program. After two years, Theresa returned to her hometown of La Porte, where she spent seven years teaching in the La Porte Community School System. During this time, Theresa pursued a master's degree in Education from Indiana University in South Bend and also completed coursework for an administrative license in Education. In 1986, Mrs. Mayerik became the assistant principal of Morton High School in Hammond, and after three years in this position, she was named the school's principal, a title she would hold for the next eighteen years. During her time at Morton, Theresa was able to implement the Advanced Placement and the Project Lead the Way curricula, increase parental involvement, and develop the Freshman Academy. In 2007, she was named Director of Secondary Education for the School City of Hammond, and three years later, she became Chief Administrator for Academic Services and Secondary Education. Among her many accomplishments during her tenure, Theresa implemented the Project Lead the Way Pre-Engineering Curriculum in all of Hammond's middle and highschools and assisted with the development of the Hammond Academy for the Performing Arts at Morton High School, as well as the Multimedia Broadcast Academy at the Hammond Area Career Center, and the Early College Program. In 2010, Theresa authored the Chinese Guest Teachers Grant, which assists with the salaries and recruitment of teachers for Mandarin Chinese programs in schools in the United States. This program has been a success and provides four teachers each year the opportunity to teach middle and high school students the Chinese language and culture.   Additionally, Theresa has selflessly given her time to various organizations and civic activities, including the Hammond Woodmar Kiwanis, the Hammond Education Foundation, and the Hammond YMCA.   Theresa's excellence in her field and commitment to charitable endeavors throughout the community is exceeded only by her devotion to her amazing family. Theresa and her husband, Daniel, have two adoring children and two beloved grandchildren.   Mr. Speaker, I ask that you and my other distinguished colleagues join me in commending the members of the Asian American Medical Association, as well as this year's Crystal Globe Award recipient, Theresa Ann Mayerik, for their outstanding contributions to the community and beyond. Their unwavering commitment to improving the quality of life for the people of Northwest Indiana and throughout the United States is truly inspirational, and I am proud to serve as their representative in Washington, D.C.                          ____________________
