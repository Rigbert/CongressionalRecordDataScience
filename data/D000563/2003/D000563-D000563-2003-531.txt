President, with all due respect to my colleagues, the amendment we just agreed to did nothing. It did not add one penny or one new benefit to any senior suffering from Alzheimer's. This amendment I offer, along with Senator Harkin, will put $12 billion into providing prescription drug coverage for the seniors we represent who suffer from heart disease, cancer, Alzheimer's, diabetes and its complications. Take your pick--a $6 billion tax subsidy for HMO and private insurance companies or $12 billion for your seniors struggling to pay impossible prescription drug bills who will be cut off under this bill. It is an easy choice for me. If you take it home to your State, you will find it is an easy choice, too.  I hope you will vote for this amendment.
