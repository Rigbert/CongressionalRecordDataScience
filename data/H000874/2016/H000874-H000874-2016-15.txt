Shuwanza does as well because their job, as the Speaker has so well stated, is to help make this institution work in a democratic nation to make our citizens proud. Very frankly, if they knew the work of Anne Bradbury and others who work on this floor, the level of their pride would be much higher than sometimes it is, because they are people of extraordinary ability, great reticence and fairness in dealing with Members, all 435 of us.  Anne, you have been a shining example of the best that is in this House. You have always been quick to share your views as to what needed to be done. You were always fair when any of us talked to you--I know, when I talked to you. There were differences, of course, as one would expect, but there was no acrimony. There was no judgment. There was simply an attempt to make sure that this institution was working well.  Anne, we will miss you. The Speaker, as he says, will be inconvenienced. We will be sad, and we will be a lesser place for your leaving. You also worked with my chief of staff, Alexis Covey-Brandt, who was at one point in time the floor director. Both Shuwanza and Alexis have unrestrained respect and affection for you. You have made us all better.  Whatever you do in the future, I know you will bring the same quality, the same commitment, the same energy, the same judgment, the same fairness, and they will be advantaged, as we have been.  Godspeed.
