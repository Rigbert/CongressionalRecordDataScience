Chairman, I am more than happy to work with my good friend from Minnesota as we move this process forward.  As you know, we talked about this in the budget process with the National Park Service earlier in the year. We, obviously, don't want to discourage people from drinking water. We want them to stay hydrated. There are also people who work in the bottled water industry, and I think it is a noble industry. We want to encourage people to drink more water. It is not just about bottled water. It is about jobs and about the people who bottle that water.  I will work together with the gentlewoman from Minnesota, and we will not deny people water in our national parks. I support this amendment.
