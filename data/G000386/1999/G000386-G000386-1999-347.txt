 President, I would like to enter into a colloquy with Senator Gregg on funding for the Drug Enforcement Agency and on national issues concerning local law enforcement training skills to combat methamphetamine abuse in rural communities, small cities, mid-size communities and on activities to alleviate the growing financial burden resulting from the cleanup of clandestine laboratories and other drug-related hazardous waste.  I say to Senators Stevens and Gregg that Senators Kyle, DeWine, Kohl, Hagel, and I have offered a bill, the Rural Methamphetamine Use Response Act of 1999, that would provide additional funding to combat methamphetamine production and abuse, and for other purposes.
