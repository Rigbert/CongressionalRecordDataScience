 A healthy economy will require policy changes, not cough drops. We need products on our shelves that are produced by Americans. We need real wealth creation here at home. We need trade that is prosperous and balanced, in the black, not in the red. And, we must infuse the power of our marketplace here at home to produce long term, to spur the necessary social and physical infrastructures to restore economic strength to our Nation rather than growing weakness. We need free trade among free people. America needs balanced trade accounts, not more trade deficits and one-sided trade agreements. And America needs production, not subsidy.  Most of all, we need changes in our trade policies and our tax policies that create real investment and long-term growth in our Nation so we don't have to continue borrowing our way forward and making our children and grandchildren debtors into the vast part of this new century and millennium.
