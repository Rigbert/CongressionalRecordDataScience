I was visited in my office by a gentleman named Michael Kuryla, Jr., of Poplar Grove, IL, one of the survivors of the U.S.S. Indianapolis. He recounted to me in detail what happened when that ship went down. As he talked about being in the ocean for days, not knowing whether they would be rescued, watching his shipmates who were literally dying around himand being devoured by sharks, wondering if they would ever be rescued, tears came to his eyes. More than 50 years after, tears came to his eyes. He said it wasn't fair, what they did to Captain McVay; to court-martial him was wrong. He asked me for my help, if I would join the Senator from New Hampshire on this resolution, and I am happy to do so.  I think justice cries out that we agree to this resolution; that Captain McVay, who was singled out, out of all the captains of the fleet, to be court-martialed under these circumstances is just unfair. The men who served under him, those whose lives were under his care and those who survived this worst sea disaster in U.S. naval history--they have come forward. They have asked us to make sure that history properly records the contribution Captain McVay made to his country.  I am happy to join in this resolution. I hope other Members of the Senate, hearing this debate and reading this resolution, will cosponsor it as well and that we can close the right way this chapter in American naval history.
