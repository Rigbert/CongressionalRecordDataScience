 Speaker, I rise in support of this legislation, a fitting tribute to Mollie Beattie, a leader in wilderness protection.  This legislation is especially important to me because Mollie Beattie was a Vermonter and the State of Vermont was lucky enough to benefit from her work long before she became the first woman to direct the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service. Her extensive list of accomplishments has benefited wildlife habitat areas, State parks, wetlands, and forests in Vermont and across the Nation.  This legislation recognizes the contribution that Mollie Beattie made to the environment and the pristine wilderness that graces our Nation. The designation will remind all of us of her strong defense of the environment and remind us that we need to do our own part in protecting it.  It was a great loss when Mollie Beattie was taken from this earth she loved so much when she died of brain cancer on June 27, 1996. I urge your support for this bill that provides a suitable tribute to her work.
