President, today I am introducing legislation to expand the geographic boundaries of HUBZones located at former U.S. military installations closed through the so-called Base Closure and Realignment--or BRAC--process. This legislation mirrors S. 3675, the HUBZone Expansion Act of 2012, which I introduced with Senator Snowe last session.  I am pleased to have my new colleague from Maine, Senator Angus King, join me in offering this legislation. Senator King knows the impact a base closing can have on a local community all too well, coming as he does from Brunswick, ME, which recently lost a major military installation through the BRAC process. Military bases are often the economic heart of the towns and cities in which they are located, and communities can struggle for years to overcome the closure of those facilities.  In recognition of this fact, Congress passed legislation providing HUBZone status for 5 years to military facilities closed through the BRAC process. This allows small businesses located within the HUBZone to obtain certain federal contracting preferences. The HUBZone program is also available to small businesses located in ``economically distressed communities,'' that suffer from low income, high poverty rates, or high unemployment.  According to the Congressional Research Service, there are currently 127 BRAC-related HUBZones in the United States. Unfortunately, for many of the military bases that have been closed, HUBZone status has not brought the benefits we had hoped for. One of the reasons is simple--the law defines the geographic boundaries of a BRAC-related HUBZone to be the same as the boundaries of the base that was closed. When that is combined with the requirement that 35 percent of the employees of a qualifying business must live within the HUBZone, the problem is clear: very few people live on these former bases, so it is difficult or impossible for businesses to get the workers they need to meet the requirements of the HUBZone program.  As I mentioned, one of these HUBZones is located at the former Brunswick Naval Air Station, in Brunswick, Maine. This facility closed in 2011, as a result of the 2005 BRAC round. When the Navy left, Brunswick and its neighbor, Topsham, lost more than 2400 military and civilian personnel. These two towns have a combined population of just 22,000, so losing the Naval Air Station has had a significant economic impact on them. Because so few people actually live within the boundaries of the former base, its HUBZone designation does not provide the help they need, and that we had hoped for.  My legislation would expand the geographic boundaries of BRAC-related HUBZones to include the town or county where the closed installation is located, or census tracts contiguous to the installation, up to a total population base of 50,000. This would provide a large enough pool of potential workers to enable qualifying businesses to locate within the HUBZone, and to help host communities overcome the loss of military installations closed through the BRAC process.  The Association of Defense Communities has endorsed the concept of expanding BRAC-related HUBZones in this manner. In December, the ADC wrote to Senate Armed Services Committee Chairman Levin and Ranking Member McCain, noting how important it is that ``Congress restore its intent to support BRAC-impacted communities attracting small businesses to help build and strengthen their local economies.''  Steve Levesque, the Executive Director of the Midcoast Regional Redevelopment Authority, or ``MRRA,'' which oversees the redevelopment of the former Brunswick Naval Air Station, has also urged Congress to modify the HUBZone program. In a letter to me last month, Steve explained that BRAC facilities do not have the residential areas needed to support the 35 percent residency requirement for businesses located within the HUBZone. As a consequence, these businesses cannot ``realize the HUBZone benefits for BRAC'd installations as envisioned by Congress.''  This point was underscored in a letter from Heather Blease, an entrepreneur who is hoping to locate a new business at the former Brunswick Naval Air Station. Ms. Blease describes the HUBZone law as ``flawed,'' because the 35 percent residency requirement makes it impossible for businesses like hers to achieve HUBZone status.  I ask my collegues to consider the legislation we are offering today to help communities get back on their feet after the loss of a military installation closed through the BRAC process.  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that letters of support be printed in the Record.  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in the Record, as follows:                                                    Association of                                          Defense Communities,                                Washington, DC, December 11, 2012.     Hon. Carl Levin,     Chairman, Committee on Armed Services, U.S. Senate,          Washington, DC.     Hon. John McCain,     Ranking Member, Committee on Armed Services, U.S. Senate,          Washington, DC.       Dear Mr. Chairman and Ranking Member McCain: The      Association of Defense Communities (ADC) admires your      longstanding support of current and former military      communities. ADC, the leading organization representing those      communities, always appreciates the opportunity to share      information with you and your staff that may help strengthen      communities with active installations and those that continue      to redevelop following base closure or realignment.       Communities that have been impacted by Base Realignment and      Closure (BRAC) often face severe economic distress for years,      especially during times of national economic difficulty. To      assist in these communities' recovery, Congress authorized in      the Small Business Reauthorization Act of 1997 that BRAC-     impacted communities would receive Small Business      Administration HUBZone certification, a federal initiative      that further helps small businesses in disadvantaged areas to      compete for federal contracts. The designation gives small      businesses relocating to closed military installation areas      equal footing with businesses in other disadvantaged areas      that receive the designation because of their location in      under-utilized census tracts.       While the intent of Congress was to provide the HUBZone      designation to help closed military installations attract      small businesses, one aspect of the HUBZone program actually      works against these redevelopment areas. To maintain HUBZone      status, 35 percent of a business' employees must also live in      a HUBZone area. Because a military installation's HUBZone      area encompasses only the base itself, many closed military      installations do not have a substantial number of HUBZone-     certified residential areas from which to draw sufficient      future employees for the businesses desiring to locate on      those properties. Thus, it is often impossible for a business      to qualify for HUBZone status and compete fairly against      other small businesses.       Many defense community leaders are hopeful this issue can      be resolved without additional spending, creation of a new      government program or a change in government contracting      goals. Senator Susan Collins is also working to address this      issue during the final stages of the FY 2013 National Defense      Authorization Act. We look forward to sharing further      information with your office and hers to help explain why it      is important to defense communities that Congress restore its      intent to support BRAC-impacted communities attracting small      businesses to help build and strengthen their local      economies.       As always, ADC appreciate your service and support and      hopes you will contact us if we may be of further assistance.           Respectfully,                                            Robert M. Murdock,                                         President, Association of     Defense Communities.                                  ____                                                 Midcoast Regional                                      Redevelopment Authority,                                 Brunswick, ME, December 11, 2012.     Hon. Susan Collins,     U.S. Senator, Dirksen Senate Office Building,     Washington, DC.       Dear Senator Collins: I represent the Midcoast Regional      Redevelopment Authority, which is charged with redeveloping      the former Naval Air Station Brunswick, Maine that closed in      2011 and is now known as Brunswick Landing.       We seek your assistance in modifying the current federal      program related to SBA HUBZones to make it a more effective      tool for businesses locating at Brunswick Landing. Over the      past several years, we have had several companies inquire      about the current HUBZone status of the former NAS Brunswick.      In fact, we are currently working with one company who is      willing to locate here and create upwards of 200 jobs, if we      are successful in getting the current HUBZone program for      closed military installations broadened.       With the implementation of the latest 2005 BRAC round, a      number of military installations have been closed across the      country resulting in severe economic distress for those      communities and States that have realized these closures.      Redeveloping these BRAC'd properties proved quite difficult      in good economic times, and now it is made even more      difficult with the national and State economic recession we      are experiencing.       While it would seem that the HUBZone designation for a      closed military installation would be an aid to its      redevelopment efforts, the 35% residency rule in the existing      law actually makes the program not a very effective      redevelopment tool for these properties at all. With the      exception of closed military installations, most of the      HUBZones in the Country are census tract based. Under current      law, only the closed military base itself (i.e., the      geographic area which used to be the former base) is      designated as a HUBZone, which is a much smaller area than      the census tract basis. Furthermore, many closed military      installations do not have a substantial amount of residential      areas from which to draw sufficient future employees (35%)      for the businesses desiring to locate on those properties.       In addition the above, the Small Business Act established a      five year time-frame for the duration of the HUBZone from the      actual date of base closure. This is of particular concern      given that the actual transfer of properties from the      military services to the base closure communities often      occurs many years following closure. Thus, these properties      are not available for business development until actually      transferred.       The net effect is that eligible HUB businesses seeking new      or expanded opportunities on closed installations cannot meet      these requirements and thus are not able to realize the      HUBZone benefits for BRAC'd installations as envisioned by      Congress. This issue exacerbates the difficulties for us and      other similar communities to overcome the devastating      economic effects of base closures.       In order to make the BRAC HUBZone designation an effective      economic development tool for Brunswick Landing, as well as      all the other closed installations across the country, the      attached amendment language to the existing law is      recommended. It should be noted that these recommendations do      not create a new program, require additional government      spending, or increase federal contracting goals.       Thank you for your service to our Country and the State of      Maine and your thoughtful consideration of this request.           Sincerely,                                               Steven H. Levesque,     Executive Director.                                  ____                                            Heather D. Blease,                                  Freeport, ME, December 12, 2012.     Hon. Susan Collins,     U.S. Senator, Dirksen Senate Office Building,     Washington, DC.       Dear Senator Collins: I have established a new contact      center business that focuses on providing service to the      federal government. A key strategy for our success hinges      upon the establishment of my business as a HUBZone certified      entity.       As a native of Brunswick, Maine, I am keenly interested in      locating my business at the former Brunswick Naval Air      Station, now called Brunswick Landing. As a BRAC facility,      the SBA rules limit the boundary of the HUBZone      geographically to base property which has very few housing      units.       In order to achieve HUBZone certification, 35% of my      employees need to reside within the HUBZone.       As the law is written, I cannot locate at Brunswick Landing      and hope to achieve HUBZone status. The BRAC HUBZone law is      flawed as written. Our Congress attempted to create an      economic development vehicle to help communities recover from      base closures, but unless the law is tweaked, the HUBZone      designation is meaningless.       Please help modify the existing definition for BRAC      HUBZones by broadening the boundary of the HUBZone for closed      military installations to include the surrounding community.      In the case of my company, it provides me with HUBZone      employees to put to work so I can meet the HUBZone      certification requirements.       If the law is changed, I will locate my business at      Brunswick Landing and provide hundreds of jobs to the      economically depressed area. Otherwise, I will need to seek      out other alternatives.       Thank you for your service to our country, the State of      Maine and your interest in helping small businesses thrive.           With greatest respect,                                                Heather D. Blease,     CEO, Savi Systems, LLC.                          ____________________
