 President, this amendment proposes to offer a 50-percent tax credit for employers of reservists to encourage differential pay.  This amendment does not benefit those who are self-employed and provides little benefit to small businesses with little equity.  In addition, nearly 80 percent of the cost of the military tax bill, which we have already passed in the Senate, is dedicated to reservists with the above-the-line deduction that was included because Senator DeWine pushed very hard for it.  The amendment is paid for by reducing the dividend exclusion which is essential to our growth package; in other words, to keep a well balanced growth package.  So the amendment I see as an attack on the jobs and growth bill, and I ask that it not be adopted.  Mr. President, I raise a point of order on germaneness, that the amendment is not germane. The point of order comes under section 305(b)(2) of the Congressional Budget Act.
