Madam Speaker, I move to suspend the rules and agree to the resolution (H. Res. 233) recognizing the 60th Anniversary of Victory in Europe (V-E) Day During World War II, as amended.  The Clerk read as follows:                              H. Res. 233       Whereas on May 7, 1945, at General Dwight Eisenhower's      headquarters in Reims, France, a representative of the German      High command signed the document of surrender,      unconditionally surrendering all air, land and sea forces to      the Allies on May 8, ending the war in Europe;       Whereas Western Europe and the United States have      traditionally celebrated May 8 as the day of the Allied      ``Victory in Europe'' over Germany, or ``V-E Day'' ;       Whereas May 8, 2005, marks the 60th anniversary of V-E Day;       Whereas V-E Day was a day for which millions had worked and      fought and prayed and died during that terrible war;       Whereas this day marked the end of six years of misery,      suffering, courage, and endurance across the world;       Whereas the United States Armed Forces fought with their      Allies to free occupied nations and their victory in Europe      represented the triumph of good over unspeakable evil, and      the promise of a peaceful future for a Europe ravaged by the      bloodiest war in its history;       Whereas V-E Day marked the culmination of the efforts of      many different nations in the Allied forces who were united      by the common quest for peace and justice and who fought      valiantly to liberate occupied countries and to prevent      Hitler's onslaught;       Whereas the more than 4,000,000 members of the United      States Armed Forces deployed in Europe, the largest United      States military force ever committed to any theater of      operation, were joined by millions of members of the armed      forces of other Allied nations, and together provided the      essential strength and made innumerable sacrifices to end the      war in Europe;       Whereas almost 200,000 members of the United States Armed      Forces gave their lives in battle and hundreds of thousands      were wounded in the European theater during World War II;       Whereas European countries have erected many monuments and      plaques commemorating their liberation by the United States      and its Allies during World War II;       Whereas the 60th anniversary of V-E Day in 2005 will be      marked by many commemorative events by citizens of the United      States and many other nations; and       Whereas the courage and sacrifice of the members of the      United States Armed Forces and of many other nations who      served with distinction to save the world from tyranny and      aggression should always be remembered: Now, therefore, be it       Resolved,  That the House of Representatives recognizes the      60th anniversary of the end of World War II in Europe, joins      with a grateful Nation in expressing respect and appreciation      to the men and women who served in the European theater      during World War II, and remembers and pays tribute to those      Americans who made the ultimate sacrifice and gave their life      for their country.
