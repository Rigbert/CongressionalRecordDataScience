Speaker, America lost its foremost science advocate, a statesman, and a tremendous human being when my colleague and friend, George Brown, passed away. As a Member and later Chairman and Ranking Member of the Science Committee, George was a forceful and tireless advocate for science. Whether it was protecting a science account from attack or pushing the newest area of research, George was a true friend to the science community. I feel both sadness and inspiration when I look up to see George's likeness watching over the proceedings in the Science Committee's hearing room. Sadness at our loss but inspired to continue building upon the successes George made possible. I am hopeful that his portrait will serve as a constant reminder of George's commitment to our nation's science programs, his leadership, his friendship, his humor, and his compassion throughout his many years of service.  George's integrity and the strength of his word were never in doubt. He could be a forceful advocate when needed and a bipartisan friend when deserved. Perhaps what was most remarkable about George was that even after sitting through hundreds and hundreds of presentations by researchers around the nation, George never lost a genuine delight in hearing of new science breakthroughs that would revolutionize tomorrow's world. When tomorrow's scientists find their next breakthrough discovery, I know in my heart that George will delight in their achievement.  Although George served for eighteen terms in the House, a remarkable achievement in itself, I don't think he ever enjoyed looking back as much as he cherished looking ahead. Earlier this year, George remarked, ``I've thought that science could be the basis for a better world, and that's what I've been trying to do all these years.'' Certainly George made his own strong contribution to making this a better world.  I ask all Members, to keep George's spirit alive as we proceed with our responsibilities during this Congress--with his respect for this institution foremost in our minds and his joy of public service and his friendship in our hearts.                          ____________________
