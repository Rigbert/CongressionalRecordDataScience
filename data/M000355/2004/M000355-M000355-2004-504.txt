 President, if there is no further business to come before the Senate, I ask unanimous consent that the Senate stand in adjournment under the previous order.  There being no objection, the Senate, at 6:56 p.m., adjourned until Tuesday, May 4, 2004, at 9:45 a.m.                          ____________________
