The Senator from Iowa is prepared to offer an amendment, and another behind him. I am hoping we will be able to get these amendments so we can perhaps have some stacked votes tonight--maybe 6 o'clock or so--whenever the leadership on both sides agrees that is the appropriate time.  I will state again how significant it is we pass this bill. It will be very costly in terms of dollars if we do not get it completed. There are a lot of programs incorporated in this lengthy bill that I do not agree with and we debated them for 3 years. I had to lose some and I won some.  This is one I don't think there is one member of the committee I chair of 10 Republicans and 8 Democrats who will say they got everything they wanted. Maybe that is a sign that we did a pretty fair job. We need to have the bill passed.  We need to do what we can to avoid another extension. An extension causes all of the 10 problems I outlined a few minutes ago. There is a clear right and wrong in this case. I suggest the absence of a quorum.
