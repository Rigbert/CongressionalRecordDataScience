 To our colleagues who are wondering why we are debating and not offering the amendment, if I offer the amendment, it will be second-degreed and our colleagues will never have an opportunity to vote or make a statement whether or not they want to continue the funds to reduce class sizes. We are here to continue to talk about the bill. I am happy to do that. I have a lot to say. I know a number of my colleagues do as well.
