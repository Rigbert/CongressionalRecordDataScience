 President, I rise today to pay tribute to a young man from Iowa who lost his life in service to his country. On Monday, May 26, 2003, Private Kenneth Nalley was killed in a tragic accident on a road in Iraq. Kenny was only 19 years old. As the town of Hamburg, Iowa mourns the loss of one of its sons, I know I join many of my fellow Iowans in extending my prayers and sympathy to Kenny's family. Private Nalley is the third soldier from Iowa to be killed since the start of Operation Iraqi Freedom. His death reminds us that a great many American men and women are still puttingthemselves in harm's way every day in answer to their country's call. Kenny joined the Army right out of high school in order to gain experience and further his prospects for a career in law enforcement. Like all who serve in our armed forces, he knew that meant he might be asked to risk his life to defend American interests. I salute Kenny Nalley's sense of public service, and I honor his sacrifice today. The announcement I received from the Army regarding his death said it best. It reads ``Pvt. Nalley epitomizes the best of our country--a brave soldier-- who exhibited courage, selfless service, and honor in abundance. His ultimate sacrifice has contributed immeasurably to the freedom and security of both Iraq and the world.'' I ask that all my colleagues in the Senate remember Kenny Nalley today, and all those who have given their lives in the service of our great Nation.                          ____________________
