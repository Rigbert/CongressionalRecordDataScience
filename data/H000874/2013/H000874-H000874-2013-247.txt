I look forward to seeing the Labor-Health bill on the floor and seeing how he comes to those priorities because I think it is very important.  Before I close--and I think he has left the floor--but I do want to mention that today is the day on which John Dingell of Michigan becomes the longest-serving Member of Congress in the history of the Congress, since 1789. He is one of the great legislators with whom many of us have served, and I know that next week we will be having an opportunity on the floor to have all Members, or many Members, participate in recognizing his service.  My staff tells me maybe we're going to do it tomorrow and not next week, but most Members will be here next week, and I expect that they'll be saying something at that time as well.                              {time}  1140  I know the majority leader joins me in congratulating our colleague and our friend, John Dingell, on his extraordinary service to not only the Congress of the United States, but to the American people.
