Speaker, it is with great pride and enthusiasm that I wish to congratulate an exceptional group of Northwest Indiana residents. The Lake County Chapter of the American Red Cross will be honoring several local heroes for their bravery and selfless acts of kindness during the ``In Honor of Heroes'' banquet on Thursday, September 9, 2004 at the Avalon Manor in Merrillville, Indiana. They will also be recognizing two fallen military heroes and two fallen police heroes.  The First Congressional District is proud to commend the following youth for their acts of bravery. Thomas Jones displayed courage when he dialed 9-1-1 while his mother was having a seizure. The 9-1-1 dispatcher, Debbie Kochis, kept 5-year-old Thomas calm and feeling secure while she dispatched help. Thomas bravely responded to Kochis's request for information needed to get help and followed her instructions to help save his mother. Five-year-old Bobby Bodnar's grandmother fell unconscious while on a shopping trip. Bobby freed himself from the car seat and tried to help her. The young hero stayed calm, showed an employee where his grandmother was, and gave valuable information to the police. While on his way to school, Mike Spurlock came upon an accident scene. Assisted by other heroic citizens, Mike broke out one of the automobile's windows and removed the badly injured victim from the car. After the incident, he continued on to school as usual to take his final exam.  The Red Cross is also recognizing the following Northwest Indiana residents for using their training in life saving techniques to assist victims in life threatening situations. Mr. Daniel Luczak, an EMT, administered care to an injured worker which reduced further injury to the victim's lumbar spine. Lt. Yvonne Hogan Foster used CPR to revive a 90-year-old female who was unconscious. The tragic outcome of this heroic attempt to save a life should not diminish the fact that Lt. Hogan-Foster reacted quickly to the situation and put her lifesaving training to use. Dave Mays and Kandis Pigg are lifeguards trained and certified by the YMCA. Dave Mays activated the YMCA's emergency procedure and safely rescued a young man in the water complaining of severe back pain. Ms. Kandis Pigg's training in delivering oxygen proved to be a lifesaving technique after she was able to remove a man from the water who complained of shortness of breath. This heroic rescue resulted in the man's full recovery. The members of the Courage Aktion Club feel that they are in good hands whenever James Harris is around. While having lunch, James noticed a woman choking and performed the Heimlich maneuver to dislodge the food. A week later, while riding the bus, James helped a passenger who was having a seizure. Without the courageous efforts of these individuals: Karl Samuel, Higinio Martinez, Hank Carmona, Brian Gregory, Paul Jacquez, Sam Rhoten, and Bill Curtis, a heart attack victim would not have survived. Their CPR/AED training revived the victim until the EMS arrived.  Carrie Clemens, Laura Layman, Stacey Gibbons, Sarah Udchitz, Stephen Kolodziej, Adam Wythe, and Matt Plassman were all working at a local Schoops restaurant when a tragic automobile accident occurred. The driver of a pickup truck suffered a fatal heart attack that resulted in the truck crashing into the restaurant. The heroic employees stepped right in to assist and aid the injured. Also being recognized are Randy Edmaiston and Martin Chelich, two courageous men that entered the home of a senior citizen while her home was on fire and evacuated the woman. Because of this selfless act, the woman's life was saved.  It takes dedication and hard work to make a blood drive a success. Hyles Anderson College and First Baptist Church work together to make blood drives successful. Due to the hard work of Kris Grafton, Karen Basham, Pastor Jack Schaap, and all the others involved, they have increased their blood collections by 40 percent and helped save 1,026 lives. Blood donors like Beth Groff truly give the gift of life. She has graciously donated 18 gallons of blood.  John D. Amos II and Luis A. Perez were two residents of Northwest Indiana who sacrificed their lives during Operation Iraqi Freedom, and their deaths come as a difficult setback to a community already shaken by the realities of war. These fallen soldiers will forever remain heroes in the eyes of this community, and this country.  I would like to also honor Trooper Scott A. Patrick and Detective William Rolniak, Jr. Trooper Patrick was the 40th Indiana State Police Officer to be killed in the line of duty. While stopping to aid a stranded motorist, he was shot by the motorist who had stolen the car. Detective William Rolniak, Jr, a 14-year police veteran, was killed in the line of duty when a suspect took him as a hostage and later killed him.  Mr. Speaker, I ask that you and my other distinguished colleagues join me in commending and acknowledging these outstanding heroes of Northwest Indiana. Their bravery and selfless deeds to others are worthy of the highest honor and respect.                          ____________________
