 President, I would like to take a moment to congratulate my friend, Leslie County clerk James Lewis, on his upcoming retirement from public service. For more than three decades, James has worked for his neighbors in local government, earning respect throughout the county and the Commonwealth. As he prepares to leave the Leslie County Clerk's Office, I want to thank him for his tireless work and dedication to our State.  First elected in 1985, James has been a fixture of his community for more than a generation. Of the many responsibilities of a county clerk, perhaps the most important is the operation and safeguarding of Americans' access to the ballot box. Throughout his service as county clerk, James has overseen nearly 60 elections, including every office from jailer to the President of the United States. Although the technologies involved may have changed, his commitment to his office has never wavered. I have had the pleasure to work with James on a number of projects throughout the years. His passion for the people of Leslie County is apparent in everything he does, and they have been served well by his time in office.  James became a respected leader among all 120 county clerks throughout the Commonwealth. From 1994 to this year, he served as the chairman of the Kentucky County Clerk's Association Election Committee, administrating election training for all other clerks for more than 20 years. Between 1999-2000, James served as the association's president. One of the association's initiatives, which James helped found, is the Help A Veteran Everyday, H.A.V.E., Program. James spearheaded one of their projects, which involves repurposing license plates into bird houses. The finished products can then be purchased at the clerk's offices. Through these efforts, James is helping support Kentucky's men and women who served our Nation in uniform.  Whatever retirement may hold in store for James, I wish him all the best. Perhaps he will spend more time on his hobbies, like gardening or fishing. I have no doubt that he will be enjoying more time with his wife, Betty, daughters, Danika and Wendy, and grandchildren, Kelsey and R.J. As he begins his well-deserved retirement, I would like to congratulate James on a distinguished career. I urge my Senate colleagues to join me in thanking James for his remarkable public service to Leslie County and to the Commonwealth of Kentucky.                          ____________________
