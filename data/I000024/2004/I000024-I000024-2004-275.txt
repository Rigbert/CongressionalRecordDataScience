President, I look forward to working with the Senator from Virginia, as I always do. I think many of us who came to serve in the Senate who were either Governors or mayors in major cities somehow have this obstacle or obstruction in our minds on any kind of mandates. I plead guilty to that. I think other Members might oppose the amendment, such as the Senator from Missouri who was a Governor. That is primarily the reason.  I would be happy to work with the Senator from Virginia, and I think he has an excellent point. I know his heart is right and he is trying to save lives. That is why we all love him so much.
