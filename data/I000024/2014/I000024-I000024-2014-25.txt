All of the environmentalists or extreme environmentalists who are trying to stop or fighting this war against fossil fuels, they ought to be rejoicing that we have this technology now.  When we talk about the number of wells, it it is now past 1 million wells that have been drilled using hydraulic fracturing. By their own admission, there has never been one documented case of groundwater contamination. So the answer is that there is no reason not to do it.  This is our opportunity to be independent. We could be independent in a matter of weeks if we had the opportunity to export.  It is not just private land, it is private and State land. All of the increase we have had, the 63 percent we talk about, is all private and State land. How is it possible that increase could take place on State land while on Federal land it goes down 6 percent? That tells the whole story.
