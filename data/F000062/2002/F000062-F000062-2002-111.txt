 President, I rise today to pay tribute to my dear friend and a true Hollywood legend: Lew Wasserman, a man who stood as a giant among giants. On Monday, June 3rd, Lew passed away at his home from complications of a stroke.  My heart goes out to his wife Edie, daughter Lynne Kay Wasserman, his grandson Casey and granddaughter Carol Leif, and to members of his extended family.  Lew was a great pioneer in the entertainment industry. He began his career in show business while in high school, working as an usher at the Palace Theater in Cleveland.  Together Lew and Dr. Jules Stein built the world's largest talent agency representing such legends as Bette Davis, James Stewart, Alfred Hitchcock, Tommy Dorsey, Kay Kyser, and Errol Flynn to name a few.  He also built a conglomerate of motion picture and television companies that produced the memorable hit movies ``American Graffiti'', ``ET--theExtra Terrestrial'' and ``Schindler's List.''  Without question Lew Wasserman was one of the most powerful and influential people in the entertainment industry, and his presence and leadership will be truly missed.  I am certain that his memory and good works will live on and continue to touch and improve the lives of people everywhere.  To list Lew's accomplishments does not come near to his contributions to our great nation.  Although Lew was unable to afford college, he was inspired to donate millions of dollars for undergraduate scholarships at UCLA. Indeed, few people have been as big-hearted and giving as Lew and his wife Edie.  Together they have given millions of dollars to a myriad of philanthropic causes including the Motion Picture & Television Hospital in Woodland Hills.  Lew was instrumental in building the Dorothy Chandler Music Center in Los Angeles and served as a trustee of the John F. Kennedy Center for the Performing Arts and the California Institute of Technology.  I know that the Wasserman family will continue the legacy of philanthropic giving.  Lew also was very active in the foundation, Research to Prevent Blindness for which he was awarded the Presidential Medal of Freedom, the country's highest civilian honor, by former President Clinton.  Throughout his distinguished career, Lew was often called upon by important leaders in our country including former Presidents Clinton, Reagan, Carter and Lyndon B. Johnson, who wanted him as his Secretary of Commerce.  Despite his retirement, Lew was a man of tireless energy. He was an avid and effective mediator during the labor tensions last year, when major studios were negotiating with writers and actors, Lew privately advised both sides to compromise, avoiding a strike that could have potentially paralyzed the economy of California.  Simply put Lew Wasserman was a great American. His legacy is one of inspiring leadership and extraordinary accomplishment.  I am proud to say Lew was a loyal and good friend. Lew set a high standard and his passing has left an enormous void to fill.  I know the next few weeks and months will be difficult for Edie and the rest of the Wasserman family. But as they grieve, I hope they find comfort in knowing what a wonderful contribution Lew made to the world around him.                          ____________________
