I am very reluctant to do this because the chairman has been very gracious to me.  Senator Collins and I had worked throughout the day on a bipartisan amendment. We would like a few minutes. It has been heard by the committees of jurisdiction, and we would like a few minutes to work with the chairman because if we are going to spend billions, we certainly ought to make sure there is a repetitiveness in the contracting. The Senator from Maine, the Chair of the Governmental Affairs Committee, has done exceptional work in this area. If we could work with the chairman, I think in a few minutes we could work this out.  I am very reluctant to make this reservation.
