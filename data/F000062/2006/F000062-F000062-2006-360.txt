 President, I am offering today private relief legislation to provide lawful permanent residence status to Claudia Marquez Rico, a Mexican national living in Redwood City, CA  Born in Jalisco, Mexico, Claudia was brought to the United States by her parents 16 years ago. Claudia was just 6 years old at the time. She has two younger brothers, Jose and Omar, who came to America with her, and a sister, Maribel, who was born in California and is a U.S. Citizen. America is the only home they know.  Six years ago that home was visited by tragedy. As Mr. and Mrs. Marquez were driving to work early on the morning of October 4, 2000, they were both killed in a horrible traffic accident when their car collided with a truck on an isolated rural road.  The children went to live with their aunt and uncle, Hortencia and Patricio Alcala. The Alcalas are a generous and loving couple. They are U.S. citizens with two children of their own. They took the Marquez children in and did all they could to comfort them in their grief. They supervised their schooling, and made sure they received the counseling they needed, too. The family is active in their parish at Buen Pastor Catholic Church, and Patricio Alcala serves as a youth soccer coach. In 2001, the Alcalas were appointed the legal guardians of the Marquez children.  Sadly, the Marquez family received bad legal representation. At the time of their parents' death, Claudia and Jose were minors, and qualified for special immigrant juvenile status. This category was enacted by Congress to protect children like them from the hardship that would result from deportation under such extraordinary circumstances, when a State court deems them to be dependents due to abuse, abandonment or neglect. Today, their younger brother Omar is on track to lawful permanent residence status as a special immigrant juvenile. Unfortunately, the family's previous lawyer failed to secure this relief for Claudia, and she has now reached the age of majority without having resolved her immigration status.  I should note that their former lawyer, Walter Pineda, is currently answering charges on 29 counts of professional incompetence and 5 counts of moral turpitude for mishandling immigration cases and appears on his way to being disbarred.  I am offering legislation on Claudia's behalf because I believe that, without it, this family would endure an immense and unfair hardship. Indeed, without this legislation, this family will not remain a family for much longer.  Despite the adversity they encountered, Claudia and Jose finished school and now work together in a pet grooming store in Redwood City, where Claudia is the store manager. They support themselves, and they are dedicated to their community and devoted to their family. In fact, last year Claudia became the legal guardian of her 14-year-old sister Maribel, who lives with her and Jose at their home in Redwood City. Omar, now 17 years old, continues to live with the Alcalas so as not to interrupt his studies at Aragon High School in San Mateo. Again, Maribel is a U.S. citizen, and Omar is eligible for a green card.  Claudia has no close relatives in Mexico. She has never visited Mexico, and she was so young when she was brought to America that she has no memories of it. How can we expect her to start a new life there now?  It would be a grave injustice to add to this family's misfortune by tearing these siblings apart. This is a close family, and they have come to rely on each other heavily in the absence of their deceased parents. This bill will prevent the added tragedy of another wrenching separation.  I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be printed in the Record along with a letter from Claudia and Jose Marquez Rico.  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in the Record, as follows:                                S. 2813       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of      the United States of America in Congress assembled,     SECTION 1.

Senator Dianne Feinstein,     U.S. Congress,     Washington, DC.       Dear Senator Feinstein: We are writing to request your      assistance in introducing a private bill in the United States      Senate on our behalf. We are currently in deportation      proceedings before the Immigration Court in San Francisco,      California. We are twenty-one and eighteen years old      respectively. We have two other siblings, Omar, sixteen, and      Maribel, twelve.       Our parents entered the United States without documents in      1990. We were very young at the time and don't remember      entering the United States or ever living in Mexico. Our life      in the United States is the only thing we have ever known, it      is where our family, friends, and community are and have      always been.       In October 2000 our parents were both killed in a terrible      car accident. We were so sad to suddenly not have our parents      and scared about what our future would bring. After the      accident we went to live with our aunt and uncle, Hortencia      and Patricio Alcala, in San Mateo, California and they became      our legal guardians. It was difficult to adjust to life      without our parents. We lived in a new home, in a new      environment, and attended different schools with new people.      Everything in our lives had changed.       Before their deaths, our parents had a case before the      Immigration Court in San Francisco, California and we were      included in that case. Our youngest sister Maribel was born      here in the United States and so she is a citizen and not      part of the case. We know that despite the deaths of our      parents that case continues and that we may be deported to      Mexico. We have a lawyer who is trying to help us with our      case, Angela Bean. She said she will be able to help our      brother Omar in his case because he is still a minor but that      there are few options for us to remain in the United States      legally. We are trying to find a solution for our case but      are scared we may be deported before we are able to do so.       Our parents came to this country because they wanted a      better future for us and all we want is the chance to have      the kind of opportunities they sought for us. Jose Elvis      wants to study mechanics and then open his own shop and      Claudia wants to go to college. All of our dreams would be      lost if we had to return to Mexico. We have no family there      and no way of supporting ourselves. Even though we were born      there, we came to the United States at such a young age it's      as if we have never been there before.       We not only worry about our future, but about our sister      Maribel if we were forced to go back to Mexico. She is the      youngest and we want to be here for her as she grows up and      to protect her and teach her things. All we have is each      other now and we don't want to be separated from the family      we have left.       We ask for your help so that we can remain in the United      States and so we can continue to grow and be surrounded by      the people and places we know and love, Our lives have been      very difficult since the deaths of our parents and we hope      that we can remain in this country where we have the      opportunities our parents wanted for us and the family      support that we need.           Sincerely,     Claudia Marquez-Rico.     Jose Elvis Marquez-Rico.                                 ______                                       By
