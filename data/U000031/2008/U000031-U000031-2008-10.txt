Speaker, we need to send the signal across America that we are, indeed, going to get serious about this issue. And I was glad that a few moments ago, Speaker Pelosi referenced Mr. Pickens' plan, and I sure would like to vote on that. I sure would like to talk about all the things that he wants to do, because it is more than just one. We cannot afford to not have a plan to increase supply. In 2007, production fell from 125,000 barrels a day worldwide, while demand grew by a million barrels a day.  I voted a couple of weeks ago to halt oil from going into SPR. But I believe seriously that it would be terribly unwise to now remove oil from that reserve.  This bill is going to hurt us if it is enacted, long-term, particularly if there is a disruption. It is a Band-Aid, at best. It will remove our insurance policy in case something even worse happens.  Last week, in my district, gasoline fell from $4.21 a gallon to, a week later, earlier this week, to under $4. It was reflective of the price of oil at the barrel, where that fell from $140 a barrel to $125 today. Why is that?  One of the reasons I am convinced that the world price of oil fell was because President Bush took the very first step by saying that he would lift the moratorium on offshore drilling. But of course we know it is a two-step process. The executive branch and the legislative branch have to act.  But what happened was, it got the attention of those speculators on Wall Street. They might have said, I am convinced that they did, maybe Congress is going to do something. The President has taken the first step. Maybe the Congress will follow suit.  So it was no accident that the price at the barrel head fell dramatically from $140 to under $125 today. Let's send a signal to the American public that we are going to get serious about this. Let's defeat this bill.
