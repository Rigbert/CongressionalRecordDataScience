  I say to Senator Sarbanes, through the course of the debate on the bankruptcy bill it has become clear that there are many Senators who have concerns about numerous aspects of the credit card industry.  I want to indicate for the record that I share many of these concerns. Furthermore, I want to point out that I am aware of his particular concerns as well as those of Senators Kyl and Feinstein.
