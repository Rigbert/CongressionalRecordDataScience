Mr. Chairman, the amendment I am offering today is both pro-life and anticoercion. It is essentially identical to the one that the House adopted to the American Overseas Interests Act, H.R. 1561, last month. The amendment would do nothing more and nothing less than reinstate the ``wall of separation'' between family planning and abortion, and particularly coercive abortion, which was torn down 2 years ago by the Clinton administration.  The prochild, provoluntarism policy that my amendment would reinstate was the law of the land for a decade. It was repeatedly upheld by the Federal courts against a wide range of both statutory and constitutional challenges brought by the abortion industry. Recent experience suggests that this policy is needed now, more than ever before.  Mr. Chairman, the government of the People's Republic of China, as I think more and more Members are realizing, routinely compels women to abort their, quote, unauthorized children. The usual method is intense persuasion, using all of the economic, social, and psychological tools a totalitarian state has at its disposal. When these methods fail, the women are taken physically to abortion mills, often in handcuffs, and coerced to have abortions. Sometimes this happens very late in the pregnancy: the baby's skull is crushed with forceps, or lethal chemical shots are administered into the soft part of the skull.  Mr. Chairman, forced abortion was properly construed to be a crime against humanity at the Nuremberg war crime tribunals, and again it is being used pervasively throughout the People's Republic of China. Population control organizations, with the United Nations Population Fund at the helm, are promoting population control in China and have had a hand-in-glove relationship with the hardliners in the PRC.  As a matter of fact, I would remind Members that during the Reagan and Bush years we did not provide funding to those organizations because of that kind of complicity in these heinous crimes against women. It is not just that the child is being killed. It is also that the woman is being exploited in this very cruel manner.  I would ask all of my colleagues to take a look at the report by Amnesty International, released just yesterday. It is under the heading ``Human Rights Violations Resulting from Enforced Birth Control.'' They point out that birth control has been compulsory in China since 1979. Women must have official permission to bear children.  Mr. Chairman, the report in its entirety is as follows: Women in China--A Preliminary Report From Amnesty International, June                                   1995     human rights violations resulting from enforced birth control       Birth control has been compulsory in China since 1979. . .      . Government demographers set a target for the stabilization      of the population by the year 2000. The target currently      stands at 1.3 billion, which they claim can only be achieved      through ``strict measures''.       The policy involves the strict control of the age of      marriage and the timing and number of children for each      couple. Women must have official permission to bear children.      Birth control is enforced through quotas allocated to each      work or social unit (such as school, factory or village). The      quotas fix the number of children that may be born annually      in each unit. Local party officials (cadres) have always      monitored the system, but since 1991 they have been held      directly responsible for its implementation through ``target      management responsibility contracts''. A cadre's performance      is now evaluated not just on the region's economic      performance but also on its implementation of the birth      control policy. Cadres may lose bonuses or face penalties if      they fail to keep within quotas.       The policy has become known as the ``one-child'' policy. In      fact, it is more complex than that and is applied differently      in various areas. While the authorities issue ideological      directives, targets and guidelines, at present the detailed      regulations, sanctions and incentives are left almost      entirely to the county level administration, who determine      them ``according to the local situation''. In most regions,      urban couples may have only one child unless their child is      disabled, while rural couples may have a second if the first      is a girl. A third child is ``prohibited'' in most available      regulations. Regulations covering migrant women indicate that      abortion is mandatory if the woman does not return to her      home region. Abortion is also mandated for unmarried women.       The authorities in Beijing initially insisted that ethnic      groups with populations of less than 10 million were exempt      from the one child policy or even from family planning      entirely. It is clear, however, that controls have been      applied to these groups for many years, including more      stringent sanctions for urban residents and ``prohibitions''      on a third child. There have also been reports since 1988 of      controls extending to enforcement of one-child families, in      particular for state employees. Currently, as with the rest      of the population, specific regulations and their      implementation are decided by ``Autonomous Regions and      Provinces where the minorities reside''.       Couples who have a child ``above the quota'' are subject to      sanctions, including heavy fines. In rural areas, there have      been reports of the demolition of the houses of people who      failed to pay fines. Peer pressure is also used as work units      may be denied bonuses if the child quota is exceeded. State      employees may be dismissed or demoted. Psychological      intimidation and harassment is also commonly used to      ``persuade'' pregnant woman to have an abortion. Groups of      family planning officials may visit them in the middle of the      night to this end. In the face of such pressure, women facing      unwanted abortions or sterilization are likely to feel they      have no option but to comply.                    amnesty international's concerns       Amnesty International takes no position on the official      birth control policy in China, but it is concerned about the      human rights violations which result from it, many of which      affect women in particular. It is concerned at reports that      forced abortion and sterilization have been carried out by or      at the instigation of people acting in an official capacity,      such as family planning officials, against women who are      detained, restricted or forcibly taken from their homes to      have the operation. Amnesty International considers that in      these circumstances such actions amount to cruel, inhuman and      degrading treatment of detainees or restricted persons by      government officials.       The use of forcible measures is indicated in official      family planning reports and regulations, and in Chinese press      coverage. Amnesty International also has testimony from      former family planning officials as well as individuals who      were themselves subjected to such cruel, inhuman and      degrading treatment.       Details of county level regulations are difficult to      obtain. Most available documents are ambiguous and full of      euphemisms such as the ``combined method'' (abortion and      sterilization) or ``remedial measures'' (abortion). Despite      this, some insight can be gained into the use of coercion      from provincial, as well as county reports. For example, in      1993 family planning officials in Jiangxi Province stated:      ``Women who should be subjected to contraception and      sterilization measures will have to comply''. Regulations      published in January 1991 for Gonghe county in Qinghai (which      has a substantial Tibetan population) state ``the birth      prevention operation will be carried out before the end of      1991 or in any case within the year 1992 and no excuses or      pretexts will be entertained''.       In a 1993 interview with Amnesty International, a former      family planning official described the threat of violence      used to implement the policy:       ``Several times I have witnessed how women who were five to      seven months pregnant were protected by their neighbors and      relatives, some of whom used tools against us. Mostly the      police only had to show their weapons to scare them off.      Sometimes they had to shoot in the air. In only one case did      I see them shoot at hands and feet. Sometimes we had to use      handcuffs.''       Several family planning officials who worked in Liaoning      and Fujian Provinces from the mid-1980's to the mid-1990's      are now in exile and have given testimony. They say they      detained women who were pregnant with ``out of plan      children'' in storerooms or offices for as long as they      resisted being ``persuaded'' to have an abortion. This could      last several days. One official reported being able to      transfer such women to the local detention centre for up to      two months if they remained intransigent. Once a woman      relented, the official would escort her to the local hospital      and wait until the doctor performing the abortion had signed      a statement that the abortion had been carried out. Unless      the woman was considered too weak, it was normal for her to      be sterilized straight after the abortion.       A refugee from Guangdong Province described how he and his      wife had suffered under the birth-control policy. The couple      had their first child in 1982 and were subsequently denied      permission to have another. In 1987 the authorities      discovered that his wife was pregnant and forced her to have      an abortion. In 1991 she became pregnant again and to conceal      it, the couple moved to live with relatives in another      village. In September that year local militia and family      planning officials from the city of Foshan surrounded the      village in the middle of the night and searched all the      Houses. They forced all the pregnant women into trucks and      drove them to hospital. The refugee's wife gave birth on the      journey and a doctor at the hospital reportedly killed the      baby with an injection. The other women had forced abortions.       The implementation of the birth-control policy has also      resulted in the detention and ill-treatment of relatives of      those attempting to avoid abortion or sterilization.      Significantly, the Supreme People's Court felt the need to      specifically outlaw the taking of hostages by government      officials in a directive in 1990. However, the practice      continues, as shown by a series of reports since late 1992      from Hebei Province.       Journalists from Hong Kong visited Zhao county, Hebei      province, in November 1992 while a birth-control campaign was      in progress. They saw villagers detained outside the county      government offices in freezing temperatures who were under      arrest for non-payment of fines for illegal birth. Villagers      reported that those who could not pay the heavy annual fine      had their property confiscated or that their relatives were      held hostage until the money was paid.       In January 1994 an official Chinese newspaper published a      letter from Xiping county, Hebei Province, complaining that      the reputation of the People's Emergency Militia (minbing      ying ji fendui) was being ruined because cadres were misusing      them to enforce unpopular family planning policies.       In April 1994 the annual review of family planning work in      Hebei Province mentioned the use of ``law enforcement      contingents'' and admitted that some cadres believed that any      method was acceptable in pursuit of the family planning      policy. Such cadres had ``resorted to oversimplified and      rigid measures and even violated laws . . . thus affecting      the party-populace and cadre-populace relations''. It is not      clear what, if any, action was taken against these abuses,      and violations have persisted in the province since then.       For example, villagers in Fengjiazhuang and Longtiangou in      Lingzhou country, Hebei Province, alleged they were targeted      in a birth-control campaign initiated in early 1994 under the      slogan ``better to have more graves than more than one      child''. Ninety per cent of resident in the villages are      Catholic and many have been fined in the past for having more      children than permitted because they reject on religious      grounds abortion and sterilization.       An unmarried woman was one of those targeted. One of her      brothers had fled the village with his wife fearing      sterilization as they had four children. The sister had      adopted one of their children and was detained several times,      including once in early November 1994 when she was held for      seven days in an attempt to force her brother and his wife to      return and pay more fines. She was taken to the county      government office and locked in a basement room with 12 to 13      other women and men. She was blindfolded, stripped naked,      with her hands tied behind her back, and beaten with an      electric baton. Several of those detained with her were      suspended and beaten, and some were detained for several      weeks.       A report by the Union of Catholic Asian News stated that      other villages had been targeted in a similar way. Despite      complaints to the county and provincial government and to the      people's procurator, the family planning teams ignored the      procurator's order to stop their actions, blaming the      Catholics for ``causing problems''.       The taking and ill-treating of hostages by family planning      officials was also reported in Fujian Province, in 1994. An      elderly woman who lived near Quanzhou city was detained for      three months when her daughter-in-law fled from family      planning officials; they had found out she was pregnant with      her second child one year earlier than local regulations on      both spacing allowed. The elderly woman was reportedly kept      in a cell with little ventilation or light, with 70 other      people, and was only released when she became ill.       Despite assurances from the State Family Planning      Commission that ``coercion is not permitted'', Amnesty      International has been unable to find any instance of      sanctions taken against officials who perpetrated such      violations. This is in stark contrast to the treatment of      those who assist women to circumvent the policies, or who      shelter women from the threat of forced abortion and      sterilization.       In December 1993 a district court in Guangzhou reportedly      sentenced a man to 10 years' imprisonment and three years'      deprivation of political rights for his part in a ``save the      babies and save the women group'', which had assisted 20      women to give birth in excess of the plan. The court      reportedly claimed that by his actions he had entered into      rivalry with the party and state, and had therefore committed      counter-revolutionary crimes as well as jeopardizing social      order.       The same month Yu Jian'an, the deputy director of the No. 2      People's Hospital in Anyanbg, Henan Province, was sentenced      to death for collecting bribes of 190,000 yuan for issuing      bogus sterilization papers. The hospital affairs director,      Sun Chansheng, was sentenced to death with a two-year      reprieve, and four others were given sentences of five years'      to life imprisonment in connection with the offense.       In the light of the information available about serious      human rights violations resulting from the enforcement of the      birth control policy and the lack of explicit and unequivocal      prohibition in published regulations of coercive methods      which result in such violations, Amnesty International calls      on the Chinese Government to include such provisions in      relevant regulations. It also calls on the authorities to      take effective measures to ensure that officials who      perpetrate, encourage or condone such human rights violations      during birth control enforcement are brought to justice.  Let me just remind Members we are talking about a country where children are declared illegal simply because they do not fit into a certain quota that has been articulated and promulgated by the government. Couples who have a child above the quota are subject to sanctions, Amnesty International writes, including heavy fines. They talk about psychological and physical pressure. They talk about degrading treatment, the use of handcuffs, detentions. They also get into the fact that not only are they just focusing on the women and their husbands, they also go after other relatives who try to shield and protect some kind of safe haven for their sisters or daughters who are the object of a forced abortion, and throw them into jail as well.  This report from Amnesty International, which takes no position on the right-to-life issue, the defense of the unborn, is another nail in the coffin of the PRC's heinous practice of forced abortion and forced sterilization.  As my colleagues know, they also point out there is a movement under way in some of the provinces where they say--and this is a slogan used by the government--``Better to have more graves than one more child.'' Children are treated very cruelly in China, not by their parents, but by the government, and they are the subject of forced abortion.  Let me also remind Members, too, there is a growing disproportionate number of baby boys vis-a-vis baby girls and young people because of this. When you've only allowed one child, what happens is that many of the families, when they are told that they can only have one, have a sonogram. If a baby girl is detected, that baby girl is killed, and now there are tens of millions of missing girls in the People's Republic of China.  Where are the feminists on this? Why are they not speaking out against this cruel practice of targeting baby girls for extinction in the People's Republic of China? They have been abysmally silent in this regard.  Let me also point out, there were some people that were recently, as the Amnesty report points out, thrown into prison for, quote, initiating a save-the-babies and save-the-women's group. The man got 10 years in prison because he tried to defend some of the women in China against this terrible practice. Please read this.  The United Nations Population Fund meanwhile applauds the Chinese programs against all of this evidence, and let me remind Members that it is indeed overwhelming evidence.
