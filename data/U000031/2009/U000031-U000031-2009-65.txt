Diether H. Haenicke, president emeritus and distinguished professor at Western Michigan University.  From 1985 to 1998, Diether served as the University's fifth president, while later serving as interim president for the 2006-07 academic year. During his 13-year presidency, WMU emerged as one of the leading public research institutions in the nation, becoming a pioneer in the life sciences. A lifelong champion of international study, the University's Office of Study Abroad and Department of Foreign Languages flourished during his tenure as well. At the same time, the University also conducted a successful multi-million dollar capital campaign that allowed for the construction of many major buildings across campus as well as the major renovation of several others.  Shortly after retiring from the presidency in 1998, Diether began writing a popular weekly column in the Kalamazoo Gazette, which continued for over 10 years. The subject matter of his column ranged broadly from reflections on his childhood in Germany and his experiences as a naturalized citizen to commentaries on current events and musings on the absurdities of campus life. Like the man himself, these writings often gave the community a moment of pause.  Not only a successful administrator, but a widely respected intellectual in his own right, Diether came to the United States as a Fulbright lecturer in the early 1960s. Having earned a doctorate, magna cum laude, from the University of Munich in 1962, he was the author of hundreds of published works on such diverse matters as comparative literature, history, academic administration, and international study.  In his so-called retirement, Diether remained actively engaged within the University and also involved himself in countless civic and charitable organizations throughout southwest Michigan.  There truly was no better friend to the University and the greater Kalamazoo community than Diether. And while his intellect, humor, and constant guidance will be sorely missed, perhaps the qualities that will be remembered most were his genuine approachability and astonishing gift for friendship. Throughout his career, thousands were fortunate enough to look to Diether as a friend and mentor--incoming first-year students and Members of Congress alike.  May the Haenicke family find comfort in knowing the far-reaching impact that Diether had upon his community and those who were attracted by the university he built up. American higher education has lost one of the best and so have we all lost a supporter of the greater good.                          ____________________
