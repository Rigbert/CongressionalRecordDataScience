President, I rise to speak today in order to recognize the fifth anniversary of the Pulmonary Fibrosis Foundation. This foundation, headquartered in Chicago, strives to educate, advocate, and fund research on pulmonary fibrosis, a terminal lung disease.  A few weeks ago, the Daily Herald, a newspaper based in Arlington Heights, Illinois, published a story about the Lukasik family. John A. Lukasik died at the age of 58, just 9 weeks after he was diagnosed with pulmonary fibrosis. Mr. Lukasik and his family didn't know anyone with the disease, or what to expect from it. After Mr. Lukasik passed away, his daughter Jennifer Bulandr helped organize support groups and joined the Pulmonary Fibrosis Foundation as director of community relations. Mrs. Bulandr wanted to be a part of the solution in helping those with pulmonary fibrosis. The Pulmonary Fibrosis Foundation has provided a channel for her--and many others--to reach this goal.  Since the formation of the Pulmonary Fibrosis Foundation in 2000, it has succeeded in raising crucial funds to research a disease that kills approximately 40,000 people annually. While the progression of the disease, along with factors relating to its origin, are not fully understood, there are a variety of causes--inhaled environmental and occupational pollutants, certain medications or drugs, genetics, and therapeutic radiation contribute to the progression of the disease.  Pulmonary fibrosis has a number of effects on people. It causes shortness of breath, discomfort in the chest, and fatigue. Once scar tissue is formed on the lungs, it cannot be removed. Although medication can limit the inflammation of the lungs caused by pulmonary fibrosis, there is no cure.  The foundation is dedicated to finding a cure and raising awareness about pulmonary fibrosis. It seeks to improve quality of life for the people affected by the disease through support services for patients and their families.  It is my pleasure to congratulate the Pulmonary Fibrosis Foundation on the occasion of its fifth anniversary and to commend the foundation for its efforts to find a cure and help those who suffer from this devastating illness.                          ____________________[Page S6221]From the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]                     PULMONARY FIBROSIS FOUNDATION
