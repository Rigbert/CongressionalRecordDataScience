Speaker, it is with great pleasure that I commend the members of the La Sierra University chapter of Students In Free Enterprise [SIFE] for winning the 1995 International Championship at the SIFE International Exposition in Kansas City, MO, May 19.  The students brought back six giant trophies and $7,500 for their championship title and for their win in four special competitions: Success 200, Halt the Deficit, G.E. Foundation ``Teaching America to Compete,'' and Best In-Depth Education.  This year's presentation team consists of eight students: Andy Wongworawat, Redlands; John-Patterson (J-P) Grant, Newbury Park; Heidi Serena, Long Beach; Maria Lafser, Escondido; Patria Wise, Calmesa; Tamara Talbot, Redlands; Steve Taggart, Colton; and [[Page E 1318]] Ismael Valdez, Hemet. John Thomas, assistant professor of economics and finance and SIFE faculty sponsor, accompanied the team to Kansas City.  ``The Next Generation'' was the title of La Sierra University's winning presentation, which summarizes the 122 projects the team created this year. Project highlights include the ``Find a Dollar in the Debt'' giant sandbox in February trip helped the community visualize the size of the national debt, the annual Adopt-a-Child Christmas Party for area Headstart children, ``Touch the World/Tech'' a child reading and mathematics tutoring program at a local elementary school, homeless shelter employment weekly seminars, a signature campaign to halt the deficit, SIFE collector ``Slam the Deficit'' POGs for elementary schoolchildren, SIFE-Net cyberspace bulletin board and training sessions, ``Rent-a-Brain'' consulting service for local businesses, SIFE ABC publication series to provide fundamental information on important topics to the community such as drug abuse, interest rates, free trade, social responsibility, and the national debt, Strive-On minority role modeling, and many others.  Some 500 students from 50 college and university teams in the eight regions competed at the international exposition. Dow Chemical CEO and Chairman Frank Popoff was the keynote speaker. The 150 judges for competition were CEO's from Fortune 500 companies.  Approximately 75 La Sierra University students led out in this year's projects, which reached some 15,000 schoolchildren and a total of about 33,000 community people. Fifty of the projects were new this year, while more than 70 were continued from previous years.  The La Sierra University SIFE team swept the western regional competition April 10 in San Francisco, winning the Success 2000 Award and the Halt the Deficit Award, along with the Regional Finalist Award. They came home with three regional trophies and $3,500 cash from that competition, and a chance to compete at the international exposition.  The students of the La Sierra University SIFE team have made their community and their Congressman proud. It is truly an honor to represent such fine individuals and I give them the highest compliments. They deserve it.                          ____________________
