 President, I rise today to introduce legislation to strengthen the penalties for organized smuggling of fruits, plants, and vegetables into the United States. A felony statute for agriculture product smuggling is needed to reflect the serious impact these crimes have on our farmers and the entire agriculture industry.  Recent breaches of the agriculture safeguarding system have proven the need for strong criminal penalties for organized smuggling: multiple exotic fruit fly infestations have decimated California and Florida; the Asian longhorn beetle has been found in NewYork and Illinois; the Asian gypsy moth has been introduced in North Carolina and Oregon; and plum pox from Western Europe has devastated peach production in Pennsylvania.  This widespread invasion of foreign species requires a strong federal response. The consequences of failing to adequately combat agriculture smuggling are clear.  Until recently, a 72 square mile area of San Diego was under quarantine due to an infestation of Mexican Fruit Flies. The quarantine effected 1,470 growers of at least 20 specialty crops. The Department of Agriculture has encouraged California producers to grow specialty fruits and vegetables in an effort to reduce the risk of exotic pest introduction from smuggled fruit. Yet, no pre or post harvest treatment for many of these crops has been provided by the USDA. As a result of 2 fruit flies, roughly 150 growers lost virtually their entire harvest--estimated more than $3 million.                      Problems with existing laws  The current system that charges low fines and encourages few prosecutions is not a meaningful deterrent for violators. The USDA can assess a maximum fine of $1,000 for passenger and cargo violations. For an illegal shipper, this is simply a minor cost of doing business and not an effective deterrent.  In addition, the lack of serious penalties for such crimes has resulted in a reduced number of criminal investigations, violators prosecuted, and sentences given to those convicted.  The Office of the Inspector General (OIG) of the USDA, the law enforcement arm of the Department, has placed a low priority on agriculture smuggling violations because they are only misdemeanors and the OIG is forced to devote the bulk of its resources to felony violations. Of the 4,400 investigations completed since October 1, 1994, fewer than 50 involved smuggling.  The sentences given to the relatively few convicted smugglers is also effected by the attitude that this is not a serious crime.  In the State of Washington, two people were caught smuggling agricultural products into the country on numerous occasions. Their third arrest came after 400 pounds of illegal and infested fruit was found in the walls of their station wagon. Despite their repeated crimes, the smugglers received only two days of jail time and a fine of $1,000.                        penalties for violations  This legislation would make it a felony to knowingly and willfully smuggle large amounts of agriculture products into the country. Persons caught smuggling foreign plant pests, more than 50 pounds of plants, more than 5 pounds of plant products, more than 50 pounds of noxious weeds, or possession with intent to distribute these products, would be punished with imprisonment for up to 5 years, a fine of as much as $25,000, or both. Repeat violators would face 10 years of jail time and/or a fine of $50,000.  The legislation would also make smuggling lesser amounts of products a misdemeanor crime punishable by one year in jail and/or a $1,000 fine. Subsequent violations would result in three years of jail time and/or a fine of $10,000.  These penalties will provide law enforcement with the needed tools to investigate, arrest, and prosecute individuals and organizations engaged in the organized smuggling of agriculture products.                          property forfeitures  Another inadequacy in current law is the lack of a specific forfeiture provision for agriculture product smuggling. I have been told of cases at the San Diego border in which a person has been caught smuggling fruits or vegetables across the border. After receiving a slap on the wrist from the judicial system, his truck was returned to him, and he was allowed to return to his criminal occupation with the tools of his trade intact. It is astonishing to me that, not only is the government incapable of punishing illegal traffickers of agriculture products, but we are unable to take even modest steps to prevent recurrences of the same crime.  According to this legislation, anyone convicted of violating the law would forfeit any property used to commit or facilitate the violation. They would also forfeit any money acquired through a violation of the law. The proceeds of the sale of forfeited property would be used to reimburse the costs of the prosecution. Any additional funds would go towards the USDA's interdiction efforts.  I believe that Congress must send a message to our farmers and growers that the federal government is committed to protecting the agriculture sector from invasive species. We can do this by passing this legislation as quickly as possible.  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the bill be printed in the Congressional Record.  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the Record, as follows:                                 S. 118       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of      the United States of America in Congress assembled,     SECTION 1.
