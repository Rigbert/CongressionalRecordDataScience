  My question to my friend from Washington is, if a Member of Congress were sort of cynically approaching this issue and his real goal was to weaken, for example, the Republican National Committee, would he not be pretty safe to advocate some kind of new restrictions on independent expenditures and issue advocacy since there is literally no chance the courts would uphold it and take the gamble that a court might, never having ruled in a whole area of party soft money, weaken the parties with a ruling saying it is possible to federalize the two parties; organized labor would then, as the biggest force engaging in issue advocacy, still be totally unrestricted, as you and I think they should be. And since the Republican National Committee responds to those issue advocacy campaigns with its soft money, would not such an approach benefit substantially, it could be argued, our dear colleagues on the other side of the aisle for whom the AFL-CIO issue advocacy is almost 100 percent favorable?
