What the Senator has pointed out is that you gut the effort to protect patients from these gag clauses unless you ensure that the providers are in a position to do their job and not get retaliated against and not face this prospect of getting financial incentives when they do their job.  The Senator from Massachusetts is absolutely right. We are making sure that providers can be straight with their patients. We are actually giving them the chance to carry out that antigag clause effort by making sure they will not be retaliated against and by making sure they will not face the prospect of their compensation in some way being tied to doing their job.  I am very hopeful all of our colleagues can support this amendment. It tracks what the majority of the Senate is already on record in voting for, the effort that the Senator from Massachusetts and I led in the last Congress shortly after I came here.  I was director of the Gray Panthers at home in Oregon for about 7 years before I came to Congress. I can see a lot of areas where Democrats and Republicans have differences of opinion onAmerican health care. There are a lot of areas where reasonable people can differ. I don't see how a reasonable interpretation of what is in the interest of patients and providers can allow for gag clauses and then give these plans the opportunity to vitiate any effort to bar gag clauses by saying: If you try to be straight with your patients, we will retaliate against you; we will tie your compensation to your keeping these parties in the dark.  I hope my colleagues will support this amendment. It shouldn't be partisan. It doesn't constitute HMO bashing.  I yield the floor.
