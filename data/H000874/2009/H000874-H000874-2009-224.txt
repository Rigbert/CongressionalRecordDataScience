We are on a good schedule now. As you know, we have passed seven of the 12 bills from the House. We have five more left to go. My expectation is that we will complete those.  Let me say that he and I have now been talking, I think, for somewhere in the neighborhood of about 3\1/2\ months about this issue. Early on I made a proposal that, from my perspective, did two things: one, it provided for time frames in which we would consider legislation; and two, it provided to the minority party, which does not control the Rules Committee--we were both in that situation for a period of time--but nevertheless, provided your party with the opportunity to offer such amendments as it deemed desirable, that it wanted to offer.  With respect to the two bills that you asked me about, I have not had an opportunity to discuss with Mr. Obey or with the subcommittee Chairs of those two committees the specific rule that they are looking for and whether or not they've been able to reach any agreements with their counterparts, the ranking members on those two subcommittees. So I can't answer your question at this point in time; but as we have had discussions, I want those discussions to continue. I will say to my friend that I had a discussion with one of your Members who is on the Appropriations Committee today who came over to this side of the aisle. We were talking about it, again, with a continuing effort to see if there is some way we can provide for the objectives of, I think, both of us.
