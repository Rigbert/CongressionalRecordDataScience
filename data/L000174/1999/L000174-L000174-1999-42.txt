President, I know my good friend from Alabama is hereas manager on his side. I know we have no further rollcalls on this. I see my friend from Wisconsin on the floor. I am wondering if we can get some of the debate out of the way, and I wonder if we might yield to the Senator from Wisconsin and let him begin debate on his amendment.
