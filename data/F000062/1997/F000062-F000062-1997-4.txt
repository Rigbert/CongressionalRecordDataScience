 President, I rise this afternoon to cosponsor legislation introduced by my colleagues Senator Grassley and Senator Jeffords to extend the production tax credit, a tax incentive to encourage wind-generated energy.  Today, California's Tehachapi-Mojave area is the world's largest producer of wind-generated electricity. The New York Times has described the area's 5,000 electricity producing wind turbines as a vision of the future. Wind generation energy provides a renewable, clean, environmentally sound source of energy in California. I am pleased to lend my support to the Grassley-Jeffords legislation.  The production tax credit provides a 1.5 cent tax credit for each kilowatt ofelectricity produced in the United States during the first ten years a new wind energy production facility is in service. The legislation is an inexpensive way to encourage clean, efficient and sustainable energy future for our children and grandchildren.  Under current law, the production tax credit is scheduled to expire in 1999, complicating the planning and development of new wind energy generation facilities. New wind energy facilities, like any major construction project, take several years to move from planning to operation. Without the certainty of the credit after 1999, investors will be reluctant to commit funds for the development of new wind energy facilities. Industry officials have already noticed a decline in investment, which can be attributed to the credit's uncertainty.  Wind energy is the world's fastest growing energy technology. The amount of wind-generated power has increased by 25 percent each year during the last 5 years, growth which is expected to accelerate through 2010. Wind-generated energy is expected to become a $400 billion industry worldwide by 2020. However, most of the growth is occurring in Europe, rather than here in the United States. No new wind power generation development has occurred in the United States since 1991.  I am pleased that California companies, including those in south and central California, are among the world's leading manufacturers and developers of wind energy facilities. If domestic firms are able to capture even one-fourth of the jobs associated with serving the growing market, the growth would support approximately 150,000 jobs. These are high-technology engineering jobs, traditional areas of strength for California, providing a solid economic foundation.  The Grassley-Jeffords legislation will have important environmental consequences as well. The President's initiative against global warming includes $5 billion program of tax incentives, which could include the extension of the production tax credit. Coal is currently the Nation's largest source of power, providing 55 percent of the Nation's energy needs. However, coal has the highest level of carbon dioxide, when compared with the amount of electricity produced. Wind production energy is a significantly cleaner alternative, helping to decrease carbon dioxide emissions. Wind energy could supply 30,000 megawatts of energy by 2010, rather than current 1,700 megawatts today, reducing carbon dioxide emissions by 18%. These are cost-effective steps for our energy future.  I am pleased to join Senator Grassley, who has demonstrated his long-standing commitment to this important issue, and cosponsor the Grassley-Jeffords legislation. Without an extension, I am concerned wind energy production will not be able to develop, undermining economic, environmental and clean air goals. Wind generation energy provides a renewable, clean, environmentally sound source of energy for California's future. I am pleased to lend my support to the legislation.                                 ______                                       By
