Speaker, there was thought that we might meet tomorrow; that is obviously not happening. It is my understanding Friday is on the schedule for next week. Can the gentleman tell me how likely it would be that Friday, while there for contingencies, the likelihood of our meeting on Friday? Does the gentleman have any thought on that? I yield to my friend.
