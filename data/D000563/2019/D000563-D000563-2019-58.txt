President, I was in my office and just learned, by Senator Grassley's floor speech, about the passing of Berkley Bedell, and I just wanted to add my voice to his.  He was a wonderful man. I served with him in the House of Representatives. Spirit Lake was his home area in Iowa. He was a really knowledgeable man when it came to issues of agriculture, and I didn't learn until many years later that he was a very successful businessman in the fishing tackle business, if I remember correctly, and sporting goods. He had many interests.  He was a spirited, friendly, good person who worked hard at his job and was a credit to the U.S. House of Representatives, regardless of party, and I think Senator Grassley's remarks reflect that.  I am going to miss his annual Christmas card. He and his wife--she passed away just recently, as well--would send a card about the comings and goings of their big, old family. It was a big oversized card, and I always looked forward to it.  I feel honored to have been able to serve with him. I thank my colleague and friend Senator Grassley from Iowa for paying tribute to him.
