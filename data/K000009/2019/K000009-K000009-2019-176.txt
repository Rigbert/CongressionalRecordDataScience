Our community joined the organization in celebrating this milestone on Saturday, April 13, 2019 in the midst of the Easter Season.  In 1969, the late Reverend H.V. Savage, Sr. established the Kitchen to address the extraordinary need evident in his community. Located in one of the oldest and poorest neighborhoods in Toledo, the Kitchen for the Poor has grown into an anchor of the community. Each day, over 200 meals are served in a neighborhood whose median income is $5,500 a year. Though its primary service is feeding the hungry through daily meals and groceries, meal delivery, summer meals and holiday meals, it also provides clothing, Christmas gifts, counseling and support for its neighbors.  The stated mission of the Martin Luther King Kitchen for the Poor is that, ``We offer hope and acceptance to those in need, keeping in mind the dignity of all persons. We help anyone who walks through our doors, regardless of age, sex, religion, political beliefs or race. We feed the homeless and those with low incomes. We provide hope where there seems to be none.''  Harvey Savage, Jr. has taken the mantle of his father's vision, serving the people food and hope. Truly, since its inception, the Martin Luther King Kitchen for the Poor has lived Christ's message of Love described in Matthew 25:40, ``Whatsover you do to the least of these my brothers, that you do unto Me.'' We congratulate the members and friends past and present for fifty years of dedicated service with dignity. Onward.                          ____________________
