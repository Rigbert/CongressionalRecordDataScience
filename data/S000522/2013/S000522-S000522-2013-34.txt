I want to thank Chairman Pitts for his very eloquent statement. Even the grand jury report noted that if Mr. Pitts' law had been followed faithfully, the whole Gosnell destruction of not only women's lives but the death and murder of one woman and the killing of these children might not have occurred.  I'd like to yield to Dr. Andy Harris, a Johns Hopkins physician and also a Member of the U.S. House from Maryland.  Dr. Harris.
