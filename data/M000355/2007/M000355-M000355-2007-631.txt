  I also want to extend my thanks on behalf of all of our colleagues to Senator Grassley, the ranking member of the Finance Committee, for his important contribution to this bill that we think made it significantly better than it might otherwise have been.  So I commend them both for their outstanding work.  I yield the floor.
