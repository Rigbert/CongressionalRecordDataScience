President, also for the advice of our colleagues, the distinguished Senator from Utah and I continued work on the managers' package, which we worked on over the weekend, last night, and we will be prepared to present that fairly soon.  If I could have the attention of the Senator from Utah for just a moment, I suspect what we would probably do at that time, when it is prepared, is to move to set aside other things so we could do that and go forward with it.  I mention this because several Senators had asked about where it was--it is a complex thing--to help make sure we get the drafting all right.
