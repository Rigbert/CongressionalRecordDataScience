 President, I would like to express my deep appreciation to the Senator from Wyoming for his overly kind and very generous comments about my work here, and also say, Mr. President, to the people of Wyoming, how fortunate they are to have Senator Barrasso representing them.  I have seen a lot of new Senators come into this body over these 25 years. I have never seen one make a mark quicker. So I know the people of Wyoming deeply appreciate their junior Senator.
