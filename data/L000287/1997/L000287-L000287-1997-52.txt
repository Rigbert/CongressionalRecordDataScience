Mr. Speaker, Republicans continue to try to sell their huge tax break for the rich by promising tax relief for middle-class Americans. But under the Republican plan millions of working Americans get no tax cuts, they only get empty promises. Let us take an example:  Daniel is a police officer. He works hard and supports his wife and four children on his $26,000 salary. He pays thousands of dollars in taxes. What does Daniel get from the Republican tax bill? Nothing, zero, zip. Democrats want to give Daniel and millions of other working families a tax cut.  What do Republicans say about Daniel? Daniel, the police officer? They said Daniel is on welfare. Billions of dollars in tax breaks for millionaires, nothing for Daniel, nothing for millions of hardworking families. That is the Republican tax bill, that is the Republican tax plan.                          ____________________
