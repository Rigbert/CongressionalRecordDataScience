Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.  Mr. Speaker, in consideration of H. Res. 199, today the House of Representatives brings honor to the men, women and children of Srebrenica in Bosnia-Herzegovina. In a little over 2 weeks, it will have been 10 years since the massacre of approximately 8,000 men and boys from that small town.  Mr. Speaker, renewed attention is focused on this event in light of the recently released video showing members of the Serb paramilitary group, the Scorpions, executing young Bosniak men from Srebrenica. Many Members of this House saw the news coverage of this video, including an interview of a woman who never knew what actually happened to her young son at Srebrenica in July 1995 until she saw the footage on television that he was among those executed. In passing this resolution, we are expressing solidarity with the thousands of women like her, and others, who a decade ago witnessed something so evil that it defies comprehension.  There are four basic motivations, Mr. Speaker, for passing this resolution today. First, there are those who, despite being indicted for genocide, continue to evade justice. Second, some continue to deny that the atrocity even occurred or they contend it was something other than genocide. Third, the international community must learn from its failure to stop slaughter from taking place in a declared safe area, and let us all remember Srebrenica was called a safe haven, especially as we look at similar situations around the globe. Finally, 10 years after Srebrenica, Srebrenica survivors, including many who came to this country as refugees and are now American citizens, still feel the excruciating pain of losing so many of their innocent loved ones.  Mr. Speaker, I want to stress that the resolution notes the direct support that came from the Serbian regime of Slobodan Milosevic and its followers. This is no small circle of Milosevic henchmen, as some in Belgrade have claimed. We are referring to an entire regime, albeit an undemocratic one, and not just a few individuals in positions of authority. Moreover, followers of the regime existed in the military, the police and other state institutions, and when it appeared that he was succeeding in a conflict against neighboring peoples, Milosevic actually garnered popular support.  Milosevic has rightfully been in The Hague, as we all know, Mr. Speaker, since 2001, but why have others like Radovan Karadzic and Ratko Mladic remained at large? Why until recently, if not to today, have they benefited from the protection not only from criminal networks but perhaps by segments of the military and the police? To me, that shows broader involvement than has been alleged.  The reference to the followers of the Milosevic regime clearly indicates that we are not referring to those in Serbia, including those in positions of authority today, who had no role in what was happening when they put themselves at risk in opposing Milosevic and his policies in the 1990s.  I would just point out to my colleagues that on the Subcommittee on International Operations and Human Rights, which I chaired for several years through the 1990s, we did hold hearings, and many of us made trips to the former Yugoslavia.  In one of those hearings, we heard from Hasan Nuhapovic, a former translator of the U.N. peacekeeping forces in Srebrenica. Hasan was one of those who lost his family and I would just quote very briefly from that testimony that he gave to our committee. He said, ``My family, just like thousands of others, was simply handed over to the Serbs in the village of Potocari, 6 kilometers north of Srebrenica on 13 July 1995. They have never been seen since. The Dutch peacekeepers threw my family out of the camp right in front of my eyes. The people, especially the men and boys who were inside the camp, didn't want to leave the relative safety of it.''  It goes on to say, ``The Dutch refused to tell the refugees inside the camp what was going on with the people outside.'' He says, ``They lied, saying that everything was all right and that the people from inside the camp were also going to be evacuated to the federation territory. The Dutch lied to the refugees inside the camp,'' he goes on. ``The Dutch knew that the men and boys outside the camp were being separated from the women and children and that some of them were even killed right on the spot. They watched the Serbs take away and kill civilians. They did nothing to prevent it.''  Mr. Speaker, this resolution remembers those 7- to 8,000 men and boys who were slaughtered in Srebrenica, and it says in a collective voice of the House of Representatives, Democrats and Republicans alike, that we care, we care deeply. We are sorrowful for those who lost their lives, and hopefully never again.  I will insert a Chronicle of Genocide in the Record at this point.                         Chronicle of Genocide                                prologue       The town of Srebrenica is located in eastern Bosnia's Drina      River Valley, about 15 kilometers from the Serbian border. In      1991, the town was home to 37,000 inhabitants, including      roughly 27,000 Bosnian Muslims (Bosniaks) and 9,000 Serbs.      Prior to the outbreak of Yugoslavia's civil war, members of      Srebrenica's different ethnic groups lived together for      decades without major conflict.       After the end of the Cold War, Srebrenica had its first      encounter with conflict in April 1992 when Serb paramilitary      forces gained control of the city for several weeks. One      month later, Srebrenica was recaptured by Bosnian Muslim      fighters from the Army of Bosnia and Herzegovina. By      September, Bosnian Muslim forces had succeeded in uniting      Srebrenica with the neighboring town of Zepa and increasing      the size of the territory under their control to 900 square      kilometers. However, the enclave remained isolated from the      main Army of Bosnia and Herzegovina and strategically      vulnerable to advancing Serb forces.       In January 1993, Bosnian Serb troops (which logistically      and financially were not     entirely independent from and were supported by Serbian      military and police forces) from the self-proclaimed      Republika Srspka launched an offensive to retake the Muslim-     controlled areas around Srebrenica. After months of fighting,      the villages of Konjevic Polje and Cerska were captured,      severing the connection between Srebrenica and Zepa and      reducing the size of the Srebrenica enclave to 150 square      kilometers. Bosnians from neighboring areas streamed into the      town of Srebrenica, increasing the population to as many as      60,000 people.       When the Commander of the U.N. Protection Force (UNPROFOR),      French General Philippe Morillon, visited Srebrenica in March      1993, he discovered an overcrowded city beset by siege      conditions. The Bosnian Serb troops had destroyed the town's      water supply and the population was running short on food,      medicine, and other necessities. Before his departure,      General Morillon promised residents that Srebrenica was under      U.N. protection and that he would never abandon the city's      inhabitants.       On April 16, 1993, the U.N. Security Council passed a      resolution declaring that ``all parties and others treat      Srebrenica and its surroundings as a `safe area' that should      be free from armed attack or any other hostile act.''       The first group of UNPROFOR soldiers arrived in Srebrenica      on April 18, 1993 and fresh troops were rotated into the city      every six months after that. In January 1995, a battalion      from the Netherlands rotated into the enclave. By this time,      few supply convoys were reaching the city. In March and      April, the Dutch soldiers defending the city observed a      build-up of Bosnian Serb troops in the surrounding area. The      Drina Corps of the Army of the Republika Srpska (VRS) was      preparing for a major attack on Srebrenica.                         chronology of genocide        March 1995--Radovan Karadzic, President of the self-     proclaimed Republika Srpska, issues a directive to the      Bosnian Serb Army ordering the VRS to ``complete the physical      separation of Srebrenica from Zepa as soon as possible'' and      block aid convoys on their way to Srebrenica.       July 2, 1995--Republika Srpska Army General Milenko      Zivanovic signs two orders outlining plans for attacking the      enclave and issues the order to various units of the Drina      Corps to prepare for combat. The operation is code-named      ``Krivaja 95.''       July 6, 1995--Bosnian Serb forces launch their attack on      Srebrenica. The Commander of the city's Dutch battalion,      Colonel Karremans, contacts the U.N. General Staff in      Sarajevo requesting NATO air support after refugee camps and      U.N. monitoring posts are shelled.       July 9, 1995--Forces from the VRS Drina Corps surround the      town of Srebrenica. President Karadzic issues a new order in      which he approves the capture of Srebrenica.       July 10, 1995--The Bosnian Serbs shell Srebrenica and      residents flee toward the U.N. base at Potocari.       Colonel Karremans makes an urgent request for NATO air      support when Bosnian Serb forces shell his soldiers'      positions. The Commander of the U.N. forces, French General      Bernard Janvier, initially rejects the request, but      ultimately approves the use of air strikes. In the meantime,      the VRS forces stop attacking U.N. soldiers and the air      attacks are postponed.       Colonel Karremans assures Bosnian Muslims that NATO      airplanes will execute a major attack on Bosnian Serb troops      if VRS forces are not withdrawn from the Protection Zone by      6:00 a.m. the next morning.       July 11, 1995--Bosnian Serb forces conduct extensive      shelling of Srebrenica.       9:00 a.m.: Colonel Karremans is notified that his request      for air support was not submitted on the correct form. At      10:30 a.m., the re-issued request reaches General Janvier.      However, the NATO warplanes that have been circling      Srebrenica since 6:00 a.m. are low on fuel and have to return      to their base in Italy.       2:30 p.m.: NATO planes bomb Republika Srpska army tanks.      The Bosnian Serb forces threaten to kill captured Dutch      soldiers and shell the U.N. base in Potocari. Plans for      further NATO air strikes are abandoned.       General Ratko Mladic, together with General Krstic (then      Deputy Commander and Chief of Staff of the Drina Corps),      General Zivanovic (then Commander of the Drina Corps) and      other VRS officers enter Srebrenica.       8:00 p.m.: Representatives of the Bosnian Serb forces meet      UNPROFOR leaders at the Hotel Fontana in the neighboring city      of Bratunac. General Ratko Mladic chairs the meeting, and the      two sides discuss the mounting refugee crisis.       Around 10:00 p.m.: In Srebrenica, military leaders of the      Army of Bosnia and Herzegovina and local civilians decide to      form a column of men--about two thirds of which were Bosnian      Muslim civilians--with the goal of escaping from Srebrenica      through the mountains toward Tuzla. The column starts moving      north around midnight.       11:00 p.m.: A second meeting at the Hotel Fontana results      in a plan to transport Bosnian Muslim civilians out of the      enclave.       July 12, 1995.--VRS General Milenko Zivanovic signs an      order directing the Drina Corps to secure all buses and mini-     buses belonging to the VRS. The Republika Srpska Defense      Ministry sends three orders to its local secretariats      directing them to procure buses and to send them to Bratunac.       10:00 a.m.: A third and final meeting is held at the Hotel      Fontana to discuss the fate of the Srebrenica Muslims. Ratko      Mladic issues an order to transport Bosnian Muslim refugees      out of Potocari, stating that it is the only way to guarantee      their survival. He also informs those present that all males      between the ages of 16 and 70--essentially all military-aged      men, (which however did not prevent boys of much younger age      as well as much older men to be included in this group) must      be separated from the others and screened to prevent the      escape of possible ``war criminals.''       1:00 p.m.: Dozens of buses arrive in Potocari. Women,      children, and the elderly are driven by bus from Potocari      toward Tuzla, which is under the control of the Army of      Bosnia and Herzegovina. Military-aged men are systematically      separated out and detained in Potocari before being      transferred to Bratunac.       Bosnian Serbs forces, including some military and municipal      police, take positions along the Bratunac-Milici road with      the intention of intercepting the column. Equipped with heavy      armor and artillery, the Bosnian Serb forces open fire on the      column as it crosses the road between Konjevic Polja and Nova      Kasaba. Many survivors of the attack are taken prisoner.       The U.N. Security Council declares that the international      community is ``[g]ravely concerned at the deterioration in      the situation in and around the safe area of Srebrenica,      Republic of Bosnia and Herzegovina, and at the plight of the      civilian population there.''       July 13, 1995.--The evacuation of women, children, and the      elderly continues. Military-aged men are separated from the      refugees and transferred to Bratunac.       As many as 6,000 men from the column headed from Srebrenica      to Tuzla are captured and detained by Bosnian Serb forces.      Several thousand of them are brought to a field close to      Sandici and to the soccer stadium in Nova Kasaba.       Bosnian Serbs begin the mass execution of Muslim detainees      at sites near the Jadar River, the Cerska valley, and a      warehouse in Kravica.       8:00 p.m.: The removal of the Bosnian Muslim population      from Potocari is completed.       July 13-14, 1995.--Executions continue in Tisca.       July 14, 1995.--Executions continue in Orahovac.       July 14-15, 1995.--Executions continue at the Petkovci Dam.       July 16, 1995.--Executions continue at Branjevo Military      Farm and the Pilica Cultural Center.       The front of the decimated column of Bosnian Muslims      succeeds in reaching territory controlled by the Army of      Bosnia and Herzegovina.       July 17-18, 1995.--Executions continue at Kozluk and other      locations.       September-October 1995--The Bosnian Serb forces engage in a      concerted effort to conceal the mass killings by exhuming      bodies from mass graves, turning over the ground, and      reburying human remains in smaller, remote gravesites.                                Epilogue       Evidence presented at The Hague in the trial of Bosnian      Serbs accused of war crimes established that during the month      of July 1995, Bosnian Serb forces executed between seven and      eight thousand Bosnian men and boys. The International      Tribunal for the Former Yugoslavia (ICTY) found ``beyond any      reasonable doubt that a crime of genocide was committed in      Srebrenica''.       Immediately after the massacre, Republika Srpska President      Radovan Karadzic and VRS Chief Ratko Mladic, the highest      political and military leaders of the Bosnian Serbs, were      indicted by the Tribunal for their roles in the Srebrenica      genocide. To date, they have successfully avoided arrest. The      crimes in Srebrenica are also included in the indictment      against former Yugoslav leader Slobodan Milosevic.       Radislav Krstic and Vidoje Blagojevic, high ranking      officers of the Bosnian Serb Army, have been convicted of      complicity in genocide. Dragan Jokic, Deputy Commander of the      Zvornik Brigade, has been convicted of crimes against      humanity. General Radislav Krstic, deputy commander of the      VRS Drina Corps, has been convicted of genocide. Officers      Momir Nikolic and Dragan Obrenovic, and the soldier Drazen      Erdemovic, have admitted their guilt and been convicted of      crimes against humanity. Those convicted in connection with      the genocide have received prison sentences ranging from five      to 35 years. Drazen Erdemovic, sentenced to five years in      prison for the murder of at least 75 men from Srebrenica, has      already been released.       Ljubisa Beara, Head of Security at the General Headquarters      of the Bosnian Serb Army, has been charged with genocide and      is awaiting trial.       Army and police officers Drago Nikolic, Ljubomir Borvcanin,      Vinko Pandurevic, and Vujadin Popovic, also indicted for      genocide, have surrendered to the Tribunal in The Hague and      are awaiting trial. Radivoje Miletic and Milan Gvero,      Generals of the Bosnian Serb Army, have surrendered to the      Tribunal and are charged with expelling Bosnian Muslims from      Srebrenica. General Zdravko Tolimir, who is accused of the      same crimes, is still at large.       The Appeals Chamber of the International Criminal Tribunal      for the Former Yugoslavia used strong language to describe      the Srebrenica genocide during the trial of General Radislav      Krstic: ``By seeking to eliminate a part of the Bosnian      Muslims, the Bosnian Serb forces committed genocide. They     targeted for extinction the forty thousand Bosnian Muslims      living in Srebrenica, a group which was emblematic of the      Bosnian Muslims in general. They stripped all the male Muslim      prisoners, military and civilian, elderly and young, of their      personal belongings and identification, and deliberately and      methodically killed them solely on the basis of their      identity. The Bosnian Serb forces were aware, when they      embarked on this genocidal venture, that the harm they caused      would continue to plague the Bosnian Muslims. The Appeals      Chamber states unequivocally that the law condemns, in      appropriate terms, the deep and lasting injury inflicted, and      calls the massacre at Srebrenica by its proper name:      genocide. Those responsible will bear this stigma, and it      will serve as a warning to those who may in future      contemplate the commission of such a heinous act.''       To date, several thousand bodies and parts of bodies from      victims of the genocide have been exhumed from mass graves.      So far, 1,327 of these bodies have been identified and buried      in the Memorial Centre in Potocari near Srebrenica.       Of the 27,000 Bosnian Muslims who inhabited Srebrenica      before the war, only a few hundred have returned to live in      the city.  Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of our time.
