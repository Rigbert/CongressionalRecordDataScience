Speaker, I rise today to honor a distinguished Member of this body for the past 18 years, the Honorable Bill Clinger who has represented the people of Pennsylvania's Fifth District with class and dignity.  It has been my honor to serve with Bill since we entered Congress together in 1978. He is a man of integrity and principle.  His legislative accomplishments over his career are impressive, but his accomplishments just in the past 2 years are nothing short of remarkable. As chairman of the House Committee on Government Reform and Oversight, Bill's leadership and determination pushed through bills ending Federal unfunded mandates and enacting the line-item veto. Bill's accomplishments did not stop with these pieces of legislation though. He also successfully passed bills involving paperwork reform and regulatory reform, among others.  For his work, the Almanac of American Politics said, ``his legislative production in just his first few months as chairman was as impressive as that of many members over a whole career.''  Mr. Speaker, the House is losing a tremendous legislative leader, gentleman, and patriot.  On behalf of the citizens of Wisconsin's Ninth District, I thank the Honorable Bill Clinger for his outstanding service to the House of Representatives and the United States.                          ____________________
