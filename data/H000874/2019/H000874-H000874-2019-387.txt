Scalise, the Republican whip, for his comments. It is a testimony to the love and respect that John Dingell enjoyed in this House from both sides of the aisle.  As I said earlier, Madam Speaker, there is no one in this House who doesn't have a particular story about John Dingell. So, before we begin this colloquy, I want to again express my gratitude for the life and service of my friend John Dingell.  Madam Speaker, I was with him Wednesday. He died yesterday. I was with him the day before he died. We sat together for 2\1/2\ hours and talked. As I left, I leaned down and I kissed him on the forehead, and I said: ``I love you, John.''  I think I was speaking for, literally, scores of Members who worked with him on the committee, who worked with him on the floor, and who saw him in various different venues as a colleague.                              {time}  1145  They loved him as well for his integrity and for his fairness. And, yes, as the gentleman from Louisiana said, he could be tough, and he could be rough, but he also could be gentle and accepting and open.  All of us in this country were blessed by his time on this Earth, so much ofwhich he gave back to the rest of us in the form of service in the Armed Forces and in this House and in his community.  History will remember him as its longest serving Member of the House of Representatives, but we who knew him well remember John Dingell as a man of extraordinary character, intellect, courage, and purpose.  From healthcare to the environment, from workers' rights to veterans' care, John worked tirelessly over six decades in the House to make sure Congress was doing right by the people who the House represents. His legislative record of achievement speaks volumes about who it was he believed he was fighting for every day in office.  Medicare, Civil Rights Act, Voting Rights Act, Clean Air Act, Safe Drinking Water Act, Endangered Species Act, all of these bore his imprint. What an extraordinary record of service and accomplishment. And that is because he was a champion of affordable healthcare, equality under the law, the right to vote, economic opportunity, and a healthy future for our children and grandchildren.  To his beloved Michigan, he was an indefatigable defender of autoworkers and their role in the American economy.  John was steadfast in his belief that the best way to serve them and all his constituents was to work, whenever possible, in concert with those across the aisle and not against them.  We are, after all, all Americans. We serve Americans. We serve a great country. He believed in Congress, and, oh, how he believed in his country. He believed in sitting down together and working through our differences in a way that was respectful and civil.  Madam Speaker, I hope that spirit and his example will imbue in us a resolve to find compromise in these challenging times. John, as everybody knows, followed his father into service--22 years of service.  In 1955, in December, his father passed away, and John was sent by the voters to continue the service of the Dingell family. John Dingell, Sr., was a major proponent of New Deal legislation in this House, serving from 1933 to 1955.  John was followed in service here by the ``lovely Deborah,'' as he so affectionately and lovingly called her. His wife is an extraordinary Member of Congress herself, and we are blessed to have her. Debbie is an extraordinary woman, an outstanding Member of the Congress of the United States.  We stood in a moment of silence just a few minutes ago. I hope that we will adjourn in his honor today.  Debbie has been carrying on the Dingell legacy of seeking bipartisan results while remaining steadfast to the progressive values that brought her into public service.  I offer, Madam Speaker, my condolences, as I do to John's children and grandchildren and to their entire extended family.  I thank the minority whip for his comments and expression, which demonstrates what we have all said. John Dingell was, of course, a Democrat, but John Dingell was more than that, by far. He was an American and a fierce promoter of the people's House and the work that was done by all the Members of the people's House, so I thank my friend.  Madam Speaker, on Monday, the House will meet at 12 p.m. for morning-hour debate and 2 p.m. for legislative business, with votes postponed until 6:30 p.m.  On Tuesday, Wednesday, and Thursday, the House will meet at 10 a.m. for morning-hour debate and 12 p.m. for legislative business.  On Friday, the House will meet at 9 a.m. for legislative business, with last votes expected no later than 3 p.m.  We will consider several bills under suspension of the rules. A complete list of suspensions will be available by the close of business today.  The House will also consider H.J. Res. 37, a war powers resolution on U.S. involvement in Yemen. This legislation will force a much-needed conversation about how to bring to an end the violence and the humanitarian crisis that we see in Yemen.  In addition, Madam Speaker, the House is expected to consider the conference report that finishes fiscal year 2019 appropriations. I understand that progress is being made, and I am hopeful--I am hopeful--and optimistic that we can have a deal that comes together early next week. Members are advised that additional legislative items are possible.  Let me simply say that Members ought to know that there is a possibility as well, given the death of our colleague, John Dingell, and the desire of so many to attend his funeral, that the schedule may be modified to accommodate that effort and that travel to Michigan.
