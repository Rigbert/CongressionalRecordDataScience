 President, I ask unanimous consent that the vote occur on passage of the bill on Wednesday--tomorrow--with no intervening action or debate, at a time determined by the majority leader, after consultation with the Democratic leader. Further, I ask unanimous consent that following that vote, the Senate insist on its amendment, request a conference with the House, and the Chair be authorized to appoint conferees on the part of the Senate, with a ratio of 4 to 3. I also ask unanimous consent that S. 1753 then be returned to the calendar.
