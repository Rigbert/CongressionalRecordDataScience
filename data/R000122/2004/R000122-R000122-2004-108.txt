President, I say to the Senator, you were speaking about increasing the Pell grant, which strikes a chord with me. Senator Pell was my predecessor, the architect of this great program. I am sure you are aware, but if you can confirm this awareness, the Pell Grant program has a $3.7 billion shortfall because of an increase in the number of students who have qualified for the Pell grant since our economy has not produced jobs over the last several years and has been dead in the water until very recently. We, in our budget, included the $3.7 billion, but I am told this funding might be in jeopardy in the conference, which would be a grievous blow to the Pell Grant Program in addition to what you have described. Are you aware of this difficulty?
