 I ask my friend and colleague from Iowa to just reflect on what I have found, and I ask if he has found the same. I have gone to good schools in Illinois, and they have told me the results of the testing. The results of the testing, in the most recent rounds of testing in No Child Left Behind, required that the students reach a 60-percent plus of performance in terms of their learning ability and learning attainment, education attainment--60 percent.  In some of the schools I have visited in the suburban areas of Chicago--not in the cities, in the suburban areas of Chicago--here is what we found. When they took the test, we found that the white students in the schools were testing slightly over 60 percent. So they were meeting their target. The African-American students were testing in the 40-percent range; the Hispanic students in the 25- and 30-percent range; and the special education students, the students with disabilities, below 20 percent. All of these subgroups, if there are certain numbers of them in each school, are all expected to hit 60 percent.  I ask the Senator from Iowa if he has had similar experiences, and if he would share them with me and try to answer the question these educators asked. They said: If these groups are not meeting the test scores they are supposed to meet, and we are going to be labeled a failing school because of that, what are we supposed to do? What will you do to help us in terms of mentoring students, tutoring students, afterschool programs, and summer school programs?  My response to them, sadly, is, if you look at President Bush's own budget for No Child Left Behind, he underfunds the promised money for these school districts. The law authorizing No Child Left Behind said this year we would send $34.3 billion to school districts across America to help these kids--$34.3 billion--and the budget only provides $24.9 billion. So we are underfunding it by $9.4 billion.
