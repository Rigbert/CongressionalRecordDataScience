 President, I rise in strong opposition to the final version of the reconciliation bill, which has emerged from conference committee.  Last week I came to this floor to express my opposition to the tax cut which emerged from the Senate. And I believe that the bill which passed the House was no better. Unfortunately, this conference report has even less to recommend it than either of those bills.  This bill will add an additional $350 billion to our deficit over the next 5 years, all of which will be paid for by future generations of taxpayers. Even worse, it contains so many sunsets and phase-outs that it makes a mockery of our tax code.  Some provisions last only through the end of next year and others phase out in each subsequent year, until the whole tax cut is finished by the end of 2008. This bill is a patchwork quilt of temporary cuts and provides neither short-term stimulus nor long-term structural tax relief. Indeed, all it provides is a great deal of uncertainty to the average American taxpayer.  Rather than view the reluctance of the Senate to pass a large tax cut as a sign of concern over our historic federal budget deficits, the conferees used a grab-bag of tricks to stuff a $1.1 trillion tax cut into a $350 billion package. Many of those cuts are likely to become permanent, which will further increase deficits and the federal debt.  Quite frankly, I am not fooled by this slight of hand, and I am sure that the average American will not be either.  By lowering tax rates on both dividends and capital gains, the Conferees ensured that this bill is even more regressive than the President's original proposal, because capital gains income is skewed even more to the wealthiest Americans than dividend income.  Between now and 2006, the period during which the majority of the tax cuts are in effect, 54 percent of the tax cuts will go to the 5 percent of Americans who earn over $150,000 annually.
