 President, I rise today in recognition of Women's History Month. As one of the 14 women in the United States Senate, I consider this tribute of the highest importance. This year's theme for the month is ``Women: Builders of Communities and Dreams.'' There is no better time to salute the work women around the world have done at home and abroad to empower communities.  I am proud to come from the State where Women's History Month was conceived in 1978. Almost 30 years ago, the education task force of the Sonoma County Commission on the Status of Women in California first established Women's History Week in recognition of the achievements of women. This was soon expanded into a month-long celebration, realizing the dream of honoring women in a special way each year.  Women's History Month recognizes those who continually strive for greatness. One that comes to mind is Mary Helen Rogers, who passed away earlier this month. She dedicated her life to protecting African American families in San Francisco from urban displacement. While raising 12 children, she became an expert in housing laws. She helped start the Western Addition Community Organization, which forced the city to assist the residents it displaced. She later went on to serve as the San Francisco Housing Authority's community relations manager. Mary Helen Rogers demonstrated through her life's work the importance of community activism and the power of an individual to inspire action in those around her.  Just last month we lost another very special woman--Dana Reeve, the widow of actor Christopher Reeve. Her commitment to spinal cord injury research and loving dedication to her husband was unmatched. Since Chris' death, she carried his spirit with her in her drive to push Congress to expand embryonic stem cell research. Dana was the face of the fight on behalf of patients across the country with spinal cord injury, Parkinson's, juvenile diabetes and countless other illnesses. Her passing should serve as call for expansion of embryonic stem cell research. Mrs. Reeve's steadfast loyalty and compassionate care serves as an example to all women. She will be missed.  In Los Angeles, ``Sweet'' Alice Harris has been a leader in her community for over 40 years. Her steadfast commitment to the community through parent organizations, emergency relief, and youth programs, has made her an example of true community leadership.  As American women, we share a common history: It is a history of fighting for many of the rights and opportunities for which today's young women will prosper. We have come a long way from the days when women had no right to vote, no right to own property, and had extremely limited inheritance or child custody rights.  It wasn't until the Women's Property Act of 1839 that women gained land entitlement. The women's suffrage movement began in 1848; however the 19th amendment, granting women the right to vote, did not come to pass until 72 long years later, in 1920. It is a right for which our predecessors worked hard for. We owe it to them to fulfill our civic duty.  Today, American women are active in every sphere of our society. We have made our mark in this country's private and public sectors. Over 65 million women are a part of the American workforce. There are over 10 million woman-owned businesses. Women represent our Nation around the world. Many proudly wear our Nation's uniform.  Much has changed for over the past century. But make no mistake; much more needs to be done. We must provide improved health care and educational and workforce support for our Nation's women. We need to eliminate violence against women. We need to ensure that women continue to have the right to choose and autonomy over their bodies.  Violence against women is intolerable. Every 15 seconds a woman is battered, and each day four women die from domestic violence. Women should not be threatened by fear and violence. This is why the Violence Against Women Act reauthorization is such an important piece of legislation.  We also need to improve healthcare in our Nation. Breast cancer continues to be a serious threat to women in this country. One out of seven American women will develop the disease, and nearly 41,000 will die from it this year. We must commit ourselves to finding a cure for this disease which affects women regardless of race, class, or religion.  As the sponsor of the breast cancer research stamp, I am proud to say that since its inception in 1998, the stamp has helped raise nearly $50 million. These funds go a long way to help fund research and increase public awareness for this devastating disease. I am also supporting the National Institute of Health and National Cancer Institute legislative efforts to ensure that women undergoing mastectomy and lumpectomy surgeries are protected during their hospital stays. By continuing to prioritize investment in research, it is my hope that we can reach the goal of eradicating breast cancer by 2015.  Pregnant women must be provided with access to clinical care and parenting support. The U.S. infant mortality rate is 35th in the world. We must change this. Providing mothers with proper nutrition and healthy lifestyle education is key to combating preventable illnesses and deaths in mothers and children. Additionally, women are balancing careers with families more than ever, creating the need for affordable, quality childcare options.  Women are also in the midst of the war in Iraq, and we need to honor these women fighting to protect this country and for the dreams of those women who have been oppressed in Iraq and Afghanistan for too long.  Women began enlisting in the military at the start of World War I. Today women are serving in Iraq in record numbers. Women in the armed services make up 15 percent of active duty personnel. There have been nearly 2,000 California female deployments since 9/11. They do jobs that range from intelligence officers to doctors, to ground soldiers.  In Louisiana, Hurricane Katrina swept communities away in an instant. In the areas hardest hit by Katrina, 56 percent of families are headed by women, who are now taking the lead role in rebuilding the homes and lives their families and neighbors once knew. They deserve our help and support. It is only through their efforts that communities in New Orleans can thrive once again.  I salute the women leading the way in building stronger communities in California and across the Nation. They continue to lead and inspire us all. It is through their tenacity, strength, and passion that we see the transformation of dreams into realities. I have great hope for future generations of women, but we must protect and expand the cherished rights of today's women, so that they may continue to serve their communities and realize their dreams.                          ____________________
