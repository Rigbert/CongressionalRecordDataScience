President, I would like to call the Senate's attention to the continued First Amendment advocacy of a Vermont journalist, Mike Donoghue of the Burlington Free Press. The Vermont Press Association has presented Mike with the prestigious Matthew Lyon Award, for his staunch advocacy of First Amendment rights.  Mike is a talented and seasoned reporter, and in more than 40 years as a staff writer at the Free Press he has covered local, State and national news, as well as sporting events--all, with integrity and vigor. He has shown a steadfast commitment to truth-telling, to getting the facts, and getting them right, for the people of Vermont.  While Mike has achieved noteworthy accomplishments and awards during his tenure at the Free Press, it is, especially, his work as an advocate and teacher of First Amendment protections that have drawn the distinction of the Matthew Lyon Award. He served two terms as president of the Vermont Press Association, where he worked to expand the use of cameras in Vermont courtrooms. As a founder of the Vermont Coalition for Open Government, he has provided testimony in front of the Vermont Legislature on a regular basis and on a variety of topics related to First Amendment rights. Mike not only is a veteran reporter and volunteer advocate but a dedicated educator as well. He is an adjunct professor of journalism at Saint Michael's College in Colchester--my alma mater--and he has trained young journalists throughout Vermont and New England as well as through the auspices of the New England Press Association, the New England Society of Newspaper Editors, and Investigative Reporters and Editors. His commitment to teaching and defending the tenets of the First Amendment led him to participate as a trainer in Ireland after the country passed its Freedom of Information Act in 1997.  The Vermont Press Association each year offers the Matthew Lyon Award to an individual who has demonstrated an exceptional commitment to the First Amendment and to ``the public's right to know the truth in Vermont.'' It is named for Congressman Matthew Lyon, one of the foremost defenders of the Bill of Rights. He served in the U.S. House of Representatives on behalf of Vermont, as well as Kentucky, beginning in the 5th Congress. Congressman Lyon is known for his time in jail--and subsequent reelection during his sentence--on charges of sedition in 1798 for his sharp criticism of President John Adams.  Throughout his career, Mike Donoghue has worked tirelessly to promote accountability of public officials, and transparency in government agencies. As an earlier recipient of this same award, I will always feel a special kinship in these efforts with champions like Mike Donoghue.  I ask unanimous consent that this announcement from the Vermont Press Association about Mike Donoghue's selection for this award be printed into the Record.  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in the Record, as follows:            BFP's Donoghue Wins VT Press 1st Amendment Award            (By The Vermont Press Association, July 6, 2015)       Montpelier.--Longtime journalist and educator Mike Donoghue      of South Burlington has been selected to receive the Matthew      Lyon Award for his lifetime commitment to the First Amendment      and the public's right to know the truth in Vermont.       The Vermont Press Association, which represents the      interests of 11 daily and about four dozen non-daily      newspapers circulating in Vermont, will honor Donoghue at its      annual meeting and awards banquet at noon Thursday, July 16      at the Capitol Plaza in Montpelier.       Donoghue, an award-winning veteran news and sports writer      for the Burlington Free Press, is being recognized for      efforts in his spare time working as an adjunct professor of      journalism at St. Michael's College, as a longtime officer      with the Vermont Press Association and his volunteer efforts      with various groups including New England First Amendment      Coalition (NEFAC), New England Newspaper and Press      Association (NENPA) and the Society for Professional      Journalists (SPJ).       VPA President John Flowers said Donoghue has been on the      front lines in seeking greater public accountability through      a range of efforts, including that government officials and      courts ensure records are easily available to the public, and      that government meetings and court hearings are open to      Vermonters.       ``Mike's efforts in accountability journalism at the      Burlington Free Press are well documented over several      decades. But the Lyon award is focusing on his efforts in      educating students, the public, government officials, and      journalists--both for print and electronic media outlets.      Mike is called upon frequently to speak in classrooms, in the      community and at professional conferences from Vermont to      Ireland.''       His work has helped improve both the open meeting law and      public records law in Vermont, Flowers said. He noted it was      while serving as VPA President in the mid-1980s that Donoghue      helped lead the media efforts in successfully obtaining      approval for cameras in Vermont Courts.       St. Michael's College recruited Donoghue in 1985 to teach      as an adjunct professor in the journalism department, where      he still helps. He also served as an officer for the Vermont      Press Association for 35 years until he resigned as its      executive director earlier this year. Donoghue was      instrumental in getting the VPA headquarters anchored at St.      Michael's College.       Donoghue serves on the executive board of NEFAC, a six-     state effort promoting the First Amendment. He was on the New      England Press Association Board of Directors and various      committees 1995-2001. The Society of Professional Journalists      appointed Donoghue in 1990 to serve as the Vermont chairman      for Project Sunshine, a nationwide First Amendment effort--a      volunteer hat he still wears.       The VPA solicits nominations from Vermonters each year for      the Lyon award, which honors people who have an unwavering      devotion to the five freedoms within the First Amendment and      to the principle that the public's right to know the truth is      essential in a self-governed democracy, Flowers said.       Donoghue has been named to five halls of fame. They include      induction as one of 35 charter members selected by the New      England Press Association for its Community Journalism Hall      of Fame in 2000. Three years later he was named one of three      charter members selected nationwide by the Society of      Professional Journalists and The National Freedom of      Information Coalition for their National Hall of Fame for      Local Heroes.       Other honors include the Yankee Quill Award in 2007 for a      lifetime commitment to outstanding journalism in New England      and beyond; selected the New England Journalist of the Year      for print or electronic media in 2013; and voted by Gannett      employees nationwide to receive ``Greater Good Award'' from      the company in 2013.       The Lyon Award is named for a former Vermont congressman      who was jailed in 1798 under the Alien and Sedition Act for      sending a letter to the editor, criticizing President John      Adams. While Lyon was serving his federal sentence in a      Vergennes jail, Vermonters re-elected him to the U.S. House      of Representatives. Lyon is credited with ousting Adams when      he cast the deciding vote in favor of Thomas Jefferson when      the 1800 presidential race went to Congress for a final      determination.       Previous Matthew Lyon winners include Patrick J. Leahy for      his work as a state prosecutor and U.S. senator; Edward J.      Cashman for his efforts as Chittenden Superior Court clerk, a      state prosecutor and state judge; Robert Hemley, for his many      successful fights as a lawyer to keep courtrooms open and      court files available to the public; Gregory Sanford, state      archivist, for his work in maintaining, restoring and saving      government records for public access; H. Allen Gilbert,      executive director of ACLU in Vermont for fighting for      greater public access to government records and for public      disclosure about police misconduct; and Ken Squier and WDEV-     radio for efforts to inform Vermonters about state and local      issues.                          ____________________
