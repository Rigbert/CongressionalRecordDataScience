 I appreciate those comments. I think there are many in the Senate who share those comments. What is so significant to me because I know Dennis Ross--and Dennis Ross was really an excellent Middle East envoy, an excellent negotiator, fully knowledgeable about all of the points of convention--and I thought if anybody had a chance of achieving a settlement, it really was Dennis Ross and President Clinton. And, clearly, that did not happen. I think on this ``FOX News Sunday,'' Dennis Ross clearly said why it did not happen.  So I appreciate those comments.                          ____________________
