 Is the gentleman prepared to bring a comprehensive immigration bill to the floor?  I yield to my friend.  Mr. McCARTHY. I thank the gentleman for yielding. And if you looked at our committees, we are working on it, just as we say this body should. It should go through committee, have debate on both sides, and be open.  I believe this immigration system is broken, and I think that is the process we should take, not the action that the President took.
