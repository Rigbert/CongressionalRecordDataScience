 President, on one final matter, I know my friend from Texas will have some words to say about the man who has been helping him run the whip operation so effectively the last few years, and I know Senator Cornyn won't mind if I share a few thoughts first.  Russ Thomasson is preparing to bid farewell to the Senate after many years in the trenches. He is one of the most approachable and good-humored staffers around here. He is also incredibly effective.  This former intelligence officer always has his ear to the ground. When he takes the pulse of the Senate, it is with uncommon precision.  Russ loves a good nail-biter too. And in a more open, more freewheeling, and, by definition, more unpredictable Senate, you are inevitably going to have a few of those as well. What is important is that with Russ's help, we almost always seem to push through. Russ has all of the qualities you would look for in a highly successful member of our leadership team--always willing to take on the difficult but necessary tasks, unafraid to offer his candid advice, working each vote until the gavel falls, and defined by loyalty and integrity. This is someone whose judgment I value greatly.  I am glad Russ's son Austin got to see him in action. He has had a front-row seat as a page here in the Senate. We hope Austin will be seeing more of his dad soon, the same with his sister Sasha and Russ's wife Cindy.  Thank you, Russ, for your service to the Senate. You have been an invaluable member of our team, and you will be truly missed.                          ____________________
