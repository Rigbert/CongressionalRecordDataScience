It could very well be, and it is my understanding that some others do have an alternative that they want to have considered.  Mr. President, this is an issue that has been with us for a long time. Due to the great history that is very often presented to this Chamber by the occupier of the chair, we went back into history and saw that for hundreds of years we have been trying, many of us, as our forefathers tried, to make English the national language. The last time we had a vote was 1983. In 1983, there was a--I don't remember who the author was at the time, but it was before I even came to the House. But that was 23 years ago. So 23 years it has taken now to get a vote on this issue.  Ours is a very simple amendment. It is very straightforward. We have perfected it by adding things that the Senator from Tennessee and the Senator from Arizona and the Senator from Alabama have asked for, and we think as a result of that, we have a bill that is actually better than ours was when it first started.
