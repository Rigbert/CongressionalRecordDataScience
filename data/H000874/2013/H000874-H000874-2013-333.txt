McKeon, this is neither regular order nor rational policy. It ought to be rejected.  This CR does nothing to address the irrational cuts to defense and nondefense that the sequester will require.It could be very harmful to our economy and to our national security, and it could place the most vulnerable in America at great risk.  We should not allow, my colleagues, our government to shut down, but we cannot do business this way, lunching from one manufactured crisis to the next.  When we make agreements, we ought to stick to them. And the agreement was, as the chairman has tried to put forward--and I want to congratulate him for that--that we would spend on the discretionary side of the budget at about $1.43 billion. That is not what this bill does. It breaks the deal.  Nobody expected sequester to take place, and we ought to obviate it because it will hurt defense, our national security and our domestic security.  Mr. Speaker, we made an agreement. We ought to keep it. That's not what we have in this CR.  While the Defense funding in this package is something I would like to vote for and the procedures incorporated in the bill I would like to vote for--let me say as an aside, that is regular order. When we usually pass CRs, we do it for House-passed bill levels, Senate-passed bill levels, conference levels, but not at a level a year ago. The reason they've amended Defense, Veterans and MILCON is because it is irrational, and they recognize its irrationality as it relates to national security. You ought to recognize the irrationality for the rest of the budget.
