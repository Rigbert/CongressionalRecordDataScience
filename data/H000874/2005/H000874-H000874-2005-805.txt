Speaker, I wanted to join my colleagues and friend, the majority whip, the gentleman from Missouri (Mr. Blunt), who I presume has already spoken, in urging Members on both sides of the aisle in supporting this important bipartisan resolution that we have offered.  Over the last half century, the Members of this body have seldom had occasion to commend those on the Palestinian side whose cause, in my opinion, was hijacked by a leadership that preached death and destruction rather than reconciliation and peace. But today we would be remiss if we did not do so.  Three weeks ago on January 9 an estimated 70 percent of the 1.1 million registered Palestinian voters turned out to cast their ballots in an election that was declared fair by most international observers.                              {time}  1100  This strong turnout, in my judgment, not only reflects the universal appeal of democracy but also the human heart's yearning for freedom and self-determination.  This resolution commends the Palestinian people for conducting a free and fair election and congratulates the new Palestinian President, Mahmoud Abbas, who has previously disavowed terrorist activity and recently earned the praise of Israel for deploying more Palestinian security forces in Gaza to try to halt rocket and mortar attacks on Israeli citizens.  Among other provisions, this resolution urges the new Palestinian leadership to advance democratic ideals by reforming its political structure, advancing human rights and ending corruption.  It strongly condemns terrorism and urges President Abbas to immediately take steps to dismantle the Palestinian terrorist infrastructure, to bring terrorists to justice, and to end the incitement of hatred in the Palestinian media, schools, mosques, and other institutions.  It restates our Nation's strong commitment to and support, unwavering support, for the State of Israel.  Finally, Mr. Speaker, let me say that the election of President Abbas is an important opportunity and could prove to be an historical turning point in the Israeli-Palestinian conflict.  Israel has made repeated overtures over its history in an effort to speak peace, and, today, it continues to move forward with its withdrawal plan in the Gaza strip. Tragically, over the past 5 decades its efforts were consistently rebuffed by the Arafat-led Palestinian leadership.  Without question, there are great challenges ahead, but the election of President Abbas hopefully marks a new day, a day in which the Palestinian leadership becomes a serious, committed partner, a partner for peace in the Middle East.  I urge my colleagues to vote for this resolution. I thank the gentleman from California (Mr. Lantos), a giant in the area of human rights and supporting democratic efforts throughout the world, for his leadership, and I thank the gentlewoman from Florida (Ms. Ros-Lehtinen) for her unending efforts, in concert with the rest of us, to ensure that this Nation stands by Israel but stands with those in the Palestinian population who reach out for peace and partnership and a better tomorrow for all of the people of that troubled area of the world, and I thank the gentlewoman for yielding me the additional time.
