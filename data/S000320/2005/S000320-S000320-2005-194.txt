 President, I rise today to speak on amendment No. 1205 on which we will soon be voting. This is an amendment I offered yesterday to the Department of Homeland Security appropriations bill. I am joined by several cosponsors, including the ranking member on the Banking Committee, Senator Sarbanes, and also Senator Reed and many others.  As chairman of the Senate Banking Committee, which has jurisdiction over transit security, I can tell you that the committee has a long history of interest in this issue, and many of my colleagues on the Banking Committee join me in supporting this amendment.  This issue has been on our radar screen for some time. In fact, last year, the Banking Committee reported the Public Transportation Terrorism Prevention Act of 2004.
