 President, first, I want to thank Senator Cantwell for her leadership on this issue. This bill is a direct result of what we have seen traveling through our States and overseas.  Every time I travel to Iraq and Afghanistan, I am struck by the commitment and professionalism of the men and women of our military. They honor America with their service and dedication.  What is also noticeable to those of us who have been around for awhile is that it is impossible to tell who is in the Guard, the Reserves, or the Active Duty.  Unfortunately, when those same brave men and women return home, it is often to units lacking the most basic equipment--radios, trucks, and engineering equipment.  This is not ``nice to have'' equipment. It is the essential stuff, the most basic equipment, needed to respond to natural disasters or perform homeland defense missions.  When a governor calls the State Adjutant-General because there has been a major winter storm, severe flooding, or any natural disaster, that governor expects the National Guard to have the ability to get to the disaster area, assist those in need, and communicate with State and Federal leaders and others responding.  Today, many State Guard units may not be able to do those basic tasks because they do not have the equipment they need.  Why not? Three reasons.  First, for years the Guard was not given all of the equipment it needed. Most units had 65 to 79 percent of what they needed. So they started the war short.  Second, in 2003 the Army began a policy of leaving equipment in Iraq to reduce transportation costs and to make sure that those in Iraq would have what they needed. The Defense Department estimates that the Army Guard has left over $1.7 billion worth of equipment in Iraq and Afghanistan.  Unfortunately, the Government Accountability Office has found that the Army cannot account for over half of these items and, even worse, the Army has no plan for replacing the equipment.  Third, the Army has a huge equipment bill because the equipment in Iraq is being worn out at two to nine times the rate planned for and the Army is trying to transform itself into a modular force with entirely new and different equipment.  So, I understand why we have equipment shortages. What I don't understand is why the Secretary of Defense doesn't have a plan to fix the shortages.  In April of 2005, the Department of Defense issued a policy directive that said every time equipment is taken from a Reserve unit, a plan had to be developed within 90 days to replace that equipment.  It's been a full year since the policy was made official and yet States across the country are desperately short of needed equipment and have not seen any plans.  Our legislation would simply make 000 live up to its rhetoric and provide the plans it has promised.  There is more that we need to do to address equipment shortages throughout all of our ground forces, but at a minimum we should all be able to agree to start by following the current policy of the Defense Department and make a plan to replace equipment that is not being returned to State units.                                 ______                                       By
