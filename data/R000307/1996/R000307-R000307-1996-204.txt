Speaker, 1 year ago today, the Nation was gripped by the bombing of the Alfred P. Murrah Federal Building in Oklahoma City, OK. We looked on in shock and horror as rescue workers and members of the community tried valiantly to reach the victims still trapped in the rubble--victims who were young and old, victims who were somebody's child or parent, husband or wife, brother or sister, friend or colleague. The magnitude of the tragedy was incomprehensible, the sense of loss overwhelming. We were left, in the words of the Roman philosopher Virgil, with ``a grief too much to be told.''  As the hours and days passed, our grief continued to mount. Mixed with the grief was a sense of empathy and compassion so strong that it gave birth to courage and hope and a resolute spirit. We watched the faces of thousands of heroes as they reached out with gestures large and small. We knew as a community and as a nation that we would endure.  Some 168 lives were lost that day, including the lives of 7 employees from the Department of Agriculture's Animal and Plant Health Inspection Service [APHIS]. A little over a month after the bombing, we paid tribute to the seven APHIS employees on the floor of this Chamber. Last year in this Chamber I paid tribute to Olen Bloomer, Jim Boles, Peggy Clark, Dick Cummins, Adele Higginbottom, Carole Khalil, and Rheta Long. I spoke of the lives they had led--good, productive, loving lives--and remembered their dedication to their work and their families. Today, we honor their memory and we remember as well the other victims, the survivors, and all the people whose lives were so sadly transformed by the events in Oklahoma.                          ____________________
