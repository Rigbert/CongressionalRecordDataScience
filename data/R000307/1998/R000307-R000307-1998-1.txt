President, a few weeks ago I called the Senate's attention to several issues in the military that are contributing to problems in recruiting and retention of key, midcareer military personnel. Briefly, those issues were as follows:  We are asking the military, significantly smaller than it was during the cold war, to operate and deploy much more frequently.  We are asking the military to deploy on missions that may not be in the vital national interest of this Nation.  We are not paying servicemen and women a salary that is comparable to the pay they could get outside the military for the same skills.  We are not providing quality health care for the families of the military, and we have not provided the promised health care for the retired members of the military.  We are not providing quality housing to all military families.  And we are not providing a retirement program that is adequate to justify a career commitment to the arduous lifestyle and the difficult family separations that are necessary in military life.  Mr. President, I rise today to offer legislation to address military retirement. The bill that I am introducing repeals the Military Reform Retirement Act of 1986, also known as REDUX. This experiment in the military retirement system was introduced in 1986 with the intended purpose--and it was a good one--of encouraging members of the military to stay longer than the popular career of 20 years.  The service chiefs now say that retirement is one of the top reasons that our men and women are leaving the service. The Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, General Shelton, listed it among the most pressing problems facing the military in retaining key people. The Secretary of Defense has voiced very similar concerns.  Pay is being addressed slowly, including a 3.6 percent pay raise in this defense appropriations bill.  The Department of Defense is working on housing issues that may solve the problems. Problems with the health care programs are very complex and multilayered and requires detailed study to solve. The issue of the high rate of deployments and the quality ofmissions rests at the feet of the administration and this Congress and are now the subject of policy debate.  Congress must address, however, the issue of retirement. We must show the men and women of our armed services that we are listening to their concerns and that we deeply care about them, their families and the commitment they make to the defense of this Nation.  While the purpose of this bill is to repeal the 1986 retirement program, I want to emphasize it is not the final solution to the military's retirement problem. I urge the Department of Defense to start a comprehensive study--I think they are--and to examine all creative options to solve the recruitment and retention problems that now face the military.  The repeal of REDUX is only but one option. There may be others. I know that private industry has many creative retirement programs that may serve as part of a final solution. The civilian sector of the Federal Government has long experience in retirement programs. Whatever course we end up taking, the bottom line must be a retirement program that is perceived as fair and adequate by our service men and women.  The fundamental job of the Federal Government is to provide for the security of the Nation. That security begins and ends with people. It is clear that they are sending a strong message that we are letting them down. We are not providing adequately for their welfare and their postmilitary life.  So providing better benefits for members of the military will pay dividends for national security. And, Mr. President, it is the right thing to do. We owe it to our military men and women who are making the personal and family sacrifices to do such an important job. They do an outstanding job under the most difficult of circumstances. It is not too much to ask that we provide adequate support for them and their families.  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be printed in the Record.  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the Record, as follows:                                S. 2563       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of      the United States of America in Congress assembled,     SECTION 1.

EFFECTIVE DATE.       This Act and the amendments made by this Act shall take      effect on October 1, 1999, and shall apply with respect to      retired or retainer pay accruing for months beginning on or      after that date.  Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, I rise to support and cosponsor the legislation that Senator Roberts introduced earlier today that reinstates the 50 percent retirement ``earned benefit'' plan for men and women in the military who retire with 20 years of military service. I also implore the Senate leadership to act quickly on this legislation and move for its swift passage before the 105th Congress adjourns for the year.  Times have changed since 1986. Our economy has prospered, producing historically high levels of employment and resulting in the emergence of a very difficult recruiting and retention environment for the armed services. Maintaining a top-quality force requires a military personnel system that has the flexibility to react quickly to the dynamics of the civilian market, and the leadership and confidence to follow through with critical personnel decisions rather than neglecting them out of fiscal opportunism. Regrettably, this year, first, second, and third-term enlisted retention, pilot and mid-grade officer retention, and recruiting are all short of the goal for each of the services.  Recruiting and retaining quality individuals requires pay scales that adjust to meet prevailing rates rather than fall 14 percent behind comparable civilian pay. It requires adequate funding for recruiting. It requires proper promotion rates--not promotion boards that take five months to process reports of promotion boards, as is the case with the Navy. It requires proper living conditions and morale, welfare and recreation services. It also requires reasonable tours of duty, a higher quality of civilian leadership, and ``role models'' within the leadership who are seen to take service members' quality-of-life concerns to heart.  Reinstatement of the 50 percent retirement plan for career military men and women would serve as an important signal of resolve to our service members that the United States Congress is aware of the shortfall in benefits for those who wear the uniform of their country and is acting to improve those benefits. Last week, the Senate Armed Services Committee heard directly from the Joint Chiefs that restoring retirement benefits is a requirement for recruiting and retaining the qualified individuals we rely on to defend this nation.  General Hugh Shelton, Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, stated clearly that fixing the military retirement system is a top recommendation for restoring the readiness of our armed forces. Army Chief of Staff General Reimer has written to me that       . . .the retirement package we have offered our soldiers      entering the Army since 1986 is inadequate. Having lost 25      percent of its lifetime value as a result of the 1980's      reforms, military retirement is no longer our number one      retention tool. Our soldiers and families deserve better. We      need to send them a strong signal that we haven't forgotten      them.  The military medical health care system, particularly the TRICARE program, has been described by ServiceChiefs as falling far short of what is warranted and needed. We cannot ignore the erosion of retirement and health care benefits, and the resultant impact on retention and readiness. General Reimer writes,       ``The loss in medical benefits when a retiree turns 65 is      particularly bothersome to our soldiers who are making career      decisions.''  From the Service Chiefs' answers, it is highly questionable whether we are meeting any of these requirements. On the contrary, it is clear that there is much work to be done.  Finally, it is demoralizing to the men and women we send into harm's way, and is incomprehensible to the American people, who expect a well-trained and well-equipped force, to witness as many as 25,000 military personnel and their families on food stamps. One tax provision that I have tried to reverse this year excludes uniformed men and women in the military from beneficial tax treatment on the profits resulting from the sale of their homes. We order servicemembers to move from place to place, but we do not afford them the same tax treatment as other U.S. citizens. Should this issue have been permitted to exist for so many years?  Mr. President, we cannot afford to neglect this array of personnel concerns. Let us begin by acting immediately to restore the higher earned benefit plan for retired service members. Senator Roberts has offered critical legislation to help reverse the diminishing retention rates that cripple our Armed Services and ultimately diminish their ability to execute our National Military Strategy. On behalf of all men and women who have honorably dedicated their careers to serving this country in uniform, I urge my colleagues to join me in support of this legislation.                                 ______                                       By
