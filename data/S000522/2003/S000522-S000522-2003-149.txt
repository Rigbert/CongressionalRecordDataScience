Mr. Chairman, I rise in support of the amendment and ask unanimous consent to revise and extend my remarks.  This amendment sends a signal to the government of the Indian state of Tamil Nadu that it must abide by its contracts with American and other foreign investors. Five American energy companies built state-of-the-art energy plants in Tamil Nadu. These companies negotiated contracts with the state government to provide energy at a guaranteed minimum rate. However, the government of Tamil Nadu has paid less than this guaranteed rate to the tune of over $130 million.  One of the affected companies, CMS Energy, is based in the 7th district of Michigan. CMS built a state-of-the-art energy plant, providing jobs and training to the Tamil people. It also provides steady energy to support economic development and growth in Tamil Nadu. The government of Tamil Nadu's violation of its contract has cost CMS over $14 million.  The amendment affects only the state of Tamil Nadu. It is not anti-India. It will do nothing to affect other Indian states that respect the sanctity of contracts and provide an excellent environment for the foreign investment that benefits both India and investors. We should not be using our aid to reward governments that do not respect contracts.
