President, I just flew in from Chicago. Early this morning, I was given the news that I had lost a great friend and one of my dearest colleagues; Senator Frank Lautenberg of New Jersey passed away.  Most of us saw Frank a few weeks ago. He was here on the floor of theSenate. He had to come down; it was one of those moments where his vote was crucial. We knew he was struggling, but we also knew he would be here. He said he would, and he was. He sat right over here in a wheelchair, with that trademark Frank Lautenberg smile. I don't think I have ever run into a person in my life as happy as Frank Lautenberg. He was a great joke-teller.
