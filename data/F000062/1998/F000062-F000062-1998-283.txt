 There is a very interesting letter from Genentech. Genentech is a huge biotech firm. Actually, biotechnology was spawned out of San Francisco and Genentech was one of the very first companies in the Nation to enter this area. They have a very cogent letter that states well their opposition. They point out, ``. . . deliberate and exercise caution and restraint in legislating this issue.''  I ask unanimous consent that the February 9 letter from the Biotechnology Industry Organization be printed in the Record.  There being no objection, it has been ordered to be printed in the Record, as follows:  Regarding Human Cloning Legislation Tuesday Cloture Vote: S. 1601,                                Bond/Lott                                                 February 9, 1998.       Dear Senator: Tomorrow the Senate is scheduled to vote on      cloture on S. 1601, the Bond/Lott human cloning bill. The      Biotechnology Industry Organization (BIO) urges you to vote      ``no'' on the cloture petition. BIO represents 760      biotechnology companies throughout the world engaged in      research on diseases, the immune system, cell therapy,      vaccines, drugs/biologics, antibiotics, and gene therapy.       The Bond/Lott bill is not ripe for consideration by the      Senate. It was introduced on Wednesday of last week, no      hearings have     been held on it and no mark-up in the two committees with      jurisdiction have been held on it. Most important, the bill      as drafted would have a dire impact on biomedical research      completely unrelated to human cloning.       This is not a human cloning bill. This is a bill which bans      the use of biomedical technology even if that use has nothing      whatever to do with human cloning.       A ``no'' vote is a vote to protect biomedical research on      deadly and disabling diseases.       There is no rush to legislate. The FDA has jurisdiction      over Dr. Seed and any others. Violations of the FDA      regulatory requirements carry draconian penalties. A ``no''      vote is a vote to proceed with caution to make sure that      biomedical research is not harmed.       A ``no'' vote is a vote to restrict this bill to the human      cloning issue.       A ``no'' vote is a vote to permit the Senate Labor and      Senate Judiciary Committees, which have jurisdiction over the      bills to take care to draft the legislation and confine it to      the human cloning issue.       BIO believes that a human cloning experiment would be      utterly unethical and unsafe. What we are writing about here      is our views on the terms of the Bond/Lott bill, not the      larger debate about human cloning.       Attached is a more detailed statement outlining our      concerns about the Bond/Lott bill which was printed in the      Congressional Record on Thursday. If you have any questions      about our position, please feel free to call at 857-0244.           Sincerely,     Nancy Bradish,       Director, Federal Government Relations.     Charles E. Ludlam,       Vice President for Government Relations.
