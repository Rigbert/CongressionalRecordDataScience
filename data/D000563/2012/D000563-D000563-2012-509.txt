This National Labor Relations Board rule which will be voted on by the Senate tomorrow is one that was needed. The rule change was needed and the attempt on the floor, of course, is to undo this decision by the National Labor Relations Board.  If they say justice is denied, look at the current situation when it comes to a vote by workers on collective bargaining. If delayed at every potential opportunity, and sometimes it happens, workers have to wait, on average--average--198 days--that is 6\1/2\ months--to have a simple vote deciding if they would be represented by the union. In some extreme cases they have been forced to wait 13 years for the right to vote on collective bargaining.  One in five workers who openly advocate for unions during an election campaign is fired. As a result of these tactics, 35 percent of workers give up and withdraw from the election before a vote is held. The proposed NLRB rule changes will remove unnecessary delays to the process, cut down on unnecessary litigation, and provide workers a meaningful vote in a reasonable period of time. The proposed rules will apply the same way to workers attempting to decertify a union as they do to workers trying to form a union. So from the business side, if they think workers no longer wish to belong to a union, there will be a timely vote on that as well. It applies the same way to unions and employers.  This rule is fundamentally fair, and that is why I encourage my colleagues to join with me and Senator Murray and many others in voting against this effort by Senator Enzi to overturn the proposed National Labor Relations Board rule.  As I said earlier, Madam President, the rule applies the same way to unions and employers. But it does not require that elections be held within a specific time period and it does not deny companies the opportunity to express their opinion about union representation. The only real impact of the rule changes will be to better protect workers' right to make a determination for themselves through a reasonable fair timely election.  The NLRB rules create a uniform process for resolving pre- and post-election disputes to provide consistency and remove unnecessary obstacles to workers' right to vote.  NLRB hearing officers will be empowered to dismiss claims that would not impact the election. At the pre-election hearing, employers and unions can raise their concerns about the petition, but they can't play games to stall the election.  The rules consolidates the pre-election and post-election appeals into a single postelection procedure, which saves the parties from having to file and brief appeals that may be costly and useless based on the outcome of the election.  The new rules make Board review of the regional directors' decisions discretionary. This change will require parties to identify compelling reason for Board review, allowing the Board to devote its limited time to cases where its review is warranted.  The new rules apply to both elections seeking to certify a union and elections seeking to decertify a union. Further, the new rules do not alter in any way an employer's ability to communicate with workers during the election period and do not require that elections be held within a certain period of time.  In the view of organized labor, these rules, even in their scaled back form, are one of few positive actions taken by Congress or the administration in the last year. Unions argue that the old rules are subject to manipulation, causing significant pre-election delay and leading to petitions being withdrawn prior to an election or avoidance of Board processes altogether. If an employer takes advantage of every opportunity for delay, the average time before workers vote is 198 days.  Business groups are opposed to the new NLRB rules arguing it will limit their ability to present their side in an election. Most of their points against the rule relate to provisions of the proposed rule that were not included in the final rule. Their position also stems from general opposition to the NLRB for the now settled Boeing issue, new worker rights posting requirements, the President's NLRB recess appointments, and other NLRB decisions.
