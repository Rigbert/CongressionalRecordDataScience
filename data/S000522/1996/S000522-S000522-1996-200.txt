Mr. Speaker, I thank my friend for yielding me time.  Mr. Speaker, I just want to advise the body that the gentleman's statement a moment ago was entirely wrong. There is nothing authorizing or providing for population control funds in this bill either way. It simply is silent on the issue. There is no foreign aid in this bill. That was dropped atthe insistence of the Democrats during the House-Senate conference committee, and it would have led to a filibuster beyond any doubt on the Senate side had we insisted that be in there. So it was dropped. It is not there.  Mr. Speaker, I would like to address some of my remarks this evening to my Democratic colleagues, because, frankly, I am astonished again by some of the disinformation going on about what is in the bill or not in the bill.  I am also a little bit hurt by the suggestion this was not a bipartisan bill. The budget savings in the consolidation provisions are there, but they have been modified. There has been compromise with a capital ``C'' with regards to this bill to meet what we thought were the administration's objections. But the goal posts keep moving back.  Let me speak primarily, however, to the human rights provisions which we have worked very, very hard in my Subcommittee on International Operations and Human Rights and in the full committee with the leadership of the gentleman from New York [Mr. Gilman].  Opposition to the violation of fundamental human rights is not a partisan issue, and this bill contains stronger human rights provisions than any previous foreign relations authorization act that I have seen on this floor during my 16 years as a Member of this House. Frankly, they were even stronger when the bill passed the House, but we had to moderate some of them and we dropped others to meet the objections of the administration.  I am very pleased that the Humanitarian Corridors Act is in this report. I offered that bill as a freestanding bill and as an amendment to the bill when it came up. It seems to me a very modest proposal to say that those countries that receive U.S. foreign assistance cannot impede or inhibit or proscribe the transiting of humanitarian aid to another country.  I speak, of course, to Turkey and the fact they have disallowed humanitarian assistance to Armenia. It is important if we have relations and provide foreign aid that we say to our allies, allow these medicines and other kinds of assistance to get to our friends in Armenia.  There is also the McBride Principles championed by our good and distinguished chairman, the gentleman from New York [Mr. Gilman]. That is in here. I just notice and would say parenthetically, Mr. Clinton just got the Irishman-of-the-Year award. He should not veto this bill. This will be the first time we codify the McBride Principles that many of us have talked about. Now we are going to do something about it in this legislation.  There is also an authority to provide the Special Envoy to Tibet. It is not mandatory. I think it is a step forward in the right direction, so that human rights can be further recognized in that very troubled region of the world.  The Migration and Refugee Assistance provisions come under our subcommittee. We, after hearings and hearing from all of the refugee community, have decided that it was very important that we hold harmless the refugee budget. The world is awash with refugees. We have to at least provide, I think, this modest amount of money to provide for them. There is $671 million in each of the fiscal years for refugee programs, $500,000 higher than the administration's 1996 request, and substantially higher than the estimates that the administration's requests were based on for 1997. So we held those refugee assistance accounts harmless.  There is also allocation of funds for certain Burmese refugees and for the resettlement of refugees to Israel. They are carried over from the prior year. We have also authorized such funds that are necessary for the resettlement of certain Southeast Asia refugees in the high risk categories identified by the Lautenberg amendment, primarily those that served with the United States forces in the former government of South Vietnam, religious refugees and members of the Hmong ethnic minority from Laos.  Subsection 1104(b) prohibits expenditures on programs involving repatriation to Vietnam, to Laos or Cambodia, unless the remaining asylum seekers have been or will be interviewed by United States immigration officers, and unless resettlement offers have been made or will be made to those found to be refugees under United States law.  This provision was modified in conference to make it clear that the refugee status interviews can, under certain circumstances, be held in the asylum seeker's country of origin. This is to accommodate the administration's so-called Track Two plan for interviews in Vietnam. This plan will only work if we can somehow guarantee the safety of the asylum seekers during the interview process. We are not there yet, but this provision, which did pass the House 266 to 156 in a broad bipartisan vote, will help us with those boat people, so that we close out the comprehensive plan of action with honor and kindness, and not cruelty.  The section on the Cuban immigration policies, and this is I think very timely, Mr. Chairman, this would require periodic reports on the Cuban Government's methods of enforcing its 1994 and 1995 anti-immigration agreements with the United States, and on the treatment of persons returned by the United States to Cuba.       section 1252, extension of certain adjudication provisions  Mr. Speaker, this section extends the Lautenberg amendment, which identifies certain high-risk refugee categories and provides that applicants in these categories are presumed to be refugees if they assert both a fear of persecution and a credible basis for their fear of persecution. The high-risk categories include nationals or residents of an independent state of the former Soviet Union or Estonia, Latvia, or Lithuania who are Jews or evangelical Christians, as well as certain Southeast Asians. (See section 1104 above.) The provision would also extend until October 1, 1997, the Attorney General's ability to adjust the status of aliens who are nationals of an independent state of the former Soviet Union, Estonia, Latvia, Lithuania, Vietnam, Laos, or Cambodia and were granted parole into the United States after August 14, 1988, to the status of aliens lawfully admitted for permanent residence. section 1253, U.S. policy regarding the involuntary return of refugees  The House-passed provision would have provided that no funds authorized by this act be used for the involuntary return of any person to a country in which he or she has a well-founded fear of persecution. This provision has been modified to meet DOS concerns. The conference provision omits the prohibition against using DOS funds to assist or promote such returns--to meet the argument that the House-passed provision might have been violated if a DOS official made a phone call. Also, the provision is now limited to refugee accounts, not all DOS accounts. The effect of this provision, therefore, is to provide that funds for refugee protection may not be used to forcibly repatriate people unless it has been determined that they are not refugees.section 1255, persecution for resistance to coercive population control                                 methods  This section would provide that forced abortion, forced sterilization, or persecution for resistance to such measures are persecution on account of political opinion within the meaning of the refugee definition in the Immigration and Nationality Act. It would effectively reinstate the prior interpretation of the law, which was reversed by an INS order on August 5, 1994.   sec. 1256, u.s. policy with respect to the involuntary return of                       persons subjected to torture  This section would prohibit the use of funds authorized by this act in the involuntary return of any person to a place in which he or she is in serious danger of subjection to torture. This provision has been substantially modified to meet DOS concerns. The section now specifically subjects the definition of torture to all reservations, understandings, etc., adopted by the United States when it ratified the Convention Against Torture. The conference also eliminated the assist or promote language to which DOS objected. (See section 1254 above.)      sec. 1304, responsibilities of bureau charged with refugees  The House-passed provision would have established. This provision would have established a coordinator for human rights and refugees within the Office of the Secretary of State. It would also have established a statutory bureau of Refugee and Migration assistance. Under the House provision, the coordinator for human rights and refugees would supervise the Bureau of Refugee and Migration Assistance and the Bureau of Democracy, Human Rights, and Labor, and would report directly to the Secretary of State. The conference substantially modified this provision to meet DOS concerns. The Department had argued that human rights and refugee protection are distinct functions requiring two separate bureaus, and also that the institution of a co-ordinator who reported to the Secretary rather than an Undersecretary might have the unintended effect of isolating these bureaus. Theconference therefore modified the provision to specify only that the bureau with responsibility for refugee and migration and refugee assistance be independent of the bureau charged with responsibility for population policy. The department can, of course, still maintain a population office in another bureau, as it did prior to 1993. The present provision is designed to reinforce the principle that refugees are linked primarily to human rights problems, not demographic problems.  Related human rights issues:     sec. 1102(e), limitation on funding for undp programs in burma  Reduces funding to the UNDP in each fiscal eyar by the estimated cost of UNDP projects in and for Burma, unless the President certifies that all such projects are directed toward the needs of the poor; are conducted through international or private voluntary organizations independent of the SLORC; do not benefit the SLORC; and are endorsed by the democratic leadership of the Burmese people.            sec. 1408, conduct of certain exchange programs  This section requires that exchanges with countries whose people do not enjoy freedom and democracy be carried out in cooperation with human rights and pro-democracy leaders in these countries. The administration successfully argued for the deletion of language that would have extended eligibility for scholarships and exchanges in such countries--including China, Viet Nam, Cambodia, Laos, and East Timor--to exiles from these countries. sec. 1410, educational and cultural exchanges for tibetans and burmese  This section carries over a provision of prior law to require that exiles from these countries be eligible for scholarships and exchange programs. In the absence of this provision, exiles would be excluded from eligibility for such programs, and the selection process would necessarily be conducted in cooperation with the regimes that rule Burma and Tibet.        sec. 1611, reports to congress on bosnia and herzegovina  This section requires periodic reports on human rights protection under the Dayton agreement, the status of refugees, and the treatment of the Albanian ethnic majority in Serb-held Kosova.  Mr. Speaker, we have heard about how this bill is pro-fiscal responsibility. It is also pro-human rights. I urge a ``yes'' vote on the conference report.
