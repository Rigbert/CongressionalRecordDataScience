President, I rise to honor two great Oklahomans, Rick and Kathy Clarke, who are in Washington, DC, for the Congressional Coalition on Adoption Institute's annual Angels in Adoption Gala. I was pleased to select Rick and Kathy as 2008 Angels in Adoption because of their great commitment to adoption at both a personal and professional level.  When Rick Clarke served for 5 years as a judge in juvenile court, working with abused and neglected children every day, both he and his wife, Kathy, formed a desire to help children who are most in need--those without families. Today, Rick dedicates part of law practice to adoption cases. He serves as a volunteer attorney through Tulsa Lawyers for Children, as a guardian ad litem through court appointments, and is on the board of Heritage Family Services, a Tulsa-based adoption agency. Kathy has served as a Court Appointed Special Advocate for children. She also currently works on special education issues and is a member of the PTA.  However, it is this family's personal story that sets it apart. The Clarkes have personally participated in the adoption process for 13 years and have adopted nine children. Throughout these years, the Clarke family has faced tragedies, hardships, and obstacles. Yet they continue to grow as a family, both in number and in character.  The Clarke's first adopted child was a 3-year-old boy from Oklahoma. The next two young children joined the family from Russia after being diagnosed with medical complications. The Clarkes later adopted three unrelated girls--aged 15, 13, and 8--through Oklahoma Department of Human Services. Lastly, they provided homes to two sisters from Liberia and an older boy from Ethiopia.  The faith and perseverance of Rick and Kathy Clarke enables them to overcome the challenges of providing a permanent and loving home to so many children. Remaining steadfast in their dedication and belief that God has a special plan for every child, Rick and Kathy have raised each of their nine children to be productive, healthy, and strong leaders in their schools and communities.  The Clarkes truly represent the blessings and the power of adoption. I am pleased to congratulate Rick and Kathy Clarke, Oklahoma's 2008 Angels in Adoption, and to welcome them to our Nation's Capital for this special honor.                          ____________________
