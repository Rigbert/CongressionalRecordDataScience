Another person comes to me and says: My mother is in a nursing home with Alzheimer's. It has been going on for years. It is a burden on our family. Or into the congressional district now represented by Congressman Lane Evans, my closest friend in our delegation and a personal hero to me, a man suffering from Parkinson's disease who now has to withdraw from public life to fight this battle--aren't these the real-life stories of real-life people who are not reflected in the agenda nor in the priorities of the Republican-led Senate?
