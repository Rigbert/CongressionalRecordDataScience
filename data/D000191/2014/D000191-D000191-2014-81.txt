Chair, I thank the gentleman for yielding. It is not so obvious with this administration. They are desperate for the TPP, they are desperate for the trans-America free trade agreement, and we are very worried that they would think that disapproving this application from Ireland representing Norway, who intends to operate a rent-an-airline, rent-a-crew from Singapore, would somehow derail their talks. So I don't think it is obvious. This is sending a message to the White House that we are not going to let this happen.  With that, I thank the gentleman.
