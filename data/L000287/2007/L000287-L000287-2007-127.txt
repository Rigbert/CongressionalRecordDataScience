Mr. Speaker, I want to thank Mr. Deal and members of the delegation for bringing this resolution before us as a tribute to our fallen colleague, Mr. Norwood.  More than anything else, Congressman Norwood was a warrior. He fought for his beliefs with passion and conviction, and he fought for the people of his district and for the people of Georgia who loved him.  He was awarded two Bronze Stars for his bravery on behalf of our Nation during the Vietnam war, and he fought courageously for patient rights right here on the floor of the House of Representatives.  In fact, his last official act was to reintroduce the Patients' Bill of Rights on Monday, a bill he coauthored with John Dingell. Charlie Norwood, this good man, this son of Georgia, fought a good fight. He was a warrior to the end.  The thoughts and prayers of all of the Members of Congress, and especially the members of the Georgia delegation, are with his wife Gloria and his two sons, Charles and Carlton, their family and his many grandchildren. I hope they will find comfort in knowing that Congressman Charlie Norwood made a lasting contribution not just to the State of Georgia, but to the Nation and to all of us as Members of this body. We are more than lucky, we are very blessed to have known him as a friend and as a colleague. He will be deeply missed.  Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.
