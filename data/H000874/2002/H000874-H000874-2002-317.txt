Speaker, on the eve of Christopher Reeve's 50th birthday, I would like to recognize his unfailing courage, strength, and faith as he has worked to overcome paralysis. Not only has Christopher Reeve put a human face on spinal cord injury, but he has become a leading advocate for medical research, better care for people with spinal cord injury and for increased quality of life for the more than two million Americans living with paralysis.  After graduating from Cornell University in 1974 and studying at Julliard, Christopher Reeve made his broadway debut opposite Katherine Hepburn in A Matter of Gravity. Best known for his star role in Superman and its many sequels, Christopher Reeve has dazzled the big screen and stage in numerous productions, such as The Bostonians, Street Smart, Speechless, Noises Off, Above Suspicion, The Remains of the Day, and most recently, Rear Window. He made his directorial debut with In the Gloaming in 1997, which received five Emmy nominations and published his autobiography, Still Me in 1998, which spent eleven weeks on the New York Times Bestseller List.  But beyond his experience within the entertainment arena, Christopher Reeve has achieved great success in a new and much more challenging role: a survivor of spinal cord injury who is working toward a medical miracle. Christopher Reeve has become a beacon of hope for all people with spinal cord injury and paralysis. The recent news reports about his medical progress has been an inspiration for not only those living with paralysis, but also for the medical research community. For the first time since his accident in 1995, Christopher Reeve is able to wiggle his fingers and toes, experience sensation in his body, and tell the difference between hot and coldsomething that the medical community did not believe was possible in someone so far removed from the initial time of his accident.  Christopher Reeve's recovery and recent scientific evidence show that there is hope for those living with paralysis. At research centers in the United States, Europe and Japan, new techniques of rigorous exercise has helped an estimated 500 persons with paraplegia and limited sensations in their lower bodies to walk for short distances, either unassisted or using walkers.  While the results of these new methods are quite miraculous, the limits of what physical exercise can do for patients remains grossly understudied. While each person and each injury is unique, and some people recover spontaneously, an estimated 200,000 Americans are living with spinal cord injuries that have not improved. Which therapy or combination of therapies will work for each persons is unknown. Today 2 million Americans are living with paralysis, including spinal cord injury, stroke, cerebral palsy, multiple sclerosis, ALS and spina bifida. We need research to see how these new interventions work on the entire population of individuals living with paralysis.  Tomorrow, I will join my colleagues in introducing the Christopher Reeve Paralysis Act of 2002, which seeks to further advance the science needed to help those living with paralysis take that next step and at the same time build quality of life program in the state that will further advance full participation, independent living, self-sufficiency and equality of opportunity for individuals with paralysis and other physical disabilities.  Those living with paralysis face astronomical medical costs, and our best estimates tell us that only one-third of those individuals remain employed after paralysis. At least one-third of those living with paralysis have incomes of $15,000 or less. And over the past 20 years, overall days spent in the hospital and rehabilitation centers for those living with paralysis have been cut in half.  Christopher Reeve's recent triumphs in overcoming paralysis prove how close we are to achieving major breakthroughs for people who have paralysis. The Christopher Reeve Paralysis Act of 2002 will ensure that the federal government does its part to help the more than two million Americans with paralysis who are still waiting for their own breakthroughs.  As John F. Kennedy once said, The stories of past courage can define that ingredientthey can teach, they can offer hope, they can provide inspiration. But they cannot supply courage itself. For this each man must look into his own soul. Since Christopher Reeve was injured, his tireless efforts to walk again, coupled with his faith, passion and commitment to improve quality of life for others living with paralysis, make him an inspiration to us all. Happy Birthday, Chris.                          ____________________
