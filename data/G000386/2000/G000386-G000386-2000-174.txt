 President, recently Congress passed the Agricultural Risk Protection Act. This legislation provides reform for the Federal Crop Insurance Program, economic assistance to farmers, and the establishment of new, innovative programs to assist the agricultural community. One of the innovative programs established in the bill is what I have termed the Agriculture Marketing Equity Capital Fund.  The Agriculture Marketing Equity Capital Fund will assist independent grain and livestock producers nationwide develop new value-added agricultural opportunities. Independent producers will use these funds to develop business plans, feasibility studies, and business ventures with packers and processors.  While I was able to garner the support of many of the nation's largest commodity organizations, I met fierce opposition from the American Meat Institute's Washington lobbyists. My floor statement during the debate over the crop insurance conference report was highly critical of their efforts. It is not my intent to attack the individual members of AMI, but I believe it is important that they understand my position.  AMI's Washington lobbyists misrepresented the provision. A story written within ``Inside AMI'' recently explained:       Senator Chuck Grassley pushed conferees to provide for a      $35 million Agriculture Marketing Equity Capital Fund. The      proposal was yet another attempt to fund an NPPC proposal      that seeks to secure government funding to establish a      national pork cooperative and use government funds to buy,      build or purchase equity in a pork slaughter and processing      facility.  This a blatant misrepresentation of the facts. My provision never had anything to do with publicly financing the construction of a pork plant.  My staff did contact AMI's Washington lobbyists who explained the opposition was based on the possibility of government-funded competition and specifically that funds would be used to develop a plant. In good faith, my staff offered AMI's Washington lobbyists an opportunity to offer their input on the legislation.  I cannot guarantee that AMI's input would have been acceptable to me, but we will never know if a mutually beneficial position could have been established because my office never received a response. I have been a friend of the agriculture community for a very long time. I am disappointed and dismayed by the way this was handled by AMI's Washington representatives.  As I promised in my crop insurance floor statement, I am today asking unanimous consent to place a list of AMI's member companies in the Congressional Record. Once again, I'm not saying that every processor or packer on this list knew what AMI's Washington lobbyists were doing, but I hope to inform every member what happened and why independent producers won't have the funds to reach out to processors in joint ventures and receive working capital to help everyone survive and thrive. I am also enclosing the text of a letter I recently sent to AMI's members.  It is my hope that members of AMI see the value of my efforts and work with me in the future to improve the plight of the independent producer. Providing stability to family farmers through joint ventures with AMI's membership would only serve to benefit both parties in the long-run.  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in the Record, as follows:                                                     June 9, 2000.       Dear AMI member: I am writing to express how disappointed I      am with your Washington lobbyists and their efforts to      misrepresent and thus undermine my attempts to help American      farmers.       You may have read a recent ``Inside AMI'' story claiming      that, ``Senator Grassley pushed conferees to provide for a      $35 million Agriculture Marketing Equity Capital Fund. The      proposal was yet another attempt to fund a National Pork      Producers Council proposal that seeks to secure government      funding to establish a national pork cooperative and use      government funds to buy, build or purchase equity in a pork      slaughter and processing facility.''       This claim is a blatant misrepresentation of the facts. The      truth is that the provision your lobbyists were attacking had      nothing to do with publicly financing the construction of a      pork plant. These funds are intended to be used by      independent grain and livestock producers to develop business      plans, feasibility studies, and business ventures with      packers and processors. While some may believe the truth is      no longer relevant in Washington, D.C., that attitude will be      given no quarter in dealings with me.       My staff reached out to your's to make certain they      understood the error in their representations of my proposal,      as well as to request alternative suggestions. No response      ever came. Unfortunately, many of my colleagues were misled      by your staff, and my proposal was gutted.       I wanted you to hear directly from me because I have had a      long and positive working relationship with many AMI members      over the years and I hope that this can be the case in the      future. I believe, however, that it would be appropriate to      investigate for yourself the concerns I have raised about      your Washington representatives.           Sincerely,                                              Charles E. Grassley,                                                     U.S. Senator.       P.S.: I have included a copy of my floor statement for your      review.                                  ____                    American Meat Institute Members     Bar-S Foods Co.
