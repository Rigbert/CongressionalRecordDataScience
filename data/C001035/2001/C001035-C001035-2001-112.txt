President, if the Senator will yield, I point out to the Senator that the yeas and nays were ordered on the Collins-Warner amendment last Thursday night when it was first debated for a half hour on the Senate floor. This isn't a new amendment or a new request. The yeas and nays were, in fact, ordered last week. I wanted to clarify that for the record.
