 President, I rise to honor the service and sacrifice of Officer Phillip Meacham, of the Hopkinsville Police Department, who lost his life in faithful service to his community.  Like all members of law enforcement, Officer Meacham put his safety at risk each and every day for those he was sworn to protect. However, on March 29, 2018, tragedy struck in a targeted act of violence when an individual impersonating a police officer fatally shot him.  For a small community like Hopkinsville, KY, Officer Meacham's killing appalled everyone to their core. This type of senseless violence had no place in their or any community, and Officer Meacham's loss sent shockwaves throughout western Kentucky. During his funeral procession, hundreds of people--both friends and total strangers--lined the streets to honor him.  Officer Meacham joined the Hopkinsville Police Department last May after more than a decade at the Christian County Sherriff's Department. His honorable service to this community will be remembered for years to come by the men and women who served with him in uniform and by the wife and young daughter he left behind.  As the community mourns Officer Meacham, we are all reminded of the ever-present danger that the brave members of law enforcement face. Officer Meacham's courage and heroism were hallmarks of his service, and his community is safer because of him.  I would like to express my deepest condolences to Officer Meacham's family, to the Hopkinsville Police Department, and to all those who knew him. I ask my Senate colleagues to join me in honoring this Kentucky hero.                          ____________________
