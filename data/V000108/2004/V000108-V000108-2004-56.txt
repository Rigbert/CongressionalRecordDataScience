Speaker, it is my distinct honor to congratulate some of the most dedicated and skilled workers in Northwest Indiana. The Northwest Indiana Federation of Labor AFL-CIO will recognize these individuals for their dedication during a banquet to be held at the Avalon Manor Banquet Hall in Hobart, Indiana, on Thursday, June 10, 2004. These individuals, in addition to the other Northwest Indiana Federation of Labor members who have served Northwest Indiana so diligently for such a long period of time, are a testament to the exemplary American worker: loyal, dedicated, and hardworking.  Mr. Johnathan Comer will receive the Old Warrior Award. Mr. Comer was the first African American to be elected to a major basic steel local--Youngstown Sheet & Tube, USWA 1011. He has spent many years dedicating his life to the interests of the labor community as well as his community in Northwest Indiana. The years of hard work he has put forth are a true inspiration to all.  Mr. Robert Cashman will receive the George Meany Award. Mr. Cashman has contributed graciously to the youth of our community. His dedication and devotion to the youth of our nation is a goal we should all strive to achieve.  Ms. Robin Rich is being honored with the Service to Labor Award. She has been a devoted organizer for the United States Steelworkers of America in District 7. Ms. Rich is a bold, strong, and loyal person, and is willing to fight for what she believes in. She has organized various events and programs for USWA District 7. Ms. Rich has given her time and effort selflessly to the people of Northwest Indiana and Illinois throughout her career.  Mr. Bob Anadell is being honored with the Community Service Award. Bob has spent nearly 40 years dedicating his life to the interests of Local 697 as well as his community in Northwest Indiana. His career at Loom 697 has allowed him the opportunity to touch the lives of numerous people.  Portage Mayor Doug Olson and City Council Members Elizabeth Modesto, David Fagen, David Highlands, Ed Gottschling, Richard Turnak, Mark Oprisko, and Olga Velazquez, are being honored with the Union Label Award. The exceptional service they have provided to the community deserves our admiration and respect. The dedication and commitment these elected officials have demonstrated for their community is exemplary of the values we cherish in Northwest Indiana.  David Chlebek is being honored with the 23rd Annual President's Award. David is a fine example of the tenets embodied by those who have dedicated their lives to enhancing the well being of workers throughout Northwest Indiana. He has mastered his trade and has consistently performed at the highest level throughout his hard work and self sacrifice.  Northwest Indiana has a rich history of excellence in its craftsmanship and loyalty by its tradesmen. These individuals are all outstanding examples of these qualities. They have demonstrated their loyalty to both the union and the community through their hard work and self-sacrifice.  Mr. Speaker, I ask that you and my distinguished colleagues join me in congratulating these dedicated, honorable, and outstanding citizens, in addition to all the hardworking union men and women in America. I am proud to represent such dedicated men and women in Congress. Their hard labor and resolute courage are the achievement and fulfillment of the American dream.                          ____________________
