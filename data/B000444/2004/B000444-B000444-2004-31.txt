 We do not intend this bill to stop the use of substances that are legitimately marketed as dietary supplements, or to limit access to substances that are not abused as steroids by athletes or children. With respect to DHEA, this legislation does not make it a controlled substance, and the legislation should mean that legitimate users of DHEA would continue to have access to it if it is lawfully marketed.
