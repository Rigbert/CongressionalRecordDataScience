President, today I am introducing legislation for the creation of the John H. Chafee Blackstone River Valley National Historical Park, along with my colleagues from Rhode Island and Massachusetts, Senators Whitehouse, Kerry, and Scott Brown. Our legislation seeks to preserve the industrial heritage and natural and cultural resources of the Blackstone Valley, help provide economic development opportunities for the local economies, and build upon the solid foundation of the John H. Chafee Blackstone River Valley National Heritage Corridor.  Samuel Slater built his mill in 1793 and started the American Industrial Revolution in Rhode Island along the Blackstone River. Today, the John H. Chafee Blackstone River Valley National Heritage Corridor contains an exceptional concentration of surviving mills and villages that illustrate this chapter of American history.  The Blackstone Valley is a national treasure, which also includes thousands of acres of beautiful, undeveloped land and waterways that are home to diverse wildlife.  The extensive work of the National Park Service and the tireless efforts of Federal, State--both Rhode Island and Massachusetts--and local officials, developers, and volunteers have resulted in the recovery of dozens of historic villages, riverways, and rural landscapes throughout the Corridor. These types of economic redevelopment and environmental restoration efforts reflect the ongoing story of the Blackstone River and the valley.  The Ashton Mill in Cumberland is one such example of local redevelopment. With the designation of the National Heritage Corridor, the cleanup of the Blackstone River, the creation of the Blackstone River State Park in Lincoln, Rhode Island, and the construction of the Blackstone River Bikeway, the property was restored for adaptive reuse as rental apartments. Once again the mill and its village are a vital part of the greater Blackstone Valley community.  Great progress has also been made in restoring the environmental resources of the river valley. As a result, people are once again enjoying the river, whether in kayaks or canoes, or through other means. I have been pleased over the years to help support the preservation and renewed development of the Blackstone River Valley.  In 2005, I cosponsored legislation introduced by my then-colleague Senator Lincoln Chafee to conduct a Special Resource Study of the Corridor to determine which areas within the Corridor were nationally significant and whether they were suitable to become part of the National Park Service. When it was released this July, the study recommended the creation of a new national historic park whose boundaries would encompass both Rhode Island and Massachusetts, including the Blackstone River and its tributaries; the Blackstone Canal; the historic districts of Old Slater Mill in Pawtucket; the villages of Slatersville and Ashton in Rhode Island; and the villages of Whitinsville and Hopedale in Massachusetts.  The partnership park described in the Special Resource Study clearly stated the importance of the rural and urban areas, the landscape, and the river in telling the story of the Blackstone River Valley.  It will build upon the solid foundation of the John H. Chafee Blackstone River Valley National Heritage Corridor and the workers and volunteers in all the surrounding communities, in restoring the Corridor.  Designating these areas as a national historical park has important economic, environmental, historical, and educational benefits for the region. This is a two state initiative, and truly a national initiative, that will embrace both Rhode Island and Massachusetts, and ensure the preservation of the industrial and natural heritage of the Blackstone River Valley for future generations to enjoy.  Establishing a national park will provide opportunities for work, opportunities for recreation, and opportunities to boost economic development, while memorializing the history of this place and its role in the American Industrial Revolution.  The partnerships between the federal, state, local, and private organizations have a proven track record of success with the Corridor, and I expect that the communities in Rhode Island and Massachusetts that have been engaged on this endeavor for many years will continue to partner with the National Park Service going forward.  Creating a national historic park sets a clear path to preserve our cultural heritage, improve the use and enjoyment of these resources, including offering outdoor education for young people, and increase the level of protection for our most important and nationally significant cultural and natural resources.  I have been proud to introduce this bipartisan legislation in honor of my late-colleague John H. Chafee, who years ago had a great vision, shared with many others in Rhode Island and Massachusetts, to preserve and protect the Blackstone Valley.  I look forward to working with all of my colleagues to create the John H.Chafee Blackstone River Valley National Historical Park.
