 President, I would like to make a few brief remarks on one section of the continuing resolution which includes the foreign operations conference report.  Over the past several months the Senate and House have sent the bill back and forth because of differences over the population program and abortion restrictions. After no less than nine votes on the issue we have finally produced a solution which satisfies the concerns of those of us who strongly oppose abortion with the interests of those who wish to fund AID's current population programs. It is not a perfect solution by any account, but it is the best we were able to achieve.  I am pleased we were able to negotiate a solution to the abortion concerns because I believe there are many provisions in this bill which serve important national priorities. Let me briefly review some of the key provisions and conditions of the foreign operations bill.  We have fully funded our Camp David partnership and strengthened our interests in the region by extending the Middle East Peace Facilitation Act. Once again, the Congress has made clear how high a priority we place on securing a regional peace and advancing stability. The tragic loss of Itzhak Rabin's life and leadership serves as a reminder of how quickly events may change in the region but our commitment must remain steadfast.  As we are all well aware, there have also been major changes over the past several months in Russia. President Yeltsin has fired or removed every single person who advanced our common interests in economic and political reform. While the administration continues to sing the same tune, that reform is inevitable and there is no looking back, I am deeply concerned about the implications of these developments.  For 3 years, I have pressed for a shift in both policy and resource emphasis to assure balance in our relations with the NIS. With the change in the Congress, we have now been able to change the ``Russia first'' approach insofar as this bill is concerned. This year, we have earmarked $225 million for Ukraine, a minimum of $85 million for Armenia and recommended $30 million for Georgia. We have also directed $15 million be made available to establish a Trans-Caucasus Enterprise Fund and $50 million for the Western NIS and the Central Asian Enterprise Funds to support the emerging private sectors.  Within those earmarked resources we have set aside funds for specific programs which directly serve American interests including a nuclear safety initiative in Ukraine to prevent another Chernobyl incident and resources targeting law enforcement training and exchanges.  The alarming increase in international crime emanating from Russia and other NIS republics is already having an impact here in the United States. The $12.6 million included in the conference report will allow the FBI, DEA, and other U.S. agencies to aggressively address these problems. It is my expectation that Judge Freeh will have primary responsibility for developing and coordinating a strategy for the region and, he will, in turn, work closely with his counterpart agency heads to disburse funds either through our international law enforcement center in Budapest or on a country by country, case by case basis.  The final provision regarding the NIS which I believe serves our interests links aid to Russia to termination of the nuclear deal with Iran. In the interest of maximizing the administration's leverage the condition begins 3 months after the date of enactment of this bill giving the administration ample time to negotiate a solution to this problem.  Beyond the NIS, I think it is worth pointing out that the Senate's positions on a range of issues have been included in the conference report. We linked the provision of assistance to the Korean Peninsular Energy Development Organization to concrete progress in the North-South relationship. We resolved the long standing dispute over equipment purchased by Pakistan. We included legislative language introduced by Senator Brown which I cosponsored and strongly supported outlining a specific strategy for expanding NATO. We have earmarked $2 million to support democracy and freedom of the press in Burma, one of the most repugnant and repressive regimes on Earth. And, the bill also included the terms of the Humanitarian Corridors Act which should help guarantee safe passage of crucial assistance to countries with dire needs.  Finally, I think we provide strong support for our export agencies and activities. I just received a note from Ken Brody, the recently retired Chairman of the Export-Import Bank. He pointed out that with billions of people joining the free market for the first time, ``initial market shares are being established that will set the patterns for years to come. We cannot afford to let other countries give their companies an unfair advantage.'' With the strong backing of this bill, Exim and our other trade agencies have helped U.S. companies and ``exporters compete and win the global economy and thereby create high paying American jobs.''  We have included each of these initiatives and funding levels while still affording the administration a measure of flexibility. Specifically, flexibility has been enhanced by consolidating a variety of development assistance accounts into a single flexible fund and we have provided transfer authority between accounts. For example, NIS resources can be used to fund the Warsaw Initiative and Partnership for Peace programs.  In conclusion, this bill sets a new course for our foreign assistance programs. The taxpayers should be enormously relieved to learn that we were able to reduce foreign assistance from last year's level by nearly $1.5 billion and were $2.6 billion below the administration's actual request. Even with these significant cuts, I believe the foreign operations bill effectively promotes democracy, free markets, and U.S. economic interests and protects our national security.  Mr. President, I would appreciate inserting a colloquy between Senator Brown and myself in the Record immediately following my remarks. Apparently, because of the abbreviated nature of the text of the continuing resolution, there appears to be some confusion over the meaning of the language. I hope this colloquy clarifies that the entire conference report funding levels, terms, and conditions accompanying H.R. 1868 are included in this bill and will be law when the President signs the continuing resolution.
