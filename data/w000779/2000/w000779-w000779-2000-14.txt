In effect, it would be impossible to carry out the will of Oregon voters on a matter that has historically been left to the States.  What is so striking--and I appreciate the Senator's question--is that we constantly have colleagues come to the floor and talk about the importance of States rights and the beauty of the 10th amendment. Then when they don't happen to agree with what a State is doing, I guess the 10th amendment isn't so important anymore.  I appreciate the Senator's question.
