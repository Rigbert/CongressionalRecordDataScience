Speaker, I rise in opposition to this rule, not because the rule protects a good bill, but because there is a provision in this bill that does not belong in there. It is a provision that is certainly a poster child of why the line-item veto is long overdue.  Section 351 of this legislation turns Congress into a domestic relations court, and a domestic relations court involving one very famous case in the District of Columbia involving Dr. Elizabeth Morgan and her former husband, Dr. Eric Foretich.  By protecting section 351 against the point of order, the Committee on Rules has, in effect, legislated the outcome of a child custody case when the Congress does not have any of the facts, and that is outrageous and it should not be allowed to stand without someone standing up here to object to it.  Let us look at the facts. Drs. Foretich and Morgan were involved in a very messy divorce case. That is not unusual. There are a lot of messy divorce cases that come up in the courts around our country. The divorce was granted.  Dr. Morgan was given custody of her daughter. Dr. Foretich was given visitation rights. Dr. Morgan objected to the visitation rights and went to court, alleging that Dr. Foretich was involved in child molestation. The court did not sustain Dr. Morgan's assertions and continued Dr. Foretich's right to visit. Dr. Morgan then hid the child and prevented visitation, and was jailed for civil contempt.  The gentleman from Virginia [Mr. Wolf] who has put the present provision in the bill, came to Congress, the 101st Congress, and asked us to pass a private bill for the relief of Dr. Morgan, to let her out of jail. When he testified before the subcommittee in the earlier bill, he said, ``The legislation written with input from academic and legal communities took great care to protect the ability of the court to enforce its rulings. While the jury trial provision in my legislation protects the individual from indefinite incarceration, the court can pursue additional remedies. Individuals cannot simply wait out the year-long period and expect to walk away from their obligation to obey the court.''  Under Public Law 101-97, Dr. Elizabeth Morgan technically could still be charged with criminal contempt of court and brought before a jury. The gentleman from Virginia, Mr. Wolf, said that some years ago. The legislation which he has introduced in this appropriation bill, without consideration by a subcommittee in either House, without a vote in either House, negates that provision.  Second, this is a direct assault on the independence of the judiciary, and is bad public policy. Dr. Morgan has access to a judicial body. If she thinks the judicial body has erred, she can either appeal, or if she thinks that the judge is biased, there are provisions in the D.C. civil procedure court to get a new judge. Instead, she has come to Congress to legislate the outcome.  Finally, Dr. Morgan and her daughter are in New Zealand. The New Zealandcourts have ruled that it is not in the best interests of the child to be brought back to the United States. The New Zealand court has possession of the child's passport. If this legislation is passed, our country will be in violation of the Hague Convention relative to child custody, and if the child is brought back to the United States without valid papers, both New Zealand and American law will be violated. Let us prevent this by voting down this rule.  Mr. Speaker, I include for the Record an op-ed piece by Paul Kolker in today's Washington Post.  The material referred to is as follows:               [From the Washington Post, Sept. 18, 1996]                 Congress as a Domestic-Relations Court                          (By Peter R. Kolker)       The legislative branch of the federal government is about      to become embroiled in a childcustody dispute. Congress would      take one case out of the hands of the judiciary and decide it      for itself. This unprecedented move has only two problems: It      is bad public policy, and it is clearly unconstitutional.       As reported in The Post's Sept. 13 news story, this      imminent legislation--a replay of previous efforts by Rep.      Frank Wolf(R-Va)--would strip the District's court system of      jurisdiction in the bitterly fought dispute between Elizabeth      Morgan and Eric Foretich over the custody of 13-year-old      Hillary Foretich, (now Ellen Morgan), and it would prevent      the D.C. Superior Court from exercising its authority      throughout Ellen's minority. Similarly, it would also prevent      her father from seeking visitation through the courts, as is      the right of every parent.       The Morgans have been in New Zealand since 1990 but now      want to return home--but like all other citizens, they would      be subject to the courts upon arrival. Morgan has asked      Congress to remove her case from the courts and deal with it      on the Hill. This would make her the only American parent      whose child-custody case was put beyond judicial reach. It      would not be the first time Congress did so for her.       When Morgan refused to comply with a D.C. Superior Court      order in the custody battle, she was held in contempt of      court, and--in a standoff with the trial judge--she spent      more than two years locked up at the D.C. Jail. But with      well-connected friends, she secured the backing of Wolf, who      engineered special legislation to trump the court's ace and      thereby gain her freedom. No one else was affected by that      legislation. Once out of jail, she headed for New Zealand,      where the courts were more accommodating to her. Now, she      wishes to return home, but she needs something even more      extraordinary to keep the courts from treating her like      others, and she has enlisted the aid of Rep. Wolf again to      further her exemption from the process of the law.       But this time, bill would affect someone else--Eric      Foretich--by effectively stripping him of his parental rights      and denying him access to the Superior Court, which is      allowed to everyone else whose child resides in the District.       The Framers of the Constitution thought something like this      could happen. And they prohibited it. The Constitution      forbids ``Bills of Attainder''--laws punishing a specific      person or a very narrow class of individuals, constructed      to deprive them of the due-process protections available      to others.       Not that this subject wasn't raised when Wolf's      subcommittee first took up the legislation. George Washington      law professor Jonathan Turley appeared at a hearing a year      ago and explained to the subcommittee the three hallmarks of      the prohibited Bill of Attainder: specificity, punishment and      elimination of judicial due process. Turley pointed to the      introduction to that early bill, which proudly states that it      applies only to the Morgan/Foretich case. Elimination of the      father's visitation rights certainly is a punishment (whether      deserved or not is another question), and it does so without      the protections found in court. Presto! A Bill of Attainder.      So why has minimal-government proponent Wolf persisted?       The dramatic Morgan battle has had much media coverage, and      one can feel passionately about the story. Who knows the      truth of this case: whether or not Ellen, when a very young      child, was sexually abused by her father, as Morgan alleged      and Foretich denied? If he did, then serious restrictions on      visitation, perhaps even prohibitions, are in order.       But what if he didn't? In our legal system, figuring out      what happened in a private dispute is for the courthouse, not      the Capitol. Our Constitution separates the judicial from the      legislative functions for good reason. A political forum is      hardly the place to take the testimony of witnesses in a      custody case, or to find facts or to fashion custody orders.       Just consider how this remedy was crafted: as a last-minute      add-on to a transportation appropriations bill having nothing      to do with child custody. If Congress becomes the court of      appeals for the Morgan case, will the federal legislature and      Wolf be available to every District litigant who feels      wronged by the trial court? Or do only the well-connected get      to have their cases adjudicated on Capitol Hill?       The judicial process was, and continues to be, fully      available to Ellen and both her parents. Whatever the      decision may have been years ago, the trial judge is bound to      consider the changed circumstances of the intervening years.      Ellen, now a teenager, certainly can articulate her views to      the judge, who undoubtedly would pay close attention. If      there were reason to think the original judge was biased, a      mechanism exists to replace him.
