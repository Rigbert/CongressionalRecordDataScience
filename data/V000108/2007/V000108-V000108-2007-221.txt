and Mrs. Bill and Sue Landske of Cedar Lake, Indiana. For years, Bill and Sue have been fully committed to the citizens they serve, with Bill serving on the Cedar Lake Town Council and Sue serving as a State Senator for over 23 years. At this time, I would like to take this opportunity to thank them for their lifelong service and also congratulate them on their 50 years of devotion to each other.  Sue's service to her community extends far beyond her elected position. A veteran of the National Guard Reserve, Sue was elected to the Indiana State Senate in 1984. Senator Landske has remained fully committed to her constituents, and she has even remained an active member of several community organizations. For her efforts, Sue has received many accolades, including the prestigious Sagamore of the Wabash in 1980 and 1983. She has also been named Outstanding Republican Senator, Business and Professional Woman of the Year, Lake County Republican of the Year, and Jaycees' Citizen of the Year.  Not to be outdone, Bill Landske has been a constant fixture in his community for many years. In recent years, Bill has extended his service to the people of Cedar Lake as an elected official, where he has taken on the role of Cedar Lake Town Council member. His resolve to improve the quality of life for his constituents has been apparent since he took office, and he has served his constituents with complete dedication and professionalism.  Bill and Sue have shared many wonderful years together. They have epitomized true devotion and unwavering commitment. However, while they have remained fully dedicated to the people they serve, Bill and Sue's greatest source of pride is their family, which includes four daughters, Cathy (Don) Jones, Jackie (Jeffrey) Basilotta, Pam (Charles) Snyder, and Cheryl (Pete) Boisson, and one son, Eric. Bill and Sue have also been blessed with eight grandchildren: Matthew Jones; Leslie Stoops; Jeff Basilotta; Caitlin, Jenny, and Kim Snyder; and Patrick and Daniel Boisson. Bill and Sue's commitment to improving the future for their community and all of Northwest Indiana is surely an extension of their commitment to their grandchildren, whom they truly adore.  Madam Speaker, at this time, I ask that you and my other distinguished colleagues join me in congratulating Councilman Bill Landske and State Senator Sue Landske as they celebrate a remarkable milestone, their 50th wedding anniversary. While their years of service to the citizens of Northwest Indiana are to be commended, it is their unselfish and lifelong devotion to each other that is worthy of our deepest admiration.                          ____________________
