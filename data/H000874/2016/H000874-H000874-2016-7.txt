Speaker, one of the things that we are certainly very hopeful of--your office and my office were having a lot of discussions about that, as are Leader Pelosi and Speaker Ryan having a lot of discussions--is the WRRDA bill. This deals very critically with the Flint crisis that has been ongoing now for 2-plus years. I am very concerned, although we apparently have an agreement on the dollar figure, can the gentleman tell me whether that dollar figure will, in fact, be appropriated within the structure of the WRRDA bill?  I yield to the gentleman from California.  Mr. McCARTHY. Mr. Speaker, I do want to thank the gentleman from Maryland for his work with his staff on this issue of the Flint crisis when we were dealing with WRRDA and the continuing resolution just short months ago.  The Speaker and Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi are continuing to talk. It is our intention that it gets solved inside WRRDA, and we are hopeful that we can close out on that even today. As soon as it is finished, it will be posted as well.
