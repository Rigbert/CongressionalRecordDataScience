Chairman, I yield myself the balance of the time.  Mr. Chairman, there are three reasons why this amendment should be rejected. First of all, it flies in the face of the fact that there have been more section 5 objections lodged by the Justice Department since the last reauthorization than during the first 17 years of operation of the Voting Rights Act.  Since 1982, over 700 objections have been lodged. That means we still needthis law, and we need the law on the books for a long time.  Second, adopting this amendment will effectively prohibit Congress from ever reauthorizing the Voting Rights Act again, because it will deny us, the Congress of the United States, a sufficiently large set of data the Supreme Court has held necessary for the VRA to be authorized.  What the gentleman from Texas's amendment does is, it gives Congress 16 years less data in the future by shortening the reauthorization period from 25 years to 9 years.  Finally, the amendment, if adopted, would completely nullify the current incentive the Voting Rights Act provides to encourage covered jurisdictions to have clean voting records for 10 years in order to get out through the bail-out provisions. This is only a 9-year extension. The way I was taught math, 9 is less than 10.  So there is no incentive whatsoever for a covered jurisdiction to clean up its act to be able to bail out, because the act will expire before they can have the 10 years to do it. Vote against the amendment. It is a bad one  Mr. Chairman, I yield back the balance of my time.                              {time}  1500  The Acting CHAIRMAN. The question is on the amendment offered by the gentleman from Texas (Mr. Gohmert).  The question was taken; and the Acting Chairman announced that the ayes appeared to have it.
