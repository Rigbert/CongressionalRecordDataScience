President, earlier this morning, the Judiciary Committee held a hearing on the consolidation of the energy industry. Regretfully, due to a scheduling conflict, I was unable to attend the hearing which was noticed only 1 week ago. I come to the floor this afternoon because this is an issue that needs to be addressed, not only by me, or the Committee, but by this entire body. The exorbitant cost of fuel is one of the most critical issues facing our nation.  Strong leadership by this Congress is needed to help all of the Americans whose pockets are being emptied by the skyrocketing costs of fuel. Consumers, small businesses, farmers, families trying to heat their homes in the cold winter months, senior citizens on limited incomes, every community in this country has felt the pinch of trying to keep up with energy costs. Everyone has suffered--or rather, almost everyone.  The day before yesterday, the big oil companies posted their year-end profit reports for 2005. The five biggest--ExxonMobil, ChevronTexaco, ConocoPhillips, BP, and Shell--trumpet raking in record profits for the year. In fact, ExxonMobil, with $36.7 billion in profit last year, turned the highest yearly profit in U.S. history for any business.  We did not hear from these companies today because they have declined to appear at this hearing. I am disappointed by their decision. Boycotting this hearing will not stifle our questions or the need for their accountability to Congress and American consumers. The chairman has announced a second hearing for the end of this month, and the executives from the oil companies will attend, whether voluntarily or in answer to subpoenas. We will not rest in our effort to understand, and then correct, the problems in the energy markets.  On its face, the deplorable issue here is not the unprecedented profits garnered last year. Surely, any business the size of these corporations could produce a high yield selling their product at $60 a barrel. Rather, the striking issue here is how these profits compare with years past. For example, since 1999, oil refiners have seen a 334 percent increase in yield made on each gallon of gasoline refined. Moreover, these same companies have more than doubled their control over oil production.  Time and time again, oil companies have defended startling statistics such as these. They claim that increased costs for production, exploration, and meeting environmental standards justify increasing prices at the pumps. This is obscene. I say it is time to invest in the American people. We need to investigate excessive market concentration in the oil industry that is stifling competition, constricting supply, and ultimately harming consumers. And then we need to do something about it.  I was glad to hear the President sounding like a Democrat on energy last night in his State of the Union speech. I can only hope that his words mean that he has finally abandoned the failed policy of the Cheney energy task force that had worked in secret with Ken Lay and other energy industry bigwigs. Had we adopted the Democratic energy proposal on which Senator Bingaman and others have worked so hard over the last several years, we would be much farther along. Nonetheless, we welcome the President and, I hope, some congressional Republicans to the Democratic emphasis on alternative and renewable fuels. After all that the Bush administration and the Republican leadership have done to advance the interests of the oil companies, including the attempts by House Republican leadership to insert special interest provisions in conference reports to give oil companies immunity for the environmental and health damage they cause, this reversal of position would be a good development for the American people.  Along with conservation, renewable energy is a key to a cleaner, more efficient energy future. If the President would work with us and follow through with sensible proposals, we can forge a bipartisan partnership. Working together, we can do better to make this a safer more energy efficient and more prosperous country. I along with the rest of America will be watching to see if these statements are reflected in the President's policies and budget request, however.  We need to relieve America's dependence on foreign oil. Although the Mideast is not the source of the majority of our energy, its share has grown during this administration. I also urge the President and the Republican leadership of Congress to work with us to relieve our dependence on foreign investors and on borrowing from Social Security to finance the record deficits and growing debt that their policies have created.                          ____________________[Pages S439-S440]From the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]   CONSOLIDATION IN THE ENERGY INDUSTRY: RAISING PRICES AT THE PUMP?
