 President, on behalf of Senator Mikulski, the first amendment she has offered is a very important one.  We all know pay discrimination in the workplace is very real. We know women are nearly half of our workforce, but they still only earn about 77 percent of what men earn, and women of color are much worse off. African-American women make 70 cents on the dollar. Hispanic women make only 60 cents on the dollar. We want to make sure all of our families are strong and stable in the future, and pay discrimination is something that is holding women and families and communities back.  So a ``no'' vote on this means you are actually OK with women earning less pay than men--women not being able to contribute to their families in a strong way so their children can be taken care of and they can pay their mortgage or their rent and put food on the table.  A ``yes'' vote on this amendment means you acknowledge this as a problem and agree that women must receive equal pay for equal work.  I want to thank the Senator from Maryland for her long-time advocacy on behalf of women in many ways, but particularly on making sure they have equal pay.
