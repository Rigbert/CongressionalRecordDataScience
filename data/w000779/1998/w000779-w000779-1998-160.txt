President, we now have a seemingly permanent political campaign in America. We have an election the first Tuesday in November, people sleep in on Wednesday, and it starts all over again on Thursday. The money chase simply does not stop. I came to the Senate after a hard-fought and, frankly, less than pleasant campaign against an individual I am proud to call both a friend and a colleague, Senator Gordon Smith. In the final weeks of that campaign, we made a decision to unilaterally take off the air all television commercials about Senator Smith. I thought it was time to talk about issues, time to focus, with the voters, on the real questions that were important to their future.  I am of the view that the American people need to know that today is the day when reform will be passed or defeated. The cloture vote on McCain-Feingold is the vote on campaign finance reform. It is the vote for a Senator who wants to address this problem of independent expenditures. It is the vote on the proposition that we need to have more time spent with voters, less time with raising money.  Mr. President, I urge passage of the bill. I thank the Senator from Kentucky for the additional time.                          ____________________
