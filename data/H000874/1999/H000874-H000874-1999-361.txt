Speaker, I rise today to acknowledge the retirement of Francis B. Francois; Executive Director of the American Association of State Highway and Transportation Officials (AASHTO).  Mr. Francois will retire in February after 19 years with AASHTO. In addition, during his tenure he also served on the Executive Committee of the Transportation Research Board.  Francis Francois was born and raised on an Iowa farm and earned an engineering degree at Iowa State University and then went on to earn a law degree at the George Washington University. A registered patent attorney, Mr. Francois resides in Bowie, MD with his wife Eileen where they have raised five children.  Known as a skilled parliamentarian, Mr. Francois served 18 years as an elected official in Prince George's County including nine as a County Councilman. While serving the County, Mr. Francois was a member of many boards and associations including the National Association of Counties and the Board of Directors of the Metropolitan Washington Area Transit Authority. Having the vision for a regional approach to solving problems, he earned the reputation of being ``Mr. Goodwrench'' and ``Mr. Fixit.''  Mr. Speaker, Mr. Francois is a person dedicated to solving problems, serving people and setting plans in motion. In 1973, Mr. Francois was named ``Washingtonian of the Year'' by the Washingtonian magazine. He is also well published on such topics as the important role of counties in state government, urban water resources and the responsibility of regional decisionmaking.  Mr. Francois will be missed by AASHTO as well as the people of Prince George's County. Mr. Francois has the vision of an all-purpose reformer. I know my colleagues will join with me in congratulating Francis Francois and his family on his retirement and wishing them all the best as Mr. Francois enters what we all hope will be his most exciting adventures to date.                          ____________________
