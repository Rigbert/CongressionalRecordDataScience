Madam Speaker, I made a statement on the House floor as part of my participation in the debate on the War on Terror and House Concurrent Resolution 63. In that statement, I repeated a quote I had read as part of an article from the Washington Times, that I believed at the time was attributed to Abraham Lincoln, because it was cited as such. I have since learned that it was not true Abraham Lincoln quote, and even though the Times never corrected the mistake, I retract my attribution. I do stand by the sentiment however, which is that in wartime, Americans, especially America's elected leaders, should not take actions that damage the morale of our soldiers and military--and that is exactly what the non-binding resolution does. I could never in good conscience support H. Con. Res. 63. Instead, I choose to support our men and women in the military.                          ____________________
