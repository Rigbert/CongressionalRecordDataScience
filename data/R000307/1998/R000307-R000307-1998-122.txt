President, I rise today to join my colleagues to discuss the issue of national security and the vital security interests to the United States and Europe, and obviously I am talking about the proposed expansion of NATO. To borrow a very well-known phrase, now we are engaged in a great debate, or at least a very good discussion, to determine and to test whether that alliance or any alliance so conceived and so successful in the past can meet the challenges of today.  We are in the amendment process, but I do want to offer some general comments and some concerns.  But for NATO and the collective security of Europe and the United States, the time has come. I must say that from the time of news accounts on old newsreels, or what we in my age can recall as the Movietone News or to CNN today, it has been quite a show for NATO. But it is time to turn off the movie projector, sweep up the popcorn, and turn out the lights. The old NATO show is over. Just as in that great 1971 movie, ``The Last Picture Show,'' when the camera pans back from the now-closed movie theater and pictures a deserted small, dusty town in Texas and tumbleweeds blowing down the street, we are not sure what the future holds but we know it will be different from the past.  We now face the uncertainty of NATO either enlarged or with the same 16 members. We don't know what it will be in the future, but we are certain it will be different than in the past and, quite frankly, peace and stability in Europe and throughout the world hang in the balance.  The debate on the addition of three new members will soon be over and the time for the vote will rapidly approach, perhaps as of this week.  The administration assures us that to fundamentally alter the most successful alliance in our history is a good thing. They tell us that we will be more secure with an expanded alliance, that the wrongs of Yalta will be corrected, the candidate countries will now be free to fully develop as democratic and market-driven societies. We are guaranteed that no new dividing lines between the West and the East will result from this or any kind of future enlargement, that the door is open to all, and that further rounds of enlargement are a certainty. The administration also predicts that although the Russians are upset, and they are, with the enlargement of NATO they will simply ``get over it'' and come to understand we have their best interests in mind with enlargement and Russia will also be more secure.  Now, we get all this for the amazing value of about $1.5 billion over the next 10 years. We are reassured that although the cost estimates have varied from $125 billion to $1.5 billion over the next 10 years, NATO's sharp-penciled budgeteers certainly have it right. Much to our relief, the burdensharing problems between our NATO allies that have plagued the alliance in the past will not be a problem now or in the future of an enlarged NATO, so the argument goes. The administration is confident the United States will not have to pick up any unexpected costs, although the allies have said they will refuse to pay one additional mark or franc for enlargement.  Now, I have spent considerable time looking into each of these controversial areas surrounding the enlargement of NATO, and one of the most amazing things about this debate is that in each concern for enlargement, the basis of the arguments, both pro and con, are fundamentally the same but the conclusions are the opposite.  Let me take a few minutes to lay out the pros and cons of NATO enlargement, if I might. First is the issue of cost and also burdensharing. Unfortunately, only time will truly show what the costs for NATO enlargement will be. With such a wide variance in the estimates, there clearly is not a single set of assumptions to gauge the true costs of enlargement. I do not know how we could. I can tell you the final costs will not be $1.5 billion over a 10-year period, but I cannot tell you what the costs will be, and I do not think anybody else can.  The opponents of enlargement say the $1.5 billion number is laughable, and the opponents breathe a sigh of relief that the agreed-to number is so low that no one could suggest we cannot afford the costs of enlargement. We are told the reasons for $1.5 billion being the correct cost include the fact only three countries are being invited as opposed to four or five, and the military infrastructure in the candidate countries is in much better shape than originally thought.  I am a little surprised at the infrastructure point. NATO has been involved in Partnership for Peace exercises and military-to-military contacts with those countries for more than a few years. We have a huge facility at Taszar in Hungary at a former Soviet air base. Didn't anyone in NATO or the United States notice the condition of the infrastructure during any of the exercises, and particularly in the three candidate countries?  Finally, another reason the cost has been reduced is that NATO has shifted some of what some thought to be shared costs to the three candidate countries.  I am concerned, regardless of the public statements by these countries, that they will not be able to fund NATO enlargement or, if they do, they will divert needed resources away from more important domestic issues and into military spending. If they are unable to meet their fiscal obligations for enlargement, will the costs be deferred or will NATO simply pick them up?  I might point out in terms of paying the contribution to NATO there are three accounts. The NATO Security Investment Program, formerly called the NATO Infrastructure Program, comes from the annual military construction appropriation. We do not have the money in that account to pay for this. The NATO civil budget money comes from the annual State Department appropriation ``Contributions to International Organizations,'' and that money is tight. The NATO military budget comes from the Department of Army annual appropriation, and that budget, too, is under very severe pressure.  Let's take up one other subject, if I might, Mr. President. What about the correction of the wrongs of Yalta? The candidate countries are proud, developing democracies and countries wanting very badly to become a part of the West. They have already made some great strides. We all understand they suffered terribly during the many years of Soviet domination. I applaud their efforts. I am confident they would be wonderful allies, capable at some point of carrying out their NATO responsibilities. I have been to Prague. I have been to Budapest. I have listened to the history. I have felt the pride of their accomplishments. A freedom-loving person cannot experience the strength of their conviction without reaching out to help them attain their stated goals of Western integration. But understanding and empathizing with their feelings and their desires are not reasons for the Senate to ratify a change in NATO membership.  The only reason to enlarge NATO is if it is in our vital national interest to simply do so. Proponents of enlargement do not see it that way. For example, General Shalikashvili in a recent Los Angeles Times article said, ``Meanwhile, there are urgencies to expanding NATO. It is nearly 10 years since the fall of the Berlin Wall, and the countries of Eastern Europe--including my native land, Poland--have waited long enough for a place at the table where they have yearned to be for so long.''  That is a common theme for the enlargement proponents, including theSecretary of State. They have the right to join NATO, and that is good enough to alter the alliance. Others argue that enlarging NATO will show the continued interest and commitment of the United States in a stable and secure Europe. As a matter of fact, I think the distinguished Presiding Officer has made that very cogent argument.  It is still not clear why NATO must enlarge to demonstrate, however, in this Senator's opinion, U.S. resolve or commitment to Europe. There is no question in my mind a secure and stable Europe is in our vital interest, but I fail to see the connection between an enlarged NATO and that end goal.  It is interesting to note that Austria, a Central European country, is not seeking NATO membership. There is no cry of a security vacuum in Austria or a concern for the right to join the primer alliance, which is NATO. In fact, Austria took a good look at NATO and decided it was more important to seek its long-term security within the European Union and the Partnership for Peace and the Organization for Security for Cooperation in Europe, OSCE. This would have been the best approach, in this Senator's view, for security and acceptance into the West for the current candidate nations rather than immediate NATO membership. Unfortunately, that is not now an option. We have come too far. The administration has planted the flag of U.S. commitment and integrity--no small matter.  Let me share with you the results of a survey published in June of 1996 in an issue of The Economist. I am sure some will challenge these results, but I think it is worth reviewing these questions asked of citizens of the three candidate countries.  Would these countries support sending troops to defend another country? Only 26 percent of the people of Hungary, 43 percent of those polled in the Czech Republic, and 55 percent in Poland support sending troops to defend another country. Now, considering this is the best that the support will ever be, since the excitement of joining NATO will soon wear off, I suggest this is not a very good commentary on the weak support to carry out a core requirement of NATO. And that core requirement is the common defense and the commitment to send troops to defend an ally.  Let me ask another question: Would these countries support having NATO troops based on their soil? In The Economist, they reported that only 30 percent of the Czechs and 35 percent of the Hungarians support the notion of allowing NATO troops to be stationed on their soil. Although 56 percent of the people of Poland, obviously, supported the idea, it is still an idea that does not have broad support in any of the three of the candidate countries.  The next question: Would these countries support regular NATO exercises in their country, or regular flights over their country? Less than half of any of the candidate countries supported having NATO exercises on their soil or even allowing flights over their country, and those percentages range from 26 percent to 41 percent, representing, again, little support for the cost of simply joining the alliance.  Would these countries support spending a bigger share of their country's budget on military and social needs? The numbers in support for this question are very low, and it is a crucial question. In the Czech Republic, 8 percent; in Hungary, 9 percent; and 23 percent in Poland support spending a bigger share on defense. Unfortunately, there will be these costs associated with their membership in NATO. I know the agriculture problems they are having in those countries. A great deal of those expenses will have to be committed to the transformation from a collective farm system to a system more in keeping with the rest of Europe.  My only point in presenting these statistics is to show there are concerns in the candidate countries about the commitment to NATO. I am afraid the survey says NATO may no longer be a ``one for all, all for one,'' but rather it may become an ``all for me, but not for you'' alliance.  Let me say, in April of this past year the Roper Starch World Wide poll asked Americans the level of support for using armed forces in certain situations. I hope--and I do not believe that the American public has become so isolationist that they would never risk any American life in defense of freedom. But there is a clearly understandable concern about risking American lives in what some call a political war of gradualism where there is no clear and discernible vital national interest.  Listen to this. If the U.S. were attacked, 84 percent of those polled supported using force. This is in the Roper Starch World Wide poll. I would like to know where the other 16 percent are.  If our forces stationed overseas were attacked, 50 percent supported armed intervention. To safeguard peacekeeping within the framework of the United Nations, the support dropped to 35 percent, which explains a great deal in regards to what happened in the gulf. Finally, to stop invasion of one country by another, the support fell sharply to 15 percent. That is why it took George Bush and Jim Baker and Dick Cheney and others a whole year to rally support among our allies in regards to the gulf war.  One issue we should all be concerned about is the collective security commitment that NATO makes in the post-cold-war environment, and that commitment is contained in article V of the NATO charter. During the cold war, obviously, everybody understood that if the Soviet Union and the Warsaw Pact countries attacked Western Europe, the very survival of the free world was at stake and every NATO member would strike back with all of their military capability. But is that still true today with no threat to the survival of Europe? Would all NATO members automatically strike back if another member was attacked tomorrow?  Article V can be read either way, and in fact the proponents and opponents argue both ways. There is a considerable amount of disagreement on this topic. I believe that if a member of NATO had a vital national interest at risk in the country under attack, they would respond with military force. If there was no threat to their vital interests, I doubt they would automatically respond with the same kind of military force. They would respond with outrage. They might threaten military force if the belligerents did not stop. But I am not sure if they would respond militarily. I am confident, however, that the candidate countries think NATO would respond to an attack on them, just as they would have during the cold war--that is, with all of their military strength.  The construction of article V is such that both interpretations are possible. Some argue--and I believe they have a point--that this ambiguity is good and may be just the right amount of deterrence in the minds of would-be belligerents. This is a serious issue, since it is at the very heart of the commitment and success of NATO during the cold war. We need to fully understand what article V means in today's environment. We just had an amendment on the floor of the Senate to try to spell that out.  The confusion over article V is only one mission concern. There is a more fundamental concern: What is the mission of NATO in the post-cold-war? The distinguished ranking member of the Foreign Relations Committee, Senator Biden, and the distinguished Senator from Oregon who was just the Presiding Officer, the distinguished Senator from Virginia, the Senator from Arizona, had a lengthy debate over this and considered the Kyl amendment. Let me share part of former Secretary of Defense Perry's testimony before the Armed Services Committee.       The original mission of NATO--deterring an attack from the      Soviet Union--is obviously no longer relevant. The original      geographical area of NATO's responsibility is no longer      sufficient. The original military structure of NATO is no      longer appropriate. And the way in which NATO relates to      Russia must be entirely different from the way it related to      the Soviet Union.  One would think, with that array of differences, and before the alliance was changed forever, that some agreed-to long-range strategy would have been developed. Unfortunately, this is not the case. Listening to the discussion on the Senate floor by my colleagues, I believe there are many possibilities for future missions of NATO. Some say the Kyl amendment opened the door to more possible missions, and the Senator from Arizona firmly says that he wants to go back to the original 1991 strategic concept.  Can anyone in the Senate say with certainty what NATO's mission is? Cananyone articulate what mission, what role, against what threat we are rushing toward enlargement of NATO, to fundamentally alter this great alliance?  Let me say that simply to bring NATO expansion into focus, the President, it seems to me, should become engaged. In Warsaw, St. Petersburg, and in Bucharest, the President did address general European security concerns. But to my way of thinking, despite all of the hard work by the Secretary of State and others, he has not made a personal case to the Congress or the American people.  As a matter of fact, in remarks during the European trip, the President said, in a post-Soviet era--I am paraphrasing here--military matters are no longer primary, that terrorism, illegal drugs, national extremism, regional conflicts due to ethnic, racial, and religious hatreds do matter. I can assure you, using an expanded NATO to address these concerns raises some very important questions.  What means would be used? Warplanes, ground forces, and naval power are of little use in fighting ethnic hatred and racism. If NATO membership reduces the threats of ethnic rivalries, somebody should tell that to the Protestants and Catholics in Northern Ireland, the Basques in Spain, and the Kurds in Turkey.  Do we really want to change the most successful security alliance in history to a European United Nations? With 16 NATO members and 28 other nations inaugurating the Euro-Atlantic Partnership Council, it seems to me the protocol, rituals, and welcoming speeches will leave no time for any serious discussion. Exactly what force requirements are necessary to prevent a power vacuum? What is the strategy to ensure stability and security in Europe?  NATO's leadership understands there is some confusion in this regard and, as I have indicated, has directed a review of its 1991 Strategic Concept to see if it is in line with the changed world and threats--and we had a good debate on the Senate floor just earlier on this very matter.  Now the Secretary of State wants to ``spread NATO's security from the Middle East through Central Africa,'' but several of the current alliance members remain unconvinced of the utility of these so-called out-of-area operations for NATO. Again, let's quote from Dr. Perry's written statement to the Senate Armed Services Committee.       The geographical area of NATO interests should be anywhere      in the world where aggression can threaten the security of      NATO members. . . .  Let me repeat that:       The geographical area of NATO interests should be anywhere      in the world where aggression can threaten the security of      NATO members--certainly including all of Europe, and      certainly including the Persian Gulf.  That is a quote. Just think of that, even with the current membership and the world's global economy, what corner of this universe could not hold interest for NATO members? Are we considering NATO as a global alliance? If we are, are we to consider global membership for NATO? Is this alliance to become the military arm of the United Nations? We should be seriously concerned that we are changing NATO before we are certain of its future mission requirements.  Now, the last but most frequently debated point associated with NATO enlargement is the impact on United States-Russian relations. Here both sides of the argument can list exactly the same points but come up with opposite results. It is a paradox of enormous irony.  Unfortunately, this is the one area that will have the most profound effect on our country in the coming decades. We must be certain of what we are doing.  The proponents argue that Russia understands that NATO is no threat to them. Opponents point out that some 350 Members of the Duma, some of which we have met with in the Senate Armed Services Committee, have formed an anti-NATO group. Let me inform the President there is not one--one--Member of the Duma that is pro-NATO publicly. The proponents say the Russians will get over it--in time. Opponents state enlargement will sour our relations with the moderate Russians. The proponents vigorously point out that in dealing with the Russians, we can't be seen as simply giving in to the ``hard-liners.'' Opponents say if we enlarge NATO, we will play into the hands of the ``hard-liners.''  Let me say, I think I know at least in part what some of the blood pressure and the motives are in regard to expanding NATO and Russia. And I quote an article from the Washington Post from Charles Krauthammer, who I think is an outstanding columnist most of the time due to the fact that he agrees with my prejudice. Obviously, I think he is a very learned columnist, but on this he tells the truth. He says here that:       . . .NATO expansion nothing more than extending the borders      of peace; building new bridges; strengthening an alliance      directed against no one in particular, certainly ``not      arrayed against Russia. . . .  Then he tells the truth.       This is all nice and good. It is, however, rubbish. In      order not to offend the bear, the administration must      understandably pretend that NATO expansion has nothing to do      with Russia. Those not constrained by diplomatic niceties,      however, can say the obvious: NATO, an alliance founded in      that immortal formulation ``to keep America in, Germany down,      and Russia out,'' is expanding in the service of its historic      and continuing mission. . . .  And that is to contain Russia. We are poking the Russian bear.  So it goes with a host of NATO enlargement topics dealing with Russia-and-United States relations. Keeping or encouraging Russia moving toward a complete system of democratic reforms, I submit, Mr. President, is in our vital national interest and, from a timing perspective, it is more important than the addition of these three candidate countries.  These are the key issues surrounding the debate on NATO enlargement: cost, mission and strategy, and United States-Russia relations. Unfortunately, there are still many unanswered questions remaining on these vital areas. I trust the Senate, with the various amendments we will be considering and the very good debate that we have had, will answer these concerns. The show is over, and we must address this enlargement of NATO on the floor now with the facts we have before us.  I ask unanimous consent to have printed in the Record, in closing, Mr. President, an article by John Lewis Gaddis, who is a professor of history at Yale University. The information was provided to me by the granddaughter of Dwight David Eisenhower. Susan Eisenhower has played a very important role in this debate.  There being no objection, the article was ordered to be printed in the Record, as follows:          [From the New York Times on the Web, Apr. 27, 1998]                 The Senate Should Halt NATO Expansion                         (By John Lewis Gaddis)       New Haven--The decision to expand NATO to include Poland,      Hungary and the Czech Republic has produced some strange      political alignments. There aren't many causes that Bill      Clinton and Jesse Helms can both support, or that Phyllis      Schlafly and the editors of The Nation can join in opposing.       Even stranger, to a historian, is the consensus that seems      to be shaping up within our community. Historians normally      don't agree on much, whether it is about the origins of the      Peloponnesian War or the end of the cold war. And yet I've      had difficulty finding any colleagues who think NATO      expansion is a good idea. Indeed, I can recall no other      moment when there was less support in our profession for a      government policy.       A striking gap has opened, therefore, between those who      make grand strategy and those who reflect on it. On this      issue, at least, official and accumulated wisdom are pointing      in very different directions.       This has happened, I think, because the Clinton      Administration has failed to answer a few simple questions:       Why exclude the Russians? One of the few propositions on      which historians tend to agree is that peace settlements work      best when they include rather than exclude former      adversaries. Within three years after the defeat of Napoleon      in 1815, the victors had brought France back within the      concert of Europe. Within six years of their surrender in      1945, Germany and Japan were firmly within American-designed      security alliances. Both settlements survived for decades.      The post-World War I settlement, however, excluded Germany.      The lessons of history on this point seem obvious.       Who, then, will we include? The Administration has made it      clear that expansion will not stop with Poland, Hungary and      the Czech Republic. It has mentioned the Baltics and Romania      as possible future members. The State Department's Web site      claims support for NATO expansion from groups like the      Belorussian Congress Committee of America, the Ukrainian      National Association and the Armenian Assembly of America.       The State Department assures us, though, that the Russians      view this process with equanimity and that we can expect      relations with Moscow to proceed normally while we sort out      just who the new members of NATO will be. Perhaps it will      next try to tell us that pigs can fly.       What will expansion cost? The Administration's estimate for      including Poland, Hungary and the Cezch Republic comes to      only $1.5 billion over the next 10 years, of which the United      States would pay $400 million. That sounds like a bargain,      but the estimate assumes no change in the current security      environment. Has it occurred to the Administration that the      act of expanding NATO, especially if former Soviet states are      included, could itself alter the current security      environment? It doesn't take a rocket scientist--or even a      historian--to figure out that actions have consequences.       What's the objective? Alliances are means to ends, not ends      in themselves. NATO served brilliantly as a means of      containing the Soviet Union, but the Administration has      specified no comparably clear goal that would justify      expanding the alliance now that the cold war is over. It      speaks vaguely of the need for democratization and      stabilization, but if these objectives inform its policy,      shouldn't they apply throughout Eastern Europe and in Russia      as well?       I heard a very different explanation from influential      government and academic figures when I visited one of the      proposed new member countries last month. NATO expansion,      they boasted, will demonstrate once and for all that the      Russians never have been and never will be part of European      civilization. Yet Secretary of State Madeleine Albright has      told the Senate Foreign Relations Committee that she wants to      erase ``the line that once so cruelly and arbitrarily divided      Europe.'' It is not at all clear how this policy will produce      that result.       Isn't it too late now to change course? Some argue that eve      if the decision to expand NATO wasn't the most thoughtful,      historically aware way to make policy, the decision has been      made and going back on it would be a disaster far greater      than the problems NATO expansion itself will bring. This      sounds a little like the refusal of the Titanic's captain to      cut his ship's speed when told there were icebergs ahead.      Consistency is a fine idea most of the time, but there are      moments when it's just plain irresponsible.       Only future historians will be able to say whether this is      such a moment. But the mood of current historians should not      give the Administration--or those senators who plan to vote      this week for NATO expansion--very much comfort.
