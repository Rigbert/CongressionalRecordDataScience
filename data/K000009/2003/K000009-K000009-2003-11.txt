Speaker, I want to thank the gentleman for raising several critical issues this evening, including the disparity between those Americans who are losing their jobs and certainly very privileged people in this country including the Vice President of this Nation.  Mr. Speaker, I want to follow up on what the gentleman was saying about the compensation that the Vice President receives from his former corporation, Halliburton Corporation. The gentleman is absolutely correct in what he says; and in addition to the figures he has placed on the record, the Congressional Research Service issued a report that the other body requested, including not just the funds that the gentleman mentioned for the Vice President, but also deferred salary and stock options, 433,333 of them to be exact, and Halliburton stock owned by the Vice President. And here is what these benefits pay him.  In deferred salary, according to this report, in 2001 Vice President Cheney received $205,298 from Halliburton while he is serving as Vice President and permitting no-bid contracts to go from the Department of Defense to this Vice President. In 2002 he received $162,392; and similar payments are to be made in 2003, 2004, and 2005. So there is an ongoing corporate obligation paid to him in company funds.  In addition, he has these stock options, 433,333 of them in three different traunches. The value of those stock options today alone are valued at over $26,674,990. It is not as though he does not have an interest in what happensto that company. And this is in addition to a $20 million retirement package paid to him by Halliburton after only 5 years of employment that he held with that company and a $1.4 million cash bonus paid to him in Halliburton in 2001, and additional millions of dollars of compensation paid to him while he was employed by the company.  Now, compare that to the people in our country who are losing their jobs and those we are having to fight for here on this floor to get extensions of unemployment benefits. One of the aspects of the job loss in our country and related to the trade deficit with China and with all of the nations is the fact that when these countries, the people in these countries sell us goods, financially our dollars go back to that country and the companies in that country. And it is very interesting what they do with their dollars. First of all, they purchase pieces of us so that the brain of the corporation is no longer located in this country, but rather wherever those companies are located which means that we become a derivative economy.  Secondly, those dollars that end up in the hands of foreign interests are being used to purchase our public debt. And one of the hidden aspects of this horrendous trade deficit that we are racking up is that countries like Japan and China and the Middle Eastern oil kingdoms are buying larger and larger pieces of us. In fact, they now own well over a trillion dollars of our debt on which we are paying them interest.  Is that not a fine how do you do?  According to the latest year for which I have figures, we paid over $85 billion in interest to these foreign creditors to the United States, the largest being Japan. In 2001, we paid her $26.1 billion of our tax money. Those are dollars we did not pay to our citizens. We did not sell savings bonds to our citizens and ask them to pay the interest to them. We paid the interest to Japan, which will not open our markets to their products and continues to exclude our suppliers in their automotive supply chain, but we paid them $26.1 billion.  We paid China and Hong Kong, this was back in 2001, before this deficit was going up as much as it is now. It was horrendous back then, but it is getting worse. We paid China back then over $10 billion, $10 billion. So just China and Japan alone we had over $36.5 billion in interest. That is more money than we put into NASA. In one year NASA's budget is about $14.5 billion. We could run three NASAs for what we are paying just in interest to Japan and China.  Now, to the oil kingdoms we paid over $6.7 billion, $6.7 billion. Could that not put a lot of our young people through college? Could that not educate new doctors for the future for free, for free? We could pay for their tuition and ask them to serve in the underserved areas of this country.  We paid Korea and Taiwan $5.6 billion. So if you total everything up, $85 billion in interest as of 2 years ago to these foreign creditors, people who are buying our debt because we cannot self-finance anymore. The hole of the debt is getting bigger and bigger. We cannot even buy it ourselves. We are pawning it off to foreign interests. Literally, it has gotten so bad that nearly half of the Treasury securities that are sold every year in our country are being purchased by foreign interests.  So the share of foreign ownership of our debt is growing every year. Because when these countries that are responsible for our trade deficit end up getting our dollars, they buy a piece of us. Think about that; $85 billion dollars, we could take care of all the disability compensation for our veterans. We could increase hazard pay for our young men and women in the Armed Forces who are giving their lives every day. We had a measure on the floor last week for $1,500 which was defeated despite our objections. We could triple it.  We could take care of TRICARE for our Guard and Reserve and the families who are part of that system. The Republican leadership will not allow that bill on the floor. We could create a real whole health care system for not just active duty but for our Guard and Reserve across this country.  We could build new water systems all over this country for $85 billion. Only a portion of that would it take to modernize water systems under every city in this country. So the cost of this kind of trade deficit with China, with all of the other countries, the lost jobs here at home, and then the insidious erosion of our own financial independence, because of the transfer of those dollars to others would then essentially weaken us because we end up owing them rather than paying bills when they come due.  Mr. Speaker, in closing this evening I think it is important to place on the record our deep concerns about the Bush administration wanting to expand NAFTA to include all of Latin America. As the gentleman from Ohio (Mr. Brown) has indicated, if we had a balanced trade account with Mexico and with Canada as a result of NAFTA, would it not make sense to do that? But, in fact, after NAFTA's passage, we went into a gigantic deficit with Mexico, the largest in our history, the same with Canada, which means that we are sucking in imports with these countries when, in fact, they promised us with NAFTA that we would be creating jobs in our country by exporting to those countries. That is not happening. It is working exactly the reverse, both in industry and in agriculture.  Now the Bush administration wants to use that flawed template in order to expand to a larger portion of the hemisphere. In whose interest is that? When the original NAFTA is not working, why would you want to expand it? Why do you not fix it so that we do not continue to hemorrhage more jobs and continue to fritter away our financial independence as a Nation?  CAFTA will be considered here before the end of the year or perhaps before next June, we are not sure; but we ought to think hard about not making the same mistake again and think about how we are go to repair these big holes of deficit that we are building both on the trade front and on the deficit front for our Treasury accounts.  Mr. Speaker, we will have more to say on the condition of the economy of the United States in the days and months ahead; but surely the Bush administration cannot be proud of its record, and surely we need leadership, new leadership here in Washington, to help us get our Nation in a stronger situation for the future generations than we have found it.
