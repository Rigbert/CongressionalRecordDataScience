Speaker, I rise today to commemorate a fellow public servant from Ohio, George Voinovich, who passed away Sunday, June 12th.  George was a pillar of the Republican Party, though he occasionally opposed the establishment in the name of good governance. His intellect was unsurpassed, helping him to become a two-term Governor of Ohio, and later to win a seat in the U.S. Senate.  Among his numerous achievements, George was proudest of passing the global anti-Semitism bill, efforts to expand NATO, and a bill to protect intellectual property. These accomplishments are a testament to his character, one which helped restore the city of Cleveland in the late 1970s.  In addition to political accomplishments, George prided himself on his frugality, in both his public life and private life. Throughout his governorship, his mantra was ``working harder and smarter, doing more with less.'' Occasionally this mantra put George in juxtaposition with his party, such as when he pushed a tax increase that would help stabilize the state's finances.  Born in Cleveland on July 15, 1936, George Victor Voinovich was the son of Eastern European immigrants. His culture would strongly shape the man he became, endearing him to the ethnic communities that thrived in the Cleveland area.  Sadly, tragedy would also shape his life in later years, after the death of his youngest daughter, Molly, when she was 9 years old. George readily acknowledged this incident as one that elicited a greater depth of feeling and understanding, all of which he reflected back on his work in public service.  George passed away suddenly on Sunday, in the company of his wife, Janet. He had just made a public appearance the Friday before at the 25th Slovenian Independence Day event at Cleveland City Hall, and was a delegate to the upcoming Republican National Convention.  George is survived by his loving wife and three children. We offer them our prayers and hope that they find comfort in the wonderful memories of our dear friend and colleague, George, who will be remembered with affection and gratitude for his probing intellect, kind heart, and utter dedication to our wonderful state of Ohio.                            ____________________
