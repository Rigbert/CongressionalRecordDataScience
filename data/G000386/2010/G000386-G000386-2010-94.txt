 President, today, our body starts debate on expiring tax and health provisions. Around this Capitol building, the nickname of these items is called extenders. I wish to make a couple of points on the process before I get into the substance of the substitute. My first point will reflect on how much the Democratic leadership has avoided a simpler, clearer, bipartisan approach. My second point will consider all of the other time-sensitive, unfinished tax legislation that appears to be abandoned with only a few weeks left in this session.  My first point deals with a conscious decision to use a partisan process for bipartisan issues. What I find surprising is that we are taking up a package that, like the HIRE Act jobs bill of a few weeks ago, absolutely belongs to the bicameral House and Senate Democratic leadership. It was negotiated between House and Senate Democratic leaders, with some input from their tax-writing committees and staff. These discussions occurred entirely behind closed doors. As far as I know, it was a Democrats-only discussion. It is not a conference agreement, where things are worked out in a sophisticated conference committee made up of people from the House and Senate.  Then, in addition, at the very last minute, the compromise took on the properties of an amoeba. In that amoeba fashion, the House Rules Committee split the bill into two pieces, one dealing with the so-called Medicare doctor fix and the rest of the bill dealing with the balance of that package. Then, under the magic of the House Rules Committee, this amoeba-like bill was reconstituted into one legislative product, and that is the underlying bill Leader Reid has brought before the Senate this very day.  I am relieved to see that it appears the Senate will process extenders in a way that is different from the way the HIRE Act jobs bill was handled. It looks as though we Senators will have a chance to represent our constituents and shape this bill, because Leader Reid has not filled the amendment tree or filed cloture at the start of debate. That is a real relief around this body, where amendment trees have been filled and cloture has been filed.  Back home, folks wonder why it is taking Congress so long to deal with these routine extenders. As an example: As I left church Sunday in Cedar Falls, IA, a person who has investment in a biodiesel plant wants to know when we are going to pass the biodiesel tax credit bill. Most of the tax provisions expired almost a half a year ago, on December 31, 2009. Folks are angry that Congress seems to be dithering, among other things, on the 71 tax provisions. In my State, it is a biodiesel tax credit that always comes up, but people are wondering about the dithering generally. And, of course, we even have physicians across the country being frustrated that this Congress has allowed a 21-percent cut in payments to go into effect again this year. Payment cuts of this magnitude severely impact physicians and health care providers and practitioners throughout the country, and they significantly threaten beneficiary access to care.  Medicare beneficiaries' access to physicians and other needed medical care has been jeopardized this year as never before because Senate Democratic leadership has once again failed to pass an essential physician update in a timely manner. We could have wrapped up this time-sensitive legislative business 4 months ago. We could have taken up a bipartisan package that I put together with my friend, Finance Committee Chairman Baucus of Montana. To be sure, some of the structure in this package reflects the agreement that my friend and I reached. But this package, in terms of the impact on the deficit, is likely several times the size of the package we agreed upon. Virtually all of the additional cost is due to proposals I would not have agreed to in representing my Republican Conference.  I was under the impression that the Senate Democratic leadership was genuine in its desire to work on a bipartisan basis, but clearly I was mistaken. Although the Senate Democratic leadership was highly involved in the development of a bipartisan bill, they arbitrarily decided to replace it with a bill that skews toward their liberal wing. That is why we are where we are this very day. There is a liberal agenda that exalts open-ended deficit hiking, spending, and tax increases, and doing it above everything else. Angry vocal members with that view seem to have dominated the decisionmaking of the Democratic leadership in resolving routine items.  The actions in the House a couple of weeks ago go on to further prove my point. The Senate Republican leaders backed the Baucus-Grassley compromise of last February. To them, it seemed to be a balanced package. It was largely offset, it was leaner than most Democrats wanted, but it was thicker than most Republicans wanted. Republicans preferred a fully offset package using spending cuts; Democrats resisted most spending cut offsetsand wanted many multiples of the level of spending with which Republicans were comfortable. So it is ideal, because this is the way it works most of the time between Senator Baucus and me.  The Baucus-Grassley compromise was a genuine middle ground. But for the liberal core of the Democratic caucus, it was their way or the highway. Leader Reid responded to that pressure and scuttled the Baucus-Grassley compromise. Ironically, almost 4 months later, it looks as though the Democratic caucus is moving closer to the structure of the Baucus-Grassley compromise of last February.  The Senate Republican Conference, seeing the alarming growth in deficits and debt in the intervening 4 months, will press hard for a fully offset package. For those in my conference, several fiscal events--and these all occurring in the intervening 4 months since the Baucus-Grassley bill was scuttled--have been compelling on my side of the aisle viewing this legislation a little bit differently.  The first event is the second opinions we are receiving on the fiscal impact of the health care bill. The Congressional Budget Office has revised the official spending upward.  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to have printed in the Record a copy of the CBO's May 11 letter to Congressman Jerry Lewis. The letter is accompanied by two tables that identify explicit authorizations of discretionary funding. These tables are available along with the full text of the letter on the CBO's website at www.cbo.gov.  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in the Record, as follows:                                                    U.S. Congress,                                  Congressional Budget Office,                                     Washington, DC, May 11, 2010.     Hon. Jerry Lewis,     Ranking Member, Committee on Appropriations, House of          Representatives, Washington, DC.       Dear Congressman: As you requested, the Congressional      Budget Office is providing additional information about the      potential effects of H.R. 3590, the Patient Protection and      Affordable Care Act (PPACA, Public Law 111-148), on      discretionary spending. The following analysis updates and      expands upon the analysis of potential discretionary spending      under PPACA that CBO provided on March 13, 2010. In      particular, it provides an update of the earlier tally of      specified authorization amounts, as well as a list of      programs or activities for which no specific funding levels      are identified in the legislation but for which the act      authorizes the appropriation of ``such sums as may be      necessary.''       Potential discretionary costs under PPACA arise from the      effects of the legislation on a variety of federal programs      and agencies. The law establishes a number of new programs      and activities, as well as authorizing new funding for      existing programs. By their nature, however, all such      potential effects on discretionary spending are subject to      future appropriation actions, which could result in greater      or smaller costs than the sums authorized by the legislation.      Moreover, in many cases, the law authorizes future      appropriations but does not specify a particular amount.       CBO does not have a comprehensive estimate of all of the      potential discretionary costs associated with PPACA, but we      can provide information on the major components of such      costs. Those discretionary costs fall into three general      categories:       The costs that will be incurred by federal agencies to      implement the new policies established by PPACA, such as      administrative expenses for the Department of Health and      Human Services (HHS) and the Internal Revenue Service for      carrying out key requirements of the legislation.       Explicit authorizations for a variety of grant and other      program spending for which specified funding levels for one      or more years are provided in the act. (Such cases include      provisions where a specified funding level is authorized for      an initial year along with the authorization of such sums as      may be necessary for continued funding in subsequent years.)       Explicit authorizations for a variety of grant and other      program spending for which no specific funding levels are      identified in the legislation. That type of provision      generally includes legislative language that authorizes the      appropriation of ``such sums as may be necessary,'' often for      a particular period of time.       CBO estimates that total authorized costs in the first two      categories probably exceed $115 billion over the 2010-2019      period, as detailed below. We do not have an estimate of the      potential costs of authorizations in the third category.       Implementation Costs for Federal Agencies--The      administrative and other costs for federal agencies to      implement the act's provisions will be funded through the      appropriations process; sufficient discretionary funding will      be essential to implement this legislation in the time frame      called for. Major costs for such implementation activities      will include:       Costs to the Internal Revenue Service (IRS) of implementing      the eligibility determination, documentation, and      verification processes for premium and cost-sharing credits.      CBO expects that those costs will probably total between $5      billion and $10 billion over 10 years.       Costs to HHS, especially the Centers for Medicare and      Medicaid Services, and the Office of Personnel Management for      implementing the changes in Medicare, Medicaid, and the      Children's Health Insurance Program, as well as certain      reforms to the private insurance market. CBO expects that      those costs will probably total at least $5 billion to $10      billion over 10 years.       Explicit Authorizations of Discretionary Funding--Explicit      authorizations are identified in Tables 1 and 2. Table 1      presents a list of items for which PPACA specifies the      authorized amount of funding for at least one year. It also      includes items for which initial specified funding levels      existed under prior law but for which PPACA extends the      authority for continued spending. The specified and estimated      amounts shown in Table 1 total about $105 billion over the      2010-2019 period.       Table 1 differs from CBO's table of specified      authorizations provided on March 13, 2010, in the following      ways:       Certain provisions that extend (existing) authorizations      with a specified level have been added. (In the previous      version of that table, only new authorizations were      included.) Also, provisions that provide mandatory grants for      2010 but authorize future spending of such sums as necessary      (subject to appropriation) have been included. Those      provisions are noted in the updated table.       Table 1 includes an estimate of the cost of section 10221      of PPACA, which incorporates the provisions of S. 1790, the      Indian Health Care Improvement Reauthorization and Extension      Act by reference. (CBO had not completed an estimate of the      Indian health provisions for the March 13 version of the      authorization table.) Those provisions authorize the      appropriation of such sums as are necessary for the Indian      Health Service (IHS) for carrying out responsibilities      broadly similar to those in law prior to enactment of PPACA.      As a result, the amounts included in Table 1 reflect recent      appropriations for those IHS programs, with adjustments for      anticipated inflation in later years.       Table 1 also includes a few corrections to the table      provided on March 13. For example, section 5207, which      authorizes funding for the National Health Service Corps, was      inadvertently left off the March 13 table but is included in      Table 1.       Table 2 presents a list of new activities for which PPACA      includes only a broad authorization for the appropriation of      ``such sums as may be necessary.'' For those activities, the      lack of guidance in the legislation about how new activities      should be conducted means that, in many cases, CBO does not      have a sufficient basis for estimating what the ``necessary''      amounts might be over the 2010-2020 period.       Although Tables 1 and 2 provide more information about the      discretionary costs associated with PPACA, they do not      represent all of the potential budgetary implications of      changes to existing discretionary programs--including both      potential increases and decreases relative to recent      appropriations. Some of those changes could affect spending      under existing authorizations or may lead the Congress to      consider making changes--up or down--in the funding for      existing programs. Moreover, some of the potential new costs      for individual provisions of the legislation may be covered      by the broad estimate of $5 billion to $10 billion for      administrative costs to HHS.       I hope you find this information useful. If you have any      questions about this updated analysis of PPACA's implications      for future discretionary appropriations, please contact me or      CBO staff. The primary staff contacts for this analysis are      Jean Hearne and Julie Lee.           Sincerely,                                             Douglas W. Elmendorf,                                                         Director.
