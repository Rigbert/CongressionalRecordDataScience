 President, I withdraw my previous point of order, but I want this body to know that I object to the language in this bill that essentially makes Hyde permanent and affects those States whose managed care plans now cover medically necessary abortions. Unfortunately, the way the language was cleverly drafted, my point of order would have unintended consequences.  I go back to what my colleague from West Virginia said to all of us a few minutes ago. I think as we move toward final passage, I hope we all understand the severe consequences of the many different arenas in this bill.  I withdraw my point of order.
