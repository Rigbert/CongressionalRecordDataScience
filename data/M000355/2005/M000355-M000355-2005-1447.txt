 President, we will resume business on the emergency supplemental appropriations bill Monday. Although we have not yet set votes on Monday, as the Democratic leader just pointed out, we will have at least two votes Monday evening at around 5:30. In addition, we have cloture votes scheduled for Tuesday morning, and now Tuesday afternoon. Therefore, we expect busy days next week as we move toward completion of this important appropriations measure before us. It is our intent to finish this funding bill next week, and we hope cloture can be invoked on the underlying bill to ensure that we can get to final passage before the end of the week.                          ____________________
