Chairman, I support the amendment. I think that it is a good amendment. It includes energy storage as a form of energy that DOE should consider to enhance emergency preparedness for energy supply disruptions during natural disasters.  It improves the bill, and I compliment the gentleman.  I yield back the balance of my time.
