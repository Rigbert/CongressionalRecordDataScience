I can recall when President Obama came forward with his stimulus bill, the recovery and reinvestment bill, that the Senator from Vermont was one of the leaders to put additional funds in the bill to build clinics all across America--in rural areas we represent, in the towns and cities we represent as well--for the very reason the Senator mentioned: Because for a lot of people who I represent in downstate, southern Illinois, in some of the rural regions, it is a long drive to a doctors clinic for primary care. So these community health clinics, FHQA clinics, are going to offer people primary care.  I think as a result of this bill, when we enact it--and I feel very good about the enactment of this because I think we sense this is a moment in history we should not miss--we are going to see this network grow across America. And it has proven itself to be so good.  In the city of Chicago, I have visited these community health clinics. I will bet the Senator does in Vermont. What I find there--many times I will walk in the door. The administrator will be there. We will start talking. I will meet the doctors. I will meet the nurses. When I finally get a chance to drink a cup of coffee and talk to them for a few minutes, I say--and I mean it--if I were sick, I would feel confident walking into the front door of this clinic, that I would be in the best of hands--better than the most expensive clinic in my State.
