Madam Speaker, yesterday, as ranking member of the Africa Subcommittee, I joined several colleagues at an important Foreign Affairs Committee meeting with Prime Minister Morgan Tsvangirai of Zimbabwe. It was an extraordinary opportunity to discuss Zimbabwe's progress towards democracy and away from dictatorship, its problems with hyperinflation, and multiple health crises, including cholera, and to obtain a fuller understanding of what additional steps the United States can take right now to help.  That meeting, however, occurred at precisely the same time that the House considered H. Res. 529, a resolution condemning the June 10th violent attack on the Holocaust Memorial Museum, a despicable anti-Semitic act that killed Officer Stephen Tyrone Johns. And as so eloquently articulated by so many of my colleagues yesterday during that debate, we salute Officer Johns for his bravery and his courage, and extend our deepest condolences to his family.  I rise today not only to express my support for H. Res. 529, but also to thank my good friend and colleague, Mr. Klein, for introducing it and for including me as a cosponsor.  Madam Speaker, the Holocaust Memorial Museum is a noble and vitally necessary attempt to remember and honor the victims of the Holocaust. The memorial itself is a witness to truth and the promotion of human dignity and tolerance.  Wednesday's attack on that museum by a crazed, hate-filled gunman is yet another chilling reminder that our society still harbors a dangerous collection of bigots and racists who hate Jews.  Unparalleled since the dark days of the Second World War, Jewish communities around the world are today facing violent attacks against synagogues, Jewish cultural sites, cemeteries and individuals. Anti-Semitism is an ugly reality that won't go away by ignoring it or by wishing it away. It must be combated with resolve and tenacity, and it must be defeated.  The sad and deeply troubling reality is that James von Brunn cannot be dismissed as an aberration, but is connected to a whole hate-promoting movement that results in violence against Jews in America and around the world on practically a daily basis.  The Anti-Defamation League recently issued its annual audit of anti-Semitic incidents. While the ADL is to be congratulated for its careful research on an unpleasant but absolutely necessary subject, the ugly facts that the report documents makes for painful reading.  In 2008, the ADL noted 1,352 reported incidents of vandalism, harassment, and physical assaults on Jewish people or Jewish-owned property nationwide. Sadly, and shamefully, my own State of New Jersey had more reported anti-Semitic incidents, 238, than any other State in the Union.  The attack on the Holocaust Museum is the most ominous aspect of this evil wave that we have seen worldwide and in our own country. The Holocaust Museum is a unique institution. It is a memorial, a museum, a center of Holocaust scholarship, and a promoter of tolerance and preventer of genocide. It is a very powerful symbol of the solidarity of America with those murdered in the Holocaust, and with the Jewish people as well.  Madam Speaker, at this critical moment, we need government officials at all levels to denounce, without hesitation or delay, every anti-Semitic act, wherever and whenever it occurs, no exceptions. At this moment, not to speak out enables the purveyors of hate. They never take a holiday. They never grow weary, nor should we.  Just as Mr. Brunn attacked the Holocaust Memorial Museum and murdered a courageous security officer tasked with its protection, Holocaust remembrance and tolerance education must dramatically expand, and we need toensure that our respective laws punish those who hate and incite violence against Jews.  Finally, if we are to protect our children from the evil of anti-Semitism, we must re-educate ourselves and systematically educate our children. While that starts at our homes, the classroom must be the incubator of tolerance as well. It seems to me that only the most hardened racist can remain unmoved by Holocaust education and remembrance. Only the most crass, evil and prejudiced among us can study the horrors of the Holocaust and not cry out: Never again!                          ____________________
