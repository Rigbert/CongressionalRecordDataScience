 President, over the last 8 years, we learned what a difference a responsible budget can make. We learned it starts with the basics, like using real numbers and not ``betting the farm'' on rosy projections. We learned that if we invest in the American people and their needs, our country and our economy will benefit. We learned that we need to be fiscally responsible. That means making tough choices and holding the line on deficit spending. And we learned that we have to work together to get things done.
