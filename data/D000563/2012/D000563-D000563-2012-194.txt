President, at this moment, the majority leader, Senator Harry Reid, and the Republican leader, Senator Mitch McConnell, are gathered on the east front steps of the U.S. Capitol along with Members of the House of Representatives. It is a bipartisan gathering to commemorate the 11th anniversary of the terrible tragedy of 9/11.  On that date the gathering was more spontaneous but reflected a feeling of unity, which all of us felt in light of that national tragedy. Toward the end of that gathering 11 years ago, Senator Barbara Mikulski suggested that Members sing ``God Bless America,'' and they did. Today, during the course of this ceremony, there will be a moment of silence, prayer, as well as the singing of ``God Bless America'' to celebrate the great effort that has been made by so many to keep America safe and to mourn the loss of those who lost their lives on 9/11.  We remember today all of those who were lost and all those who suffered in the terrorist attacks on America. In their honor may we work to keep alive that sense of unity we felt on that day, and may we do our best to serve the loved ones they left and the Nation they loved.  Mr. President, I yield the floor, and I suggest the absence of a quorum.
