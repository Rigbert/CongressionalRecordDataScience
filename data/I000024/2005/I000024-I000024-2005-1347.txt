It was about a year before former President Nixon died. No matter what you think of former President Nixon, I don't think there is anyone who won't tell you that he was the most knowledgeable person on foreign affairs of anyone of his time. He came before the House of Representatives where I was serving at the time and gave a 2\1/2\ hour talk. He didn't use any notes. He stood up there, stood erect at his age and his health condition, and he took us for 2\1/2\ hours all the way around the world, every remote country there was, and talked about the history of that country, the history of our relationship to that country, what our relationship would be and should be with those countries. I don't think there is anyone who can do that today other than the nominee we are talking about today in Dr. Condoleezza Rice. I have seen her do the same thing. We are blessed to have her as our nominee for Secretary of State. I am certainly looking forward to serving with her.  I yield the floor.                               Exhibit 1               [From the Washington Post, Jan. 25, 2005]                Results, Not Timetables, Matter In Iraq              (By Henry A. Kissinger and George P. Shultz)       The debate on Iraq is taking a new turn. The Iraqi      elections scheduled for Jan. 30, only recently viewed as a      culmination, are described as inaugurating a civil war. The      timing and the voting arrangements have become controversial.      All this is a way of foreshadowing a demand for an exit      strategy, by which many critics mean some sort of explicit      time limit on the U.S. effort.       We reject this counsel. The implications of the term ``exit      strategy'' must be clearly understood; there can be no      fudging of consequences. The essential prerequisite for an      acceptable exit strategy is a sustainable outcome, not an      arbitrary time limit. For the outcome in Iraq will shape the      next decade of American foreign policy. A debacle would usher      in a series of convulsions in the region as radicals and      fundamentalists moved for dominance, with the wind seemingly      at their backs. Wherever there are significant Muslim      populations, radical elements would be emboldened. As the      rest of the world related to this reality, its sense of      direction would be impaired by the demonstration of American      confusion in Iraq. A precipitate American withdrawal would be      almost certain to cause a civil war that would dwarf      Yugoslavia's, and it would be compounded as neighbors      escalated their current involvement into fullscale      intervention.       We owe it to ourselves to become clear about what post-     election outcome is compatible with our values and global      security. And we owe it to the Iraqis to strive for an      outcome that can further their capacity to shape their      future.       The mechanical part of success is relatively easy to      define: establishment of a government considered sufficiently      legitimate by the Iraqi people to permit recruitment of an      army able and willing to defend its institutions. That goal      cannot be expedited by an arbitrary deadline that would be,      above all, likely to confuse both ally and adversary. The      political and military efforts cannot be separated. Training      an army in a political vacuum has proved insufficient. If we      cannot carry out both the political and military tasks, we      will not be able to accomplish either.       But what is such a government? Optimists and idealists      posit that a full panoply of Western democratic institutions      can be created in a time frame the American political process      will sustain. Reality is likely to disappoint these      expectations. Iraq is a society riven by centuries of      religious and ethnic conflicts; it has little or no      experience with representative institutions. The challenge is      to define political objectives that, even when falling short      of the maximum goal, nevertheless represent significant      progress and enlist support across the various ethnic groups.      The elections of Jan. 30 should therefore be interpreted as      the indispensable first phase of a political evolution from      military occupation to political legitimacy.       Optimists also argue that, since the Shiites make up about      60 percent of the population and the Kurds 15 to 20 percent,      and since neither wants Sunni domination, a democratic      majority exists almost automatically. In that view, the Iraqi      Shiite leaders have come to appreciate the benefits of      democratization and the secular state by witnessing the      consequences of their absence under the Shiite theocracy in      neighboring Iran.       A pluralistic, Shiite-led society would indeed be a happy      outcome. But we must take care not to base policy on the wish      becoming father to the thought. If a democratic process is      to unify Iraq peacefully, a great deal depends on how the      Shiite majority defines majority rule.       So far the subtle Shiite leaders, hardened by having      survived decades of Saddam Hussein's tyranny, have been      ambiguous about their goals. They have insisted on early      elections--indeed, the date of Jan. 30 was established on the      basis of a near-ultimatum by the most eminent Shiite leader,      Grand Ayatollah Ali Sistani. The Shiites have also urged      voting procedures based on national candidate lists, which      work against federal and regional political institutions.      Recent Shiite pronouncements have affirmed the goal of a      secular state but have left open the interpretation of      majority rule. An absolutist application of majority rule      would make it difficult to achieve political legitimacy. The      Kurdish minority and the Sunni portion of the country would      be in permanent opposition.       Western democracy developed in homogeneous societies;      minorities found majority rule acceptable because they had a      prospect of becoming majorities, and majorities were      restrained in the exercise of their power by their temporary      status and by judicially enforced minority guarantees. Such      an equation does not operate where minority status is      permanently established by religious affiliation and      compounded by ethnic differences and decades of brutal      dictatorship. Majority rule in such circumstances is      perceived as an alternative version of the oppression of the      weak by the powerful. In multiethnic societies, minority      rights must be protected by structural and constitutional      safeguards. Federalism mitigates the scope for potential      arbitrariness of the numerical majority and defines autonomy      on a specific range of issues.       The reaction to intransigent Sunni brutality and the      relative Shiite quiet must not tempt us into identifying      Iraqi legitimacy with unchecked Shiite rule. The American      experience with Shiite theocracy in Iran since 1979 does not      inspire confidence in our ability to forecast Shiite      evolution or the prospects of a Shiite-dominated bloc      extending to the Mediterranean. A thoughtful American policy      will not mortgage itself to     one side in a religious conflict fervently conducted for      1,000 years.       The Constituent Assembly emerging from the elections will      be sovereign to some extent. But the United States'      continuing leverage should be focused on four key objectives:      (1) to prevent any group from using the political process to      establish the kind of dominance previously enjoyed by the      Sunnis; (2) to prevent any areas from slipping into Taliban      conditions as havens and recruitment centers for terrorists;      (3) to keep Shiite government from turning into a theocracy,      Iranian or indigenous; (4) to leave scope for regional      autonomy within the Iraqi democratic process.       The United States has every interest in conducting a      dialogue with all parties to encourage the emergence of a      secular leadership of nationalists and regional      representatives. The outcome of constitution-building should      be a federation, with an emphasis on regional autonomy. Any      group pushing its claims beyond these limits should be      brought to understand the consequences of a breakup of the      Iraqi state into its constituent elements, including an      Iranian-dominated south, an Islamist-Hussein Sunni center and      invasion of the Kurdish region by its neighbors.       A calibrated American policy would seek to split that part      of the Sunni community eager to conduct a normal life from      the part that is fighting to reestablish Sunni control. The      United States needs to continue building an Iraqi army,      which, under conditions of Sunni insurrection, will be      increasingly composed of Shiite recruits--producing an      unwinnable situation for the Sunni rejectionists. But it      should not cross the line into replacing Sunni dictatorship      with Shiite theocracy. It is a fine line, but the success of      Iraq policy may depend on the ability to walk it.       The legitimacy of the political institutions emerging in      Iraq depends significantly on international acceptance of the      new government. An international contact group should be      formed to advise on the political and economic      reconstruction of Iraq. Such a step would be a gesture of      confident leadership, especially as America's security and      financial contributions will remain pivotal. Our European      allies must not shame themselves and the traditional      alliance by continuing to stand aloof from even a      political process that, whatever their view of recent      history, will affect their future even more than ours. Nor      should we treat countries such as India and Russia, with      their large Muslim populations, as spectators to outcomes      on which their domestic stability may well depend.       Desirable political objectives will remain theoretical      until adequate security is established in Iraq. In an      atmosphere of political assassination, wholesale murder and      brigandage, when the road from Baghdad to its international      airport is the scene of daily terrorist or criminal      incidents, no government will long be able to sustain public      confidence. Training, equipping and motivating effective      Iraqi armed forces is a precondition to all the other      efforts. Yet no matter how well trained and equipped, that      army will not fight except for a government in which it has      confidence. This vicious circle needs to be broken.       It is axiomatic that guerrillas win if they do not lose.      And in Iraq the guerrillas are not losing, at least not in      the Sunni region, at least not visibly. A successful strategy      needs to answer these questions: Are we waging ``one war'' in      which military and political efforts are mutually      reinforcing? Are the institutions guiding and monitoring      these tasks sufficiently coordinated? Is our strategic goal      to achieve complete security in at least some key towns and      major communication routes (defined as reducing violence to      historical criminal levels)? This would be in accordance with      the maxim that complete security in 70 percent of the country      is better than 70 percent security in 100 percent of the      country--because fully secure areas can be models and magnets      for those who are suffering in insecure places. Do we have a      policy for eliminating the sanctuaries in Syria and Iran from      which the enemy can be instructed, supplied, and given refuge      and time to regroup? Are we designing a policy that can      produce results for the people and prevent civil strife for      control of the State and its oil revenue? Are we maintaining      American public support so that staged surges of extreme      violence do not break domestic public confidence at a time      when the enemy may, in fact, be on the verge of failure? And      are we gaining international understanding and willingness to      play a constructive role in what is a global threat to peace      and security?       An exit strategy based on performance, not artificial time      limits, will judge progress by the ability to produce      positive answers to these questions. In the immediate future,      a significant portion of the antiinsurrection effort will      have to be carried out by the United States. A premature      shift from combat operations to training missions might      create a gap that permits the insurrection to rally its      potential. But as Iraqi forces increase in number and      capability, and as the political construction proceeds after      the election, a realistic exit strategy will emerge.       There is no magic formula for a quick, non-catastrophic      exit. But there is an obligation to do our utmost to bring      about an outcome that will mark a major step forward in the      war against terrorism, in the transformation of the Middle      East and toward a more peaceful and democratic world order.
