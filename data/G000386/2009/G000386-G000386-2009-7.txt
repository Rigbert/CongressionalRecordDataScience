 President, Democratic leadership and the White House have spent months talking about accountability. With this objection, the majority will not even consider an amendment to make sure the White House and all Members employed on Capitol Hill, not just those in our personal offices, live under the same new health care system the rest of the country lives under. That sure doesn't sound like accountability to me.
