  The Foreign Relations committee reported this bill in July, and it passed the Senate by unanimous consent on August 1. Since then, the situation in Zimbabwe has deteriorated rapidly. Respect for human rights and the rule of law have been systematically subverted by Zimbabwe's ruling party, and indeed by President Robert Mugabe himself. President Mugabe has supported the invasion of farms by so called ``war veterans,'' he has intimated judges, harassed the free press, forbidden international monitors to observe next year's presidential elections and packed the supreme court with cronies in a misguided attempt to give his actions a patina of legitimacy.  Under Mugabe's leadership the economy of Zimbabwe has been driven into the ground. The deployment of troops to the Democratic Republic of Congo was an expensive ill thought fiasco which has cost millions. The illegal farm invasions have resulted in the loss of income from the country's major cash crop. Unsound fiscal policies have resulted in a suspension of aid from the international Monetary Fund, inflation is soaring, international investment has dried up and unemployment is on the rise.  The World Food Program has had to start a food distribution program in a country that should be exporting food to its neighbors. That in itself is bad enough. Worse, however, is the fact that the Zimbabwean government has stated that private relief agencies are prohibited from delivering food to the needy. Only the government can distribute food. Given the current political climate this can mean only one thing: the government will attempt to coopt the population by giving food in exchange for votes in the upcoming presidential elections.  The bill itself is very straightforward. It offers money for a credible program of land reform, and plans for U.S. support for bi-lateral and multi-lateral debt relief if the President certifies to Congress that rule of law has been restored in Zimbabwe, including subordination of law enforcement organizations to the civilian government, that conditions for free and fair elections exist, that a credible program of land reform has been put in place, and that the government of Zimbabwe is adhering to agreements to withdraw its troops from the Democratic Republic of Congo. No new sanctions are imposed on the government, but the legislation does very wisely ask the administration to look into personal sanctions for high level members of the Zimbabwean government and their families, such as travel bans and visa restrictions.  The actions undertaken in the last two years by Robert Mugabe can becharacterized as nothing more, or less, than a shameless power grab. According to news reports current polls show that the leading opposition party has more support than Mugabe. No doubt this will cause an even more heinous crackdown on political opponents in the lead up to the elections. While I sincerely hope that Mugabe comes to his senses and allows for the presence of international observers during the upcoming presidential elections, I doubt that he will. Perhaps passage of this bill will send a signal to the government of Zimbabwe that the United States is serious about its position on the rule of law, human rights and democracy. The tragedy that has unfolded in what was once a stable prosperous country must not be ignored.                          ____________________
