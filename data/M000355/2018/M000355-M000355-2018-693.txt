 He meant so much to so many of us, both inside this Chamber and out.  As I noted yesterday, the Senate is eager to work on concrete ways to continue this momentum and provide a lasting tribute to this American hero long after this week's observances are complete. Following Senator Kennedy's death in 2009, for example, we named the Kennedy Caucus Room to honor his and his brothers' public service. Some have suggested we take a similar step so that the Armed Services Committee, on which our friend played such a critical role, would meet in a committee room named for Senator McCain.  Back in 2000, the Senate approved recommendations to add two additional portraits to the Capitol Senate Reception Room right off the Senate floor. Only seven Senators in the entire history of this institution are honored with portraits there.  I actually had the opportunity to serve in the bipartisan group that successfully recommended that Senators Arthur Vandenberg and Robert Wagner should appear there alongside Henry Clay, Daniel Webster, John Calhoun, Robert La Follette, Sr., and Robert Taft, who were selected by a special committee back in 1957. That committee, interestingly enough, was appointed by Lyndon Johnson and chaired by John F. Kennedy. I have also heard in recent days that perhaps Senator McCain's portrait should join that distinguished group. So it is a further tribute to our colleague that there is no shortage of good ideas.  In order to make sure we realize these intentions, I would like to put together an official group who can collaborate and bring together ideas from current Members, former colleagues, and friends. It will be bipartisan, as only befits John's legacy. Come to think of it, we should probably call it not a committee but a gang. So I am glad we are able to form this gang to ensure that a suitable, lasting tribute becomes a reality. I will have more details regarding this group to share in the coming days after our friend is laid to rest.                          ____________________
