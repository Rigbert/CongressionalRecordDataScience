 Yesterday we had hours upon hours of quorum calls. All I am suggesting is that I be allowed to continue, and at such point as the Senator reaches an agreement, I would, of course, yield to whomever wishes to make the unanimous consent request. Being unable to do that, I believe my courtesy in giving up the position I had has not been returned. But, of course, the Senator has the parliamentary right to do whatever he wants because he has the floor.
