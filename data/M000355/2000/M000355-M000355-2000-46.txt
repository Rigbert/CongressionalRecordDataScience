 President, I rise today to pay tribute to my good friend and philanthropist, R. Gene Smith.  I have had the privilege of knowing Gene for many years, and have always been able to witness his compassion for others on numerous occasions. Gene has a kind heart and a giving spirit, and constantly thinks of ways to help those less fortunate than himself. Eight years ago, he offered another of his generous gifts to a fourth grade class in Louisville. In a spectacular show of kindness, Gene promised an all-expense paid college education to 58 students at Jefferson County's poorest school, Engelhard Elementary. The students' part of the deal entailed completing high school and gaining acceptance to a post-secondary college or university. As fourth graders, these children probably couldn't grasp the incredible opportunity they were offered then, but they certainly understand it now.  As Gene often does, he went the extra mile on his promise and committed to helping each of the 58 students graduate from high school. He created the R. Gene Smith Foundation to meet the academic, social, and emotional needs of each child. Over the students' eight-year journey to graduation, the Foundation served as a haven for the children and facilitated learning and personal growth opportunities. In spite of numerous obstacles, Gene and his students exceeded expectations and recently celebrated the graduation of 31 of the original 58 students.  Gene gave an amazing gift. Not only did Gene provided a free college education, but he provided each of the students and their parents with compassion, motivation, and peace of mind over the last eight years. He prevented 31 sets of parents from having to worry about whether they would have the money to pay for their child's education. He provided 31 students with hope for a bright and successful future.  Although this latest act of compassion is extraordinary, it is only one example of Gene's generosity. Gene chaired fund-raising efforts for Neighborhood House, a community center in a poverty-stricken area of Portland, Kentucky. He supports a preschool program for underprivileged children in Kentucky, called Jump Start. Additionally, he donated $1 million towards redevelopment of the Louisville waterfront. Gene also lends his support to such civic groups as the Speed Art Museum, the Cathedral Heritage Foundation, the University of Louisville Hospital Foundation, and Greater Louisville, Inc.  On behalf of myself and my colleagues in the United States Senate, I offer heartfelt thanks to Gene for his continuing commitment to helping others and a hearty congratulations to the 31 hardworking high school graduates.                          ____________________
