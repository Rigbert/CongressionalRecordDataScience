Chairman, if the gentleman will yield further, I want to thank him for his continuing comments and again express, this was probably the most substantive bipartisan bill that passed in the last Congress. The Speaker indicated that and others have as well. If we, however, fail to fund it properly, it will be a promise unfulfilled, and our democracy will not be as well served as all of us hoped when we supported the Help America Vote Act.  Mr. Chairman, I thank the gentleman for his time.
