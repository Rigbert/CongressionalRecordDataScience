 President, I strongly oppose this amendment.  This amendment provides an exception to this resolution in support of efforts to defend against threats to civilian population centers in coalition countries, including locations where citizens and nationals of the United States reside. But the President already has authority to support the defense of U.S. partners and U.S. citizens residing in those countries, so it simply duplicates the authorities the President already has.  In the best interpretation, this amendment is unnecessary, but this amendment could also very easily be used by the administration as a loophole that will allow the Department of Defense to continue the unauthorized activities that the sponsors of this resolution are attempting to halt.  This resolution is intended to end U.S. support for the Saudi war against the Houthis in Yemen, support that has not been authorized by Congress as the Constitution requires. Under the language of this amendment, the administration could continue to wage that war under different pretenses.  The goal of this resolution is to get the United States out of a war. Senator Inhofe's amendment creates a pretext to keep the United States in that war.  I urge my colleagues to vote against it, and I move to table the Inhofe amendment and ask for the yeas and nays.
