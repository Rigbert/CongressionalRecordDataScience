 Coal miners have to pay 8 percent for underground mining and 12\1/2\ percent for surface mining where hard rock pays none.  I would think the Senators from States who have coal miners who are paying 8 percent would be rushing to the floor and saying: Where is the fairness here where you can mine hard rock for gold and pay not one dime back to the taxpayers for the use of that public land and for what you have extracted from that public land, and yet coal is 12\1/2\ percent?
