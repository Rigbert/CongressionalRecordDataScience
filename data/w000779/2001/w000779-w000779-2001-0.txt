President, I rise to engage the distinguished chairman of the Commerce Committee in a colloquy on very important legislation he has sponsored--the Port and Maritime Security Act of 2001. This legislation, which I am pleased to have cosponsored, would establish new Federal safeguards for the security of our ports and maritime commerce. I would appreciate the chairman clarifying whether the intent of this legislation is to cover not only the security of ports but also inland waterways such as the Columbia-Snake River system. This is an important issue for the Pacific Northwest region because dams on the Columbia and Snake Rivers are not only critical for maritime transportation in our region but also a major source of our region's energy. Barges pass through the locks on these dams every day carrying gasoline and other explosive cargoes that could disrupt our waterways or energy production and even put residents downstream at risk of flooding if these cargoes exploded while in transit through one of the navigation locks. So I would ask my Chairman whether the authority provided to the Coast Guard and S. 1214 includes evaluating not just security for ports but also inland waterways like the Columbia/Snake River system?
