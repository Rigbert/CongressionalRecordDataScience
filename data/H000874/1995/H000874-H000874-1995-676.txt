Speaker, I rise today in support of H.R. 2058. I want to commend the efforts of my good friends Ms. Pelosi and Mr. Wolf against the human rights atrocities in China.  Mr. Speaker, the United States has granted MFN renewal to China annually since 1980. Since the massacre in Tiananmen Square in 1989, we have been extremely focused on China's human rights performance. There are some Members who de-link international trade and human rights and believe that the infusion of Western business practices and ideas will lead to greater freedom in China.  Mr. Speaker, it has been 6 years since the Chinese regime directed the brutal massacre of pro-democracy protesters in Tiananmen Square. There has been little change, at best, in the dismal human rights record of the Chinese government.  There still has not been a full accounting for the victims of the 1989 crackdown. And, furthermore, just 2 months ago, scores of well-known activists and intellectuals were rounded up and arrested for filing open petitions to the government urging a complete list of those who died.  Over the past 2 years this Congress has been, in my opinion, lenient towards the continued denials of freedom of expression, association, and religion in China.  Clearly, the time has come to send a clear and strong message to President Zemin and the National People's Congress that the United States will no longer stand idly by as products are made by slave labor for export, dissidents are permanently exiled, and torture and denial of medical care continues in Chinese prisons and labor camps.  The bill before us clearly states the Congress' outrage at China's violation of international nonproliferation standards. It also calls upon China to respect and uphold the U.N. Charter and universal declaration of human rights.  Despite previous concessions and promises made by the Chinese regime on human rights, the State Department recently reported that there continues to be widespread and well-documented human rights abuses in China.  Mr. Speaker, let me be clear * * * I agree that we must engage the Chinese. I recognize the over $9 billion of exports to China last year and the thousands of American jobs associated with those products and services.  However, we should not help underwrite the totalitarian regime in China any longer. This MFN debate is very different than others in the past.  This is a hallmark moment in United States-Sino relations. The post-Deng Xiaoping transition period approaches. With the fall of the Soviet Union, the Korean peninsula has become the most dangerous place on the planet.  As we have learned in country after country in Europe, the United States develops its strongest alliances and ensures its lasting security when we stand firmly and unequivocally for the principles upon which our own Nation was founded.  Mr. Speaker, whether we like it or not, the fact is that MFN is the only bargaining power we have with the Chinese each year. Our continued policy of unconditional engagement and economic stimulus to encourage human rights and nuclear nonproliferation is a failed policy.  H.R. 2058 directs the President to undertake intensified diplomatic initiatives to persuade the Chinese Government to, among other things, adhere to prevailing international standards regarding nonproliferation of weapons and respect the internationally recognized human rights of its citizens.  These initiatives will be carried out in our bilateral relations with China, and through the United Nations, the World Bank, and the WTO.  This bill requires the administration to report every 6 months on the progress of these initiatives and the Chinese Government's willingness to bring about reform.  Essentially, this bill will not allow the administration to walk away from the reality of the human rights abuses or nuclear proliferation.  It will also require the Chinese to make real reforms now, rather than empty and worthless concessions days before MFN renewal each year.  Mr. Speaker, there is a general consensus in the Congress that the best China policy is one that advocates a prosperous, strong, and democratic China. This bill is a compromise which makes great strides toward effectively pressuring the Chinese to make needed reforms, while not denying MFN status to China at this time. For that reason, I will support this bill. Thank you.                          ____________________
