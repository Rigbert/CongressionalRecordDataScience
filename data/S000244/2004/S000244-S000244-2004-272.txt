Speaker, I rise in support of S. 15, the ``Project BioShield Act of 2004.'' This important legislation will help us to be better prepared against bioterrorism and other forms of terrorism. I just want to briefly note the jurisdictional interest of the Committee on the Judiciary in the Federal Tort Claims Act provision contained in the new Sec. 319F-1(d)(2) which is contained in 2(a) of the bill. I support the inclusion of this provision. However, I want to note that by allowing this provision to be included in the bill, the Committee on the Judiciary does not waive its jurisdiction over the provision. With that, I urge my colleagues to support the bill.
