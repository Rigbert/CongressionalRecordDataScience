Chairman, is quite simply un-American. It is alien to who we are as a people. And where others may seek to rationalize its use, we must not. We must make clear to those who are watching, both friends and foe, that we do not tolerate the behavior that took place, that we will hold accountable all those who are responsible. And that it is not now, nor will it be, the policy of this great and good Nation to sanction the use of torture.  Mr. Chairman, today through language that was included in the fiscal 2005 defense appropriation act for which, again, I thank the chairman and ranking member, we again take an essential step by reaffirming that torture is, in fact, illegal under American and international law, that it is not consistent with American values, and that it is not a policy accepted by the United States of America.
