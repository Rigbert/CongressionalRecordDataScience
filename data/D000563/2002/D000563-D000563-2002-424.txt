Is this really equal justice under the law, that we have a slot machine culture when it comes to voting? If you happen to be in the right jurisdiction with the right machine, we will correct your mistakes; but if you happen to be one of those poor people with a 40-year-old punchcard system, good luck. If your vote doesn't count, try it again in 2 or 4 years from now.  Mr. McCONNELL. One short answer to the Senator's concern is that of these millions of people who voted on punchcards, almost nobody complained except in Florida. Nobody demanded a recount. Nobody went to court. The practical effect of what the Senator is suggesting here is that we mandate a certain kind of punchcard voting system. It seems to me that clearly wrecks the fundamental concept of the bill.
