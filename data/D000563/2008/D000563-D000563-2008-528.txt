President, let me say that at this moment we are on Thursday of this workweek with the possibility and likelihood of a cloture vote tomorrow morning in the Senate. If one looks at the business of the Senate this week, it is a good thing we are not being paid for piecework because we have done so little.  We had an initial motion to go to this climate security bill, which is an important piece of legislation. That was considered early in the week, and then a second measure, which was very brief, on adopting a budget--an important document but one that had already been debated at length many times in this Chamber. We burned 30 hours off the clock in what was requested for a general debate. That, of course, took place, and it was a good debate: a bipartisan effort to explain an important bill involving global warming and carbon pollution which is changing the world we live in.  Then a request was made yesterday by the Republican leader that this bill, the Climate Security Act, be read in its entirety into the Record. So for 8 hours, our staff had to stand and read every word of this bill into the Record. This bill--the substitute--had been available for days and the concepts behind it for weeks. There was no element of surprise, no necessity for this reading, other than to burn off an entire day in the Senate where little or nothing was accomplished. Now we face virtually the same thing again.  Although 89 percent of the people in America say that global warming is an important issue that should be addressed by the Senate, this week there have been repeated efforts to make sure we never reach that point. Those who oppose this bill should stand and vote accordingly. Those who have amendments should bring them forward. We are still waiting for a list of amendments to the global warming bill from the Republican side. We have given them a list of our amendments, including a bipartisan amendment offered by Senator Lugar, who just spoke on the floor, and Senator Biden. We have tried to engage the minority in a debate on this critically important bill, but instead, they have engaged in delay tactics, including 8 hours wasted in the Senate yesterday reading this bill in its entirety.  We finally adjourned at about 12:15 a.m. this morning to return today. I guess it is the intention of the Republicans to stop us from considering the global warming issue, but that will not stop the dangers being created by global warming in the United States and around the world. If we are truly elected to lead, I cannot understand why the Republican minority will not engage us in a meaningful and honest debate about this bill. That is why we are here. We should be voting on amendments, testing different theories and policies to see what the majority feels in the Senate, but instead, we are caught up in this exercise: 8 hours of reading this bill--a tremendous waste of time and energy that the Senate should have put to more productive purposes.  I yield the floor.                          ____________________
