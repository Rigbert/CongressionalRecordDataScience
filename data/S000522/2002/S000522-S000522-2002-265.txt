Mr. Speaker, I rise today to honor Monsignor Leonard Toomey, who has been named the Grand Marshal of this year's City of Trenton's St. Patrick's Day Parade. Just a few days after he leads the annual parade through historic Trenton, Msg. Toomey will celebrate the 54th anniversary of his ordination as a priest, which occurred on March 13, 1948.  Technically, Monsignor Toomey is ``retired.'' Yet he is more active in his community than people half his age. He serves as an assistant pastor at several Diocesan Parishes, and devotes many of his homilies to the children he loves so much.  Perhaps best known for his 26 years as pastor of Sacred Heart Church on South Broad Street, Trenton--the oldest Catholic Parish in the state of New Jersey--Monsignor Toomey was a pillar of the community during one of the city's most turbulent time periods of the late 1960s.  While at Sacred Heart, he worked to make sure the Church's external image was restored and preserved to match its lofty lineage and legacy of service. In the mid-1970s, he launched a successful campaign to restore all of the parish's buildings and grounds.  His service to the Church, to the city of Trenton, and surrounding areas has been so effective on many fronts. In addition to serving as pastor at several churches, Monsignor Toomey founded the Children's Youth Organization Day Camp so area children had a safe and fun place to go during the summer.  He also brought God's guidance to the brave men and women of the Trenton Fire Department, as well as to the inmates at New Jersey's State Prison in Trenton, a maximum security facility where those convicted of the state's worst crimes are housed.  Monsignor Toomey has held numerous posts throughout the Diocese and has given his time to several local boards including those for public housing projects, museums and historical societies, and St. Francis Hospital.  I always enjoy marching in Trenton's St. Patrick's Day Parade, and this year's experience will be equally meaningful for I will be marching behind a man who truly has been a bedrock of the city of Trenton for the better part of a century.  I join Monsignor's many admirers, friends, proteges and parishioners in thanking and congratulating him on another well-deserved recognition and milestone for his leadership and contributions to our community.              Celebrating 100 Years of Jarrett Stationary       Statement of the Honorable Howard Coble, February 27, 2002       Mr. Speaker, On Friday, March 1, 2002, one of the most      respected family-owned businesses in High Point, North      Carolina, will celebrate its 100th birthday. On behalf of the      citizens of the Sixth District of North Carolina, we wish to      congratulate Jarrett Stationary on its first century of      existence.       ``We don't know the exact date when Gene Jarrett started      the business, but is was in February 1902,'' David Wall, the      store's president told the High Point Enterprise. Wall, a      third-generation owner and a High Point City Councilman, told      the newspaper, ``I figured holding the celebration on March 1      would help us cover the date properly. Ever since we got to      95 years, it seems like it's taken forever to get to 100      years, so I'm both proud and relieved that this time has      finally come.''       Because small businesses are the lifeblood of our economy,      Mr. Wall, all of us are proud that Jarrett Stationary has      succeeded for 100 years. Jarrett Stationary is the 16th      oldest business entity in High Point according to the local      Chamber of Commerce. Jarrett Stationary has had a rich and      colorful history during its century in business.       There have only been three presidents during its 100-year      existence. Gene Jarrett ran the company for approximately 45      years. Thurman Wall, Jarrett's son-in-law, served as      president before his son, David assumed the role in 1981. The      company also served as a bookstore during its first 40 years      before concentrating on office supplies after World War II.       It has been at its downtown North Wrenn Street location      since 1929. Despite the glut of national office supply      chains, and that many other small businesses have abandoned      the downtown retail core, Jarrett Stationary has stayed and      thrived. The future looks equally bright for Jarrett      Stationary.       In fact, the very name of the company has come up for      discussion in the past. Though a Wall family member has run      the business longer than a Jarrett, David Wall said there was      never any real consideration to abandon the company name.      ``Both my father and I thought about all those years that the      good name of Jarrett Stationary has been built up in this      city,'' Wall told the High Point Enterprise. ``In retail      especially, if you have that, that's like money in the bank,      so why change?''       We concur that Jarrett Stationary should not change. It      should continue to serve the people of High Point the same      way it has for 100 years. On behalf of the citizens of the      Sixth District of North Carolina, we congratulate Jarrett      Stationary on its centennial celebration, and we offer our      best wishes for the future.                               ____________________
