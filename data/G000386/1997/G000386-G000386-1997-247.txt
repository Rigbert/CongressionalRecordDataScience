 President, I would like to talk about our efforts to eliminate problem disbursements at the Department of Defense [DOD].  Problem disbursements are payments that were not matched with obligations before the bills were paid.  As we have learned in recent years, the failure to follow this very elementary internal control procedure leaves the Pentagon's financial accounts vulnerable to theft and abuse.  It leads to underpayments, overpayments, erroneous payments, and even fraudulent payments.  It leads to overdisbursed accounts.  That is when payments exceed available appropriations.  When that happens, you have a violation of the Anti-Deficiency Act. That is a felony.  Right now, Mr. President, the Defense Finance and Accounting Service [DFAS] Center at Columbus, OH, has about 2,700 contracts that are overdisbursed.  Those contracts have negative cash balances of $900 million-plus.  In a nutshell, the Pentagon's financial books are in a shambles.  Mr. President, that's not the Senator from Iowa talking.  That's coming straight from the horse's mouth--the DOD inspector general [IG] and the General Accounting Office [GAO].  That's what their audit reports say. They say: DOD's books are in such a mess that they can't be audited--as required by law--the Chief Financial Officers Act of 1990.  When the auditors can't conduct an audit, they issue a ``disclamer of opinion.''  Well, guess what?  DOD gets one disclaimer after another--year after year. It's a disgrace.  One way to clean up the books is to start matching disbursements with obligations before payments are made.  This is the stuff that's taught in basic accounting course 101 in college. It's square one, I know, but it's the right place to start.  And that's what the Senate has been telling DOD to do since 1994.  For 3 years now, we have been telling DOD to get on the stick and fix the problem.  This was done with the leadership and support of my friend from Alaska Senator Stevens, and my friend from Hawaii, Senator Inouye.  I thought we were really making progress--until I saw the new GAO report.  That's a May 1997 report. It says DOD is underestimating the dollar value of problem-disbursements by at least $25 billion.  DOD says it's an $18 billion problem.  That means we're really staring at a $50 billion problem--or worse.  Why would DOD grossly underestimate the problem like this, Mr. President?  We're looking at a classic bureaucratic trick. Blowing smoke to conceal the problem: Redefining the problem to make it look smaller.  This makes the Senate think the problem is getting fixed.  They want the Senate to ease up on the pressure. That's the goal, Mr. President, reduce the pressure.  Unfortunately, with problem disbursements at the $45 to $50 billion level, we right about where we started in 1994.  So this is no time to ease up on the pressure.  The unwanted pressure is being generated by our legislative initiatives.  We have gradually turned up the pressure in three successive appropriations bills as follows:  Fiscal year 1995 act--section 8137.  Fiscal year 1996 act--section 8102.  Fiscal year 1997 act--section 8106.  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to have printed in the Record those sections of the law.  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in the Record, as follows:PUBLIC LAW 103-335--SEPT. 30, 1994                           *   *   *   *   *       Sec. 8137. (a)(1) The Secretary of Defense shall develop a      plan for establishing and implementing a requirement for      disbursing officials of the Department of Defense to match      disbursements to particular obligations before making the      disbursements. The Secretary shall transmit the plan to      Congress not later than March 1, 1995.       (2) The Inspector General of the Department of Defense      shall review the plan and submit the Inspector General's      independent assessment of the plan to the congressional      defense committees.       (b)(1) Not later than July 1, 1995, the Secretary of      Defense shall require that each disbursement by the      Department of Defense in an amount in excess of $5,000,000 be      matched to a particular obligation before the disbursement is      made.       (2) Not later than October 1, 1995, the Secretary of      Defense shall require that each disbursement by the      Department of Defense in an amount in excess of $1,000,000 be      matched to a particular obligation before the disbursement is      made.       (c) The Secretary shall ensure that a disbursement in      excess of the threshold amount applicable under subsection      (b) is not divided into multiple disbursements of less than      that amount for the purpose of avoiding the applicability of      such subsection to that disbursement.       (d) The Secretary of Defense may waive a requirement for      advance matching of a disbursement of the Department of      Defense with a particular obligation in the case of (1) a      disbursement involving deployed forces, (2) a disbursement      for an operation in a war declared by Congress or a national      emergency declared by the President or Congress, or (3) a      disbursement under any other circumstances for which the      waiver is necessary in the national security interests of the      United States, as determined by the Secretary and certified      by the Secretary to the congressional defense committees.       (e) This section shall not be construed to limit the      authority of the Secretary of Defense to require that a      disbursement not in excess of the amount applicable under      subsection (b) be matched to a particular obligation before      the disbursement is made.                                                                    ____PUBLIC LAW 104-61--DEC. 1, 1995                           *   *   *   *   *       Sec. 8102.

(b) The Secretary shall ensure that a disbursement in      excess of the threshold amount applicable under subsection      (a) is not divided into multiple disbursements of less than      that amount for the purpose of avoiding the applicability of      such subsection to that disbursement.       (c) The Secretary of Defense may waive a requirement for      advance matching of a disbursement of the Department of      Defense with a particular obligation in the case of (1) a      disbursement involving deployed forces, (2) a disbursement      for an operation in a war declared by Congress or a national      emergency declared by the President or Congress, or (3) a      disbursement under any other circumstances for which the      waiver is necessary in the national security interests of the      United States, as determined by the Secretary and certified      by the Secretary to the congressional defense committees.       (d) This section shall not be construed to limit the      authority of the Secretary of Defense to require that a      disbursement not in excess of the amount applicable under      subsection (a) be matched to a particular obligation before      the disbursement is made.                                                                    ____PUBLIC LAW 104-208--SEPT. 30, 1996                           *   *   *   *   *       Sec. 8106.
