Mr. Chairman, I do not believe the gentleman's State will get any less money under what we propose. It will be at 92.6, and the problem with this amendment is that it is the Flake amendment and that is the number one problem. I will tell you very frankly, after stressing that we worked very closely with the leadership, with everybody trying to reach a solution with the amount of dollars we have and still in fact take care of those Members that believe in fact they should have a say about some monies that go into their State and where it goes. The idea that collectively you will sit down with your fellow Members and you will arrive at a decision and you have got two senators over there, you can forget it because that is not going to happen. And this is the one time Members themselves have an opportunity to make a decision for the State in their district.  California, in which I believe has 52 Congressman now, I have some areas that have never got a nickel of Federal monies because of Caltrain who spends it all in the larger populated areas. That is the unfortunate fact of life. Because the Department of Transportation is not always right on the transportation needs for individual districts, and this is the House of the people. And if I thought for one moment that any of these dollars were spent for anything other than transportation, I would be frankly against it. But every dollar being spent is for transportation. And this is the one time every 6 years that there is an opportunity to, in fact, advance for each of the Members' district, and if you do not choose to do that, that is your prerogative. But to have other Members to be deprived of that opportunity, I think, is inappropriate.                              {time}  1315  The gentleman and I have discussed this amendment for quite a while, and I can just about assure him I have committed to the donor States that we would be able to, in fact, reach that 92.6, and it will be in the final version of the bill when it goes to the President's desk.  The Acting CHAIRMAN (Mr. Hefley). The gentleman's time has expired.
