President, I rise to introduce the Fire Sprinkler Incentive Act. I am pleased to be joined by my colleague from Delaware, Senator Carper, in introducing this bipartisan bill.  In the United States, the annual cost of fires is enormous. In 2015, according to the National Fire Protection Association (NFPA), fires resulted in approximately $14 billion in direct property loss. In addition, more than 3,000 civilians were killed and more than 15,000 people were injured in fires. The NFPA also reports that a fire department responded to a structure fire every 63 seconds.  These statistics are of particular concern in Maine, which has some of the oldest housing stock in the country and which has experienced deadly apartment building fires. In 2014, an apartment fire resulted in the deaths of six people--Maine's deadliest fire in nearly four decades.  Historically, Maine has also seen commercial property damaged by fires. In fact, much of the construction in the historic areas of Portland was done following a devastating fire in 1866. This fire destroyed a third of the city, including most of Portland's commercial buildings, many of its churches, and countless homes.  The NFPA reports that when fire sprinklers are present during a large fire, they are effective 96 percent of the time, saving billions of dollars in property damage but more importantly, thousands of lives. Our bill would encourage commercial building owners to invest in fire safety upgrades. While building codes require sprinklers in new commercial buildings, a great number of structures across the U.S. were built and put in service before sprinklers were required.  Small business building owners, however, may find it difficult to fund retrofit sprinklers. To help these owners, our bill would provide two tax incentives to encourage them to make this lifesaving investment.  Currently, commercial building owners must depreciate fire sprinkler retrofits over a lengthy 39-year period. The period for residential buildings is 7\1/2\ years. This bill reclassifies fire sprinkler retrofits as 15-year depreciable property, thus allowing building owners to write off their costs more quickly. The bill also provides an option for certain small businesses to deduct the cost of the fire system upgrades immediately under Section 179 of the tax code. Together, these proposals will provide a strong incentive for building owners to install fire sprinkler systems.  This bill was originally drafted in response to the deadly nightclub fire in West Warwick, RI, in 2003, which killed a staggering 100 people. That building did not have a fire sprinkler system. Let us work together to lessen the chances of another tragedy like this one. I invite my colleagues to join Senator Carper and me in support of this bipartisan, common sense legislation.  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that a letter of support be printed in the Record.  There being no objection, the letter of support was ordered to be printed in the Record, as follows:                                         International Association                                               of Fire Chiefs,                                       Fairfax, VA, March 6, 2017.     Hon. Susan Collins,     U.S. Senate,     Washington, DC.       Dear Senator Collins: On behalf of the more than 12,000      chief fire and emergency service officers of the      International Association of Fire Chiefs (IAFC), thank you      for introducing the Fire Sprinkler Incentive Act (FSIA). The      IAFC appreciates your leadership in creating an incentive for      property owners to retrofit their properties with automatic      fire sprinkler systems. If passed, the FSIA will be an      important tool to save lives in the future.       Fires continue to be a devastating problem in Maine and      across the United States. According to the National Fire      Protection Association (NFPA), in 2015 alone, there were more      than 1.3 million fires in the United States which resulted in      nearly 3,300 civilian deaths, 15,700 civilian injuries, and      $14.3 billion in property damage. Additionally, the U.S. Fire      Administration reports that the relative risk of fire death      in Maine is 1.5 times higher than the U.S. average. Fire      sprinkler systems play a crucial role by significantly      increasing the chances of surviving a fire and reducing      property damages. The NFPA found that a fire sprinkler system      decreases the likelihood of dying in a fire by 83%, reduces      property damage by 74%, and confines a fire to its room of      origin in 95% of instances. Incentivizing fire sprinkler      systems simply makes sense from both life safety and public      policy perspectives.       Despite the clear benefits of fire sprinkler systems, the      current tax code fails to incentivize these lifesaving      systems. Your legislation would fix this oversight by      classifying fire sprinkler systems as Section 179 expenses      and allowing property owners to deduct the cost of      retrofitting their buildings. Additionally, the FSIA will      allow high-rise building owners to depreciate the costs of      these systems much faster than the current tax code allows.      The FSIA provides a real incentive for building owners to      protect not only their properties but the lives of those      people inside them.       Thank you again for your strong support for the fire and      emergency service. The IAFC looks forward to continuing to      work with you to protect communities across Maine and the      entire United States.           Sincerely,                                      Fire Chief John D. Sinclair,                              President and Chairman of the Board.                                 ______                                       By
