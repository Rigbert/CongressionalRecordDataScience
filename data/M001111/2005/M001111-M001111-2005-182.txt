 President, I thank the chairman of the subcommittee and urge all of our colleagues to bring their amendments to the floor. As I stated last night, the chairman of the subcommittee was in a good mood. We had a great baseball game last night, from his viewpoint, for all of us who stayed up to watch the final home run. I think he is amenable to talking to anyone who would like to bring their amendments today. I would suggest our colleagues get that done. I think we all want to finish this bill, most importantly because we need to go to conference on this bill. We are again operating under a continuing resolution. There are many serious issues affecting our investment in housing, our investment in the FAA, in transportation, highways, as well as many other issues that are within this bill. We have a lot of work ahead of us in terms of getting this to conference and working out our differences with the House.  I urge my colleagues to bring their amendments to the floor. We are going to be talking about a time agreement fairly soon. If Members want their issues addressed, they need to bring them to the floor.  I yield the floor and suggest the absence of a quorum.
