 The authors regard an eventual drop in consumption as a forgone conclusion of tax relief and equate it with the necessity to pay back what had been borrowed over the previous decade. At the very least, the study says: ``The economy suffers a lot of short-term pain.''  Congress needs to act to extend or make permanent tax relief enacted in 2001 and 2003 or we risk plunging the country into a frivolous recession. I say frivolous because the recession will be the result of vanity on the part of those who use balancing the budget as a cover for tax-and-spend politics.  More cause for concern of the impact of tax increases comes to us from China. I am sure everyone is aware that the Shanghai Composite Index lost 8.8 percent of its value this past Tuesday. According to various news reports, including a dispatch from the Associated Press, a factor in the drop may have been rumors that a capital gains tax on stock investment was in order.  I ask unanimous consent that an ABC NEWS article entitled ``Shanghai Shares Rebound Nearly 4 percent'' be printed in the Record.  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in the Record, as follows:                Shanghai Shares Rebound Nearly 4 Percent                         (By Elaine Kurtenbach)       Shanghai, China.--Chinese stocks recovered Wednesday      following their worst plunge in a decade as regulators      shifted into damage control, denying rumors of plans for a 20      percent capital gains tax on stock investments.       The Shanghai Composite Index gained 3.9 percent to 2,881.07      after opening 1.3 percent lower. On Tuesday, it tumbled 8.8      percent, its largest decline since Feb. 18, 1997.       Bullish comments in the state-controlled media appeared to      reassure jittery domestic investors, who account for      virtually all trading.       China will focus on ensuring financial stability and      security, the official Xinhua News Agency cited Premier Wen      Jiabao as saying in an essay due to be published in      Thursday's issue of the Communist Party magazine Qiushi.       Markets across Asia were still rattled, with many falling      for a second day. Japan's benchmark Nikkei Index sank 2.85      percent, while stocks in the Philippines tumbled 7.9 percent.      Malaysian shares fell 3.3 percent, while Hong Kong's market      fell 2.5 percent.       On Tuesday, concerns about possible slowdowns in the      Chinese and U.S. economies sparked Wall Street's worst drop      since the Sept. 11, 2001, terror attacks. The Dow Jones      industrial average lost 416 points, or 3.3 percent.       Analysts said they expected China's stock market to      stabilize and keep climbing over time although further near-     term declines were possible given concerns that prices may      have risen too precipitously in recent months.       Tuesday's ``sell-off does not reflect any fundamental      change in the outlook for China's economy,'' Yiping Huang and      other Citigroup economists said in a report released      Wednesday. ``A sharp contraction in excess liquidity that      would reinforce damage in the stock market remains      unlikely,'' it said.       China's big institutional investors are all state-     controlled and would be unlikely to sell so heavily as to      completely reverse gains that more than doubled share prices      last year. With a key Communist Party congress due in the      autumn, the authorities have a huge stake in keeping the      markets on an even keel.       ``They are acting now to nip a nascent bubble in the bud,''      says Stephen Green, senior economist at Standard Chartered      Bank in Shanghai, adding that it's a challenge given      generally bullish sentiment and the massive amount of funds      available for investment.       ``So they have to somehow calibrate the rhetoric and policy      actions to keep a lid on this, while not triggering a      collapse,'' Green says.       One option is a capital gains tax on stock investments.      Rumors that such a tax may be enacted are thought to have      been one factor behind Tuesday's sell-off.       But the Shanghai Securities News ran a front-page report      denying those rumors. The newspaper, run by the official      Xinhua News Agency and often used to convey official      announcements, cited unnamed spokesmen for the Ministry of      Finance and State Administration of Taxation.       China has refrained from imposing a tax on capital gains      from stock investments, largely because until last year the      markets were languishing near five-year lows. The Shanghai      Securities News report cited officials saying that the      government had little need to impose such a measure now,      given that tax revenues soared by 22 percent last year.       The exact cause of Tuesday's decline in China was unclear,      given the lack of any significant negative economic or      corporate news.       Some analysts blamed profit taking following recent gains:      the market had hit a fresh record high on Monday, with the      Shanghai Composite Index closing above 3,000 for the first      time.       Others pointed to comments by former Federal Reserve      Chairman Alan Greenspan, who warned in remarks to a      conference in Hong Kong that a recession in the U.S. was      ``possible'' later this year.       Adding to those factors was a persisting expectation that      China might impose further austerity measures, such as an      interest rate hike, to cool torrid growth: China's economy      grew 10.7 percent last year the fastest rise since 1995 and      most forecasts put growth at between 9.5 percent and 10      percent this year.       China's markets took off after a successful round of      shareholding reforms helped alleviate worries over a possible      flood of state-held shares into the market. Efforts to clean      up the brokerage industry and end market abuses also helped.       Their confidence renewed, millions of retail investors      began shifting their bank savings into the markets in search      of higher returns last year. Strong buying by state-     controlled institutional investors and overseas funds also      helped.       China still limits foreigners' purchases of the yuan-     denominated stocks that make up the biggest share of the      markets, though that is gradually changing as regulators      allow increasing participation by so-called qualified foreign      institutional investors.       Stocks have shown unusual volatility this year, with the      Shanghai index notching one-day drops of 4.9 percent and 3.7      percent already this year before recovering to hit new      records.       But there are limits to how far shares are allowed to drop      in a single trading day: total single-day gains and losses      are capped at 10 percent.
