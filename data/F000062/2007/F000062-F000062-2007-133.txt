 President, I rise to support the reauthorization of the State Children's Health Insurance Program. It is critically important that we continue and improve upon this successful effort that has made a difference in the lives of so many children.  I would like to thank my colleagues, Senator Baucus, Senator Rockefeller, Senator Grassley and Senator Hatch, as well as their staffs, for the countless hours they have spent in order to bring this bipartisan compromise before us today.  Like all compromises, the bill is not perfect. I, along with several of my colleagues, voted for a budget resolution that included an additional $50 billion for the reauthorization of the Children's Health Insurance Program. I understand that fiscal constraints make it difficult to fund a sum of that magnitude. But at the same time, no dollar spent to insure a child is wasted.                         History of the Program  I am proud to have supported this program since its inception in 1997. At that time, there were too many working families who played by the rules and could not afford health insurance for their children. They had just a little too much to qualify for Medicaid or other Government programs, but not enough income to be able to afford the premiums that private insurance requires.  So a Republican Congress and a Democratic President came together to create the Children's Health Insurance Program, which has enjoyed a decade of broad bipartisan support.  The success has been clear. Twenty-one percent of the children in California were uninsured when the Children's Health Insurance Program launched. Six years later, in 2005, that rate had fallen to 14 percent, despite economic downturns, which commonly lead to increases in the number of uninsured.  It is now time for a Republican President and a Democratic Congress to come to together to allow this program to continue to fulfill its promise.                         Summary of Legislation  The bill we are considering today will allow this program's success to continue and make significant improvements. This legislation would:  Invest $35 billion to provide health insurance coverage to 3.2 million children who are currently uninsured. This will keep the 6.6 million children already enrolled in the program from losing coverage.  Give States the tools they need to find and enroll these uninsured children. Six million of the nine million uninsured children in the United States today are eligible for Medicaid, or they are eligible for the Children's Health Insurance Program. These families deserve to know they are eligible for coverage, and they ought to receive it without unnecessary bureaucracy and additional paperwork.                          Tobacco Tax Increase  These improvements are funded with an increase in the Federal tobacco tax, to $1 per package of cigarettes. Not only will this increase fund needed health insurance for children, it will create significant health improvements.  We must be very clear about the serious implications of tobacco use. It has to be understood that:  Tobacco is linked to at least 10 different kinds of cancer.  Tobacco use accounts for about 30 percent of all cancer deaths.  Tobacco use remains the top cause of preventable death in the United States.  According to the Campaign for Tobacco Free Kids, this tax will prevent an additional 1,873,000 children alivetoday from ever becoming smokers. And this prevents them from becoming cancer victims later in life. Of this I am certain.  During my time in the Senate, I have worked to make the eradication of cancer a top priority. I strongly believe that we can eliminate the death and suffering caused by cancer in my lifetime. I have worked with the American Cancer Society, and the National Cancer Institute. I have spoken to leading cancer researchers, and patients and their families.  And over and over again, I have heard that tobacco is a leading cause of cancer.  There is much about cancer that we still do not understand and that we cannot control. But the relationship between tobacco and cancer could not be clearer.  The one thing we can do, immediately, to stop cancer deaths, is to reduce tobacco use. This legislation takes a step in that direction, while providing health coverage for children in the process.              Importance of health insurance for children  We know that when it comes to children, health insurance matters. It can determine whether a child receives appropriate treatment, and even if he lives or dies. According to a Families USA study conducted this year,  An uninsured child admitted to the hospital as the result of an injury is twice as likely to die during his or her hospital stay than a child with insurance.  Uninsured children admitted to the hospital with middle ear infections are less than half as likely to get ear tubes inserted than children with insurance.  These are not rare occurrences. As any parent will attest, children get into plenty of accidents, and children get lots of ear infections. No child should suffer a worse outcome because her parents could not afford health insurance.                   CHIP is not Government Health Care  Frankly, I am quite surprised that the Senate is not unanimously endorsing the compromise we have before us today. I was stunned when President Bush indicated he would veto it.  Unfortunately, some are attempting to use this debate to score political points, and in the process, are portraying the Children's Health Insurance Program in an unfair light.  Let us be clear. The Children's Health Insurance Program is not Government-run health care. Doctors, nurses and parents still make medical decisions. And in California, our Healthy Families program relies on commercial managed care plans.  California offers 24 health plans, 6 dental plans, and 3 vision plans.  In fact, 99.72 percent of Californians in Healthy Families have a choice between two health plans.  In four of our largest counties, families can choose between as many as seven plans.  Twenty-four different health plans in one State. That is certainly not a form of ``socialized medicine.'' Many employers providing private insurance cannot afford to give their workers more than one choice.  This legislation remains targeted at the children and families most in need of assistance. I am from San Francisco, one of the most expensive cities in one of the most expensive States in the Nation. No one will deny that it costs more to live in San Francisco than just about any other place in the country. You spend more on groceries, more on housing, more on transportation, and not surprisingly, more on health care. The California Association of Realtors estimates that in order to purchase the average entry level home in California, a family must have a household income of over $96,000 per year.  Yet, with the exception of Alaska and Hawaii, we have a uniform Federal poverty level, which is $20,650 for a family of four. President Bush insists that no family above twice this poverty level, or $41,300, could possibly need additional help to afford health insurance. I strongly disagree.  I would like to challenge anyone to support two children on $41,300 annual income in California, and find the $11,480 necessary to purchase the average family insurance policy. It is nearly impossible. This is precisely why we created the Children's Health Insurance Program 10 years ago, to prevent hard-working families from falling through the cracks.  This legislation maintains the State flexibility necessary to do just that.                           California Stories  As a mother and grandmother, I know that there are few things worse than having a sick child. I cannot imagine the dilemma of a mother or father who knows that their child needs medical attention, but must also consider whether that treatment will have a catastrophic impact on their family's finances.  The Herman family from Sonoma County, CA, found themselves in this situation, twice in 1 month. Daughter Amber Herman fell and hurt her arm. Three-year-old Jacob shoved a rock in his ear during a family camping trip. Parents Penny and Peter Herman are self-employed small business owners, unable to afford private insurance.  The Hermans faced a $5000 out-of-pocket medical bill for their care. And Penny was pregnant with the couple's third child, Abraham. The family learned they were eligible for Healthy Families, and enrolled in the program. Penny received coverage for her pregnancy from Medi-Cal. All three children now have comprehensive health care coverage.  The Nunez family in Solano County, California never worried about health insurance; they were always covered under their father Pablo's union health plan. Pablo started his own business and he, wife Sandra, and their four children lost their coverage. Through outreach efforts, the family learned a few months later that their kids might qualify for coverage. They did, and all four Nunez children were enrolled in Healthy Families before they had a health care emergency.  These stories show that a robust Children's Health Insurance Program, coupled with good information and a straightforward enrollment process, makes a real difference in the lives of countless families.                               Conclusion  Without action, these children and many others will risk losing this insurance coverage. It is my hope that the President will reconsider his ill-advised veto threat and sign this bipartisan legislation into law. While the President may want to advance his own health care reform ideas, it is not fair to hold millions of uninsured children hostage in the process. I welcome a wide-ranging debate on how to reform our health care system, after this bill is signed and the State Children's Health Insurance Program is protected.  This is a successful bipartisan program. It must be reauthorized, and the American people must make it clear to President Bush that they will accept no less.  I urge my colleagues to join me in supporting this important legislation.
