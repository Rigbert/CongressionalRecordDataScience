 The Conference Report on H.R. 3295 contains a new requirement that voters in Federal elections have the opportunity to cast a provisional ballot in cases where that person's name does not appear on the list of eligible voters at a polling site and the voter declares that he or she is properly registered to vote at that polling site. I would like to ask the senior Senator from Missouri about the provisional ballot requirement.  Am I correct that this legislation does not require a State or locality to count a provisional ballot cast by an individual who is not properly registered in the jurisdiction where the individual attempts to vote? And furthermore, this legislation does not require a State or locality to permit a voter who is not registered in a jurisdiction to vote from that jurisdiction?  And am I also correct that a provisional ballot will be provided to a voter if a poll worker or other individual, pursuant to State law, challenges a voter's eligibility to cast a ballot?
