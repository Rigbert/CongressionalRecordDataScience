 President, I rise to introduce legislation that enhances the innocent spouse equitable relief provision of the Internal Revenue Code. Through only minor legislative modifications, this bill clarifies the statute's original intent, affording innocent spouses the necessary recourse to ensure their cases and circumstances are given a fair hearing.  According to section 6015(f) of the Internal Revenue Code, the IRS may relieve an innocent spouse of liability for unpaid taxes generated through the filing of a joint tax return if ``taking into account all the facts and circumstances'' it would be inequitable to hold the spouse responsible.  Little recourse exists, however, to prevent the IRS from seizing assets or garnishing wages if a petition for innocent spouse equitable relief is not approved.  Recent decisions of the Eighth and Ninth Circuit Courts of Appeals have denied the Tax Court jurisdiction over petitions for equitable relief under the Innocent Spouse Statute. Consequently, there is no mechanism for review or appeal of these IRS decisions.  The story of one of my constituents provides a stunning example of the problem.  The IRS seized all of her husband's income to pay a tax liability incurred 20 years earlier, before they were married. Because the IRS seized the entirety of the income, the taxes on the income remained unpaid.  When her husband died, the IRS pursued the innocent spouse for the taxeson her husband's income. She was forced to sell her family home and all property owned jointly with her husband. My constituent is employed, but due to financial hardship she must live with friends. Even so, the IRS may have her wages garnished along with funds set aside for her in trust by a probate court.  Because the Tax Court does not have jurisdiction to review claims for innocent spouse equitable relief, my constituent can do little to prevent the IRS from seizing what remains.  The aim of this legislation is to provide an avenue through which innocent spouse equitable relief decisions may be appealed, if originally denied by the IRS.  This bill: expressly provides that the Tax Court has jurisdiction to review the denial of equitable innocent spouse relief under Internal Revenue Code section 6015(f); and suspends IRS collection activity while a request for relief under Internal Revenue Code section 6015(f) is pending.  I believe that my proposal would provide a straightforward and uncontroversial solution to the unfair treatment of innocent spouses under current law. Moreover, without this bill, an increasing number of innocent spouse equitable relief appeals will remain in limbo--pending, with no method for consideration.  When this body enhanced innocent spouse protections--through passage of the 1998 Internal Revenue Service Restructuring and Reform Act--the goal was to modernize, simplify, and streamline the cumbersome process of seeking relief from liabilities of tax, interest, and related penalties.  Unfortunately, the conference report on the 1998 act included vague language, which ultimately has left innocent spouses with no avenue for appeal.  It is worth noting that the IRS grants fewer than three in 10 requests for innocent spouse relief. This bill in no way guarantees relief, but rather fixes the broken appeals process for these IRS decisions.  I urge my colleagues to support this small change that will have a profound effect on the lives of many innocent spouses--mostly women--who deserve their day in court.  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be printed in the Record.  There being no objection, the text of the bill was ordered to be printed in the Record, as follows:                                 S. 3523       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of      the United States of America in Congress assembled,     SECTION 1.
