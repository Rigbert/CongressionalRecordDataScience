 President, I am offering this amendment to speed up adjudication, by the appeals board of the Department of Health and Human Services, of appeals from nursing facilities of civil monetary penalties levied by the Health Care Financing Administration (HCFA) for violations of standards established pursuant to the Nursing Home Reform Act of 1987. Currently, there is a substantial backlog of some 701 such cases. Delay in final adjudication of such cases subverts the purpose and effect of civil monetary penalties, delaying corrective action, and improvements in the quality of care offered by nursing facilities. Delays in adjudication of these cases also burdens nursing facilities through additional legal fees and the perpetuation of uncertainty caused by unresolved disputes.  The number of such cases filed each year by nursing facilities has increased each year since 1995, the year when regulations for the Nursing Home Reform Act's enforcement standards went into effect. Currently, as I noted earlier in my statement, there are 701 such cases pending.  Mr. President, the steady increase in appeals of civil monetary penalties since 1995 shows the effect of increased use, by the States and HCFA, of the enforcement regulations which went into effect in 1995. Nevertheless, in hearings I held in the Special Committee on Aging last July, the General Accounting Office reported that nursing facilities providing poor quality of care regularly escaped sanctions which could cause care to be improved. The pattern seemed to be that a facility would be sanctioned for poor quality of care, be required to attest in writing through a plan of correction that steps had been taken to improve care, and then be found deficient on the next visit from State officials. This pattern often continued for long periods of time. And when sanctions such as civil monetary penalties were levied by HCFA, the sanctioned facilities would appeal, causing lengthy delays in final resolution of the case.  One week before my July hearings, President Clinton launched a variety of new initiatives designed to improve the quality of care in nursing facilities. Among those new initiatives was one designed to eliminate paper compliance with quality standards and to proceed more quickly to sanctions for those homes with a history of poor care.  The upshot of oversight by the Special Committee on Aging and the Presidential initiatives is that there has been a substantial increase thus far in 1999 of appeals of civil monetary penalties by nursing facilities.  Certainly, facilities have the right to appeal sanctions levied by HCFA. But it is also important that appeals be heard and resolved in a reasonable amount of time. Delay subverts improvement in the quality of care in nursing facilities as real deficiencies go uncorrected. Delay also slows the development of precedents which would clarify outstanding issues. Slow development of such precedents encourages facilities and their legal representatives to file appeals because guidance as to the worthiness of an appeal is lacking. And, as the body of precedents becomes more complete, adjudication of cases becomes speedier.  The root problem has been that the departmental appeals board does not have sufficient resources to keep up with the increase in new cases, to say nothing of working off the current backlog of cases. I am given to understand that, at the present time about 25 new cases are filed with the appeals board each week. As will be clear from the table I am attaching to my statement, the number of cases decided each year has averaged around 23 for the last 3 years. Clearly, the board is swamped and needs help.  The President's budget for fiscal year 2000 proposes $2.8 million for the board. Were the Congress to provide those funds, it will certainly take time for the appeals board to gear up and begin to speed up adjudication of appeals.We can't wait to begin addressing this problem, Mr. President. The amendment I offer would provide $1.4 million to be made available through the supplemental appropriation we are now considering. I have not proposed to provide the full $2.8 million the President's budget proposes for the next fiscal year because the appeals board could not effectively spend that amount in what remains of the fiscal year. Therefore, I have essentially prorated that amount over the time remaining in this fiscal year.                            amendment no. 84       At the appropriate place in the bill, insert:       Sec.   . Title 49 Recodification Correction.--Effective      December 31, 1998, section 4(k) of the Act of July 5, 1994      (Public Law 103-272, 108 Stat. 1370), as amended by section      7(a)(3)(D) of the Act of October 31, 1994 (Public Law 103-     429, 108 Stat. 4329), is repealed.                            amendment no. 85               (Purpose: To make a technical correction)       On page 16, strike beginning with line 12 through page 23,      line 8, and insert the following:       Emergency Steel Loan Guarantee Program. (a) Short Title.--     This section may be cited as the ``Emergency Steel Loan      Guarantee Act of 1999''.       (b) Congressional Findings.--Congress finds that--       (1) the United States steel industry has been severely      harmed by a record surge of more than 40,000,000 tons of      steel imports into the United States in 1998, caused by the      world financial crisis;       (2) this surge in imports resulted in the loss of more than      10,000 steel worker jobs in 1998, and was the imminent cause      of 3 bankruptcies by medium-sized steel companies, Acme      Steel, Laclede Steel, and Geneva Steel;       (3) the crisis also forced almost all United States steel      companies into--       (A) reduced volume, lower prices, and financial losses; and       (B) an inability to obtain credit for continued operations      and reinvestment in facilities;       (4) the crisis also has affected the willingness of private      banks and investment institutions to make loans to the U.S.      steel industry for continued operation and reinvestment in      facilities;       (5) these steel bankruptcies, job losses, and financial      losses are also having serious negative effects on the tax      base of cities, counties, and States, and on the essential      health, education, and municipal services that these      government entities provide to their citizens; and       (6) a strong steel industry is necessary to the adequate      defense preparedness of the United States in order to have      sufficient steel available to build the ships, tanks, planes,      and armaments necessary for the national defense.       (c) Definitions.--For purposes of this section--       (1) the term ``Board'' means the Loan Guarantee Board      established under subsection (e);       (2) the term ``Program'' means the Emergency Steel      Guaranteed Loan Program established under subsection (d); and       (3) the term ``qualified steel company'' means any company      that--       (A) is incorporated under the laws of any State;       (B) is engaged in the production and manufacture of a      product defined by the American Iron and Steel Institute as a      basic steel mill product, including ingots, slab and billets,      plates, flat-rolled steel, sections and structural products,      bars, rail type products, pipe and tube, and wire rod; and       (C) has experienced layoffs, production losses, or      financial losses since the beginning of the steel import      crisis, after January 1, 1998.
