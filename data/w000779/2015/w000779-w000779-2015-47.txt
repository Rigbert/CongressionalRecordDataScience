President, I would like to inform my colleague, the distinguished chairman of our Intelligence Committee, I am always thinking about the history of the committee. I believe Chairman Burr, the ranking minority member Senator Feinstein, and I have been on the Intelligence Committee almost as long as anybody in history.  I always like to work with my colleague. This is an area where we have a difference of opinion. I am going to try to outline what that is and still try to describe how we might be able to work it out.
