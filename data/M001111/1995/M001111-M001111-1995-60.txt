 President, the Harkin amendment to remove fraud and abuse from Medicare is a giant step in the right direction--saving taxpayer money, urging us toward a balanced budget, and striving for greater efficiency.  However, the amendment is based on a concept both necessary and controversial. This amendment would require competitive bidding for Medicare part B items and services.  I have heard from owners of numerous medical supply businesses in my State who tell me they will be driven out of business by this amendment provision. They tell me services will be cut to rural areas. They tell me services involved with setting up and instructing about medical equipment is essential for patients, and will be threatened under this amendment.  Senator Harkin has made changes to his amendment language, to maintain access to services for rural and underserved areas. He has made changes to assure quality assurance standards, so that large companies are not able to undercut their competition simply by providing shoddy supplies and equipment.  He points out the large difference between prices for supplies at Veterans Administration hospitals--which have competitive bidding--and prices from providers under Medicare part B. He makes a good case for solving some of our Medicare cost problems with a clear goal to find efficiency through competitive bidding, rather than just a budget decision.  In light of these changes, I will vote for the amendment, but I want to be sure that we are doing everything we can to make this transition survivable for small business.
