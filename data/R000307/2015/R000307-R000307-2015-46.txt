President, this amendment would repeal ObamaCare's medicine cabinet tax. The health care law now prohibits individuals from using funds in their medical savings accounts, such as an FSA or an HSA, to purchase over-the-counter medications without a prescription. Fifty million Americans participate in FSAs and other health savings accounts. These accounts allow individuals to set aside their own money each year on a pretax basis to pay for health care expenses such as copayments and prescriptions, or over-the-counter medications.  Rather than promoting cost effectiveness and accessibility, this provision instead directs participants to potentially more costly, less convenient, more time-consuming alternatives. Further, it injects unnecessary confusion and complexity into a system that was previously straightforward and easy for consumers to utilize. This provision of ObamaCare restricts Americans' choice and flexibility in how they manage their health care expenses and adds yet another burden on our physicians. It should be repealed. Folks should be allowed to spend the funds in these accounts as they see fit.  I hope for support for these two amendments when we begin the proceedings.  I yield the floor.
