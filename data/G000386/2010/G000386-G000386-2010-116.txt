 I hope the Senate would give some discretion to the fact that when Senator McCaskill comes over, that she would be able to speak for 2 or 3 minutes on this issue so that people can hear from the other side of the aisle on the importance of this amendment.  We appear to have a fundamental difference regarding how independentPresidential appointees are. If I were an inspector general, I would feel more independent with a two-thirds vote of a bipartisan panel, meaning commission appointees, as opposed to one person. Our amendment assures IGs, if they are terminated, it will be in a public forum and not the back room of the White House, if they are Presidentially appointed.  I yield the floor.
