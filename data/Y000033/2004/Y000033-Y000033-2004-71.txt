Mr. Chairman, I rise in strong support of the Simmons amendment. I thank my friend from Connecticut for bringing this important amendment to the floor.  This amendment will maintain the integrity of the Coast Guard as a distinct entity within the Department of Homeland Security.  Section 888 of the Homeland Security Act states that the Coast Guard shall be maintained intact with all of the service's authorities, functions, and capabilities.  The Coast Guard has submitted a plan for its research, development, test and evaluation activities for fiscal year 2005 which will concentrate on the development of strategies and resources aimed to improve the service's ability to perform its traditional missions.  The Coast Guard's traditional missions include search and rescue, drug and migrant interdiction, marine environmental protection, ice operations and aids to navigation.  It is imperative that we maintain the Coast Guard's ability to perform these important traditional missions in addition to the service's homeland security mission.  I am concerned that the transfer of research and development funds to the Department will be the first step down a slippery slope that will forever change the Coast Guard's abilities to balance its resources and personnel to carry out its many and varied missions.  We must protect the multi-mission nature of the Coast Guard.  We should provide funding for Coast Guard research, development, test and evaluation directly to the service in the same manner that we provide all other Coast Guard funds.  This is what the law demands and this is the right thing to do.  I urge my fellow members to support the Simmons amendment.
