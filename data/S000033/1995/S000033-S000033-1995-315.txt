 It must have been a really good dinner for $50,000, but this is money that came from obviously some of the very wealthiest people in America who wanted to give the Speaker and his friends the opportunity to communicate with America, with their particular point of view. But at the same time, by accepting that money, they are in the process of trying to shut down the public broadcasting system. I suspect that that is not just a coincidence.
