Mr. Chairman, I rise in opposition to the amendment.  Mr. Chairman, I am a little confused, because we have heard a lot of debate today about the Congress forcing people to do things, and I am afraid that what this will do is put the pressure on two groups to have the vote within 90 days. To my knowledge, this never happened in any other case in the United States if there was not a majority. In fact, there have been other areas that did not have a majority, and they had to wait and wait and wait until they did it again. I am a little confused why it is necessary to do this on this bill.  It is very clear in my bill, it says you have to have a majority. The gentleman from Georgia (Mr. Barr) will offer an amendment that I will not support that wants a super majority. This says we are going to have a vote on the two top ones in 90 days.  This adds confusion to the bill and is not necessary. I reluctantly oppose the amendment. I just heard about it, and the gentleman talked to me a momentago, and I do not really know what it is going to try to accomplish, so I do oppose the amendment.
