 President, reserving the right to object, the Senate has treated President Obama very fairly with respect to his judicial nominations. By comparison, at this point in President Bush's Presidency, the Senate had confirmed 316 of his judicial nominations--316. As of now, the Senate has already confirmed 329 of President Obama's judicial nominees. In fact, the Senate has already confirmed more of President Obama's judicial nominees than it did during the entirety--the entirety--of President Bush's 8 years in office.  So at this point I am going to object to the request, but I am prepared to enter into an agreement to process a bipartisan package of four more judicial nominations that would include a California judicial nomination, two Pennsylvania judicial nominations, and a Utah judicial nomination. This would presumably be agreeable to the senior Senator from California, the junior Senator from California, and to the senior Senator from Pennsylvania, along with the junior Senator from Pennsylvania and both Utah Senators.  So I am going to ask the Senator from North Dakota to modify her request as follows: Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the Senate proceed to executive session to consider individually the following nominations, at a time to be determined by the majority leader in consultation with the Democratic leader: Calendar Nos. 364, 460, 461, and 569; that there be 30 minutes for debate only on each nomination, equally divided in the usual form; that upon the use or yielding back of time on the respective nomination, the Senate proceed to vote, without intervening action or debate, on the nomination.
