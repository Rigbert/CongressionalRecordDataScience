Speaker, until we have taken care of spending bills for the rest of government operations, we have no business taking care of ourselves. Today, along with my colleagues, Representatives Morella, Davis, and Luther, I am introducing a resolution to postpone final action on Legislative Branch appropriations for any fiscal year until all other regular appropriations for that fiscal year have been enacted into law.  The resolution adds new points of order under three House Rules. These would preclude final action on the regular Legislative Branch appropriations bill, if all other regular appropriations bills for the fiscal year have not been enacted into law. Similarly, a continuing resolution could not contain Legislative Branch appropriations unless it also included continuing appropriations for the same period for all other regular appropriations bills for the fiscal year that have not yet been enacted into law.  Basically, this means, for Legislative Branch appropriations, there could be no final action on conference reports, no motions on Senate amendments, and no action on continuing resolutions if we have not first, or concurrently, provided appropriations for the other twelve regular appropriations. This resolution would ensure that the Legislative Branch is last in line for appropriations in the future.  The concept is elementary--no dessert until we clean our plates.  Last September, Congress made the mistake of trying to fully fund the Legislative Branch bill for fiscal year 1996 before taking care of nearly every other appropriations bill. And it backfired. The Legislative Branch spending bill was vetoed the first time around--not because of its content, but because of its timing.  Even after a Legislative Branch appropriations bill was enacted, many regular appropriations bills remained in limbo. As a result, the second Government shutdown did not affect Congressional operations.  We should never again leave major portions of the Government hanging, with ourselves high and dry. We should never again play with the lives of innocent Federal employees and disrupt the operations of Government unless we are willing to risk our own time, our own staff, and our own operations. We should never again enjoy our dessert while our main course remains on the table before us.  I urge my colleagues to join me in cosponsoring this resolution to make sure that before we ever fund ourselves again, we have first met our obligation to take care of the rest of our Government operations and the public we are here to serve.                          ____________________
