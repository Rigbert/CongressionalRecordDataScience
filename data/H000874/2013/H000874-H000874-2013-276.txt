The result would be longer hours for workers with no overtime pay and only the hope that their bosses will let them take their earned time off when asked. How we have skewed the rules and play against the middle working class of America. You ought to read the book ``Who Stole the American Dream?'' by Hedrick Smith.  Workers wishing to collect their overtime pay would be forced to wait until the end of the year, essentially granting employers an interest-free loan.  Mr. Speaker, this isn't fair, it isn't right, and it isn't going to become law; and everybody on this floor knows that--everybody. All 434 of us that are here today know that this bill is not going to become law. But we're wasting our time on it. Instead of wasting time on a partisan measure that would never make it through the Senate, we ought to be working on creating jobs and restoring fiscal discipline, not a partisan rollback of workers' rights, but a bipartisan compromise to help put more Americans to work.  Again, I say, if those Republicans who were Members of this House in 2003 were still here, this bill would not be on the floor.
