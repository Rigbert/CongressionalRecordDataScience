 President, I rise today to discuss the future of the Assembled Chemical Weapons Alternative, ACWA, program, which is of vital importance to the people of Madison County, KY.  The people of Madison County are living right next door to over 500 tons of the deadliest material ever conceived by man. It is stored at the Blue Grass Army Depot, BGAD. Understandably, those in the nearby community would like to see these weapons disposed of as safely and quickly as possible. It is the mission of the ACWA program, as well as the Department of Defense, to do just that.  Recently, the program manager for ACWA, Mike Parker, decided to retire. Mike has left big shoes to fill. The question then is, who will take Mike's place? Whoever is picked to permanently fill his position will need to possess a number of qualifications. These traits include an appreciation for the unique culture at ACWA. Central to that culture is the willingness to work collaboratively and openly with the local community and with Congress. It would be unfortunate if the new program manager, whoever it may be, were to attempt to impose solutions unilaterally onto the community and to act without transparency and consultation with Congress. I also trust that the new program manager will understand the need to complete work at BGAD as soon as is safely possible; not as soon as the department finds it to be convenient.  Finally, the new program manager needs to be fully committed to chemical neutralization at BGAD as this approach has already been selected by the department, embraced by the community and endorsed by the state of Kentucky. Any variance from this path would only lead to additional delay in eliminating the risks associated with these stored weapons.  The job of disposing of chemical weapons at BGAD is not just to be laid at the feet of the program manager for ACWA. It is a mission entrusted to the Department of Defense. Accordingly, the department itself needs to provide oversight over ACWA to ensure that the new program manager is acting in a manner consistent with the way ACWA has conducted its business in the past. Those at the department also need to support the ACWA program manager's mission by providing sufficient funding in the annual budget request, in the $450-500 million range, so that the chemical weapons are disposed of in a timely fashion. In the past, the department has chosen to tie itself in bureaucratic knots over the program. Those days need to end. These chemical weapons need to be destroyed. The people of Madison County deserve no less.                          ____________________
