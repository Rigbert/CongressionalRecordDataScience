 I think his point is well taken. I might add this. He has specified various groups that have come forward with reservations about this amendment. He and I both understand that in a time of economic turmoil, economic recession, some of the most vulnerable Americans are not even represented in Washington by a special interest group. They are the working poor, getting up every morning, and going to work, 40 hours a week, struggling to get by, barely beyond the minimum wage, often husbands and wives, sometimes working two jobs, trying to make ends meet, trying to keep their families together.  That is what concerns me. They will be the first casualties in a recession. They will be the ones laid off. They will be the ones who will have to then make a decision about their lives and to get back on track. And what we are saying, I believe the Senator from Massachusetts and I agree, is that at various points in the modern history of America there have been opportunitiesfor them created through Government programs that have helped.  Oh, certainly they need their own personal responsibility, their own initiative. But the door was there for them to walk through. If that door is bolted shut with the supermajority requirement, these families, the working poor, the groups that the Senator from Massachusetts has outlined, they will be the first casualties. That is why I offered the amendment. I thank the Senator from Massachusetts for speaking on behalf of the amendment.
