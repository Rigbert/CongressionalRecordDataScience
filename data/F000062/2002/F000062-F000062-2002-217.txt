Hon. Dianne Feinstein,     Chair, Subcommittee on Technology, Terrorism and Government          Information, U.S. Senate, Washington, DC.       Dear Senator Feinstein: I write on behalf of the Nation's      largest association of international education      professionals--with more than 8,000 members nationwide,      including 992 in California--to express our strong support      for S. 1749, the Enhanced Border Security and Visa Entry      Reform Act.       We have a particular interest in those parts of the bill      that pertain to international students and scholars. We have      worked closely with your offices to ensure that the bill      includes any necessary provisions with respect to visa      screening and student tracking, while at the same time      maintaining the openness to international students and      scholars that is itself important to our Nation's security.      In our judgment, the bill strikes that crucial balance, and      we congratulate you for your work.       We look forward to early enactment of this legislation, and      we pledge our ongoing cooperation to ensure its successful      implementation.           Sincerely,                                               Marlene M. Johnson,     Executive Director and CEO.                                  ____                                 Americans for Better Borders,                                    Washington, DC, March 8, 2002.     To Members of the U.S. Senate:       We urge you to help bring S. 1749 to the floor, the      Enhanced Border Security and Visa Entry Reform Act of 2002      sponsored by Senators Kennedy, Brownback, Feinstein, and Kyl.      In December, the House passed H.R. 3525, the companion      measure, by voice vote. The Senate should quickly follow      suit.       Almost six months have passed since the September 11      terrorist attacks. Since that time we, like the rest of the      nation, have focused on how to enhance our Nation's security      through constructive changes to our immigration policies.      This legislation takes a significant step in ensuring that      our Nation's immigration policies are in line with our common      goal of effectively deterring terrorism. It includes many      long-overdue reforms that will deter terrorism by developing      layers of protection both outside and within the U.S., and      help our country increase its intelligence capacity. It      provides authorization for increased funding to support      additional personnel and technology at our border agencies,      mandates better cooperation among border agencies, and      encourages further cooperation on a North American Security      Perimeter with Canada and Mexico. The bill requires new and      advance information sharing between the privates sector and      government agencies, and enhances the use of biometrics in      our visas and passports.       While we support all of these efforts, we are aware that      this bill also poses significant challenges to the agencies      and Congress to implement new technologies and processes in      very short deadlines. Congress must allocate     adequate, ongoing resources to ensure that these deadlines      are met and new systems are property maintained and updated      into the future. Reliance on user fees will not be adequate      for this national security priority. Furthermore, if it      proves impossible to meet the deadlines in this legislation,      Congress must be willing to revisit them to ensure that the      legitimate cross-border flow of people, commerce and goods      can continue, or our economic security may be jeopardized.       Given the importance of this measure, we urge its swift      passage in the Senate and signature by the President. For our      part, we in the private sector pledge to work closely with      Congress and the agencies to ensure swift and effective      implementation of these needed reforms.

Hon. Dianne Feinstein,     Chair, Subcommittee on Technology, Terrorism and Government          Information, Senate, Washington, DC.       Dear Senator Feinstein: I write on behalf of the Alliance      for International Educational and Cultural Exchange, an      association of 65 American nongovernmental organizations that      conduct exchange programs of all types. We wish to      congratulate you and express our strong support for S. 1749,      the Enhanced Border Security and Visa Entry Reform Act.       We have worked with your staffs as the legislation has      developed, and have had opportunities for input to help      ensure that the bill strikes the right balance between our      strong national interests in increased security and in      continued openness to exchange visitors, students, and      scholars from around the world. We believe you have succeeded      in accomplishing that important goal.       We look forward to the passage of this legislation, and to      continuing to work with you to ensure that the United States      remains fully, and safely, engaged with the world.           Sincerely,                                                  Michael McCarry,     Executive Director.                                  ____                                                    March 8, 2002.       Dear Senator: We write to urge you to cosponsor and help      enact S. 1749/H.R. 3525, the Enhanced Border Security and      Visa Entry Reform Act of 2001, and to commend Senators      Feinstein, Kyl, Brownback and Kennedy for their leadership in      developing this important measure. We support their      compromise version.       This legislation includes constructive changes to our      immigration policies that can help strengthen our nation's      security. These changes fill current gaps in our immigration      system and will increase our nation's intelligence capacity      as well as develop layers of protection both outside and      within the U.S. Among other provisions, this bill:       Provides consular and border personnel with the training,      facilities and data needed to prevent the entry of people who      intend to do this country harm.       Calls for vital improvements in technology to provide more      timely information.       Authorizes increased funding for the Department of State      and the Immigration and Naturalization Service so that they,      along with other federal agencies, can coordinate and share      information needed to identify and intercept terrorists.       Calls for a study to determine the feasibility of an North      American Perimeter Safety Zone. This study includes a review      of the feasibility of expanding and developing pre-clearance      and pre-inspections programs with protections for persons      fleeing persecution.       Includes provisions for a workable entry-exit control      system.       Provides for a one-year extension of the deadline for      individuals crossing the border to acquire biometric border      crossing cards.       S. 1749/H.R. 3525 is a bipartisan effort that merits your      cosponsorship and swift passage. The House passed this      measure in December. We urge the Senate to immediately take      up and pass this measure as well.           Sincerely,       American Immigration Lawyers Association.       Church World Service.

Hon. Dianne Feinstein,     Washington, DC.       Dear Senator Feinstein: The American Council on      International Personnel (ACIP) would like to thank you for      your leadership in enhancing our Nation's security. ACIP      believes the Enhanced Border Security and Visa Entry Reform      Act of 2001 (S. 1749) takes appropriate measures to better      screen and track foreign visitors without imposing      unreasonable burdens on the mobility of international      personnel so vital to our Nation's economy.       ACIP is not-for-profit organization of 300 corporate and      institutional members with an interest in the global mobility      of personnel. Each of our members employs at least 500      employees worldwide; and in total our members employ millions      of U.S. citizens and foreign nationals in all industries      throughout the United States. ACIP sponsors seminars and      producers publications aimed at educating human resource      professionals on compliance with immigration laws, and works      with Congress and the Executive Branch to facilitate the      movement of international personnel.       ACIP has long supported the enhanced use of electronic      communications and information technology to process      immigration petitions and visas, assess risks, identify      fraud, and speed legitimate foreign visitors across the      borders. ACIP members are heavy users of the INSPASS and Visa      Waiver programs. We believe that in the long run, machine-     readable documents and biometric technology will make these      programs even more successful. We fully support the expansion      of preclearance, the integration of agency databases and the      electronic transmission of visa files and passenger manifests      and hope this will eventually be used to facilitate      legitimate travelers as well as to apprehend those who pose a      threat. Efforts to standardize our laws with neighboring      countries is also a welcome step that should facilitate      commerce. In addition, ACIP is authorized to maintain an      Umbrella J Visa program for international trainees employed      by our member companies. While it is unclear whether the      Foreign Student Monitoring Program will eventually be      extended to programs such as ours, ACIP would be pleased to      participate in any pilot programs.       We appreciate that S. 1749 provides authorizations to      implement and maintain these important programs. We look      forward to your leadership in ensuring that adequate funds      are appropriated to enable the agencies to carry out these      missions within the ambitious timeframes. ACIP looks forward      to assisting you in this important work.           Sincerely,                                         Lynn Frendt Shotwell,                                        Legal Counsel and Director     of Government Relations.                                  ____                                      University of California                                    Oakland, CA, December 3, 2001.     Hon. Dianne Feinstein,     U.S. Senate, Hart Senate Office Building,     Washington, DC.       Dear Senator Feinstein: On behalf of the University of      California, I am pleased to express our support for the      provisions regarding student visas in The Enhanced Border      Security and Visa Entry Reform Act of 2001. This legislation      reflects a well-crafted balance between the nation's need to      enhance security with the benefits of international      education.       The University of California has more than 9,000      undergraduate and graduate foreign students and approximately      23,000 foreign students in our Extension programs. We value      the contributions these students, and all of our students,      are making to education and research. Like you, we recognize      the tremendous benefits that UC students provide to      California and to our nation. International education is one      of our nation's best tools for sharing democratic ideas      around the world; we believe the instruction and research      opportunities UC provides are helping to better shape our      nation and democracy abroard.       The legislation you have introduced with Senator Kyl,      Senator Kennedy, and Senator Brownback will strengthen and      accelerate implementation of the foreign student tracking      system (SEVIS), and will provide interim measures until that      system is operational. On October 12, I wrote President Bush      asking him to support your request of $36.8 million     for SEVIS. It is my hope that Congress and the administration      recognize the need to fund fully this tracking system. You      may be interested to know that our campuses are already      working with the Immigration and Naturalization Service (INS)      to ensure the effective deployment of this system.       My colleagues and I appreciate your effort to work with us      in developing language that is agreeable to the University      and addresses your concerns about strengthening the student      visa system. As we have stated, the University of California      is ready to work with the INS and other relevant agencies in      implementing this legislation. Furthermore, we hope that      cooperative discussions will continue regarding the      collection of the fee associated with the tracking system.       Thank you for your leadership on national security issues      and your interest in working with the University of      California.           Sincerely,                                              Ricahrd C. Atkinson,                                                        President.
