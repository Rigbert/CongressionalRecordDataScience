Mr. Speaker, let me close by saying, it is not easy to stand here, but there comes a time when we must stand up for what is right, for what is fair, for what is just. I love this institution, like all of my colleagues. This institution that we are elected to, we have an obligation, a mandate and a mission to remove this dark cloud hanging over this institution, and let us do the right thing and help remove it by releasing this report.
