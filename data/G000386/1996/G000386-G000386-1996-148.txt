 President, I am happy that the Senate is finally taking up the conference report on the Small Business Job Protection Act. The House has already overwhelmingly passed this measure in a vote of 354 to 72. Finally, we are making laws instead of rhetoric about tax relief.  Finally, American families and entrepreneurs can get a break from the tax man.  As a member of the Finance Committee, I am proud of my part in moving this legislation through the Finance Committee and through the bill's conference committee.  This bill is good, sound bi-partisan work. In my belief, great credit also goes to Finance Chairman Roth for his leadership of the committee. To ensure that his efforts will not go unnoticed, I want to remind all Senators that Chairman Roth completed work on three separate conference reports this week. This is no small accomplishment, and I extend my gratitude to my friend from Delaware.  For my State of Iowa, this conference report on the small business tax bill makes some vital improvements. Particularly, I want to point out the provisions enabling new loans for first time farmers. I hope that this legislation will save the future of agriculture.                      Loans for First Time Farmers  I introduced this Aggie Bond legislation with Senators Pressler, Baucus, and Moseley-Braun. It improves the program that allows tax-exempt bonds to finance discount rate loans for beginning farmers.  Loans for beginning farmers are important because of the changing scene in agriculture and the inability of young farmers to get started in farming. Of particular importance are the statistics of the average age of farmers. In Iowa, our farmers average in their late fifties. In 5 to 6 years, we will have 25 percent of our farmers retiring.  The U.S. Department of Agriculture has announced that my State of Iowa has 2,000 less farms today than it did only a year ago. Four other States also lost 2,000 farms each. The largest decreases were in the States of Ohio, Alabama, Georgia, and Indiana. Clearly, farming States are still feeling the effects of the agricultural recession of the 1980's.  Young people are discouraged about becoming farmers because they cannot afford to get started. Many want to continue the family farm when their parents retire and cannot.  This Aggie Bond legislation helps by lifting the present restriction that disallows the bonds from being used to finance family to family transactions. In other words, under present law, a young person cannot get a good loan to continue the family farm. This legislation fixes that problem. I am very proud to be an agent of this important change.                  Contributions in Aid of Construction  Mr. President, this Conference Report also includes another unrelated important change for families trying to buy a home.  The provision is called Contributions in Aid of Construction. It repeals an indirect tax that has been imposed on families building homes since the 1986 Tax Act.  It will save families up to $2,000 off the price of a new home. Current law requires that water utilities pass a ``gross up'' tax onto a family that wants to buy a home. The ``gross up'' tax can increase the cost of extending water services to a new home by 70 percent. This conference report repeals this unfair ``gross up'' tax. It will foster home ownership where it is currently out of reach.  Repealing the ``gross up'' tax is an outstanding addition to this Small Business Job Protection Act. I am pleased to have introduced the original bill.                         Pension Simplification  Mr. President, I want to point out that the pension simplification provisions in this bill represent a major step forward. Not much has been said about these provisions in the commentary about what we are accomplishing here this week.  But I think you can argue that these pension simplification provisions could represent one of the major accomplishments of this week of many substantial legislative accomplishments.  Their enactment should ultimately result in more pension plans being created, particularly by smaller businesses. Since it is that segment of the business community that has the greatest difficulty in offering pensions to their employees, enactment of these provisions could result in a major increase in pension coverage.  Ultimately, that means more savings and more income for retirees.  We included in the bill a number of provisions which will help clarify the treatment of church pension plans.  We included last year in the Finance Committee's portions of the Balanced Budget Act a Pryor-Grassley bill designed to deal with many of the problems the church plans were having with the rules pertaining to highly compensated employees and to nondiscrimination.  Ultimately, those provisions were dropped from the legislation on the grounds that they did not meet the requirements of the Byrd Rule.  The legislation that we are considering today will go a long way toward taking care of the most serious of the problems faced by the church plans.  Mr. President, these simplification provisions have been on our Congressional agenda for several years. I understand that President Clinton has indicated support for pension simplification provisions. It is high time they were enacted.  Finally, I just want to stress again the importance that today we are making laws instead of rhetoric about tax relief. Families and small businesses not only need it, they deserve it. I encourage all of my colleagues to support this conference report.
