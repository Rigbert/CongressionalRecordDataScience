President, I thank the majority leader for his kind words. He is a friend of long standing. We came to Washington together in the House of Representatives many years ago, and we certainly never could have dreamed, when we arrived here so many years ago, that today we would be able to work so closely and so well in the leadership of the Senate.  Harry Reid is a terrific leader. He has done an extraordinary job. Today a lot of praise is being given to the President for his first 100 days. I want to add in that chorus of praise Harry Reid, the Senator from Nevada, who has helped the President achieve the goals that he set out to achieve in the first 100 days. He has made an extraordinary commitment to make that happen, not just in time and effort but in patience dealing with Members of the U.S. Senate.  I thank Senator Reid for his earlier comments.                          ____________________
