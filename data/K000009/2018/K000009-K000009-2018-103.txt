Speaker, I rise today in recognition of nearly 50 million baby boomers ready for retirement.  This week is National Retirement Planning Week. Let me emphasize two earned benefits that have done more to grant security and peace in retirement than any other: Medicare and Social Security. If future generations are to reap their retirement security, our generation must ensure their solvency. And if we only talk retirement with seniors, we fall seriously short.  Although nearly half of all baby boomers say they have $100,000 or less saved, and their Social Security is critical to their survival, half of Generation Xers have less than $10,000 saved. Given the financial pressures on millennials, they could end up in precarious situations.  Congress must show real leadership on this issue; and the somber reality is more Americans than ever are shouldering the burden of financing retirement alone. As a society, Congress also must prioritize financial literacy and education, beginning with young students in schools. We must equip everyone to start small nest eggs that can grow over the decades into what I call Social Security Plus.  Thank you to the National Retirement Planning Coalition, whose fantastic online resources are available to Americans free of charge. That is the National Retirement Planning Coalition, free of charge, to all Americans. Let's get to work for security for our retirees, not just this generation, but those to come.                          ____________________
