Mr. Speaker, a dozen years after the tragic events of September 11, 2001, the scars from the heinous attack on our country remain. We continue to mourn the loss of the lives of nearly 3,000 innocent men, women and children, including more than 50 men and women from my own district, the 4th District of New Jersey.  The scars remain, obviously, in the painful void in the lives of the families who have sought in vain to make sense of their tragic loss. And the scars remain embedded in the fabric of our society, which has had to learn to cope with the reality of a world where indiscriminate, vicious attacks on human life are a constant threat.  While recognizing the extraordinary efforts and courage of America's first responders--the firefighters, police officers, and other emergency response personnel, the heroes--it was also apparent from the terrorist attacks that our Nation had much to learn. We had to craft policies to better protect our people.  While progress has been made--we are safer, but still not safe--some lessons have still not been effectively learned by some in our government. One year ago today, unfortunately--on the very anniversary of the original 9/11 tragedy--we lost four Americans in a sustained attack on the U.S. consulate in Benghazi, Libya, including the U.S. ambassador to that country.  I was one of those, among so many others, who advocated early and consistently for a commission to chronicle the facts, missteps, and opportunities lost leading up to the original 9/11 tragedy and to develop a well-informed, thoughtful strategy to reduce the risk of an attack. The 9/11 Commission--that was chaired so ably by Governor Tom Kean, the former Governor of New Jersey, and former chairman of the Foreign Affairs Committee, Lee Hamilton--issued an historic, incisive report, a comprehensive report which, together with subsequent legislation, was thoroughly examined by House and Senate committees.  Virtually all of the recommendations were enacted into law. The whole thrust, post 9/11, has been to mitigate and, God willing, prevent such a tragedy from ever occurring again on our homeland. We have largely succeeded as several terrorist bomb plots have been prevented, except for the dreadful bombing at this year's Boston Marathon on April 15. Still, the perpetrators of that attack have been captured--one is now deceased fatally wounded in a shoot out with police and the other arrested and facing trial for his part in the bombing.  I wish I could say the Benghazi murderers of the four Americans have met swift justice, but one year later, no one has been arrested, there are no credible leads on the perpetrators, and those deemed by the subsequent Accountability Review Board (ARB) report to be at fault received months of paid leave and are now back at work at the State Department. Then-Secretary of State Hillary Clinton claimed to be responsible, but even though she was directly involved in decisions made during the hours of attacks on the Americans in Benghazi, the ARB didn't even question her and never explained why. A year later, we still don't know who gave the order to our military to stand down from rescue operations while there presumably was still time to save the four Americans who died. Despite House and Senate hearings on the matter, a shroud of silence has descended to withhold the answers to the mysteries still surrounding the events of one year ago today.  Our enemies are constantly searching for our vulnerabilities, and our ability to remain ahead of them is critical to our very survival. However, when Americans lose their lives and no one is culpable for their deaths, our safety in the homeland or abroad cannot be assured. Our enemies must know that justice will surely find them, and our officials must be certain that unjustifiable errors in judgment are not without cost.  This is a very solemn day for America. There are now two tragedies associated with this day, and the most recent one remains painfully unresolved.                          ____________________
