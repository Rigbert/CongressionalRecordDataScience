 President, we are reaching the end of a long road. We are about to pass the compromise on the AMT patch, extenders, energy tax incentives, and disaster relief.  I urge my friends in the House leadership to take a careful look at the votes the Senate took this afternoon. Also, they should take a look at the White House policy statement. House Democrats will see $42 billion of revenue raisers. House Republicans will see an unoffset AMT patch, extenders and other items.  There must be a majority to match the supermajority here.  I thank Chairman Baucus, Leader Reid, Leader McConnell, and their staffs. I wish to single out Russ Sullivan, Bill Dauster, Cathy Koch, Josh Odinitz, Pat Bousilman, Tiffany Smith, Mary Baker, Bridget Mallon, and Ryan Abraham.  I also wish to thank the Senate legislative team led by Jim Fransen. Finally, the crew at Joint Tax went above and beyond the call of duty. Ed Kleinbard, Tom Barthold, and the Joint Tax team moved effectively and efficiently.
