 Chairman, I just wanted to mention for the record that if this amendment passes, the Strategic Petroleum Reserve would have 93 percent of its capacity, and we could fill it as soon as the oil prices went down. And, again, when people talk about concern about national security, we are all concerned. Let me remind that 53 Members of this House urged the President to do this, including 39 Republicans. The Senate passed a bipartisan resolution.  So as the gentleman from Oregon (Mr. DeFazio) has indicated, the issue is will we finally stand up for the American consumer and lower the cost of gasoline.  Mr. DeFAZIO. Mr. Chairman, could the Strategic Petroleum Reserve be an insurance policy? Yes. And in this case, it can ensure a lower price of gasoline for American consumers and American businesses, or the lack of change in this policy and in the administration's current actions will ensure higher prices and higher profits for the industry. This vote will tell us which side of that question people come down on.
