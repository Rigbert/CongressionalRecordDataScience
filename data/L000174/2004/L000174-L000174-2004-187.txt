President, I am struck by the way the Republican majority is managing the Senate. I have noted that we do not yet have a Federal budget resolution. It is July and we have as yet considered only one appropriations bill, and that one bill still has to be resolved with the House. We have yet even to consider the other 12 appropriations bills that are normally regarded as ``must pass'' legislation--that is unless Republicans intend to shut the Government down, again.  Instead, the Republican majority has apparently decided to devote the July work period to partisan political matters. We are reading press accounts about Republicans maneuvering to bring the divisive constitutional amendment to federalize marriage to this floor for debate. The Senate Judiciary Committee has held a few hearings on this issue but has yet to consider language of a proposed constitutional amendment. Bypassing the committee of jurisdiction to bring this or any constitutional amendment to the Senate floor is an unmistakable sign that political expediency and haste, in the furtherance of political expediency, are the guiding principles for the Republican majority in scheduling the Senate's time. Political expediency--whatever it takes--is their guidepost, not the pressing needs of the country to act on a budget or on the annual appropriations bills. Paramount to Republican leaders at the moment are such matters as the divisive, hot-button topic of federalizing marriage law, by constitutional amendment. Republican partisans seem intent on politicizing not only judicial nominations but also the Constitution itself during this election cycle.  Democrats fulfilled our commitment to the White House when we considered the 25th judicial nomination that was part of our arrangement this year. I read that Republicans will now insist on devoting a good portion of the Senate's remaining time to the most divisive and contentious of the President's judicial nominees. They are intent on following the advice of the Washington Times editorial page to, they believe, make Democrats look bad, when in fact it is the President who is seeking to make judicial confirmations a partisan political issue. Democrats have cooperated in confirming almost 200 judges already. That is more than the total confirmed in President Clinton's last term, the President's father's presidency or in President Reagan's first term. Federal judicial vacancies have been reduced to their lowest level in decades.  It is wrong and it is corrosive to seek partisan advantage at the expense of the independent Federal judiciary or our national charter, the Constitution. I wonder in Presidential election years whether we should not have a corollary to the ``Thurmond Rule'' on judicial nominations that we could call the ``Durbin Rule.'' The astute Senator from Illinois recently observed that we should prohibit consideration of constitutional amendments within 6 months of a Presidential election. He is right in pointing out that the Constitution is too important to be made a bulletin board for campaign sloganeering. We should find a way to restrain the impulse of some to politicize the Constitution.  This week the Republican leadership has stalled action for days on any legislation as it resists amendments to the class action legislation from both Democratic and Republican Senators. The Republican leadership's handling of this bill is a prescription for nonaction, not for legislative movement forward.  Just yesterday Roll Call published an insightful editorial lamenting what it called the ``Big Mess Ahead.'' I think we may already be stuck in that big mess. The editorial noted that ``July should be appropriations month in the Senate.'' I agree. This traditionally has been when we were focused on getting our work done and making sure the funding for the various functions of the Federal Government were appropriated by the Congress, in fulfilling Congress's responsibilities and its power of the purse. Not this year.  Roll Call observes that ``the second session of the 108th Congress is poised to accomplish nothing.'' The way things are going, under Republican leadership, this session will make the ``do-nothing'' Congress against which President Harry Truman ran seem like a legislative juggernaut by comparison.  I ask unanimous consent that the July 7, 2004, Roll Call editorial be printed in the Record.   There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in the Record, as follows:                   [From the Roll Call, July 7, 2004]                             Big Mess Ahead        Here we go again. The Senate can't pass a budget      resolution. Only one of the 13 appropriations bills has      cleared both the House and Senate, July is a short      legislative month, and everyone will be gone in August. You      know what this means: a lame-duck session in November and a      messy, pork-riddled omnibus spending bill.        And it's not just on the money front that the second      session of the 108th Congress is poised to accomplish      nothing. The House and Senate can't agree on an energy bill      despite high gasoline prices, last year's Northeast blackout,      repeated urging from the White House and constant reminders      of America's over-dependence on risky Mideast oil.      Bankruptcy-reform legislation is stymied. So is welfare-     reform reauthorization. Maybe there will be a Transportation      reauthorization bill, maybe not. Even the Defense      reauthorization bill faces a tough conference.        Sure, the House and Senate have done a few must-do things.      The United States is in a war, so both chambers have passed a      Defense appropriations bill. And both have approved      legislation repealing a $5 billion-a-year export subsidy      after the World Trade Organization ruled against it and      authorized imposition of punitive tariffs against U.S.      products. Despite complaints from both parties about      expanding budget deficits, however, the House's repeal      measure contained $15 billion in new corporate tax breaks;      the Senate added $17 billion.        As any House Member will tell you, the perennial locus of      delay in Congress is ``The Other Body.'' And so it is this      year. The House has passed four appropriations bills, and      three more have cleared committee. In the Senate, it's one      and one. July should be appropriations month in the Senate,      but instead Majority Leader Bill Frist (R-Tenn.) has      scheduled class-action tort reform--which had the 60 votes      necessary for passage last November--and an anti-gay-marriage      constitutional amendment designed mainly to embarrass      Democrats before their national convention.        Republicans blame Democrats for Senate ``obstructionism,''      but the failure to pass a budget resolution--which would have      made it easier to pass appropriations bills--is mainly an      intra-GOP affair. Moderates want to impose a pay-as-you-go      system to restrain spending. Conservatives, ironically      enough, don't. The situation has the conservative Senate      leadership so exercised that it's trying to acquire the means      to threaten wayward moderates with the loss of committee      chairmanships.        It's true that if Senate Republicans drop the seniority      system and give leaders the power to make committee      assignments and choose chairmen, they simply will be      following the authoritarian patter of Senate Democrats and of      both parties in the House. Still, the effect would be to      smother centrism--what there is left of it--and enhance      partisanship and polarization. That's a distinct      Congressional pattern: When things are going badly, make them      worse.                          ____________________
