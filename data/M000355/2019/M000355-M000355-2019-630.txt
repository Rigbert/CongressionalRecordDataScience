  It is still too bad that our Democratic colleagues continue to insist on cloture votes, floor time, and rollcall votes for the kinds of uncontroversial nominees who have ordinarily traveled by voice vote for past administrations of both parties. Yet the Senate hasn't been deterred by this novel campaign of systematic obstruction from our Democratic friends. We will keep right on getting these talented public servants on the job, where they belong.  Later today, we will confirm a Deputy Under Secretary of the Treasury. Then we will confirm an ambassador, a solicitor of a Cabinet department, and a deputy commissioner of Social Security. They aren't the only nominees we will confirm this week. Before our work is finished, we will also have confirmed our next Vice Chairman of the Joint Chiefs and, pending the committee action of our colleagues, ournext Secretary of Labor--another group of talented professionals put to work for the American people and more of the President's team in place.                          ____________________
