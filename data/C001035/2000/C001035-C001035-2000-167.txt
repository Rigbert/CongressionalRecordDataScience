President, I rise today on behalf of myself and my colleagues, Senators Murkowski, Dodd, Torricelli, and Hutchinson to introduce the Organ Procurement Organization Certification Act to improve the performance evaluation and certification process that the Health Care Financing Administration currently uses for organ procurement organizations (OPOs).  Recent advantages in technology have dramatically increased the number of patients who could benefit from organ transplants. Unfortunately, however, while there has been some interest in the number of organ donors, the supply of organs in the United States has not kept pace with the growing number of transplant candidates, and the gap between transplant demand and organ supply continues to widen. According to the United Network for Organ Sharing (UNOS), there are now 68,220 patients in the United States on the waiting list for a transplant.  Our nation's 60 organ procurement organizations (OPOs) play a critical role in procuring and placing organs and are therefore key to our efforts to increase the number and quality of organs available for transplant. They provide all of the services necessary in a particular geographic region for coordinating the identification of potential donors, requests for donation, and recovery and transport of organs. The professionals in the OPOs evaluate potential donors, discuss donation with family members, and arrange for the surgical removal of donated organs. They are also responsible for preserving the organs and making arrangements for their distribution according to national organ sharing policies. Finally, the OPOs provide information and education to medical professionals and the general public to encourage organ and tissue donation to increase the availability of organs for transplantation.  According to a 1999 report of the Institute of Medicine (IOM) entitled ``Organ Procurement and Transplantation: Assessing Current Policies and the Potential Impact of the DHHS Final Rule'', a major impediment to greater accountability and improved performance on the part of OPOs is the current lack of a reliable and valid method for assessing donor potential and OPO performance.  The HCFA's current certification process for OPOs sets an arbitrary, population-based performance standard for certifying OPOs based on donors per million of population in their service areas. It sets a standard for acceptable performance based on five criteria: donors recovered per million, kidneys recovered per million, kidneys transplanted per million, extrarenal organs (heart, liver, pancreas and lungs) recovered per million, and extrarenal organs transplanted per million. The HCFA assesses the OPOs' adherence to these standards every two years. Each OPO must meet at least 75 percent of the national mean for four of these five categories to be recertified as the OPO for a particular area and to receive Medicare and Medicaid payments. Without HCFA certification, an OPO cannot continue to operate.  The GAO, the IOM, the Harvard School of Public Health and others all have criticized HCFA's use of this population-based standard to measure OPO performance. According to the GAO, ``HCFA's current performance standard does not accurately assess OPOs' ability to meet the goal of acquiring all usable organs because it is based on the total population, not the number of potential donors, within the OPOs' service areas.''  OPO service areas vary widely in the distribution of deaths by cause, underlying health conditions, age, and race. These variations can pose significant advantages or disadvantages to an OPO's ability to procure organs, and a major problem with HCFA's current performance assessment is that it does not account for these variations. An extremely effective OPO that is getting a high yield of organs from the potential donors in its service area may appear to be performing poorly because it has a disproportionate share of elderly people or a high rate of people infected with HIV or AIDS, which eliminates them for consideration as an organ donor. At the same time, an ineffective OPO may appear to be performing well because it is operating in a service area with a high proportion of potential donors.  For example, organ donors typically die from head trauma and accidental injuries, and these rates can vary dramatically from region to region. According to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), in 1991, the number of drivers fatally injured in traffic accidents in Maine was 15.54 per 100,000 population. In Alabama, however, it was 29.56, giving the OPO serving that state a tremendous advantage over the New England Organ Bank, which serves Maine, but not for a very good reason!  Use of this population-based method to evaluate OPO performance may well result in the decertification of OPOs that are actually excellent performers. Under HCFA's current regulatory practice, OPOs are decertified if they fail to meet the 75th percentile of the national means on 4 of the 5 performance areas. In this process, which resembles a game of musical chairs, it is a mathematical certainty that some OPOs will fail in each cycle, no matter how much they might individually improve.  Moreover, unlike other HCFA certification programs, the certification process for OPOs lacks any provision for corrective action plans to remedy deficient performance and also lacks a clearly defined due process component for resolving conflicts. The current system therefore forces OPOs to compete on the basis of an imperfect grading system, with no guarantee of an opportunity for fair hearing based on their actual performance. This situation pressures many OPOs to focus on thecertification process itself rather than on activities and methods to increase donation, undermining what should be the overriding goal of the program. Moreover, the current two-year cycle--which is shorter than other certification programs administered by HCFA--provides little opportunity to examine trends and even less incentive for OPOs to mount long-term interventions.  The legislation we are introducing today has three major objectives. First, it imposes a moratorium on the current recertification process for OPOs and the use of population-based performance measurements. Under our bill, the certification of qualified OPOs will remain in place through January 1, 2002, for those OPOs that have been certified as a January 1, 2000, and that meet other qualification requirements apart from the current performance standards. Second, the bill requires the Secretary of Health and Human Services to promulgate new rules governing OPO recertification by January 1, 2002. These new rules are to rely on outcome and process performance measures based on evidence of organ donor potential and other relevant factors, and recertification for OPOs shall not be required until they are promulgated. Finally, the bill provides for the filing and approval of a corrective action plan by an OPO that fails to meet the standards, a grace period to permit corrective action, an opportunity to appeal a decertification to the Secretary on substantive and procedural grounds and a four-year certification cycle.  Mr. President, the bill we are introducing today makes much needed improvements in the flawed process that HCFA currently uses to certify and assess OPO performance, and I urge all of my colleagues to join us as cosponsors.  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be printed in the Record.  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the Record, as follows:                                S. 2235       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of      the United States of America in Congress assembled,     SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.       This Act may be cited as the ``Organ Procurement      Organization Certification Act of 2000''.      SEC. 2. FINDINGS.       Congress makes the following findings:       (1) Organ procurement organizations play an important role      in the effort to increase organ donation in the United      States.       (2) The current process for the certification and      recertification of organ procurement organizations conducted      by the Department of Health and Human Services has created a      level of uncertainty that is interfering with the      effectiveness of organ procurement organizations in raising      the level of organ donation.       (3) The General Accounting Office, the Institute of      Medicine, and the Harvard School of Public Health have      identified substantial limitations in the organ procurement      organization certification and recertification process and      have recommended changes in that process.       (4) The limitations in the recertification process include:       (A) An exclusive reliance on population-based measures of      performance that do not account for the potential in the      population for organ donation and do not permit consideration      of other outcome and process standards that would more      accurately reflect the relative capability and performance of      each organ procurement organization.       (B) An immediate decertification of organ procurement      organizations solely on the basis of the performance      measures, without an appropriate opportunity to file and a      grace period to pursue a corrective action plan.       (C) A lack of due process to appeal to the Secretary of      Health and Human Services for recertification on either      substantive or procedural grounds.       (5) The Secretary of Health and Human Services has the      authority under section 1138(b)(1)(A)(i) of the Social      Security Act (42 U.S.C. 1320b-8(b)(1)(A)(i)) to extend the      period for recertification of an organ procurement      organization from 2 to 4 years on the basis of its past      practices in order to avoid the inappropriate disruption of      the nation's organ system.       (6) The Secretary of Health and Human Services can use the      extended period described in paragraph (5) for      recertification of all organ procurement organizations to--       (A) develop improved performance measures that would      reflect organ donor potential and interim outcomes, and to      test these measures to ensure that they accurately measure      performance differences among the organ procurement      organizations; and       (B) improve the overall certification process by      incorporating process as well as outcome performance      measures, and developing equitable processes for corrective      action plans and appeals.
