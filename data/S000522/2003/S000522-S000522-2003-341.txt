Mr. Speaker, as Chairman of the House Committee on Veterans' Affairs, I rise today to pay tribute to Judge Guy H. McMichael III, who is retiring after a lifetime of public service, including more than 25 years at the Department of Veterans Affairs. Judge McMichael's career includes stints in the Army, as a Deputy Prosecuting Attorney, on the Senate Committee on Veterans' Affairs, and at the VA under five Administrators, four Secretaries and five different Presidents.  Judge McMichael graduated from Harvard University and received a law degree from the University of Michigan. He served in the Army for two years and later was in private practice for four years, while also serving as a Deputy Prosecuting Attorney for the State of Indiana. In 1971, he became General Counsel for the Senate Committee on Veterans' Affairs, where he remained for six years until joining the VA following the election of President Carter.  When Judge McMichael first came to the VA with Administrator Max Cleland in 1977, he brought a healthy distrust of what people said and what they did. His discernment and skepticism was resented by some, but over the years, his ability to persuade others of the importance of being honest brought integrity to almost all parts of the VA that he touched. That a man who was the Administrator's right hand during the Carter years would stay on and perform such exemplary service for an additional 23 years is quite remarkable.  In 1981, Administrator Robert P. Nimmo appointed Guy McMichael to the VA Board of Appeals as an Administrative Judge. He was appointed Chairman and Chief Administrative Judge in l990, and has remained in that position until his retirement this year. Over the past several years, Judge McMichael has also filled several important positions on a temporary basis, including Acting Chief of Staff, Chief Information Officer, and Acting Under Secretary for Benefits.  Mr. Speaker, Judge McMichael's legacy is that of a man who served his nation with compassion and distinction, and advanced the interests of veterans. Truly, he saw his work for veterans as a mission, one that he could devote the full talents God blessed him with. Veterans are better off because he served them as long as he did.                          ____________________
