President, today we are voting on the Energy bill, which provides Congress with a historic opportunity. We should seize this opportunity and ensure that as this legislation goes to conference, the NOPEC bill, S. 555, remains an essential part of the underlying legislation.  America's fuel crisis continues to take hard-earned money from our families, farmers, and businesses. When President Bush took office, the price of 1 gallon of regular gasoline was about $1.45. Today, that same gallon will cost an American at the pump more than $2.20. And yesterday, our financial markets closed with the ominous and unprecedented news that a barrel of crude oil now sells for more than $60 per barrel. We know that these prices have a real impact--a major shipping carrier announced disappointing earnings last week in part due to the high price of fuel--and yet the administration has done nothing to address the situation.  In the face of continued inaction from the White House, it is time for Congress to substitute action for talk. It is time for us to finally pass NOPEC as part of the larger Energy bill.  We should have considered and passed this bill, S. 555, on its own. This bill passed out of the Judiciary Committee for a second time with overwhelming support earlier this year. I have repeatedly called for its consideration by the Senate over the last several months. It is long past time for the Congress to hold OPEC accountable for its anticompetitive behavior. This amendment will release the United States from being at the mercy of the OPEC cartel by making them subject to our antitrust laws. It will allow the Federal Government to take legal action against any foreign state, including members of OPEC, for price fixing and other anticompetitive activities in this regard.
