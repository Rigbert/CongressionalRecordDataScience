You don't have that and I appreciate that; but in your amendment, from the original bill, you took this language:       The Secretary shall treat an activity carried out under      title 23, United States Code, or project within a right-of-     way as a class of action categorically excluded from the      requirements relating to environmental assessments or      environmental impact statements.  That means all Federal highway projects would be exempt from any environmental review. Don't you think that's a little over the top? That's a little more than streamlining it, and that's not just within existing rights-of-way. That is, acquire a new right-of-way, build an eight-lane road and no environmental review? Don't you think, I mean, that might be a little bit over the edge?                              {time}  1530
