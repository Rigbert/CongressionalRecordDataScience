Madam Speaker, I thank the gentleman for those comments, and he is exactly right. And the gentleman from Pennsylvania (Mr. Murtha) knows that firsthand because he spends considerable time visiting the wounded in the hospitals as well.  One of the things that I learned is when a wounded soldier or troop leaves the hospital, despite the fact that person was there because of injuries or illness based on the battle, they get a bill for $8.10 a day for the food they consumed in the hospital. That is outrageous. I could not believe that was the case, and I immediately went back to research it, and found yes, that is the law. I could not find anybody that knew where that law came from or why it was or anybody that believed we should have that law.  So we introduced a bill to repeal that charge for those who are wounded or become ill because of their deployment to the battlefield or peacekeeping mission. I thank the chairman of the subcommittee and the ranking member and all of the members of the subcommittee. They have agreed to include that bill in this conference report. So when this bill is signed by the President next week, hopefully, that terrible law that charges a wounded soldier who might have lost a leg or two legs or an eye will be repealed. He will not have to pay that $8.10 a day for the food consumed in the hospital while recuperating from those wounds.  Because it is an appropriations bill, it is only a 1-year fix, so we must continue to push for the permanent bill which has over 200 cosponsors as I speak today.  Again, I think that the subcommittee has done a great job. Maybe it is not a lot of money, but it is symbolic, an American soldier wounded in action should not have to pay for the food that they eat or consume while in the hospital recuperating.
