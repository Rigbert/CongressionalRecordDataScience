 President, I ask unanimous consent that when the Senate completes its business today, it stand in adjournment until 9:15 a.m. on Friday, July 24. I further ask that when the Senate reconvenes on Friday, immediately following the prayer, the routine requests through the morning hour be granted and the Senate immediately proceed to the vote on passage of the transportation appropriations bill as previously ordered.
