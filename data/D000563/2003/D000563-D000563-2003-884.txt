President, I rise today to introduce the Melanie Stokes Postpartum Depression Research and Care Act along with Senator Fitzgerald and Senator Clinton.  My legislation is named after a Chicago native who struggled unsuccessfully against postpartum psychosis following the birth of her daughter. While fighting this debilitating mental condition Ms. Stokes has been in and out of hospitals several times, stopped eating and drinking, and wouldn't swallow pills. Despite medical assistance and the support of her family and friends, Mrs. Stokes was ultimately unable to overcome her condition, and jumped to her death from a 12-story window ledge.  Studies indicate that 50 to 75 percent of all new mothers experience the ``baby blues,'' a feeling of moderate emotional distress following childbirth. Serious postpartum depression on the other hand, affects between 10 and 20 percent of women. In Illinois alone there are at least 180,000 births a year. Even using the conservative estimate that 10 percent of mothers will suffer from postpartum depression, this suggests that over 18,000 women, in the State of Illinois alone will experience the devastating symptoms of this disorder each year. Women suffering from serious postpartum depression may worry excessively or find themselves exhausted. They may experience sadness, feelings of guilt, apathy, phobias, or sleep problems sometimes for as long as 3 to 14 months. Understanding this disorder more fully and developing new treatments should be a top priority.  The most severe form of mental illness that can affect women following childbirth is postpartum psychosis. Although this condition is more difficult to recognize since it occurs less frequently than postpartum depression, the consequences of allowing postpartum psychosis to go untreated are serious. Postpartum psychosis is characterized by hallucinations, hearing voices, paranoia, severe insomnia, extreme anxiety and depression and women suffering from the disorder are at increased risk for suicide or harming others.  Even though many new mothers will experience some form of postpartum depression or the ``baby blues,'' few research studies are carefully examining the causes of this mental condition at present. In addition, there is currently no standard treatment for women suffering from postpartum depression. The Melanie Stokes Postpartum Depression Research and Care Act would develop a coordinated approach for understanding and treating this devastating illness.  Specifically, my legislation authorizes the Secretary of Health and Human Services to organize a series of national meetings that focus on developing a consensus research and treatment plan for postpartum depression and psychosis. The Melanie Stokes Postpartum Depression Research and Care Act also encourages the Secretary to implement the consensus research and treatment plan generated via the national meting series in a timely fashion. Finally, the bill makes grant funding available through the Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration to aid in the delivery of treatment services for postpartum depression to women and their families.  I am pleased that Senator Fitzgerald and Senator Clinton have joined me in introducing this important legislation. Congressman Rush has taken the lead in the House of Representatives. I am anxious to work in a bipartisan, bicameral fashion to coordinate our approach toward understanding postpartum depression by passing this legislation in remembrance of Melanie Stokes and all the women who have suffered from postpartum depression and psychosis.                                 ______                                       By
