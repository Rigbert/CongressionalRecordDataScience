Speaker, the most important part of this bill is its dismantling of the dysfunctional Immigration and Naturalization Service. The bill abolishes the agency and separates immigration enforcement from immigration services, the key to reform.  The immigration enforcement half of the INS becomes the Bureau of Border Security in the Directorate of Border and Transportation Security. The headof the enforcement bureau, the Assistant Secretary, will report to the Under Secretary of Border and Transportation Security and must have 5 years of law enforcement experience and 5 years of management experience. This work experience requirement will ensure that immigration enforcement is headed by someone with the expertise to enforce our immigration laws. The separation of this function from immigration services will allow the Assistant Secretary to focus on a single mission.  As current events have shown with the July 4 Los Angeles Airport shooter, Lee Malvo, and other recent alien criminals who have been released by the INS, an unencumbered immigration enforcement unit is long overdue.  The equally important immigration services half of the INS becomes the Bureau of Citizenship and Immigration Services apart from other DHS components. The Director of the services bureau reports directly to the Deputy Secretary of Homeland Security. This will ensure that immigration services receives the attention and resources that it needs, and that it will not be forgotten and neglected in a department otherwise devoted to fighting terrorism. Our government must remain welcoming to immigrants who follow our laws.  In addition, the bill requires separate budgets and accounts for the immigration services and enforcement bureaus so that each bureau receives all of its designated money and no poaching occurs, as has been known to happen between the two components in the current INS.  While the bill permits the President to consolidate components within the two bureaus to make them more efficient, it prohibits the President from merging the two bureaus back into one agency. This should ensure that the INS as we know it is history and our years-long effort to restructure this failed agency will be accomplished.  Mr. Speaker in addition to the monumental immigration and border security reforms contained in this bill, this legislation will profoundly affect Federal law enforcement. This legislation moves the Secret Service, Customs Service, Coast Guard, Border Patrol, Office of Domestic Preparedness, Federal Law Enforcement Training Center, and other law enforcement functions into the DHS.                              {time}  1900  At its core, homeland security is a law enforcement function, and law enforcement should be the predominant role. The Committee on the Judiciary will closely follow the integration of these important law enforcement entities to make sure they have the support and authority that they need to protect the country from terrorism and other criminal enterprises.  Finally, this legislation moves the law enforcement function of the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, and Firearms to the Department of Justice as a distinct entity and makes important changes to the way we enforce explosives law and regulations.  I urge the membership to support this bill.
