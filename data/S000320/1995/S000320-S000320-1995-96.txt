 President, I ask unanimous consent that the Senate insist on its amendments to H.R. 2020, request a conference with the House on the disagreeing votes of the two Houses, and that the Chair be authorized to appoint the conferees on the part of the Senate.  There being no objection, the Presiding Officer (Mr. Inhofe) appointed Mr. Shelby, Mr. Jeffords, Mr. Gregg, Mr. Kerrey, Ms. Mikulski, Mr. Hatfield, and Mr. Byrd conferees on the part of the Senate.                          ____________________
