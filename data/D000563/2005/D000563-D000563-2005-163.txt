President, life and the Senate are about choices. Here are your choices with this amendment. You can give a capital gains and dividends tax cut that goes primarily to the wealthiest Americans. In fact, 75 percent of the capital gains tax cuts goes to people making over $200,000 a year; 1.5 million taxpayers will benefit from that new tax cut, people who are doing pretty well in life. Or you can take the same amount of money and provide health insurance for 9 million uninsured children in America. The cost? The same thing: $10 billion each year.  There is the choice--give tax cuts to the wealthiest people in America or provide health insurance for 9 million kids who don't have it, children of families who go to work every single day and don't have health insurance. The choice is pretty clear. A lot of people talk about moral values and family values. Maybe the choice in this amendment gets down to those questions.
