Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.  Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentlewoman from Connecticut (Ms. DeLauro) for such an eloquent statement and for her leadership on international food programs as well as our domestic programs like WIC and all of the Food and Drug Administration programs on which you have worked so hard in the subcommittee. We are truly fortunate to have you as a Member of this Congress and Connecticut certainly has made a very good choice in sending you here.  Mr. Speaker, I would like to just mention before calling on our dear able colleague from North Carolina (Mrs. Clayton), that it is probably important as we talk about this motion to instruct to acknowledge the courage, the dedication and the patriotism of the workers from the U.S. Agency for International Development and the World Food Program who have been working under extremely difficult conditions, certainly in the Middle East and Central Asia, but in Africa, in Indonesia, in so many other places on our globe.  They do not get a great deal of publicity. Over the years so many have lost their lives. They in my judgment are as important as any person serving our Nation and we want to thank them, and we want to let them know that this Congress understands the heroism of their work and the great humanitarian role that they play in treating all people equally and bringing the bounty of this land to places that most Americans will never see. We wish them to know the depth of our thanks and respect that we hold for the work that they do largely unacknowledged.  Mr. Speaker, I yield such time as she may consume to the gentlewoman from North Carolina (Mrs. Clayton), a very high ranking member of our Committee on Agriculture. If the word is agriculture, if the word is leadership, if the word is development, she is at the front of the line.
