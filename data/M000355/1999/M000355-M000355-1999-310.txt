  I also want to make the entire Senate aware of a letter written by the Chairman and Vice Chairman of the Senate Intelligence Committee. Senators Shelby and Kerrey wrote to the Assistant Secretary of Defense for Command, Control, Communications and Intelligence and pointed out that ``It appears the outdated, non-compliant locks still employed by Defense contractors cannot adequately prevent surreptitious entry.'' They go on to state that ``FF-L-2740 compliant locks are more cost-effective than the devices currently in use.'' Finally, they close by stating that they ``believe DOD should consider directing the retrofit of Defense contractors' equipment.''  I thank the Senator from Alaska for his support of the $10 million appropriation for this retrofit program. His leadership will help prevent the type of espionage that has dominated the news in recent days.
