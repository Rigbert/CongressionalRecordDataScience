President, further parliamentary inquiry: Is it the intent of the distinguished Republican leader to request subsequent votes after this first one be 10-minute votes?  Mr. McCONNELL. I ask unanimous consent that the second and third votes on the three stacked amendments be 10-minute rollcall votes, and as was suggested earlier, there will be a minute on each side to describe each of the amendments prior to the vote.
