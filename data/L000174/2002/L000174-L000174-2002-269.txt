President, I compliment the assistant majority leader. Seeing Senator Reid on the floor--along with Senator Reed of Rhode Island and Senator Akaka it seems only minutes ago I saw all of them as we were finishing up at 1 o'clock this morning. I appreciate the courtesy of the Senator from Hawaii in letting me speak at this point.
