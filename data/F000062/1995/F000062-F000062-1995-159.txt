 President, under present law, deeming only applies to cash programs, AFDC, SSI and food stamps.  Without this amendment, there is a massive cost shift, particularly to four States: New York, Texas, Florida and California. That cost shift is literally hundreds of millions of dollars because it means that legal immigrants presently in this country today would not have access to Medicaid, to Head Start, to child protective services, to foster care, to any of those noncash programs.  Who would have to pick it up? The State or the local jurisdictions. It is a massive cost shift for four major States. I yield the floor.
