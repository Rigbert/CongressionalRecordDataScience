And if I am not mistaken as well, he has said on the floor this has no direct impact on asthma and pulmonary disease, even producing a chart to that effect.  I wish to ask the Senator from California--because I visited an emergency room hospital, one of the children's hospitals in Chicago, and the emergency room physician said to me, Do you know what the No. 1 reason is that children show up in emergency rooms? And I said, Fall off their bicycles? Trauma? No. Asthma. Asthma.  She said, Senator, I will have young people come into this emergency room who are fighting for breath, saying, I am asthmatic and I can't breathe, and I watch as they die in front of me. That is the reality of asthma. This isn't just an inconvenience; it is life threatening.  I wish to ask the Senator from California on what basis could any Senator say there is no connection between air pollution, soot, and the particles in the air, and pulmonary disease and asthma?
