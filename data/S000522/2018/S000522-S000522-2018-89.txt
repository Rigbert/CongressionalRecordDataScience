Mr. Speaker, I rise today to congratulate Christopher D'Urso, a senior at the University of Pennsylvania from Colts Neck, NJ, in my district, who was one of only 32 candidates nationwide selected as a 2018 Rhodes Scholar, for a three-year doctoral program at Oxford University.  Christopher graduated from the University of Pennsylvania this week with a Master's of Public Administration (MPA) and a Certificate in Politics through Penn's Fels Institute of Government--the youngest student to graduate the university with an MPA. He also earned a Bachelor of Arts in International Relations, and was named Valedictorian of the International Relations Senior Class of 2018, with a 4.0 GPA.  This fall, Christopher will begin pursuing a doctorate in Public Policy at Oxford's renowned Blavatnik School of Government as one of only five full-time students worldwide selected to enroll in this program.  Rhodes Scholarships honor young men and women not only for their achievements, but ``for their character, commitment to others and to the common good, and for their potential for leadership in whatever domains their careers may lead.''  Christopher most certainly meets these high standards, as I have seen first-hand his keen intellect, passion for public service, outstanding leadership qualities and commitment to excellence. From 2013 to 2014, he interned in my district office where he assisted our staff with casework matters by helping provide valuable information from government agencies.  As a high school student, his research on loopholes in U.S. country-of-origin labeling laws that pose risks to consumer safety was so well-conducted that in 2014, he testified before the China Commission alongside officials from the USDA and the FDA in a hearing on concerns over food exports from China. He also produced a report with legislative recommendations on the issue.  I know that consumer safety and public service are important issues for Christopher--while at Penn, he founded Penn CASE, a student--led consumer assistance outreach program for local residents. Christopher also worked for the Monmouth County Department of Consumer Affairs for three years, investigating 70 consumer complaints--many of them related to Hurricane Sandy--and helping return over $114,000 to local citizens.  His senior project, a report on ``Translating Justice: An Evaluation of U.S. Efforts to Support Criminal Procedure Reform in Panama,'' was borne out of his recent trip to Panama as part of his MP A capstone project; he interviewed Panamanian and U.S. officials on the country's criminal justice system and evaluated U.S. programs created to help reform the system. Christopher won Penn's Rose Undergraduate Research Award for his work, and he will share his evaluation and recommendations with the U.S. Department of Justice, the State Department, and the Panamanian Embassy.  As Christopher graduates and prepares to attend Oxford in the fall, I wish him all the best in this exciting new step in his life.                          ____________________
