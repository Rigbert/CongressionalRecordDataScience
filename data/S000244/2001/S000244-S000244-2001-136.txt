Chairman, the point of order should be sustained. The rules of the House very clearly state that interstate compacts, regardless of the nature of them, fall within the jurisdiction of the Committee on the Judiciary. This bill is a bill that has been produced not by the Committee on the Judiciary, but the Committee on Agriculture, and consequently the amendment does not meet the jurisdictional test that is contained in clause 7 of rule XVI. The point of order should be determined to be well taken.  The CHAIRMAN pro tempore. The gentleman from Vermont (Mr. Sanders).
