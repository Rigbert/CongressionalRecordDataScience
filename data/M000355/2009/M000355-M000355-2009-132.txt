 President, today I rise to honor the life of a Kentucky heroine, Ms. Mary Josephine Oberst of Owensboro. Ms. Oberst passed away on November 13, 2009, at the age of 95. A native Kentuckian, she proudly served her country as a member of the Army Nurse Corps beginning in 1937. In July 1941, Ms. Oberst was sent to the Philippines, and in early May the following year, when Bataan and Corregidor fell to the Japanese during the Battle of the Philippines, more than 60 nurses, including Ms. Oberst, were taken as prisoners of war, POWs, by the Japanese. These nurses, later christened the ``Angels of Bataan,'' were held as POWs for 33 months. During this time, Ms. Oberst continued her duties as a nurse, caring for fellow prisoners, even though she herself suffered from malaria and significant weight loss. In early February 1945, the 44th Tank Battalion rescued the POWs who were later brought back to the United States.  After overcoming the medical conditions which resulted from her imprisonment, Ms. Oberst was appointed captain and continued to serve as a member of the Army Nurse Corps. She worked in hospitals in Louisville, KY; Fort Knox, KY; and Ashford, WV, until her retirement from the Corps in 1947. Ms. Oberst was honored for her duty with several military service awards, including the Bronze Star Medal. Mary Josephine Oberst was a woman of high character, who faithfully served our country. Today, I wish to honor her life and her service, as well as give my condolences to her family for their loss.                          ____________________
