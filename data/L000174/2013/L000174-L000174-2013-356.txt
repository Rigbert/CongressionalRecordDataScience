President, I wish to recognize a man who is a leading contributor to the preservation of the Italian community in Burlington, VT.  John Varricchione grew up in a former Italian neighborhood adjacent to downtown Burlington. I have my own fond memories of that neighborhood, travelling with my mother--a first generation Italian-American--from Montpelier to Burlington to shop in the small, family-owned, Italian markets there. Only remnants of the neighborhood remain, as most of it was lost to urban renewal in the 1960s.  I had the pleasure of joining John and other members of the Vermont Italian Club for the dedication of a historic marker, which serves as a reminder of the wonderful neighborhood in which he grew up, and of the people who lived there. John was instrumental in making the marker possible. We all shared wonderful Italian food after the dedication ceremony. I was honored to be part of such a special event.  John never moved far from the old neighborhood. He stayed in Vermont and became an outstanding teacher and coach at Rice Memorial High School--a Catholic school in South Burlington--where he became affectionately known among students as ``Mister V.'' Many Rice graduates consider him a favorite teacher.  John's contributions to the Vermont Italian Club, and his efforts to preserve our State's Italian heritage, are many. In honor of his work, I ask unanimous consent that an article published in The Burlington Free Press on May 10, 2013, ``Fragrant memories of Burlington's deep Italian roots,'' be printed into the Congressional Record.  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in the Record, as follows:             [From the Burlington Free Press, May 10, 2013]          Fragrant Memories of Burlington's Deep Italian Roots                          (By Melissa Pasanen)       John Varricchione, 66, has strong memories of growing up in      the heart of Burlington's Little Italy, he said last Monday      while he and his wife helped their friend Mary Anne Gucciardi      make a batch of her famous meatballs in their Burlington      kitchen.       At one point, Varricchione donned an apron imprinted with      the name of the Vermont Italian Club and three photos from      the early 1900s of three families who were among the pillars      of the community: the Eveltis, the Varricchiones and the      Merolas.       His grandfather, Luigi Varricchione, originally came to      Burlington in 1912 at the suggestion of the Merolas who      preceded him and who hailed from the same town about an hour      east of Naples back in Italy.       The family first lived on Cherry Street at the core of the      Italian neighborhood, and Luigi Varricchione made wine in his      basement like many of the area's Italian families. He was a      member of the Vermont Italian Club in the 1930s when it was      men-only, although the club hosted regular meals for      everyone, charging 50 cents for men and a quarter for women      and children. The club maintains the tradition with an annual      fundraising dinner in late winter or early spring. (See      vermontitalianclub.org for more information.)       Varricchione remembers back to when he was 9 or 10 ``going      to mass with my father at the old Cathedral of the Immaculate      Conception'' and then walking a block to where his      grandmother lived on South Union Street with one of her sons      after her husband passed away.       ``There were grapevines growing up the wall and a garden in      the back for herbs,'' Varricchione recalled. ``Grandma would      often be making pasta from scratch and it would be hanging      all over on wooden drying racks or laid out on the bed on a      clean sheet. She would serve me a bowl of pasta with sauce or      a bowl of her greens and beans. On occasion,'' he added,      ``she'd pull out the anisette and little Johnny got to      taste.''       Both Varricchione and Gucciardi recalled the bustling      Italian stores with cheeses and salamis hanging from the      ceiling and shelves holding big jars of olives and boxes of      torrone, Varricchione's favorite nougat candy.       ``We'd go to the store for penny candy,'' said      Varricchione. ``There was Merola's and also Izzo's Market.      Both stores were very generous in allowing people to buy on      credit.'' The whole neighborhood was lost to urban renewal by      the late 1960s, Varricchione explained sadly.       Looming large in his recollections was the image of the      Italian mama ``with plenty of love and food to share,''      Varricchione said. There were always many mouths to feed, he      said with a chuckle: ``There weren't too many small Italian      families.''       Varricchione's parents, Francesco and Simone (known as Si),      raised their eight children at 85 Bank St. and then 78 Pine      St. (now a law office).       ``We would have crowds to eat,'' said Varricchione,      recalling with relish how his mother browned pork chops and      then slow-braised them in red sauce. Even though his mother,      like Gucciardi's mother, was originally French-Canadian, she      learned all the Italian recipes and became a true Italian      mama and then nonna.       In a family history written by Varricchione's wife, Joanne,      she describes the scene:       ``Everyone managed to squeeze around the kitchen table      while Nona [sic] stood watch over the stove, stirring her      delicious sauce. The menu seldom varied: spaghetti and      meatballs, chicken or pork, salad, wine, garlic bread and ice      cream. The laughter and commotion only added to the wonderful      aromas and meals she prepared . . . Si seldom sat down and      ate with the family; she preferred to make sure everyone had      enough to eat. (`Does anyone need more sauce?' was the      question she always asked.) `No, Ma. Come and sit down.' `I      will in a minute.' It was a habit she never broke.''                          ____________________
