President, today I pay tribute to LTG Herbert J. Carlisle, former Director of Legislative Liaison for Office of the Secretary of the Air Force and the current Commander of 13th Air Force, Hickam Air Force Base, HI. A command pilot with more than 3,400 flying hours in the T-38, AT-38, YF-110, YF-113, and F-15 Eagle, LTG ``Hawk'' Carlisle has commanded at the squadron, group, wing, and now Numbered Air Force levels. He has participated in Operations Restore Hope, Provide Comfort, and Noble Eagle, and his selection to lieutenant general and commander of the Jungle Air Force is a testament to his exceptional airmanship, leadership, and judgment.  General Carlisle graduated from the U.S. Air Force Academy in 1978 and was selected to attend pilot training at Williams Air Force Base, AZ. He excelled in pilot training and was selected to fly the Air Force's premier air superiority fighter, the F-15 Eagle. Stationed at Bittburg Air Base, Germany, with the 525th Fighter Squadron, the Bulldogs, during the heart of the Cold War, then-Captain Carlisle again excelled in the air and on the ground as a pilot, flight lead, instructor pilot, and examiner pilot. His prowess in the air earned him a selection to attend the Air Force's Fighter Weapons School, and upon completion of the course he joined an elite team of fighter weapons school instructors. He became the chief of weapons and tactics at Holloman Air Force Base in New Mexico, only to be brought back to Nellis Air Force Base to become part of a recently declassified Air Force training program in which he flew Soviet fighters as adversaries against U.S. pilots to increase their capability and survivability in combat. Selected for promotion, Major Carlisle departed Nellis Air Force base for Maxwell Air Force Base, AL, to attend Air Command and Staff College and then deployed to Riyadh, Saudi Arabia, as the chief of air operations, U.S. Central Command Forward from 1991 to 1993.  In 1993, now-Lieutenant Colonel Carlisle returned to the F-15 Eagle, as operations officer of the 19th Fighter Squadron and then commander of the 54th Fighter Squadron at Elmendorf Air Force Base, AK. Following command, Lieutenant Colonel Carlisle attended Army War College in 1996, was selected for promotion to colonel, and returned to the Pacific in the F-15 Eagle as the Deputy Commander, 18th Operations Group at Kadena Air Base, Japan. Following Kadena, Colonel Carlisle was selected to command the 1st Operations Group at Langley Air Force Base, VA, then the 33rd Fighter Wing at Eglin Air Force Base, FL, and finally, after a short staff tour, the 3rd Wing at Elmendorf Air Force Base.  General Carlisle has served several tours on the Air Staff to include chief of the plans and programs directorate, director of the operational planning, policy and strategy, deputy chief of staff for air, space and information operations, plans and requirements, and two tours in the Legislative Liaison Division, as deputy director and director. It was in these positions that I witnessed firsthand General Carlisle's adept ability to handle a myriad of complex issues that directly impacted our national security. General Carlisle's engagement with Congress during his tenure as both deputy director and director of the Legislative Liaison Division was faultless.  Under General Carlisle's leadership, the Air Force developed a comprehensive congressional notification plan, ensuring timely and accurate passage of information on the Air Force's most difficult issues including the $40 billion KC-X acquisition program, creation of Air Force Cyber Command, force structure changes, and creation of Air Force Global Strike Command. General Carlisle prepared over 200 announcements to the Hill, cleared of over 500 witness statements, transcripts, inserts, and questions for the record through the Office of the Secretary of Defense and the Office of Management and Budget, and managed over 1,000 Congressional travel events to all 7 continents including 100 congressional Member visits to the Central Command Area of Responsibility. Finally, General Carlisle led the drive for what I consider the Air Force's most pressing issue: recapitalization. Through General Carlisle's leadership, the Air Force secured a budget of $1.7 billion for bomber and air-to-ground weapons, yielded $8.2 billion for fighter and munitions programs, and laid the foundation for $200 million in supplemental munitions funding. The leadership, insight, and dedication of General Carlisle have been instrumental in building lasting and trusting relationships with the U.S. Congress, resulting in an overall increase in U.S. national security.  The breadth and depth of General Carlisle's assignments and the professionalism with which he has carried them out reflect a keen intellect and an unrivaled grasp of national security policies developed through both personal experience and academic instruction. General Carlisle earned a master's degree in business administration from Golden Gate University in San Francisco, attended the National Security Management Course at Syracuse University, the Seminar XXI--International Relations programs at Massachusetts Institute of Technology, and the Executive Course on National and International Security at George Washington University. While he has received many distinguished awards and decorations, it is General Carlisle's commitment and sacrifice to this Nation that make him stand out among his peers.  Today, General Carlisle is once again at the tip of the spear, leading our service men and women as commander of 13th Air Force, commander of Joint Task Force--Support Forces Antarctica, Operation Deep Freeze, and the Pacific Command's Joint Forces Air Component commander. On behalf of Congress and the United States of America, I thank Lieutenant General Carlisle, his wife Gillian, and their daughter Summer for their continued commitment, sacrifice, and contribution to this great Nation. I congratulate Lieutenant General Carlisle on his recent promotion to lieutenant general and wish him Godspeed as he leads our military in protecting this great nation and its way of life.                          ____________________
