President, in an interview with Roll Call newspaper a while back, Robert Remini--one of the great historians of our time--talked about what he hoped for after he died. Professor Remini said his idea of Heaven would be listening with his own ears to debates involving congressional giants such as Henry Clay, Daniel Webster, and John C. Calhoun.  On March 28--Holy Thursday--Robert Remini died in a suburban Chicago hospital from complications of a recent stroke at the age of 91.  I hope his wish comes true. I hope right now he is listening in awe somewhere in Heaven as the great issues are debated in the Great Beyond.  Robert Remini lived a good and full life. He spent most of his career at the University of Illinois at Chicago, where he founded the university's respected Institute for the Humanities. He produced a remarkable body of work that brought important chapters of America's history to life.  In 2002, at the age of 80, Professor Remini became a distinguished visiting scholar of American history at the Library of Congress.  At the request of Librarian of Congress James Billington, Professor Remini spent the next 3 years writing the history of the House of Representatives. That is where I met him. What a man, a great historian, a great personality, with a smile on his face every minute of the day.  Professor Remini was once asked how he found the stamina to start writing another book at the age of 80. He said he started by setting a goal for himself to write nine pages a day. Then he did what he had been taught by the Jesuits who trained him. He designed a plan to reward success and punish failure. This historian, this writer, this man who had assigned himself nine pages a day, would only get his reward at the end of the day--a martini--if he met his goal of nine pages.  His system worked. ``The House'' was published in the year 2006.  In 2005, House Speaker Dennis Hastert, from Illinois, asked Professor Remini to become the official Historian of the U.S. House of Representatives. The post of House Historian had been empty for more than 10 years. Over the next 5 years, Professor Remini rebuilt the office's small staff and reestablished its reputation for impartial scholarship and integrity.  He retired from the House in 2010, but he kept writing until shortly before his death.  In all, he wrote and coauthored more than 20 books. His subjects included Presidents John Quincy Adams and Martin Van Buren, House Speaker Henry Clay, Senator and statesman Daniel Webster, and Mormon leader Joseph Smith.  As one former colleague said, he wrote with such immediacy ``that you might think he'd had lunch . . . with Martin Van Buren. He is an American treasure.''  The subject that interested him the most, though, was none of those great figures but Andrew Jackson. At least 10 of Professor Remini's books were about Jackson, including an influential three-volume biography, the third volume of which won the National Book Award for nonfiction in 1984.  To Professor Remini, Andrew Jackson was ``the embodiment of the new American.'' He was:       An orphan, poor, and yet talented, who through his own      abilities, raised himself to the highest office in the land.      He personified what the American Dream is all about. That it      is not class or money or bloodlines that are rewarded in      [America], but rather the ability of each individual to      achieve something worthwhile in life.  Professor Remini did not excuse Jackson for his backward views on slavery or women's rights or his harsh treatment of Native Americans.  He regarded Jackson as admirable because:       He believed in this Union. He believed in this country. . .      . [H]e . . . believed that government shouldn't be for only a      small segment of society, but for all of us. That's what I      want in [a] President.  So said Professor Remini.  Robert Vincent Remini was born in New York City. He graduated from Fordham University in 1943. He wanted to be a lawyer, but that changed after he enlisted in the Navy during World War II. To pass the time on board ship, he read history, including all nine volumes of Henry Adams' ``History of the United States of America.'' By the time the war ended, he knew it was history, not law, that he loved the most.  He returned to New York to obtain his master's and doctorate in history from Columbia University, and he married his childhood sweetheart, Ruth Kuhner. He taught at Fordham University for 12 years.  In 1965, he moved to Chicago and became the first chair of the history department at the newly established University of Illinois at Chicago's Circle Campus. He later founded the university's interdisciplinary Institute for the Humanities. He chaired that from 1981 to 1987. He became a professor emeritus of history and research professor emeritus of humanities in 1991.  He was an institution, not only in the field of history but certainly in Chicago and at the University of Illinois at Chicago.  In addition to the National Book Award, his other honors include the Lyndon Baines Johnson Foundation Award, the Carl Sandburg Award for Nonfiction, the University Scholar Award of the University of Illinois, the American Historical Association's Award for Scholarly Distinction, and the Freedom Award from the U.S. Capitol Historical Society.  Professor Remini's wife Ruth passed away last year. I wish to express my condolences to their children, Robert, Elizabeth, and Joan, their three grandchildren, and to Professor Remini's friends, colleagues, and former students. I will close with this: In 2003, the National Endowment for the Humanities invited Professor Remini to deliver its inaugural ``Heroes of History'' lecture. He chose as his subject the Members of the first Congress.  This is part of what he said of those men in whose footsteps many of us follow:       Ordinary. Most of them were ordinary individuals as far as      the record shows, yet they performed heroically. And they      deserve to be called heroes because they set aside their      local and regional differences, their economic and personal      prejudices, in their effort to make the Constitution succeed      and thereby establish an enduring union. They had many      disagreements, but they resolved them in compromise. And they      did it for the sake of showing the world that a republican      government was a viable instrument for the protection of      liberty and betterment of its citizens.  If Professor Remini were here today, he would tell us that the spirit of principled compromise is more than a noble part of our past; it is the best hope for our future.  Now I will make a statement as part of the continuing debate on the outstanding legislation, S. 649.  As I mentioned before when Senator Murphy spoke, I rise to speak about a vote the Senate is going to take tomorrow as we begin debating legislation to reduce gun violence.  I am glad we are finally having this vote. There were some who thought we would never reach this point. It has been far too long since the Senate held a reasonable debate on how best to protect our children and families and schools and communities from violent shootings.  When we talk to the families who have lost children to gunfire--and it has been my sad duty to do that over and over again--and when we talk to law enforcement officials who are getting outgunned by criminals on the streets every day, we know this debate is long overdue.  Some Senators have said they do not want to touch this issue. They have announced their intention to filibuster in order to try to stop us from even debating gun safety. This is an extreme political position. It is an unfortunate position. But, fortunately, over the last few days, a growing number of Senators from both sides of the aisle have made it clear this debate is going to move forward.  I hope the vote tomorrow reflects that, and when we get to the point where we are in debate, we can roll up our sleeves and get to work. We can look at our Constitution, which we have sworn to uphold, including the second amendment, and we can also look to the needs of America to protect the life, liberty, and opportunity for happiness for the people who live in this country.  According to the Centers for Disease Control, over 11,000 Americans--11,000--are murdered with guns each year. That is more each year than all the American lives lost in the 9/11 attacks, Iraq, and Afghanistan combined.  When we count suicides and accidental shootings, more than 31,000 Americans are killed by guns each year. That is 87 Americans killed every single day by guns. Another 200 are shot each day but survive. Think of those numbers.  Gun violence in America is truly at epidemic levels. Gunshots now kill over four times more Americans per year than HIV/AIDS, and shooting deaths are projected to surpass car accident deaths within the next few years.  These statistics should give us all pause. But numbers cannot truly capture the deeply personal impact of gun violence. There are too many families who now face an empty chair at the dinner table, too many parents who walk past an empty bedroom, too many husbands and wives who have lost the loves of their lives because of guns.  It is heartbreaking. But, sadly, it is almost routine--in a park in Chicago; at a nightclub in my hometown of East St. Louis, IL; in a movie theater in Auroro, CO; in a shopping center in Tucson, AZ; in a Sikh temple in Oak Creek, WI; at military bases in Texas, Virginia, and Kentucky; in college lecture halls in DeKalb, IL, and Blacksburg, VA; sadly, in the first-grade classrooms in Newtown, CT.  Since the Newtown shooting on December 14, more than 3,300 Americans have been killed by guns, including at least 220 children and teenagers. The violence continues. Americans all across the country are saying with one voice: Enough. We have to do something. We need to protect our kids, our communities, our schools, and this epidemic of gun violence has to come to an end.  On Thursday, we will vote to begin debate on a bill that would take commonsense steps to prevent gun violence. It is called the Safe Communities, Safe Schools Act. The Senate Judiciary Committee reported the parts of the bill last month. The committee held three lengthy hearings and four markups which I attended.  The Safe Communities, Safe Schools Act would do three things: First, it makes sure that the FBI NICS background check programs are conducted on all gun sales with some reasonable exceptions. Currently, up to 40 percent of all transfers of firearms include no background check. Someone raised the point in one of our hearings, what if you got on the airplane and they announced to you--the flight attendant said: Welcome to this flight from Washington to Chicago. The Transportation Security Agency has checked 60 percent of the passengers to make sure they are not carrying a bomb but not the other 40 percent. Have a nice flight. What would you think about it? You would think, for goodness' sake, we have to do everything we can to check everyone if we are truly dedicated to safety. That is what this universal background check is about.  We would also create tough Federal criminal penalties for illegal straw purchasing and the trafficking of guns. Get the picture. If you are going to buy a gun from a licensed dealer, they are going to run a background check on you. If your background check discloses, for example, that you have a felony conviction or that you are under a domestic violence order or that have you been adjudged mentally incompetent, unstable, and you should not own a gun, you will not be sold that gun.  Since we came up with this idea of background checks, up to 2 million unqualified people tried to buy them and we stopped them. That is what the law is supposed to do. But under the current circumstances, straw purchasers go in and buy a gun because they have a clean record. So the gangster, the mobster, the drug gang member, the thug sends his girlfriend in to buy the gun. She does not have a criminal record. She buys the gun, comes outside and hands it to him. He turns around and uses it to kill someone. This bill is going to change what happens to her. Of course, he is still going to face the full brunt of the law for his misdeeds. But she is now going to be held accountable, too, up to 15 years of hard time in Federal prison for buying that gun.  We had a press conference in Chicago and said: Girlfriend, think twice. He ain't worth it. To run the risk of spending 15 years in prison if you buy a gun to give to that boyfriend who is going to turn around and use it in a crime, it ain't worth it. This bill would also authorize additional resources to keep schools safe.  These proposals just make sense. They have strong support from the American public, including a majority of gun owners. The National Rifle Association may speak for the gun industry, but it does not speak for gun owners. Gun owners, and I know them. They are part of my family. I have grown up with them my entire life. They are good, God-fearing, church-going, patriotic Americans who value their guns and use them properly, store them safely at home away from kids. These are people who will follow the law. They understand we have to stop those who misuse guns from getting their hands on them. A majority of those gun owners across America, sportsmen, hunters, those who buy guns for self-defense support what we are doing in this bill.  The straw purchasing and school safety proposals passed in committee with strong bipartisan votes. I am hopeful we will be able to adopt the bipartisan floor amendment from Senators Manchin and Toomey on background checks.  All these proposals are also supported by law enforcement. It was about 3 weeks ago. I went to the Chicago Police Department headquarters. Superintendent McCarthy invited me in. I sat down for about an hour with 10 beat cops from Chicago. They are ones who literally get up every morning and go, usually undercover, into neighborhoods and try to stop the murders and violence. I sat there. One of them had just gotten back from his 11th surgery. He got in a shootout with a 15-year-old who shattered his leg. He has had 11 surgeries trying to get back on his feet and get back on the force.  We talked about what life was like out there. They talked about 14- and 15-year-olds packing guns and firing away. They are not worth a darn as a shot. They, sadly, kill a lot of people they do not intend to kill. They are as irresponsible as they come, but it is the reality of the mean streets of many cities. So these people in law enforcement agree we need to do something about the straw purchasers, for example. So do the prosecutors, the medical community, the faith community, teachers, mayors, colleges, universities, and, most important, the family members of gun violence victims. Many of those family members from Newtown are here today. Senator Murphy from Connecticut spoke earlier, as did Senator Blumenthal, to note their persuasive lobbying as they walk the Halls of Congress, hoping the sad and awful tragedy they went through on December 14 will at least lead to a safer America.  I salute them. In their grief, they are standing up to make this a safer nation. Unfortunately, some parts of the gun lobby have had a long history of opposing even those commonsense ideas. They have raised objections to them. I want to respond to the main objections the gun lobby has raised. As it turns out, they just do not stand up to scrutiny.  First, the gun lobby claims that requiring FBI background checks for gun sales will lead to the creation of a national gun registry. That claim is absolutely totally false. Federal law prohibits the Federal Government from establishing a national gun registry. We could argue the merits of it, but we have to acknowledge the reality. It does not exist today. It will not exist as a result of this bill.  I have a copy of a letter signed by 30 Senators, including 26 Republicans. I ask unanimous consent to have this letter printed in the Record.  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in the Record, as follows:                                                  U.S. Senate,                                 Washington, DC, November 3, 2011.     Hon. Daniel Inouye,     Chairman, Senate Committee on Appropriations,     Washington, DC.     Hon. Barbara Mikulski,     Chairwoman, Subcommittee on Commerce, Justice, Justice,          Science and Related Agencies, Senate Committee on          Appropriations, Washington, DC.     Hon. Harold Rogers,     Chairman, House Committee on Appropriations,     Washington, DC.     Hon. Frank Wolf,     Chairman, Subcommittee on Commerce, Science, and Related          Agencies, House Committee on Appropriations, Washington,          DC.       Dear Chairmen and Chairwoman: As supporters of the Second      Amendment and the rights of law-abiding gun owners, we are      writing to urge the House and Senate Appropriations      Committees to maintain several House-passed firearms      provisions in the upcoming Conference Report on H.R. 2112,      the legislative vehicle for the Fiscal Year 2012 Commerce,      Justice, Science (CJS), and Related Agencies Appropriations      Act. While these provisions had broad, bipartisan support in      the Senate, the amendments that would have reinstated these      provisions in the Senate version of H.R. 2112 did not receive      a vote.       Over the years, Congress has taken many actions to preserve      Second Amendment rights and prevent undue encroachment on      those rights on the part of the Executive Branch. One of the      most common ways in which Congress has accomplished this goal      has been through a number of general provisions in CJS      Appropriations bills. Most of these protections have been in      place for a number of years--some going back as far as three      decades--and none of them have been the source of any      significant controversy.       The House CJS Appropriations bill (H.R. 2596) made      permanent nine separate Second Amendment protections.      However, the Senate version of H.R. 2112 stripped the House      language and extended these protections only through Fiscal      Year 2012. We believe these protections should not be subject      to yearly reinstatement, they should be permanently fixed in      the law.       Specifically, the House-passed provisions would make      permanent the following protections:       Firearms Database Prohibition. A prohibition on the use of      funds to create, maintain or administer a database of      firearms owners or their firearms. This prohibition has been      in place since FY 1979 and prevents the federal government      from establishing a national gun registry.       Curio and Relic Definition. A prohibition on the use of      funds to change the definition of a ``curio or relic.'' This      provision protects the status of collectible firearms for      future generations of firearms collectors. This provision has      been included since Fiscal Year 1997.       Physical Inventory Prohibition. Prohibition on a      requirement to allow a physical inventory of Federal Firearms      Licensees. The Clinton Administration proposed a rule in 2000      to require an annual inventory by all licensees, While the      Bush Administration eventually withdrew the proposal,      Congress has still passed this preventive provision every      year, beginning in FY 2007.       Information Retrieval Prohibition. A prohibition on the use      of funds to electronically retrieve personally identifying      information gathered by federal firearms licensees. This      provision prohibits the creation of a gun registry from      dealers' records that are required by law to be surrendered      to the federal government when a dealer goes out of business.      This provision has been included since FY 1997.       Business Activity. A prohibition on the use of funds to      deny a Federal Firearms License (FFL) or renewal of an FFL on      the basis of business activity. This provision prohibits      BATFE from denying federal firearms license applications or      renewals based on a dealer's low business volume alone.      Congress added this general provision in FY 2005.       Information Gathering Prohibition. A prohibition on the use      of funds to maintain any information gathered as a part of an      instant background check or to maintain information for more      than 24 hours. This provision protects the privacy of law-     abiding gun buyers by prohibiting information about legal gun      purchases from being kept by government authorities. It has      been included since FY 1999.       Firearms Trace Data Disclaimer. A requirement that any      trace data released must include a disclaimer stating such      trace data cannot be used to draw broad conclusion about      firearms-related crime. This provision has been included      since FY 2005.       Firearms Parts Export to Canada. A prohibition on the use      of funds to require an export license for small firearms      parts valued at less than $500 for export to Canada. This      provision removed an unnecessary and burdensome requirement      on U.S. gun manufacturers that was imposed under the Clinton      Administration, It has been included since FY 2006.       Importation of Curios and Relics. A prohibition on the use      of funds to arbitrarily deny importation of qualifying curio      and relic firearms. This provision insures that collectible      firearms that meet all legal requirements for importation      into the United States are not prevented from import by      Executive Branch fiat. This provision has been included since      FY 2006.       Once again, these are non-controversial protective measures      that have long had the support of members of both parties.      Had a vote taken place, they most certainly would have been      included in the Senate bill, Once again, we urge the House      and Senate Appropriations Committees, particularly those who      will serve on the upcoming Conference Committee on H.R. 2112,      to work to ensure that the language making these protections      permanent are included in the Conference Report.       Thank you for your attention regarding this matter.           Sincerely,         Orrin G. Hatch; Johnny Isakson; Mark Begich; Jim DeMint;            Michael B.
