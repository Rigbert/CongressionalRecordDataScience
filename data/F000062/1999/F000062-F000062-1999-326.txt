 President, today I am introducing a bill to provide a tax credit for the bond holders of public school construction bonds, totaling $1.4 billion each year for two years. To qualify to use the bonds, the bill requires schools to be subject to state academic achievement standards and have an average elementary student-teacher ratio of 28 to one.  Bonds could be used if school districts meet one of three criteria:  (1) The school is over 30 years old or the bonds will be used to install advanced or improved, telecommunications equipment;  (2) Student growth rate will be at least 10 percent over the next 5 years; or  (3) The construction or rehabilitation is needed to meet natural disaster requirements.  The bill is the companion of H. R. 415, introduced by my California colleague, Representative Loretta Sanchez.  The bonding authority can leverage additional funds and it offers a new financing tool for our schools that can complement existing funding sources in an effort to address the need to repair and upgrade existing schools. It offers assistance especially for small and low-income school districts because low-income communities with the most serious needs may have to pay the highest interest rates to issue bonds, if they can be issued at all. Because the bonds provide a tax credit to the bond holder, the bond is supported by the federal treasury, not the local school district.  The nation's schools are crumbling. We have many old schools. One third of the nation's 110,000 schools were built before World War II and only about one of 10 schools was built since 1980. More than one-third of the nation's existing schools are currently over 50 or more years old and need to be repaired or replaced. The General Accounting Office has said that nationally we need over $112 billion for construction and repairs at 80,000 schools.  My state needs $26 billion from 1998 to 2008 to modernize and repair existing schools and $8 billion to build schools to meet enrollment growth. In November 1998, California voters approved state bonds providing $6.5 billion for school construction.  In addition to deteriorating schools, some schools are bursting at the seams because of the huge numbers of students and we can expect more pressure as enrollments rise. The ``Baby Boom Echo'' report by the U.S. Department of Education in September 1998, found that between 1988 and 2008, public high school enrollment will jump by 26 percent and elementary enrollment will go up by 17 percent. In 17 states, there will be a 15 percent increase in the number of public high school graduates. This school year, school enrollment is at a record level, 52.7 million students.  My state faces severe challenges:  1. High Enrollment: California today has a K-12 public school enrollment at 5.6 million students which represents more students than 36 states have in total population, all ages. We have a lot of students.  Between 1998 and 2008, when the national enrollment will grow by 4 percent, in California, it will escalate by 15 percent, the largest increase in the nation. California's high school enrollment is projected to increase by 35.3 percent by 2007. Each year between 160,000 and 190,000 new students enter California classrooms. Approximately 920,000 students are expected to be admitted to schools in the state during that period, boosting total enrollment from 5.6 million to 6.8 million.  California needs to build 7 new classrooms a day at 25 students per class between now and 2001 just to keep up with the growth in student population. By 2007, California will need 22,000 new classrooms. California needs to add about 327 schools over the next three years just to keep pace with the projected growth.  2. Crowding: Our students are crammed into every available space and in temporary buildings. Today, 20 percent of our students are in portable classrooms. There are 63,000 relocatable classrooms in use in 1998.  3. Old Schools: Sixty percent of our schools are over 40 years old. 87 percent of the public schools need to upgrade and repair buildings, according to the General Accounting Office. Ron Ottinger, president of the San Diego Board of Education has said: ``Roofs are leaking, pipes are bursting and many classrooms cannot accommodate today's computer technology.''  4. High Costs: The cost of building a high school in California is almost twice the national cost. The U.S. average is $15 million; in California, it is $27 million. In California, our costs are higher than other states in part because our schools must be built to withstand earthquakes, floods, El Nino and a myriad of other natural disasters. California's state earthquake building standards add 3 to 4 percent to construction costs. Here's what it costs to build schools in California: an elementary school (K-6), $5.2 million; a middle school (7-8), $12.0 million; a high school (9-12), $27.0 million.  5. Class Size Reduction: Our state, commendably, is reducing class sizes in grades K through 3, but this means we need more classrooms.  Here are some examples in California of our construction needs:  Los Angeles Unified School District got 16,000 additional students this year and expects an 11 percent enrollment growth by 2006. Because of overcrowding, they are bussing 13,000 students away from their home neighborhoods. For example, Cahuenga Elementary School has 1,500 students on 40 buses, with some children traveling on the bus two hours every day. Not only is this essentially wasted time for students and an expense of school districts, it means that it is very difficult for parents to get to their children's schools for school events and teacher conferences.  Half of LA Unified's students attend school on a multi-track, year-round schedule because of overcrowding. This means their schools cannot offer remedial summer school programs for students that need extra help.  Olive View School in Corning Elementary School District, with over 70 percent of students in portable classrooms, needs to replace these aging and inadequate facilities.  Fresno Unified School District has a backlog of older schools needing repairs. For example, Del Mar Elementary School has a defective roof. Chuck McAlexander, Administrator, wrote me: ``The leakage at Del Mar is so bad that the plaster ceiling of the corridor was falling and has been temporarily shored with plywood.''  San Bernardino City Unified School District, which is growing at a rate of over 1,000 students per year, has 25 schools over 30 years old, buildings needing improved classroom lighting, carpeting, electrical systems, and plumbing. Several schools need air condition so they can operate year-round to accommodate burgeoning enrollment.  Berkeley High School was built in 1901 and damaged by the 1989 Loma Prieta earthquake. They are still trying to raise funds to replace the building.  Polytechnic High School in Long Beach is over 100 years old and houses 4,200 students. The last repairs were done in 1933. Long Beach officials wrote:       ``The heating system is in desperate need of replacement      with continual breakdowns and the constant need for      maintenance. The roofs have exceeded their average life      expectancy by 20 years. Flooring and equipment have been      damaged several times during the rainy season. There have      been instances where classrooms had to be evacuated due to      health and safety issues. The electrical systems that were      designed for 2,000 students can no longer support the needs      of over 4,000 students, especially after taking into account      the need for increased technology. The antiquated plumbing      system is in desperate need of repair. . . . The entire      support infrastructure, water, sewer and drainage facilities      are in dire need of replacement as the age of these systems      have well exceeded their lifespan.''  The elementary school in the Borrego Unified School District has a deteriorating water well, with silt and inadequate pressure. The middle-high school has an intercom and fire alarm system inoperable because of a collapsed underground cable.  In San Diego, 49 schools need roof repairs or replacement. Ninety-one elementary schools need new fire alarms and security systems. Mead Elementary School, which is 45 years old, has clogged and rusted plumbing beyond repair, with water pressure so weak that it amounts to a drip at times.  Ethel Phillips Elementary School, age 48, in the Sacramento City Unified School District, has dry rot in the classrooms because of water damaged and needs foundation repairs and new painting, to preserve the building.  Loleta Union School District, which is in an area of seismic activity, needs an overhaul of the wiring to support modern technology.  San Pasqual Union School District's only water well is contaminated and the 30-year-old roof needs replacement.  At the San Miguel Elementary School in San Francisco, the windows are rotting and the roof is leaking so badly that they must set out buckets every time it rains.  And on and on.  School overcrowding places a heavy burden on teachers and students. Studies show that the test scores of students in schools in poor condition can fall as much as 11 percentage points behind scores of students in good buildings. Other studies show improvements of up to 20 percent in test scores when students move to a new facility.  The point is that improving facilities improves teaching and learning. I hope that this bill will offer some help and most importantly provide new learning opportunities for our students. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that a summary of this be printed in the Record.  There being no objection, the summary was ordered to be printed in the Record, as follows.         Summary of Feinstein-Sanchez School Construction Bill                              Tax Credits       Provides $1.4 billion in tax credits in FY 2000 and $1.4      billion in tax credits in FY 2001 to any bondholder for      public elementary and secondary school construction and      rehabilitation bonds. Similar to the Qualified Zone Academy      Bonds created by the Taxpayer Relief Act of 1997, bondholders      would receive a tax credit, rather than interest.                            Eligible Schools       To qualify to use the bonds, students in the schools must      be subject to state academic achievement standards and tests;       schools must have a program to alleviate overcrowding; the      school district must have an average elementary student-     teacher ratio of 28 to one at the time of issuance of the      bonds; and meet one of the following three criteria:       1. The school to be repaired is over 30 years old or the      bonds are used to provide advanced or improved      telecommunications facilities.       2. The student growth rate in the school district will be      at least 10 percent over the next 5 years.       3. School construction or rehabilitation is needed to meet      natural disaster requirements.                          ____________________
