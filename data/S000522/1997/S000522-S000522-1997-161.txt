Mr. Chairman, I move to strike the last word.  Mr. Chairman, I rise in opposition to the amendment, and again with all deference and respect for my good friend, the gentleman from Texas [Mr. Paul] I do rise against his amendment. I think it would deny us an opportunity to promote world peace and do some of the things that we have been doing so well and not so well at times through the United Nations.  Let me just say that if his amendment were passed, we would no longer be participating in the UN Children's Fund, and there is $100 million in this bill targeted to UNICEF. UNICEF has been part of the global effort to eradicate preventable diseases that affect children, like pertussis, polio, tetanus, diptheria and other menacing diseases, measles, and it seems to me that if we were to take that money away, we would see more children die from these preventable diseases.
