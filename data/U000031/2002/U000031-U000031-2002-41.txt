I look at my State and that is exactly when teen pregnancies began to drop. And the nice thing about this program is it is not just Federal dollars, it encourages the States to establish their programs and it becomes a match. For every $4 of Federal dollars, the States have to come up with $3. And then there are incentives and awards if they actually do work.  Michigan has had a great program under the leadership of our governor, and we have seen that work and we have seen those rates continue to decline year after year.
