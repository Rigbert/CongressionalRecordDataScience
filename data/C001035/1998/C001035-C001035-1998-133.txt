President.  Mr. President, I am pleased to support the amendment offered by the Senator from Texas. There is a wonderful example of what she is talking about in Presque Isle, ME. There is an all-girl's math class. They produce wonderful results. I have been in that classroom, and the learning there is absolutely terrific. But they had to go through all sorts of regulatory hoops in order to be able to do that. They would not have to under the amendment of the Senator from Texas. I am pleased to join her in support of it. Thank you, Mr. President.
