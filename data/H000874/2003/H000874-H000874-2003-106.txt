I have my own perspective, however, I will tell my colleagues.  The gentleman indicated that there are a number of meetings going on of conferees discussing this. And lamentably I want to tell the leader that the gentleman from Michigan (Mr. Dingell), the gentleman from New York (Mr. Rangel), and the gentleman from Arkansas (Mr. Berry) are not aware of any meetings that have occurred involving, at least, them; and they are conferees. If we are going to be able to pass this legislation, in my opinion, it will be necessary for us to proceed in a bipartisan way.  Could the gentleman comment on the fact that the gentleman from New York (Mr. Rangel) and the gentleman from Michigan (Mr. Dingell) and the gentleman from Arkansas (Mr. Berry) have not been in any of these meetings to which he has referred?  Mr. DeLAY. Just any formal meeting of the conference that has been held, the gentlemen he has listed have been invited to those meetings. The other meetings, the informal meetings and group meetings that have been held around the Capitol, the gentleman knows are being held with people that actually want to get a bill.  We are working with those, both Democrats and Republicans, who actually want to get a bill and are serious about negotiating that bill. And it is such a complicated bill. Different parts are being negotiated by different people. The gentleman knows how a conference can work and how difficult it is to hold it together. So to the extent that people want to actually get a bill to the President's desk, they are having great and strong input in the negotiations that are going on.
