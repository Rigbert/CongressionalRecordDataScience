President, this year marks the 50th anniversary of Portland State University [PSU], Oregon's urban university. In its short life, the university has evolved into a national model for how higher education can be integrated into urban communities through service learning directed at taking on thorny urban problems. What this means is that instead of just focusing on ethereal academic concepts, PSU staff and students roll up their sleeves and connect concepts with community, and knowledge of an academic subject with real world applications.  In 1946, Portland State University began as an extension school to serve returning World War II veterans. Today, the university serves more than 37,000 individuals every year, offering a wide range of undergraduate and graduate degree programs. What's more, since its extension school days, PSU's mission has shifted to showing how town and gown can work together to build the communities of the future.  When innovative community programs in the Portland metropolitan area are brought to my attention, often I find that PSU is in the thick of things. One program that I am involved with is PSU's partnership with the Police Activities League [PAL] in sponsoring the National Youth Sports Program on campus every year. The program provides at-risk youngsters with a structured summer program which emphasizes sports, positive decisionmaking skills, and education. PSU does more than just provide the facilities--in keeping with its mission, university faculty consult with PAL in developing curriculum for the program and students are active participants in running the program. The collaboration doesn't just stop at the end of the summer. Throughout the year, PSU and PAL work together to involve these youngsters in positive programs and encourage them to work toward a college degree.  PSU has also tapped into emerging technologies to both strengthen the university and the community. One of the most innovative uses of technology is its PORTALS program, or the Portland Area Library System. PORTALS is a cooperative endeavor linking public and private institutions throughout the Portland area to an electronically accessible research library, with PSU as its hub. The States of Oregon and Washington both stand to benefit from the new resources available through this innovative project.  These programs are just the tip of the iceberg of the university's involvement, PSU runs teacher academies to help local teachers get in-service education. PSU students, who are all required to be involved in community projects, work at local community-based organizations such as community health centers, schools, and after-school programs.  It is thus no surprise that PSU has received a number of national awards for its innovative curriculum and for its work serving the metropolitan community and the State. Last year, the school received over $3 million from foundations and Federal agencies to support its cutting-edge undergraduate curriculum. For the same reason it is also has been recognized by the American Association of Higher Education, the American Association of State Colleges and Universities, and the Interstate Commission on Higher Education as a national model for innovative undergraduate education.  The 50th anniversary is a time to celebrate the achievements of the past and look forward to the innovations and adventures of the future. The faculty, staff, and students at Portland State University, past and present, deserve our congratulations on a remarkable history and our best wishes for future success.                          ____________________
