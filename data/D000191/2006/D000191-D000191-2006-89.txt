Chairman, this amendment, we have already had some discussion about the Secretary's budget and the concerns of the Chair and certainly there needs to be some amount of support for that, but this goes to a critical function, a function of the Department which actually could produce more dollars and make America more secure.  The Department of Homeland Security's Office of Inspector General has done tremendous work. They have saved the taxpayers millions of dollars. They have uncovered fraud and abuse. Right from the beginning the $500,000 that was spent on art, silk, plants and other frou frou things at the new headquarters, that was uncovered by the OIG.  The OIG was then detailed, 75 people out of an already inadequately staffed office, to help with Katrina oversight. They found 10,000 mobile homes, at a cost of $301.7 million, vacant and sinking into the mud in Arkansas; $3 million in overcharges for food and lodging provided to disaster responders; a million dollars in overbilling by one company for hotel rooms for disaster evacuees. As of this date, the Office of the Inspector General has unfortunately had to continue to detail 75 people to the Katrina and the disaster recovery oversight. That is bringing about approximately a $15 million shortfall. Yes, there is a minimal increase in their budget, but it is about $15 million short of what they need.  They not only find fraud and abuse and overt waste, but make America more secure by spending those dollars more wisely. I am familiar with their work in the area of aviation security. They have been showing us the holes in the aviation security system in baggage screening, in passenger screening and other areas. Absolutely vital function. Again, they have been cut back because of the redeployment and the reassignment of the people to deal with the Katrina recovery effort. And it is not at all certain that those people will be coming back for years.  So I think it is essential that we find more funds to have more personnel full time, qualified personnel in this office; and in the end the taxpayers will come out ahead. We will avoid waste, and we will more efficiently spend the dollars we have.  I know the chairman will raise concerns about the Secretary's budget. I would suggest another place perhaps that could be cut in the overhead budget is the $21.2 million limousine contract. Now, granted that is a 3-year contract, but that is $7 million a year up from $3.8 million last year. There have been some revelations, and this certainly isn't for security purposes since as I understand it the owner of the company is a convicted felon. So I do not think we are providing security to senior level DHS people by putting them in limousines of a company owned by a felon.  I would wonder how many people there are that need limousines there at the Department of Homeland Security. $7 million a year? I mean, if there are 100 people, that is $700,000 a year. I can't even image there are 100 people who need limousine services. There are a lot of caps floating around D.C. loose.  I would suggest we could dramatically reduce the limousine budget, and I am sure there are a few other places we could find in the Secretary's overhead, and we could rededicate that money to the Office of the Inspector General, and we could squeeze out the fraud and abuse and better serve our taxpayers and make the country more secure.  So I am hopeful that the chairman would be willing to look favorably upon this amendment to help the OIG deal with their current backlog. This is as of March, I did not ask for an update, they had 4,151 allegations of fraud and abuse on file. And they have been able to investigate 429 of the 4,151 allegations of abuse.  You cannot tell me that they are overfunded or even near adequately funded when there is nearly 3,800 pending investigations on allegations of abuse.  This Department contracts, almost one-third of their total budget is contracted. They should have the most robust OIG force in the Federal Government. Instead, they have the smallest OIG force of any agency in the Federal Government despite the fact that a third of all the funds that go are contracted out and that does not even include the emergency Katrina issue which I addressed earlier.  So, again, I would hope the chairman could look favorably upon increasing the OIG budget and accept this amendment.                             Point of Order
