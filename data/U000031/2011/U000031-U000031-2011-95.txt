Speaker, I yield 1 minute to the gentlewoman from Washington (Mrs. McMorris Rodgers).  Mrs. McMORRIS RODGERS. Mr. Speaker, we can do better. There are many reasons to start over on health care reform. Do it right, and listen to the American people.  Number one, the current bill further destroys jobs at a time when we need jobs.  Number two, it actually increases our health care costs.  Three, it increases government spending.  Four, it raises taxes on hardworking families and small businesses.  Five, it takes away our choice of physicians.  Six, it cuts Medicare for seniors. Good-bye Medicare Advantage.  Seven, it threatens our world-class quality health care system.  Eight, it will add to our already growing budget deficit.  Nine, it includes taxpayer funding for abortions.  Ten, it is unconstitutional. And there are many, many more.  I encourage my colleagues to join me in supporting H.R. 2, and let's start the process of repealing this bill, the current health care reform bill, and replacing it with a bill that America deserves and America wants.
