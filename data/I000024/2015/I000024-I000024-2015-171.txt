President, there is one last comment I wish to make. This is something that doesn't happen on the Senate floor. But the Senator from Arizona is indeed a very good friend. We disagree on this amendment. We will have a chance to have a vote on it. But the fact that he did make a commitment that I would have the vote is very meaningful to me, and he did keep his word, and I thank him very much.  I yield the floor.  Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.
