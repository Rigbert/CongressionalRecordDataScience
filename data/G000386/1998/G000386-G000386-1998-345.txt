 President, I would like to commend my friend from Georgia, Senator Coverdell, for offering this excellent amendment last evening.  The purpose of our amendment is to curb wasteful military spending. I am a co-sponsor.  This amendment contains a very important message. It sends this signal: Pay a fair market value for what you buy. We hope the Department of Defense (DOD) will be guided by this common sense principle in the coming year when it starts spending all the money provided for in this resolution. Unfortunately, that may not happen.  Two recent reports issued by the Inspector General at the Defense Department undermine our confidence in DOD's ability to get a handle on the problem. These two reports provide details on the latest round of spare parts ``horror stories'' at the Pentagon. They were presented by the Inspector General (IG), Ms. Eleanor Hill, at a hearing before the Senate Armed Services Committee on March 18, 1998.  The IG's testimony and reports are the motivating force behind our amendment.  Mr. President, the story presented by the Inspector General on March 18th was not new. In fact, it's the same old story about spare parts overpricing that we have heard so many times before. It's a carbon copy of what we witnessed back in the 1980's. First came the revelations about the $450.00 hammer and the $640.09 toilet seat. Then came the assurances from all the Pentagon bureaucrats: ``Don't worry,'' they said. ``We already have a fix in place.''  History has repeatedly proven that those promises were worthless. They were empty promises. And history is about to repeat itself--again. There's no reform in sight.  The IG has brought new spare parts horror stories to light, and the bureaucrats are already promising that ``corrective actions'' are in place. Problem solved, right? Wrong! Unless DOD's corrective action has some teeth--andthere is some accountability for the mess, there will be more horror stories somewhere down the road. I guarantee it.  Mr. President, the only way to stop these kinds of waste procurement practices is with accountability. Some heads should roll at the Pentagon. Those responsible for the policies governing spare parts purchases should be identified and disciplined.  I wrote to Secretary of Defense Cohen on March 20th, asking him to consider the need for accountability in the latest round of spare parts horror stories. I am still waiting for a response.  This amendment sends a message over to the Pentagon. It's only a message but a very important message: This kind of waste must be brought to a screeching halt. We must find a way to fix it for good.  And it sets the stage for the debate over the Defense Reform Initiative that will take place later this year. That measure will be considered when we take up the defense authorization bill for FY 1999. I am hoping there will be some specific proposals offered--at that time--to bring some lasting reform to the way DOD buys spare parts.  Again, Mr. President, I would like to thank my colleague from Georgia for sending the right message to the Pentagon.                          ____________________
