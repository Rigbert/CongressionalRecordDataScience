This legislation would make it more difficult to prevent public disclosure of information in lawsuits involving a product that poses a serious public heath or safety risk.  Senator Kohl's amendment would promote transparency in court proceedings by prohibiting courts from restricting access to information in civil cases that could affect public health or safety. The amendment would prohibit judges from sealing court records, information obtained through discovery, and certain details of a settlement unless the public health or safety interest is outweighed by a specific and substantial interest in maintaining confidentiality. When issued, protective orders could be no broader than necessary to protect the privacy interest asserted.  The Judiciary Committee heard compelling testimony in a recent hearing about the tragic consequences of court secrecy in cases concerning defective products. We heard from Johnny Bradley, a Navy recruiter who tragically lost his wife in a car wreck that resulted from tread separation on a Cooper tire on his Ford Explorer. Mr. Bradley chose to buy Cooper tires in the wake of the Bridgestone/Firestone recall, believing that they would be safer. It was not until after the tragic death of his wife that he found out during litigation that Cooper had faced numerous similar incidents and had thousands of documents detailing design flaws and defects in the company's tires. The details from as many as 200 lawsuits against Cooper remained covered up through various protective orders, demanded by the tire company. As a result, vital information that could have saved Mr. Bradley's wife was not disclosed to the public. Mr. Bradley's story is just one example of the terrible consequences of court secrecy in cases involving products that pose health and safety risks.  Last December, Senator Kohl introduced the language contained in this amendment as the Sunshine in Litigation Act. I am a cosponsor of Senator Kohl's bill, and I support this amendment. In an environment where the administration is clearly not enforcing product safety regulations, we need to make sure that consumers have better access to information that affects their health and safety.
