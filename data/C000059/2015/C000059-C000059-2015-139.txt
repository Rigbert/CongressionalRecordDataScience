BLM regulations are 25, 30 years old.  However, the States have been doing the same thing over the last number of years. Unfortunately, BLM's rule is duplicative of existing State regulation.  It forces companies to drill into a double compliance scheme. It also costs them more time, and it significantly lengthens the time in which it takes time to get to a permit.  None of this is necessary, which is why we adopted this provision during the committee's markup of this bill.  I certainly urge my colleagues to oppose this amendment.  I yield such time as he may consume to the gentleman from Texas (Mr. Flores).
