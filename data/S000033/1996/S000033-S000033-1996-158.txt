 Speaker, for the benefit of my colleagues, I would like to have printed in the Record this statement by Amy DeCarmine, Amber Johnson, Beth Carmine, and Nathina Roy, high school students from Vermont, who were speaking at my recent town meeting on issues facing young people       The Summer Youth Employment Program has kept us off the      streets; kept us from the use of drugs, alcohol and violence      of any type. The Youth Program has also given us the      experience of how living can be in real life, and how to      conserve money for our future.       There can be nothing more positive in our lives than the      Summer Youth Employment Program; it is a continuance of      encouragement of being a responsible young adult. The Summer      Youth Employment Program has been the cause of so many young      people being employed, and in some cases it may help to slow      down the cycle of the welfare generation. It gives us ideas,      training for possible future employment, and it gives us a      better idea of what we need to do to accomplish our future.      Please help us to keep what has been proven to be a wonderful      chance to understand what is expected from us as adults.       It has given us a great source of self-pride in our      abilities to contribute and know what this is--that this is a      great start in life. And with your support in us, you have      also given us hope that you believe in all of us. We need      this opportunity to prove that we are serious about our      future, and need your consideration to allow us this Program      to continue. That's it.       Congressman Sanders: Can you tell us what kind of work you      did in the Summer Youth Employment Program?       Answer: I've been on the Youth Program for two years now.      And, the first year I worked at Project Independence, which      is helping elderly people take care of themselves and      entertain them. And last summer, I cleaned the elementary      school of Williamstown to get [it] ready for school.       Answer: I've only been in this for one year, which was last      year, but I worked with Amber at the elementary school      cleaning, and I thought it was a really great thing, because      a lot of people that are inexperienced, like under 16,      [employers] don't want to hire you * * *       Answer: I worked at a hospital as a spot clerk in the      basement, and I was in the program for one year. It was a      very good skill because I'm going to be working at a hospital      after I graduate.       Congressman Sanders: So I think what you're seeing here is      an example of a Federal program which meant a lot to you      three, and to tens and tens of thousands of other young      Americans.       Answer: Yes.       Congressman Sanders: There is a major debate taking place      in Congress right now, as to whether this fund, with this      program, should continue to be funded. I prefer, strongly,      that it should; but we're fighting against people who prefer      to put money into     airplanes and bombers that the Pentagon doesn't need, rather      than in programs like this. So, I thank you very much for      personalizing one of the major debates taking place in      Congress. Thank you.                          ____________________
