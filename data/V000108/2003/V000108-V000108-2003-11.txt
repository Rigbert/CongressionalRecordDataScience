Speaker, I appreciate the gentleman for yielding me the time.  Mr. Speaker, I will vote for the final supplemental package. However, I do rise to express a number of concerns that I have.  This is the largest foreign aid package that any current Member of this Congress has voted for, and I do not believe that it should be left to our children and grandchildren to bear the burden of today's decision.  During the Committee on Appropriations markup of this aid package last week, I voted in favor of an amendment offered by the gentleman from Wisconsin (Mr. Obey), the ranking minority member. The gentleman from Wisconsin's (Mr. Obey) amendment would have transferred $4.6 billion from the reconstruction of Iraq to the equipment needs of our brave men and women who are still in harm's way. I would again support this amendment if it were allowed to be offered in the House because I strongly believe that it is our duty and our responsibility to first ensure that every American soldier and military personnel in Iraq has the equipment they need to fight and defend themselves; secondly, that our generation should pay for it, not our children.  The gentleman from Wisconsin's (Mr. Obey) amendment would have added additional funds for repairing and replacing equipment used in operations. It would have included funds to allow the Army to increase its number of active-duty troops from the current level of 480,000 to 500,000. These additional troops, enough for one full Army division, after 1 year would help relieve pressure on an already overdeployed active-duty force, but most importantly, the entire $87 billion package would be paid for by canceling the top tax cut rate of 1 percent. The amendment restores the top tax rate to pre-2001 levels of 39.6 percent. It would have placed us in a position of not borrowing money to fight a war today that our children would have to pay for tomorrow.
