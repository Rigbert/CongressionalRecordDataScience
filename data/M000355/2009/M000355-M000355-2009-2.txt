 I have had an opportunity to observe Senator Kennedy over the years. That is exactly the way he operated.  If I may, just to make a point with regard to the observation of the Senator from Mississippi about Congressman Stupak, as I understand it, Congressman Stupak was not asking for some special deal for Michigan in return for his vote. He was, rather, trying to establish a principle that would apply to all Americans. Is that not the case?
