President, I will now resume consideration of the amendment I have offered with Senator Smith. I, too, want to praise Senator Carnahan for an excellent amendment. I am happy she spoke on it at this time.                            Amendment No. 78  Mr. President, just a couple of additional points. Again, I want to make it clear that nobody is going ahead of the line under this amendment that we have developed in close consultation with Senator Smith. I want to make it clear that all that happens is in chapter 11 you have to have a plan to repay the public.  In providing for this review by the FERC, we are not in any way subjecting the Bonneville Power Administration and public entities to rate review by FERC. Rather, it would have rates for power traded or delivered in California subject to FERC review, to examine if they are unjust and unreasonable.  It was a very tough proposition for folks in the Pacific Northwest and elsewhere to send our power to California.  It has been a tough year. At the bipartisan town meetings Senator Smith and I held earlier this year, again and again we heard from our constituents who were very irate--and understandably so--about being forced to send power to California. It doesn't seem to be fair--it is just not right--to say that all of those working families in the Pacific Northwest are going to be stiffed, that after thank-you letters have arrived, now somehow there could be a bankruptcy proceeding and the folks we represent just have to face the music and the extra cost.  I urge my colleagues to prevent this unfair result by supporting the bipartisan amendment Senator Smith and I developed with Senator Boxer from California.  I am happy to yield to my colleague from Oregon at this time.                  Amendment No. 95 to Amendment No. 78
