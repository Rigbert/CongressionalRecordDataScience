 Generally, single taxpayers got a $300 check and married couples got a $600 check.  What I would like to do today is first put the tax cut in historical context. Second, I would like to set the record straight in terms of the progressivity of the tax relief and its budget effects. Finally, I would like to illustrate what the tax relief legislation means in terms of typical families across America.  I am going to use a series of charts as I move through the discussion.  Let's start with historical context. In the last 20 years, there have been several pieces of major tax legislation. When I use the term major, I am referring to net tax hikes or net tax cuts in the neighborhood of $100 billion or more.  In the last generation, frankly, the American taxpayer has come out on the short end of the deal. By and large, the tax-and-spend Washington crowd prevailed. There have been four major tax increase bills. There have been three major tax cut bills, with one of those, the 1997 tax relief package, barely breaking into the major category.  Let's take a look at the tax increase bills first. There were No. 1, ``TEFRA'' in 1982, No. 2, ``DEFRA'' in 1984, No. 3, ``OBRA'' in 1990, and, as then Finance Chairman Pat Moynihan said, No. 4, the ``world record tax increase'' of President Clinton's 1993 tax package. Senator Moynihan's description was verified by a Joint Committee on Taxation estimate. It showed the 1993 tax increase raised taxes by over $1 trillion.  In the same generation, taxpayers have received net tax cuts three times. The three events occurred in 1981, in 1997, and last year. In 1981, the Reagan tax cuts brought down the top rate of 70 percent to 50 percent. In 1997, modest bipartisan tax relief, had, as its centerpiece, the $500 per child tax credit. Of course, last year, all taxpayers received a tax relief.  When you look over the last generation, the bipartisan tax relief of last year, in effect, helped tip the balance back a little bit toward the American taxpayer. I say a little bit, because, by any reckoning, even when fully in effect, last year's bill still leaves the balance toward higher taxes and more government. More on that in a minute.  For another point of historical context, take a look back at the fundamental tax reform of 1986. You will recall that effort was a grand compromise between liberals, led by Congressman Rostenkowski, and conservatives, led by President Reagan. We came up with a revenue neutral package by broadening the tax base by shutting down tax shelters. The revenue raised was used to create two rates--15 percent and 28 percent. In addition, millions of low income families ceased paying income tax.  During the tax reform debate, today's House Democratic Leader, Congressman Gephardt, pursued a tax reform plan with former Senator Bradley. The Bradley-Gephardt plan contained three rates of tax. The three rates were 35 percent, 25 percent, and 15 percent. Former Senator Mitchell, who would become the Democratic Leader and a great champion of the liberal wing of the Democratic Caucus, supported a top rate of 35 percent as well. Indeed, the House, at that time controlled by Democrats, passed a tax reform bill with a top rate of 35 percent.  So, at the watershed event of 1986, the leaders of the Democratic Caucuses, said individual income tax rates should not exceed 35 percent. As everyone knows, 35 percent is the top rate when the bipartisan tax relief package is in full effect in 2006. I guess I find it a bit ironic that today the Democratic Leadership says individual tax rates must be above 35 percent.  It makes you wonder why today's Democratic Leadership, in historical context, is so fixated on higher taxes. Why is Congressman Gephardt, the House Democratic Leader, insisting on tax rates at higher levels than his 1986 era plan? Why is Senator Daschle, today's leader of the Democratic Caucus, insisting on tax rates at higher levels than his predecessor, Senator Mitchell?  Isn't 35 percent of a person's income enough of a contribution for their share of the burden of the Federal Government?  That is where the Democratic Leaders were during tax reform. That is where the bipartisan tax relief plan leaves us when fully in effect in 2006. Unfortunately, that's not where the Democratic Leaders are today.  The question of why 35 percent isn't enough leads in the second part of my discussion. What I would like to do is set the record straight on the progressivity and budget effects of the bipartisan tax relief plan.  It seems to me that the Democratic leadership has moved its tax reform target away from tax relief for a very simple reason. The reason is to provide resources to grow the Federal Government by increasing spending.  It is part of a larger of agenda of moving a society, America the engine of capitalism, to look more like European socialism. It means more Government and less individual responsibility. It means less reward for work and more money from the pockets of working people for the Federal Government. It means opportunity defined less by a dynamic market and more by political criteria.  Now, a lot of inaccurate information has been spread about the bipartisan tax relief package. At the head of this campaign, is the Democratic Leadership. Perhaps unwittingly, perhaps by design, much of the media has worked hand in glove with this partisan campaign.  The misinformation comes forward in three bogus assertions. The first incorrect assertion is that the bipartisan tax relief was a partisan Republican product. The second is that the bipartisan tax relief package is the source of our current budget problems. The third incorrect assertion is that the tax relief favored the wealthy over low and middle income taxpayers.  I would like to turn to the first incorrect assertion. Often we hear the phrase Republican tax cut or partisan tax cut. In fact, the tax cut was bipartisan. Twelve Democratic Senators voted for the conference report. Senator Jeffords also voted for the conference report. That is over one-fourth of the Democratic Caucus.  The tax relief legislation was bipartisan by design. In a Senate divided down the middle, the tax relief had to be bipartisan to pass. There was no other way.  Democratic members of the Finance Committee played a key role in crafting the bill. LEd by our current Chairman, Max Baucus, they insisted on a bill that reflected their priorities. Senators Breaux, Torricelli, Lincoln, all contributed to the formation of this bill. Republican moderates like Senator Snowe also played a key role. Without these Senator's input and support, we would not have the tax relief in place.  Anyone who characterizes the tax relief as partisan is flat out wrong.  I would like to move on the second incorrect assertion. How many times have we heard on this floor or seen written in the media the charge that the bipartisan tax relief caused the current and projected deficits. If I have a dollar for every time I've heard or read this point, I could put the budget in balance.  Cold hard numbers tell a different story. Cold hard numbers from the Congressional Budget Office, the Office of Management and Budget, and private sector sources reveal the truth.  Here is what the numbers say. You can check it out on the CBO website.  According to CBO's January baseline, for the current fiscal year, the tax cut represents barely 14% of the total change in the budget since last year. For instance, for the same period, increased appropriations outranked the tax cut by $6 billion. So, spending above baseline, together with lower projected revenues, accounted for 89 percent of the change in the budget picture. Let me repeat that. Bipartisan tax relief was a minimal, 11 percent factor, in the change in the surplus.  Over the long-term, the tax cut accounts for 45 percent of the change in the budget picture. Stated another way, the 10 year surplus declined from $5.6 trillion to $1.6 trillion. Of that $4.0 trillion change, the tax cut represented about $1.7 trillion of the decline. That is less than one-half of the change. Let me repeat that for our friends in the Democratic Leadership and their allies in the media. The tax relief package accounts for less than 45 percent of the decline in the surplus.  The second incorrect assertion, that the tax cut ate the surplus, is incorrect, according to CBO.  I would like to turn to the third incorrect assertion about the bipartisan tax relief package. That assertion is that the tax relief package was a tax cut only for the wealthiest Americans.  How many times have we heard the statistic that 40 percent of the benefits of the tax cut went to the top 1 percent of taxpayers?  Where did the statistic come from? Did it come from the non-partisan Joint committee on Taxation? The answer is no. The statistic cited by the media and the Democratic Leadership came from the liberal think tank known as the Center on Budget Policy and Priorities. How do they get their numbers? Here's an example. Let us talk about how they distribute the benefits of the death tax. The liberal think tank assumes that the person benefitting from death tax relief is the dead person. Imagine that. Only in Washington, D.C. do they assume you can take the benefit of tax relief with you to the grave.  It takes these kinds of distortions in methodology to get the conclusion the liberal think tank wants. That's why our friends in the Democratic Leadership rely on the Center for Budget Policy and Priorities. Unfortunately, some in the media accept these statistics at face value.  Once again, facts can be ugly things for harsh critics of the bipartisan tax relief package. According to the Joint Committee on Taxation, Congress' official non-partisan scorekeeper, the tax code is more progressive with the tax relief package. Let me repeat that fact. Joint Tax, not a liberal or conservative think tank, says the bipartisan tax relief package made the Tax Code more progressive.  I ask unanimous consent to place in the Record a distribution analysis, prepared by Joint Tax.  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in the Record, as follows:                                           DISTRIBUTIONAL EFFECTS OF THE CONFERENCE AGREEMENT FOR H.R.

Corporate income tax and estate and gift taxes are not included due to uncertainty concerning the incidence of these  taxes. Individuals who are dependents of other taxpayers and taxpayers with negative income are excluded from the analysis. Does not include indirect  effects.\4\ The effective tax rate is equal to Federal taxes described in footnote (3) divided by: income described in footnote (2) plus additional income  attributable to the proposal.
