 President, I think the leadership of the Armed Services Committee deserves a lot of credit for wrapping up the conference on the fiscal year 1997 Defense authorization bill in record time.  This measure was ready before the August recess. We just could not get to it because of other pending business.  The chairman of the committee, Senator Thurmond, and the ranking Democrat, Senator Nunn, have done an outstanding job.  They resolved a number of very complicated and difficult issues, and they did it in a very timely and business-like way.  I would also like to thank the committee for protecting my amendments:  Section 217 that establishes a 1991 baseline for the independent cost estimate for the F-22 fighter; and  Section 809 that places a $250,000 per year cap on executive compensation.  However, I am very unhappy with one part of the final bill--section 405.  I am very disappointed to see this provision in the final bill.  Section 405 authorizes an increase in the number of general officers on active duty in the Marine Corps.  It raises the current ceiling from 68 to 80 generals.  That is an increase of 12 generals.  I attempted to block this measure but failed. My amendment was defeated by a vote of 79 to 21.  The House had rejected it earlier but could not prevail in conference.  So we lost the fight.  The Marine Commandant, General Krulak, visited me in late July and helped to soften some of my objections.  For example, he assured me that the 12 new generals will be assigned to warfighting billets. That is good.  He promised me that the new generals will not fill mushrooming headquarters billets.  Those are the billets that Marine General Sheehan is so worried about.  But General Krulak's guarantees do not overcome my basic objection to the idea of adding brass at the top when the military is downsizing.  From that standpoint, section 405 of the bill defies understanding.  With 80 generals on board, the Marine Corps will have more generals than it had at the height of World War II when the Marine Corps was three times as big as it is today.  The Marine Corps is critically short of platoon sergeants. That is where we should add money--not for generals.  The Marine Corps is already topheavy with brass.  That came through loud and clear during Operation Restore Hope in Somalia, according to Col. David Hackworth.  Colonel Hackworth's thoughts are presented in his new book entitled:  Hazardous Duty: America's Most Decorated Living Soldier Reports From the Front and Tells It the Way It Is.''  Marine Lt. Gen. Robert Johnson was in charge of Operation Restore Hope in late 1992.  He had 12 rifle companies under his command or about 1,200 fighters.  But as Colonel Hackworth points out, General Johnson's headquarters strength was 1,141.  So General Johnson's headquarters staff almost outnumbered the fighters.  In all, he said, there were 12 American generals in Somalia, one for every rifle company.  A rifle company is commanded by a captain, and a captain does not need a bunch of generals giving him orders.  All he needs is one good colonel.  Colonel Hackworth concludes with this thought: ``Never had so few been commanded by quite so many.''  So why does a shirinking Marine Corps need more generals? The Marine Corps already has too many generals commanding troops in the field. Somalia proved that point. They aren't needed for combat. They are needed for bureaucratic infighting in the Pentagon budget wars.  The Committee makes that point crystal clear in its report. I quote: ``The increase is intended to permit the Marine Corps to have greater representation at the general officer level on the Department of the Navy-Secretariat staff and in the joint arena.''  The Marines think more generals at the table will mean a bigger slice of the pie or a better piece of the action somewhere down the road.  That's what this is all about: capturing important bureaucratic real estate.  Mr. President, in my mind, this is bad public policy. It's going to backfire--big time. Giving in to the Marine Corps's request will not lay this issue to rest. This is not the end of it. It's just the beginning.  It is an ominous sign of interservice rivaalry that could ignite a war over who can get the most stars.  The Army, Navy, and Air Force are now going to complain: The Marines got theirs. Now we want ours.  The floodgates are about to open.  The Army, Navy, and Air Force are already lining up with their requests for more generals.  The Navy went on record in March, saying it has ``331 valid flag officer requirements.''  The Navy is authorized to have 220 today. Does this mean the Navy needs another 111 admirals?  The Navy is already topheavy with brass, having just about one admiral per ship.  The Army and the Air Force are even more topheavy--fatter with brass.  Yet both the Army and the Air Force are lobbying Secretary Perry to get their requests for more generals approved.  Now, while Mr. Perry is doing this, he is also telling the military to continue downsizing.  Does this make sense, Mr. President? Does it make sense to topsize when you're downsizing?  Former Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, Gen. Colin Powell, shed some light on this issue back in 1990 when post-cold-war downsizing began in earnest.  General Powell's thinking on this issue was outlined in an article that appeared in the August 1 issue of the Washington Post.  The article was written by Mr. Walter Pincus.  I ask unanimous consent to have this report printed in the Record.  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in the Record, as follows:                [From the Washington Post, Aug. 1, 1996]             Marines Land Generals Despite Some Opposition                           (By Walter Pincus)       The Marines have landed their 12 more generals and despite      some opposition appear to have the situation well in hand.       House conferees yesterday reached an agreement on the      fiscal 1997 defense authorization bill that will allow the      Corps to appoint a dozen more generals, enlarging its top      tier so that the Marines will have a fair share of      representatives in joint commands and be able to fill vacant      positions.       If the conference report passes both houses and is signed      by President Clinton, the Marines will be entitled to raise      the number of active duty generals from 68 to 80. That would      give the 174,000-member Corps, one more general than it had      in June 1945 when the force was 475,000 strong, according to      Rep. G.V. ``Sonny'' Montgomery (D-Miss.), who opposed the      increase.       Sen. Charles E. Grassley (R-Iowa), who led the opposition      in the Senate, said yesterday he was ``very disappointed and      frustrated'' by the House conferees' action. He said he had      hoped the increase could have been held off pending a study      ``based on recent downsizing in the rank and file.''       But the Marines have insisted that the increase is      warranted. ``We don't ask for something unless it is truly      needed,'' Marine Commandant Gen. Charles C. Krulak said in a      letter to Grassley.       The Iowa Republican warned that other services will now be      encouraged to request more admirals and generals, despite the      military drawdown. ``This is just a small snowball rolling      down a hill that is going to expand very rapidly the number      of brass in all services,'' he said.       Last March, Adm. Frank L. Bowman, chief of naval personnel,      told the Senate Armed Services Committee, ``I am convinced      the Navy needs 25 to 30 more flag officers in order to have a      manageable number of people to assign without having to rely      on gapped billets or filling flag officer billets with senior      captains.''       Yesterday, Capt. Jim Kudla, spokesman for Bowman, said the      Navy proposal ``is not yet out of the hopper,'' but added      that a number is under study in the office of Navy Secretary      John H. Dalton.       The Navy, which this year has 428,000 officers and enlisted      personnel, currently is authorized to have 216 flag officers      plus four more allowed by the Joint Chiefs of Staff. That is      down from a total force of 535,000 in 1990 when it had 256      admirals.       Under current plans, Navy personnel will go down to 395,000      by late 1998 and level off there. Nonetheless, according to      Bowman, the Navy's increase in admirals is justified because      ``I believe we went too far in flag officer reductions in the      Navy. We are feeling the pinch.''       In 1990, then-Defense Secretary Richard B. Cheney and his      chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, Gen. Colin L. Powell,      agreed that as they reduced overall service levels, they      would as a ``matter of good faith'' look at cutting generals      and flag officers ``proportional to the reductions in base      forces,'' a former senior Powell aide said yesterday.       Since the main forces were being reduced by 25 percent,      Cheney and Powell looked at cutting the number of generals      and admirals by at least 20 percent. Powell argued that the      military services were like a pyramid. ``You can't just cut      at the bottom,'' the former aide said in describing Powell's      position. ``You have to take some off at every level so it      still had the proper shape to it.''       Powell regularly met with other members of the Joint Chiefs      to have them ``pledge their commitment'' to the cuts which,      the former aide said, ``were painful.'' Those chiefs have now      retired and the services, starting with the Marines, have      begun to relieve the pain, the aide added.       The issue has led to some tough back-room politicking while      House and Senate conferees worked out their differences.       Recently, House and Senate aides said they had been told by      Pentagon sources that Arnold L. Punaro, minority staff      director of the Armed Services panel, aide to Sen. Sam Nunn      (D-Ga.) for 23 years and a Marine Corps Reserve brigadier      general, had masterminded the move. The sources, from other      services, alleged that Punaro was preparing a billet for      himself for next year after Nunn retires from the Senate.       Punaro, who had heard the rumor, reacted sharply to it.       ``The new active-duty Marine Corps general officer      positions have nothing whatsoever to do with my future,'' he      said. ``I will remain a civilian when I leave my current      position with the Senate Armed Services Committee.''       Committee sources said Punaro stayed out of the issue other      than to sit in on briefings by Krulak in Nunn's office.
