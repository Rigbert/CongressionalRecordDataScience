 Gasoline prices are another illustration. These prices have gone up dramatically in the State of California and in the State of Illinois. What has this administration done about it? Nothing. A cost to business, a cost to families, a cost out of the bottom line of the paycheck people bring home, and this administration refuses to confront OPEC about fair gasoline prices.  Why do family health care premiums continue to be the No. 1 issue across America, ignored by the Bush administration, ignored by the Republican leaders in this Congress? Because the leaders in this Congress and the Republican Party refuse to confront the health care insurance industries, the pharmaceutical companies, and those that are driving up the cost of health care. Those special interest groups are sacred cows in this town, and because the Republican leadership will not confront them, American families are being victimized by them.  These are the issues that families care about. They are the ones we are going to bring to this Presidential campaign, and they are the ones the Republican leadership wants to ignore. They want us to rush off and debate at length constitutional amendments that, frankly, are going nowhere.  I am happy to yield to my colleague from California for a question.
