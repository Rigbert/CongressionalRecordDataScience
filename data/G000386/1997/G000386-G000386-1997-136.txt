 President, I know that all of us agree there is no greater national treasure this Nation has than our children. Nurturing and encouraging them to live up to their potential is one of the most important things we can do. That is why our educational system must be the best it can be and our Nation's educators must be the best they can be. But there is something that I believe all the members of congress need to be aware of because it may have a profound and lasting effect on educators throughout the country. I am referring to the ongoing merger talks between the National Education Association and the American Federation of Teachers.  This matter is of prime importance to NEA members across the United States and I know it is of tremendous importance to the Iowa State Education Association. It is disturbing that many members of the NEA are not aware of this because this is not just joining of two teachers' organizations. Given the AFT's affiliation with the AFL-CIO and the apparent willingness of the NEA to accede to the demands of the AFT. Should the merger go through, this new organization would be a member of the AFL-CIO, which could have tremendous policy implications for the largest organization representing educators. For that reason, I urge other members of congress to read the article I am submitting for consideration.  The article follows:                   Will ISEA Part Ways With the NEA?                          (By James Flansburg)       The Iowa State Education Association is thinking about      dropping its affiliation with the National Education      Association.       At ISEA's annual meeting in Ames in early April, a number      of members said they fear that the NEA is moving toward a      militant unionism that could severely harm professionalism in      teaching.       The course being followed by the NEA would take away the      independence of local and State affiliates, while, at the      same time, putting them deeply into partisan politics and      formal efforts to control local school boards and policies.       ISEA represents about 35,000 Iowa teachers, and a vast      majority of them have misgivings over terms of a proposed      merger between NEA and the late Albert Shanker's American      Federation of Teachers, AFL-CIO.       Critics of the proposed merger contend that, more than an      endeavor to improve the lot of teachers, it's a surreptitious      effort aimed at strengthening the labor movement and      rebuilding the Democratic Party.       NEA has a membership of about 2.2 million and AFT about      800,000, but the merger terms being pushed by NEA's national      leaders endorse AFT's way of doing business instead of the      more moderate approach of the traditional NEA.       An indication of that came in a February speech by NEA      President Robert Chase at a National Press Club luncheon.       ``I came here this afternoon to introduce the new National      Education Association--the new union we are striving to      create in public education,'' he said.       Chase called for ``building an entirely new union-     management relationship in public education.''       No one knows more than teachers what schools need, he said:      ``higher academic standards; stricter discipline; an end to      social promotions; less bureaucracy; more resources where      they count, in the classroom; schools that are richly      connected to parents and to the communities that surround      them.''       ``To this end,'' he continued ``we aim not so much to      redirect the NEA, as to reinvent it.       ``The new direction . . . is about action. It is about      changing how each of our local affiliates does business,      changing how they bargain, changing what issues they put on      the table, changing the ways they help their members to      become the best teachers they can be.''       The union's goal? ``An agreement that allows teachers, in      effect, to co-manage the school district.''       Terms of the NEA-AFT merger would make the new organization      a member of the AFL-CIO, with the power to override the      concerns of local and State affiliates.       Such things as student welfare and professional teachers'      concerns and local school conditions could be lost in the      dust of battle over union politics, local and national, and      wages, hours and working conditions.       Local concerns would come behind the union's national      priorities. A community might find itself held hostage by      national union goals that have nothing to do with the      community itself.       The new national organization would have the power to take      control of local and state organizations for refusing to      follow the national organization's policy and political      lines.       In effect, it would have the power to trample the      professional and ethical considerations that have led the      huge majority of teachers in Iowa and the nation to join a      professional association such as ISEA rather than a local of      the AFT.       The Iowa and New Jersey state affiliates of NEA have been      the most vocal critics of the merger terms, which seem      basically dictated by the AFT's power sources in New York and      other big urban centers.       Although a substantial majority of teachers across the      country may oppose merger terms, top NEA officials and      staffers have the power to bring it off.       That's because a number of state organizations are      financially dependent on NEA and have little choice except to      do its bidding.       ISEA, in contrast, is not financially dependent on NEA. But      it might have to drop its affiliation with NEA to avoid being      taken over by the newly merged organization.       So the ISEA has no alternative but to think about and start      making contingency plans to cancel its NEA affiliation.       The details of that dominated a number of private      discussions at the ISEA's delegate assembly at the Hilton      Coliseum at Ames in April.       In most places, the merger seems a well-kept secret.       The idea is to keep the implications of the merger from the      teachers in the states where local organizations and their      leaders are beholden to NEA and AFT leaders.       ISEA has kept Iowa teachers up to date on the merger talks,      and has advocated that other state organizations mirror the      effort.       ``The more information that comes out on the proposed      merger, the more the membership seems disinclined to do it,''      said one person who has been following the merger talks.       It's probably not hard to find people who would dismiss all      this as intramural arm wrestling between two unions.       That may well be. For the public, it may not make any      difference which view prevails.       I've fought with ISEA over the years, and have been soundly      denounced by dozens of teachers for dismissing it as little      more than a trade union.       Whatever. If I were an Iowa teacher, I'd be against the      merger because it surely would take away all hopes of the      organization ever becoming a professional association that      cared about anything except wages and hours.       On a practical basis, moreover, a merger would take away      the implicit threat that many teachers' groups now are able      to use.       Deal with the moderate ISEA or its equivalent, they lead      the school boards and others to believe, or you may end up      with the blood-letting unionism of the AFT.       On the other hand, I'd choose the AFT's militance before      I'd relegate Iowa teachers to the kind of second-class      citizenship--lots of respect and no money and no say about      their working conditions--they suffered under before they      acquired the ability to collectively bargain with the school      districts about 25 years ago.                          ____________________
