President, the Collins/Warner teacher relief amendment would support the expenditures of teachers who strive for excellence beyond the constraints of what their schools can provide. Our amendment enjoys the bipartisan support of several of our colleagues, including Senators Landrieu, Cochran, Allen, Gordon Smith, Harkin, Mikulski, Jack Reed, DeWine, Hutchinson, Dodd, and Enzi as well as the endorsement of the National Education Association, American Federation of Teachers, American Association of School Administrators, National School Boards Association, National Association of State Boards of Education, Council for Exceptional Children, National Center for Learning Disabilities, and the National Board for Professional Teaching Standards support the Collins/Warner Teacher Relief Amendment of 2001. I ask unanimous consent these support letters be printed in the Record.  There being no objection, the material ordered to be printed in the Record, as follows:                               National Education Association,                                     Washington, DC, May 16, 2001.     Senator Susan Collins,     U.S. Senate,     Washington, DC.       Dear Senator Collins: On behalf of the National Education      Association's (NEA) 2.6 million members, we would like to      express our support for your amendment to the Senate tax bill      to provide tax benefits for educators' professional      development and classroom supply expenses.       As you know, teacher quality is the single most critical      factor in maximizing student achievement. Ongoing      professional development is essential to ensure that teachers      stay up-to-date on the skills and knowledge necessary to      prepare students for the challenges of the 21st century. Your      proposed tax deduction for professional development expenses      will make a critical difference in helping educators access      quality training.       We are also very pleased that your amendment would provide      a tax credit for educators who reach into their own pockets      to pay for necessary classroom materials, including books,      pencils, paper, and art supplies. A 1996 NEA study found that      the average K-12 teacher spent over $400 a year out of      personal funds for classroom supplies. For teachers earning      modest salaries, the purchase of classroom supplies      represents a considerable expense for which they often must      sacrifice other personal needs.       We thank you for your leadership in introducing this      important amendment and look forward to continuing to work      with you to support our nation's educators.           Sincerely,                                           Mary Elizabeth Teasley,     Director of Government Relations.                                  ____         National Board for Professional Teaching            StandardsTM,                                      Arlington, VA, May 21, 2001.     Hon. Susan Collins,     U.S. Senate,     Washington, DC.       Dear Senator Collins: The National Board for Professional      Teaching Standards (NBPTS) is pleased to lend its support to      the Teacher Relief Act of 2001 as an amendment to H.R. 1836,      the Tax Reconciliation Bill. As you know, National Board      Certification is one of the most demanding and prestigious      voluntary professional development programs available to our      nation's teachers. The tax deductions proposed in the Teacher      Support Act of 2001 would provide much needed financial      relief to teachers seeking to improve their teaching      practice.       National Board Certified Teachers (NBCTs) are the best      example of quality teaching and National Board Certification      reflects the highest standards in professional development      and assessment. Allowing teachers to deduct professional      development expenses, such as those associated with National      Board Certification, is an important supplement to the      policies and programs of states and school districts that      support the mission of the NBPTS to establish high and      rigorous standards for what accomplished teachers should know      and be able to do.       We look forward to continuing our work with you in      promoting the vital link between high quality professional      development and higher student achievement.           Sincerely,                                                     Betty Castor,     President.                                  ____         National Association of State Boards of Education,                                     Alexandria, VA, May 21, 2001.     Hon. Susan Collins,     U.S. Senate,     Washington, DC.       Dear Senator Collins: We are writing to applaud your      efforts to provide tax benefits for elementary and secondary      school teachers through the Teacher Relief Act, which will be      offered as an amendment to S. 1, the Better Education for      Students and Teachers Act (BEST). Teachers are the most      influential school-based factor in a student's academic      success. Your legislation will not only facilitate better      trained teachers, but reward teachers for their classroom      investments.       Quality professional development activities can      significantly increase student learning and improve teaching      practice. Allowing K-12 teachers a $500 annual tax deduction      for professional development expenses is a straightforward      solution to help promote on-going teacher training that is      individually directed and designed. It is one important      element in realizing the ultimate goal of effective and      comprehensive professional development programs.       In addition to their time, teachers also pay for a      significant amount of their classroom and instructional      materials out of their own pockets. Because these expenses      are frequently not reimbursed, they constitute an educational      donation that is too often overlook. Your proposal addresses      this fact by providing teachers with a 50% tax credit (up to      $250 annually) for out of pocket classroom expenses that will      financially reimburse teachers and enrich students' classroom      settings.       We appreciate your efforts and attention to address this      critical situation. NASBE     looks forward to working with your office to enact federal      initiatives benefiting the instructional needs of America's      teachers.           Sincerely,                                                   David Griffith,     Director of Governmental Affairs.                                  ____                                              American Association                                     of School Administrators,                                                     May 17, 2001.     Senator Susan Collins,     Russell Senate Office Building, Washington, DC.       Dear Senator Collins: On behalf of the American Association      of School Administrators, representing more than 14,000      public school superintendents and school system leaders, we      would like to express our strong support for the Collins/     Warner/Landrieu teacher tax credit amendment (amendment      #675).       Passage of the Teacher Relief Act would provide teachers      with two well-deserved benefits: a tax deduction for      professional development and a tax credit for out-of-pocket      classroom expenses. Together with Senators John Warner and      Mary Landrieu you have outlined a solution to a critical      problem facing teachers and educational professionals: the      lack of reimbursement for excess expenses incurred by      teachers. All too often schools lack the funds to provide      teachers with adequate classroom supplies or continuing      education. Dedicated teachers frequently opt to pay for      books, paper, supplies, and professional development with      their own money. Ideally we should not be asking our teachers      to make such a burdensome financial sacrifice; the least we      can do is make sure that those teachers are partially      reimbursed for their expenses.       The Collins/Warner/Landrieu amendment should not be thought      of as a tax benefit for teachers; it should be thought of as      educational reform. The Teacher Relief Act helps guarantee      that America's children are taught by qualified professionals      in well-equipped classrooms. Thank you for your continuing      support of public education.           Sincerely,                                                     Jordan Cross,                                           Legislative Specialist.  In fact, the tax deductions proposed in the Teacher Support Act of 2001 would provide much-needed financial relief to teachers seeking to improve their teaching practice through advanced course work, and assist those teachers seeking advanced certification, such as the National Board or additional educational endorsements.  In the midst of the education and tax debates, we are asking our colleagues in the Senate now to overlook the selfless efforts of teachers and the financial sacrifices they make to improve their instructional skills and the classrooms in which they teach.  Senator Warner deserves enormous credit for focusing the Senate's attention, through a sense-of-the-Senate resolution to the education bill, on the need to provide tax relief for our teachers.  Senator Warner's sense-of-the-Senate resolution which I was proud to cosponsor, passed by a vote of 95-3.  Our amendment would first allow teachers, teacher's aides, principals, and counselors to take an above-the-line tax deduction for their professional development expenses.  Second, the bill would grant educators a tax credit of up to $250 for books, supplies, and equipment they purchase for their students. The tax credit would be established at 50 percent of such expenditures, so for every dollar in supplies a teacher spent, the teacher would receive 50 cents of tax relief.  I greatly admire the many educators who have voluntarily reached deep into their pockets to pay for additional training and course work for themselves, and also to finance additional supplies and materials for their students. By enacting these modest changes to our Tax Code, we can encourage educators to continue to take the formal course work in the subject matter which they teach and to avail themselves of other professional development opportunities.  The relief that our Tax Code now provides to teachers is simply not sufficient. By and large, most teachers do not benefit from the current provisions that allow for limited deductibility of professional development and classroom expenses. Teachers, out of their own generosity, are reaching deep into their pockets to improve their teaching.  Now, under the current law, the problem is that teachers do not reach a sufficient level to be able to deduct the costs of their professional development and classroom supplies. By allowing teachers to take the above-the-line deduction for professional development expenses and a credit for classroom expenses paid out of pocket, our amendment takes a fair, progressive approach that will provide a modicum of relief to our Nation's schoolteachers.  I should note that most of our colleagues have already voted for very similar legislation. Last year, Senator Kyl, Senator Coverdell, and I offered a similar amendment to the Affordable Education Act, which was adopted unanimously.  President Bush has eloquently stated: ``Teachers sometimes lead with their hearts and pay with their wallets.''  Our amendment makes it a priority to reimburse educators for just a small part of what they invest in the futures of our children.  I hope our colleagues will join us in support of this important legislation.  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Carper). The Senator from Virginia.
