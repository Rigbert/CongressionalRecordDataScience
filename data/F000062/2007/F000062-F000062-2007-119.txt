 President, I rise to introduce legislation to correct a longstanding flaw in the Medicare Geographic Practice Cost Index, GPCI, system that negatively impacts physicians in California and several other states.  This legislation will allow counties that are underpaid by at least 5 percent to be reclassified into a payment locality that reflects their own geographic costs.  It holds harmless the counties, predominately rural ones, whose locality average would otherwise drop as other counties are reclassified.  Finally, this legislation is fully offset by requiring that independent diagnostic laboratories comply with state and federal regulations. This will allow the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid services, CMS, to take action against unscrupulous operators, predominately in California, that seek Medicare reimbursements for inaccurate and unnecessary diagnostic testing.  This legislation would benefit physicians who are currently underpaid in 10 States: California, Florida, Georgia, Illinois, Maryland, Massachusetts, Michigan, Missouri, Texas, and Washington.  Congressman Sam Farr has introduced companion legislation, H.R. 2484, in the House of Representatives, which now has 12 cosponsors.  The Medicare Geographic Practice Cost Index measures the cost of providing a Medicare covered service in a geographic area. Medicare payments are supposed to reflect the varying costs of rent, malpractice insurance, and other expenses necessary to operate a medical process. Counties are assigned to ``payment localities'' that are supposed to accurately capture these costs.  Here is the problem: some of these payment localities have not changed since 1997. Others have been in place since 1966. Many areas that were rural even 10 years have experienced significant population growth, as metropolitan areas and suburbs have spread. Many counties now find themselves in payment localities that do not accurately reflect their true practice costs.  These payment discrepancies have a real and serious impact on physicians and the Medicare beneficiaries they are unable to serve. My home State of California has been hit particularly hard.  San Diego County physicians are underpaid by 5.5 percent. A number of physicians have left the county and 60 percent of remaining San Diego physicians report that they cannot recruit new doctors to their practices.  Santa Cruz County receives a 10.2 percent underpayment, and as a result, no physicians are accepting new Medicare patients. Instead, they are moving to neighboring Santa Clara, which has similar practice cost expense, but is reimbursed at a rate that is at least 22 percent higher. This means that seniors often need to travel at least 20 miles to see a physician.  Sacramento County, a major metropolitan area, is underpaid by 4.6 percent. The county's population has grown by 9.6 percent, while the number of physicians has declined by 11 percent.  Sonoma County physicians are paid at least 8 percent less than their geographic practice costs. They have experienced at 10 percent decline in specialists and a 9 percent decline in primary care physicians.  Seniors' Medicare cards are of no value if physicians in their community cannot afford to provide them with health care.  The underpayment problem grows more severe every year, and the longer we wait to address it, the more drastic the solution will need to be. This legislation provides a common sense solution, increasing payment for those facing the most drastic underpayments, while protecting other counties from cuts in the process.  This is an issue of equity. It costs more to provide health care in expensive areas, and physicians serving our seniors must be fairly compensated.  I urge my colleagues to support this legislation. I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be printed in the Record.  There being no objection, the text of the bill was ordered to be printed in the Record, as follows:                                S. 1964       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of      the United States of America in Congress assembled,     SECTION 1. ESTABLISHMENT OF NEW SEPARATE MEDICARE PHYSICIAN                    FEE SCHEDULE AREAS IN STATES WITH MULTIPLE FEE                    SCHEDULE AREAS TO IMPROVE MEDICARE PHYSICIAN                    GEOGRAPHIC PAYMENT ACCURACY.       (a) In General.--Section 1848(e) of the Social Security Act      (42 U.S.C. 1395w-4(e)) is amended by adding at the end the      following new paragraph:       ``(6) Establishment of separate fee schedule areas in      states with multiple fee schedule areas to improve physician      geographic payment accuracy.--For purposes of computing and      applying the geographic adjustment factor under subsection      (b)(1)(C) and this subsection in the case of a State that      includes more than one fee schedule area--       ``(A) the Secretary shall establish as a separate fee      schedule area each county or equivalent fee schedule area the      geographic adjustment factor for which would (if such      separate areas are established and before taking into account      the adjustment under this subparagraph) be 5 percent or more      above the geographic adjustment factor for such revised      locality; and       ``(B) for such a locality from which a separate fee      schedule area is established under subparagraph (A), the      geographic adjustment factor indices shall in no case be less      than the geographic adjustment factor otherwise computed if      this paragraph did not apply.     The Secretary shall first apply the previous sentence to      services furnished during 2008 and shall again apply it each      third year thereafter.''.       (b) Offsetting Funding Through Requirement for Annual      Certification of Compliance With State Licensure Requirements      for Independent Diagnostic Testing Facilities (IDTF).--       (1) In general.--Section 1862(a) of the Social Security Act      (42 U.S.C. 1395y(a)) is amended--       (A) by striking ``or'' at the end of paragraph (21);       (B) by striking the period at the end of paragraph (22) and      inserting ``; or''; and       (C) by inserting after paragraph (22) the following new      paragraph:       ``(23) where such expenses are for a diagnostic laboratory      test under section 1861(s)(3) performed in an independent      diagnostic testing facility in a State or locality described      in section 1861(s)(16) unless within the previous 12 months      the State or locality (whichever is or are applicable) has      certified that the facility is in compliance with all      applicable State (or local) licensure requirements.''.       (2) Effective date.--The amendments made by paragraph (1)      shall apply to tests performed on or after January 1, 2008.                                 ______                                       By
