Speaker, I rise today to recognize and honor Howard H. ``Tim'' Hays who recently passed away at the age of 94. He will be deeply missed.  Mr. Hays spent 51 years at the Riverside Press Enterprise, the sixth largest newspaper in the state of California. Before coming to the newspaper, Mr. Hays was an FBI Special Agent during World War II. In 1946, he joined the paper as an Assistant Editor and also passed the California bar exam. The Riverside Press Enterprise wrote an article detailing the many accomplishments of Mr. Hays and the incredible contributions he made to the newspaper, the community and the country.                            [Oct. 14, 2011]             Former P-E Publisher and Editor Tim Hays Dies       Howard H. ``Tim'' Hays, Jr., the Harvard-educated lawyer      who chose a newspaperman's life and led what became The      Press-Enterprise into national prominence as a Pulitzer      Prize-winning advocate of open government and defender of the      First Amendment, died Friday in St. Louis. He was 94.       Mr. Hays had been struggling with Alzheimer's disease, his      son Tom Hays said Friday. He said his father died in the      afternoon at Barnes-Jewish Hospital following a brief acute      illness.       Mr. Hays spent 51 years at The Press-Enterprise. He was an      FBI special agent during World War II and joined the      newspaper as assistant editor in 1946. He passed the bar the      same year but never practiced law.       His subsequent roles included editor, co-publisher,      publisher and chairman. He continued as chairman until 1997,      when The Press-Enterprise was sold to the A.H. Belo Co.,      ending 67 years of family ownership of the Riverside-based      newspaper.       The news organization's five-story office on Fourteenth      Street was named in 2006 as the Howard H. ``Tim'' Hays Media      Center.       ``Tim was a rarity, a man whose moral compass was set on      true,'' said Mel Opotowsky, the former managing editor of The      Press-Enterprise. ``That is especially important as a      newspaper owner because of the obligation as a public trust.      There are many instances of Tim's beneficence, not only to      his employees, but to his readers and to principles of      quality journalism.''       Mr. Hays once joked that his choice of journalism over law      and his ``semi-meteoric rise'' at the newspaper were due to      ``diligence, and the fact that my father was co-owner.''       Courtly, soft-voiced and with a penchant for remembering      anyone's name, from civic leaders to cleaning crews in the      hallways of his newspaper, Mr. Hays' personality contrasted      sharply with flamboyant news-executive contemporaries. His      memos were to his ``Fellow Employees.''       But his reserved manner was matched with a steely resolve.       He stood up to pressure and confrontation to lead his      newspaper to a Pulitzer Prize. He took two open-government      cases to the U.S. Supreme Court, winning both.       Media attorneys use shorthand to refer to two landmark      cases won by the newspaper, Press-Enterprise One and Two.       In January 1984, the newspaper won a case establishing the      public's right to attend jury selection in criminal trial      proceedings. In a 1986 case, the court asserted the right of      the public to attend pre-trial hearings in criminal cases      with few exceptions.       Mr. Hays oversaw publication of a series of articles in      1967 that exposed malpractice in the conservatorship program      for Agua Caliente Indians in Palm Springs. Editorials      combined with more than 100 stories, mostly written by      reporter George Ringwald, earned the newspaper the Pulitzer      Prize for meritorious public service in 1968. (Ringwald died      in 2005.)       During the newspaper's reporting of that issue, a judge who      was under investigation became infuriated by a Press-     Enterprise editorial and ordered Mr. Hays arrested.       The publisher stood his ground and was not jailed.       Mr. Hays also stood by his reporters, even as advertisers      took their business away in protest over investigative      pieces.       Despite national recognition, Mr. Hays kept his community      at the foreground of his work. He was among the civic leaders      who worked to get a University of California campus      established here. UC Riverside opened in 1954.       ``Tim had a very active mind that saw beyond the ordinary      but was able to bring it down to earth,'' said his former      executive secretary, Jean Wingard. ``He was an excellent      newsman, and had the respect of those who worked with him and      for him.''       Mr. Hays established the Hays Press-Enterprise Lecture in      1966, which was underwritten in 1998 by a $100,000 endowment      after the newspaper was sold.       The free lectures, open to the public, featured leaders in      news media, including retired Washington Post Executive      Editor Ben Bradlee; Gene Roberts, former managing editor of      the New York Times; and W. Thomas Johnson, who was then      president of Cable News Network.       Mr. Hays also undertook the cause of preserving the Mission      Inn.       He and other civic leaders maintained their effort during a      seven-year stretch in which the state and national historic      landmark in downtown Riverside was closed--at one time      surrounded by a chain-link fence.       Several attempts to reopen the Inn failed. Some suggested      the land was a prime spot for a parking lot. In 1992, Duane      Roberts bought the hotel and invested millions of dollars in      renovations.       The Press-Enterprise under Mr. Hays also quietly helped to      underwrite local cultural and arts organizations.       ``I'm not married to any cause,'' Mr. Hays once said. ``I      believe in generosity to the community in which you live. I      think you can contribute more with time and energy than with      dollars. But I guess the money can be pretty dandy, too.''       Retired appellate court Justice John Gabbert said Mr. Hays,      similar to his brothers, developed his sense of community      engagement early in life.       ``He was motivated by the very strong civic background that      he probably inherited from his father,'' Gabbert said Friday.      ``They were all there, out in the community, making it      better.''       Contemporaries of Mr. Hays said he was less likely to      deliver a fiery speech, and more likely to argue his points      over lunch or in a casual conversation. Former state Sen.      Robert Presley said each time he would meet Mr. Hays at the      same downtown Riverside restaurant, the publisher would prod      him for support of downtown Riverside projects.       ``He didn't seem to have a lot of ego, although he could be      vigorous and persuasive in his arguments,'' Presley said      Friday from Sacramento.       ``He was a very special person,'' said Marcia McQuern who      worked for Hays at The Press-Enterprise and eventually became      the paper's publisher. ``He had a true journalist's heart. He      always tried to live up to his standards and ideals.''       McQuern remembered Hays being well tied into the community.      So much so that he often knew what was going on before his      reporters did.       ``I would come to him with a story and he'd say, `You      finally found that out,' '' she said. ``But he never would      kill anything.''       Even when it may have been unpopular among the community      leaders he mingled with.       ``He took a lot of heat. He really stuck by the newsroom.      That's where his heart was,'' she said.       McQuern remembered one instance where the paper wanted the      name behind a large anonymous donation to UC Riverside.       ``We fought for access,'' she said. ``He let us go fight      for the information. We were about to file suit and he      finally admitted it was him.''       Howard H. ``Tim'' Hays, Jr. was born in Chicago on June 2,      1917, the son of Howard H. Hays, Sr. and Margaret Mauger      Hays. He came to Riverside with his parents in 1924.       A graduate of Riverside Polytechnic High School, he was      editor of the school newspaper, Poly Spotlight, during his      senior year.       Mr. Hays earned a bachelor's degree in social sciences at      Stanford University, graduating in 1939.       In 1942, he received a law degree from Harvard Law School.      After his service with the FBI, he briefly served as a      reporter at the San Bernardino Sun before joining the family      newspaper and beginning his leadership role in American      journalism.       Mr. Hays moved to St. Louis part time in 1989, and began      living there full time after his retirement from The Press-     Enterprise, his son Tom said.       In a message read at the 2007 dedication of the news      building named after him, Mr. Hays noted that he still read      every day the newspaper that he had led for so long.       Survivors include wife Susie Hays of St. Louis, sons Bill      Hays of Corona Del Mar and Tom Hays of New York City, and      brother Dan Hays of Riverside. His brother, William H. Hays,      died earlier this year. Mr. Hays' first wife, Helen Hays      Yeager, died two years earlier, to the day, of Mr. Hays'      death.       Said Tom Hays, ``He lived a very long and productive and      fortunate life, and he died very peacefully, so we are      thankful for that.''       Mr. Hays will always be remembered for his incredible work      ethic, generosity, love of     family, and the numerous contributions he made to the      newspaper industry. His dedication to the integrity of the      newspaper, the protection of the First Amendment and to the      community as a whole are a testament to a life lived well and      a legacy that will continue. I extend my condolences to Mr.      Hays' family and friends. Although Mr. Hays may be gone, the      light and goodness he brought to the world remain and will      never be forgotten.                          ____________________
