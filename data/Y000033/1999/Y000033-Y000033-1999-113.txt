Mr. Chairman, as my good friend from Utah has mentioned, the administration is adamantly opposing the amendment and so is the International Association of Fish and Wildlife.  But it never ceases to amaze me. The gentleman from Virginia (Mr. Moran) has never seen a trap in his life. He has never seen a trap. He has never trapped. I am the only licensed trapper in this whole Congress, the only person who has ever done any trapping commercially and for subsistence.  I will tell my colleagues what really disturbs me is that they are not looking at a management tool. But more than that, my colleagues wonder why I am upset about this.  We have in my State a group of people that have to have trapping for their welfare. These are native people that they have surrounded by refuge lands. Yes, they say, they can do it for subsistence. But this is not for subsistence. This is for a livelihood. And my colleagues are going to take it away from them.  I did not want that refuge, but it was created by this Congress around most of the villages of native people in my State.  What the gentleman from California (Mr. Farr) is doing is taking the poor little guy and squishing him and eliminating his ability to make any livelihood at all.  Now, I am ashamed of the gentleman for not even thinking of that. If my colleagues want to exclude Alaska, that is their business; but that is what should have been done. But they are hurting my people.  I again say I am the only trapper that has done this professionally. I have never hurt an animal. The trap works efficiently, as the Department of the Interior says it does. It is a tool that must be used.  By the way, if my colleague has an antitrap law in his State, he cannot trap on Federal lands. If he wants to do it, pass it in his State. But do not mess with my State.
