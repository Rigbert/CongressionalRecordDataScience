Mr. Chairman, that may be the argument of the gentlewoman. That is not the way the amendment reads, and we have to go by the way the amendment is offered before the House.  ``Each amount appropriated or otherwise made available by this act is hereby reduced by 3 percent.'' That means you go through the bill, pick out the items that are not mandatory, that are not entitlements, and they will be reduced by 3 percent.  All of the debate will not change that, and I say again that part of those accounts are O&M and personnel. $4.5 billion of this reduction would be applied to those two accounts. That is where the pay raise comes from.  What else comes from that? Barracks. We have heard all year long about the sad condition of so many of our barracks. Pentagon officials who testified told us if you drive your kids up to college and their dormitories looked like these barracks, you would put them in the car, take them home; you would not let them stay. That is not fair that your military personnel have to live in facilities like that.  During the break I had a chance to visit some of the military bases, and I have seen some of the barracks that go back to World War II. The tiles are falling off the ceiling. The pipes are leaking. The money is not there to either rebuild them or refurbish them.  So they are in poor condition, and they need to be corrected.  What about promotions? This would, in effect, stall a lot of promotions that are already scheduled. The members of the military are already starting to spend the money in their mind. Some of the promotions are not going to be able to go forward.  As we put this bill together, we did not add a lot of new money for procurement. We did not start up any nice, new, big programs. But what we did, we looked at all of the services, and we tried to isolate and identify those areas where there were real shortages of items that we have to have, and what called this to my attention was that at one of our earlier hearings this year we were talking about airplanes and buying new airplanes, and the witness who was testifying told us, ``We are not so much worried about the airplanes. We are short of tugs to draw the airplanes from the hangars out to the runway,'' and it got me thinking, I wonder how many items there are out there like that that nobody has ever heard about that could actually stop the operation of our military forces.  So I assigned the staff of the subcommittee to identify for me items that nobody has ever heard about but that are essential and important to the conduct of our military forces, and with the help of this page I am going to unravel this long list of items you have never read about in the newspaper, you have never heard about on television, because they are not politically sexy, but they are things that are essential to maintaining our military.                              {time}  1715  Now here is where we added money, and, if we have to take a 3-percent reduction, we are going to lose a lot of this, things like trucks. I visited one Army facility. They had trucks that go back to Harry Truman's Presidency.  We have added additional money in this bill to buy some new trucks to replace those old trucks that cost more to maintain than to try to use them.  What were some of the other shortfalls?  Believe it or not, ammunition, shortfalls in ammunition. We are correcting that. We are adding additional money to buy ammunition.  What about rifles? Who would ever think that the U.S. Army would be short on rifles? But we are. Certain types of rifles the U.S. Army has a shortage.  Look at the testimony the Army testified today. Real property maintenance, depot maintenance; those are the kind of things we put in this bill.  As I said, we did not create a lot of new programs, we did not start any massive new procurement programs or weapon systems. We are trying to enhance those that we have; we are trying to take care of the nuts and bolts to keep the machinery working.  Mr. Chairman, it reminds me of a statement that my grandmother taught me many, many years ago, and I have later learned that she was not the author, but she related it to me. and that was for the want of a nail the shoe was lost, and for want of the shoe the horse was lost, and for want of the horse the rider was lost, and it goes on to tell how the battle was lost. Well, this list I have just unrolled here, these are my horseshoe nails. We want to make sure we did not lose anything important because we did not provide for the horseshoe nail.  This 3-percent across-the-board cut is going to cut into the increases that we made in some of those nonsexy, nonpolitical, but important, issues relative to those who serve in the Armed Forces, and again, Mr. Chairman, the gentlewoman would argue that her amendment does not do that, but in fact it is exactly what it does.
