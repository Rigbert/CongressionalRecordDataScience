 I am not trying to be an obstructionist at all. No. 1, I am told by my staff--A, I don't know about the amendment, notwithstanding it has been filed. I have been concentrating on other things. No. 2, I am told by my staff--and they may be incorrect; staff as well as Senators often are--the fact is that I am told that Senator Helms has not signed off on any amendment yet.
