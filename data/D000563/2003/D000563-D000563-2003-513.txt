Is it not true if the jury knows that the plaintiff's family, in David's case, has health insurance which is going to pay for some of his medical costs, which are obviously going to be extensive, that this is likely to diminish the amount that will have to be paid by the party responsible for David's condition?  I ask the Senator, he suggested earlier that this should not be about punishment. Is there not a question of accountability? If the doctor in this case did not monitor his temperature leading to quadriplegia and a lifetime of pain and suffering, is there not a question of holding that doctor accountable rather than his parents for having the foresight of buying insurance?
