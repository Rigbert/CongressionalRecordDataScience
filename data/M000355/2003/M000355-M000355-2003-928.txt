 President, the assistant Democratic leader and I have been working over the last few hours to come up with a consent agreement with regard to handling the debt limit. We have now reached agreement.  Therefore, I ask unanimous consent that at a time to be determined by the majority leader, in consultation with the Democratic leader, the Senate proceed to the consideration of Calendar No. 80, H.J. Res. 51, the debt limit extension; that first-degree amendments be limited to 12 per side, with relevant second-degree amendments in order; provided that no amendments with respect to gun liability or hate crimes be in order on either side; that upon disposition of all amendments, the joint resolution as amended, if amended, be read the third time, and the Senate then vote on passage of the joint resolution without further intervening action or debate.
