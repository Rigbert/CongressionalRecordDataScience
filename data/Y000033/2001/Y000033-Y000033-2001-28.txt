Mr. Chairman, it is with sadness that I announce the death of Mr. Frederick G. Mohrman.  Fred died at his home in Grayson, Kentucky early this morning. His wife, Jan, was with him when he died.  Fred served as clerk and staff director of the Committee on Appropriations from 1984 to 1995. He was born November 24, 1932, a graduate of Kansas State College. He joined the Committee on Appropriations on January 1, 1975. Two years later he was appointed clerk of the Subcommittee on Interior. He became clerk and staff director of the Committee on Appropriations in February of 1985.  He retired from committee service in 1996, having served both Republican and Democrat majorities here in the House.  A veteran of the U.S. Air Force, he is survived by his wife, Jan, and 5 children: Jana, Deke, Sean, Lisa, and Danny.  Fred Mohrman was very much an institution on our committee. He was a big, gentle man. He knew when to be kind and he knew when to be gruff. He protected the committee against all challenges, most of the time with great success. He knew the rules and how to use them for the benefit of all.  When he retired, he bought a piece of land in eastern Kentucky and became ``Farmin' Fritz.'' Each week he kept the committee updated with his new life.  Fred Mohrman leaves behind a legacy of loyalty, hard work, good humor, and a love of this institution. He will be greatly missed by all of us.  I am happy to yield to the gentleman from Wisconsin.
