Chairman, I rise in strong support of H.R. 2005, the Workplace Goods Job Growth and Competitiveness Act of 1999. H.R. 2005 is premised on the notion that a product which is used safely for a substantial period of time is not likely to have been defective at the time of manufacture, sale, or delivery. Any injury incurred after a reasonably long period of time is likely to have been due to either misuse or improper maintenance by someone other than the manufacturer. The longer the product is in use, the more difficult it is for the manufacturer to prove its product was not defective at the time it was manufactured. H.R. 2005 creates a uniform federal statute of repose for cases involving injury caused by durable goods. Currently, nineteen states have statutes of repose.  I have long recognized the need for a national statute of repose for products, including workplace durable goods. In fact, my first year as a Member of this body, I introduced one of the first federal statute of repose bills.  In sum, H.R. 2005 provides a balanced solution to the problem of endless liability, while protecting a claimant's right to bring suit for injuries incurred during the repose period. It places a reasonable outer time limit on litigation involving older products in the workplace, where injured claimants will have recourse to benefit from the worker compensation system. I commend my colleague, Mr. Chabot, for all his hard work on this long overdue, much needed legislation. I urge the passage of this legislation.
