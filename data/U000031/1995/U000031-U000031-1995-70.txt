Speaker, I am introducing today legislation to delay full implementation of the Clean Air Act by 2 years. As this program has unfolded, it is clear that it is generating more expense and disruption than was foreseen at enactment.  Most knowledgeable Americans still support the Clean Air Act's goals and most are willing to accept reasonable personal sacrifice to achieve those goals. But, as EPA tightens the program's enforcement screws, I fear a public backlash that could undermine support for the program itself. Americans are simply in no mood for Dracoian regulatory programs, especially when program benefits are so difficult to determine.  We have a situation in western Michigan that illustrates this point. A three county area generally around Grand Rapids and Muskegon is a nonattainment area. Studies by the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency and Michigan's Department of Natural Resources confirm that 80 to 90 percent of the pollution measured in this nonattainment area is not produced locally, but drifts across Lake Michigan from the industrial complexes on her western shore.  EPA is leaning hard on the State and on local agencies to take difficult steps to bring the area into compliance. These steps include a centralized or enhanced inspection and maintenance system for automobiles, a system that will be expensive and inconvenient. Three testing centers have been built in western Michigan at a cost of some $16 million but they have catalyzed great public outcry and their opening has been delayed.  EPA has required development of regional transportation plans to evaluate transportation proposals to insure that traffic generated by those proposals won't push the region over its ozone budget. As described by one local official:       We have to take into consideration all the variables,      including employment centers and traffic patterns, and      project those in place in future years. We then have to run      that data through the EPA's model and prove that the      resulting emissions are less than the base case, which is      1990.  This is a significant and questionable change in the way local governments have operated. Under such a system, it's hard to see what the function of local government will be. If all decisions are driven by Clean Air Act considerations, what is the residual role of State and local agencies? Is EPA to be a national office of planning, zoning and development?  The public has yet to be convinced that such heavyhanded regulation will achieve results worth the costs involved. In the case of enhanced inspection and maintenance, a 1992 study by the General Accounting Office found more than one in four cars that failed the initial emissions test subsequently passed a second emissions test even though no repairs were made to the vehicles.  In areas more severely out of compliance, EPA has advocated an array of programs including mandatory carpooling that will have even heavier impact on the daily lives of working Americans. Small wonder that these planning, inspection, and trip reduction strictures cause many to wonder if job creation and economic development are even possible in areas under EPA's regulatory thumb. Few of the people I represent, viewing EPA data on the steady improvement in air quality, truly believe that the problem demands such solutions.  Earlier today, I wrote to the new chairman of the Commerce Committee's Subcommittee on Health and the Environment urging two actions on him. First, I asked that he schedule informational hearings as soon as feasible to reexamine the Clean Air Act, the assumptions accepted at the time of enactment and the methods proposed for achieving the act's goals. Secondly, I asked him to support a postponement in further enforcement of the act.  I have in mind a time out to reassess the situation and to allow State and local agencies additional time to determine what needs to be done and to do it. The bill I am introducing today simply grants a 2-year delay in further EPA requirements and in the imposition of sanctions against those unable to fulfill them.  Mr. Speaker, a clear message in November's election results is that Americans are weary of big, complicated and burdensome Federal regulatory programs. The public is not convinced that they generate benefits commensurate with their costs. I urge my colleagues to join me in assuring that the Clean Air Act's results justify its costs.                          ____________________
