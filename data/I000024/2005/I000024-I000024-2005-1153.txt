President, if there is time during the course of this debate, even though we are operating under 1 hour equally divided, I want to go over, so everybody understands, why it is necessary to pass this bill instead of going with another extension because we do not get all the reforms we need without passing this bill.  I have to agree with the Senator from South Dakota that in order to get up to a higher figure in terms of the donor States--and there are a lot of donee States that are supporting us in this effort--it is necessary to have a more robust bill. I am sure we will have an opportunity to debate that and get to conference and see what we can work out.  The chairman of the Subcommittee on Transportation has been such a strong, hard worker. The Senator from Missouri has been there every step of the way and has been a part of this great bipartisan effort. So we yield to him at this time for whatever time he wishes to use.
