President, I rise today to recognize the valor and great sacrifice of the citizens in Frankfort, KS. Frankfort is a small town in northeast Kansas. It is a thriving rural community of approximately 855 people. In the early 1940s, just as today, Frankfort was teeming with good Americans, Americans who answered the call of duty and fought so that their fellow Americans could live in freedom.  But that alone is not what makes Frankfort notable. Brave men and women from small towns, big cities, and everywhere in America have served our Nation in the Armed Forces. Many have made the ultimate sacrifice.  What makes this town, then home to approximately 1,800 people, notable is the solemn fact that 32 brave men from Frankfort and the surrounding farmland gave their lives in World War II. Based on records from local county newspapers of that time, it is concluded that the Frankfort community lost more men in World War II than any other town of similar size. Thisfact imparts both a deep sense of pride for the bravery and commitment of these young Kansans and also sadness for the great loss of life that is inherent in times of war.  During my years in public service, I have experienced many opportunities to meet some amazing people and hear the incredible stories that truly define America. This is exactly how I have come to learn of this incredible contribution to our Nation's security. Frank Benteman, a World War II Army veteran, shared this story. Mr. Benteman, now 80 years old, is from Frankfort and was part of this ``greatest generation'' who served. It was Mr. Benteman who continues to honor those who went before by remembering their sacrifice and honoring their memory. I am pleased to work along with Frank Benteman to honor the heroes of Frankfort, KS, by entering their names into the Congressional Record in recognition of their ultimate sacrifice to a grateful nation.  The brave men from Frankfort, KS, who gave their lives in the great Second World War include Willard A. Backman, Fred Bentsen, Lloyd C. Blackney, Leland Cook, Melvin Cope, Elmer Crumpton, Kenneth DeWalt, Robert Emmingham, Victor Feldhausen, Peter Fiegener, William R. Gibson, Don Hockensmith, Jr., Dale C. Hooper, Milan E. Jester, Koester Johnston, Donald E. King, Vern F. Long, Weldon Maneval, Matt McKeon, Carl O. Nord, Aloysius Noud, Howard Olson, Paul A. Paden, Charles Poff, Charles L. Punteney, Theodore Rhodes, David L. Shyne, James Stoffel, Clifford Watson, Robert B. Welsh, Charles F. Zinn, and Munro Zoellner.
