Speaker, and my colleagues of the House, it is true that Republicans on three occasions have unanimously voted to up the debt limit to $5.5 trillion through September 1997. That is not the issue here. The issue is to try to jam the President of the United States, as I have said before.  Now, let me read a letter dated November 9, 1995, just 2 days ago. This is not a partisan issue. I quote from that letter:       While we may have differing views on the merits of the      various issues being raised in the budget debate, we share      the strong view that the debt limit should not be, should not      be, should not be, embroiled in that debate. We urge that      prompt action be taken to either raise the debt limit      permanently to a level that would accommodate either of the      budgets being proposed, or that a sufficient short-term      increase be enacted to allow the debate over priorities to      proceed in an orderly manner without impairing market      confidence in our Nation's commitment to discharge its      obligations.  Who signed that letter? Secretary Bentsen, Secretary under Clinton. Secretary Blumenthal, Secretary of the Treasury under Carter. Secretary George Shultz, Secretary of Labor and Secretary of the Treasury under Nixon and Secretary of State under Ronald Reagan. Secretary G. William Miller, Secretary of the Treasury under Carter. William E. Simon, Secretary of the Treasury under President Nixon and President Ford; and Secretary Fowler, Secretary under President Johnson.  In a letter dated June 28, 1990, from Secretary Brady, he said, ``I urge the Congress to act in a timely manner on a debt limit increase in order,'' he said, ``to avert a default with its adverse consequences on domestic and international confidence and trust in the United States.''  Be responsible. Reject this bill.
