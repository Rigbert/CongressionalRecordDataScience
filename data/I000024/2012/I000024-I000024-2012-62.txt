I regret that is the case. The problem is this would be the latest confirmation of a circuit court nominee during an election year in 20 years.  I was thinking today that I cannot vote against this guy, but I sure can vote present. If we have a 20-year precedent that was put in there by the Democrats and the Republicans alike, I wouldn't want to be the one to break that precedent. We are within 4 months of an election right now. It is very important that we do what we have done over the last 20 years and allow the new administration to come in.  The nomination of Robert Bacharach has been up there for 2 years before any action. You have to be a little suspicious as to why is he coming up right now. So I may end up voting present.  Mr. McCONNELL. I thank my friend from Oklahoma. He confirms that this is not about the nominee, who apparently is well qualified. This is about an approach that has developed over several decades called the Leahy-Thurmond rule, under which it has been the practice to kind of call a timeout within rather close proximity to an election. In 2008, the timeout was called in June. We are going to enter August at the end of this week.  I would say also to my friend from Oklahoma, we have confirmed for the President in this election year five circuit court nominees. President Bush in 2008 got four; President Bush in 2004 got five. We have not been unfair to the administration. And it is certainly no reflection on what is apparently an outstanding nominee from your State.  Mr. President, I yield the floor.
