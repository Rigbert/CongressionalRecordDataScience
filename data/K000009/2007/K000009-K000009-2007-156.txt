 Mr. Kazmaier will be honored at a special dinner ceremony tomorrow evening at Maumee High School, where he will donate to his alma mater a replica of his Heisman Trophy for display in a specially-made trophy case.  After graduating from Maumee High School in 1948, Mr. Kazmaier led Princeton University to back-to-back undefeated seasons in 1950 and 1951. He also led the Nation in total offense in 1951, operating as the lone back in the Tigers' single-wing formation. He received more Heisman votes than any other winner up to that time, and he finished more than 1,000 points ahead of the runnerup. He made the cover of Time Magazine.  And then Richard Kazmaier made a life-changing decision. He turned down an offer to play professionally for the Chicago Bears and decided instead to enter Harvard Business School, choosing the Ivy League over the National Football League.  After serving 3 years in the U.S. Navy, attaining the rank of lieutenant, Mr. Kazmaier went into business as president of Kazmaier and Associates, a sports marketing and financial services company. He was inducted into the College Football Hall of Fame in 1966. He later served on the board of trustees at Princeton University. He was a director of the Knight Foundation on Intercollegiate Athletics. He was appointed by President Ronald Reagan to the President's Council on Physical Fitness, and served as its chairman.  Richard Kazmaier never forgot his hometown, either. The Richard Kazmaier Scholarship Program at Maumee High School has awarded more than $153,000 in scholarships to student athletes over the past 17 years.  Madam Speaker, it is entirely appropriate that Richard Kazmaier, a two-time All-America at Princeton, will be feted in his hometown, because just last year Maumee gained acclaim as an All-America City. Congratulations are in order for Richard Kazmaier and also for the city of Maumee.                          ____________________
