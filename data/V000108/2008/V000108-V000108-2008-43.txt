This conference brought together leaders in energy research from the University of Notre Dame, the U.S. Department of Energy, Oak Ridge National Laboratory, Purdue University, the state of Indiana, and academic think tanks.  The University of Notre Dame Energy Center was established in 2005 to develop new technologies for energy efficiency, safe nuclear waste storage, clean coal utilization, CO2 separation and sequestration, and alternative renewable energy sources. The Center also plays a key role in energy education and literacy, affecting energy policy and exploring the ethical implications associated with energy sources, availability and policy. It involves approximately 25 faculty members in the Colleges of Engineering, Science, Arts & Letters and Business. The Notre Dame Energy Center and its faculty members have funding support from the U.S. Department of Energy and extensive collaborations with researchers at Sandia, Argonne National Labs and the National Energy Technology Laboratory.  Meeting U.S. energy needs in an environmentally sustainable manner without jeopardizing economic growth or national security interests through undue reliance on foreign energy sources is arguably our most demanding challenge. Achieving this goal will require multiple solutions and strategies. To meet this challenge, the University of Notre Dame, through their Energy Center and conferences such as this, combines existing research expertise and new research infrastructure with visionary thinkers from both Indiana and the federal government.  A collaboration also is currently being undertaken by the Notre Dame Energy Center that addresses the Indiana Dunes National Lakeshore, which is a resource that is very important to the Northwest Indiana community. This project seeks to provide energy-related consulting services to the park during the coming summer months that will promote the responsible use of an irreplaceable national treasure. As part of the project, students will track and quantify the cost savings related to energy use reduction and lower greenhouse gas emissions. This collaboration will help preserve the unique ecosystem of the IndianaDunes National Lakeshore and will allow future generations to enjoy this tremendous natural, educational, and recreational asset of Northwest Indiana.  I would like to thank Dr. Joan Brennecke and Dr. Paul Bohn for organizing the July 7th event and for their tireless work in addressing our nation's energy problems. The conference will offer Hoosiers the opportunity to hear from state and national leaders in energy research. While prices at the gas pumps may be getting most of the attention now, the energy crisis is about more than just oil. As a nation, with the help of our research universities, we need to continue efforts in examining our entire mix of energy sources and how to go about changing that mix over the long term in order to increase our economic and national security.  The state of Indiana and its industries can benefit from this type of research and discussion, and I believe that Indiana will be at the forefront of this nation's energy revolution. The sluggish economy and increasing energy costs have left families struggling to make ends meet. The work being done by those involved at this event seek to ease their burden and create the next generation of energy-related jobs in Indiana.                          ____________________
