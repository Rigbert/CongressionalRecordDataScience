President, I support giving our troops a pay raise, and I support improving the retirement package of career military personnel. However, the bill the Senate has considered, S. 4, the Soldiers', Sailors', Airmen's and Marines' Bill of Rights, is not only too expensive, it was also brought to the floor too hastily, without holding hearings on its provisions, and before we considered how the bill might affect the rest of the budget. Even though I want to see a pay raise and retirement reform, I had to vote against this excessively costly bill.  When S. 4 was reported out of committee, it already cost $12 billion more than the President requested over the next five years. The bill as passed by the Senate is estimated to cost $17 billion more than the President asked for. That is just for the next five years. Using Congressional Budget Office (CBO) figures, S. 4 would consume one-quarter of the projected non-Social Security surplus in the next fiscal year. Once personnel start to retire under its provisions, costs will skyrocket. CBO estimates that the retirement changes in S. 4 will eventually raise the costs of military pensions by a whopping 18 percent. These increased costs will come due at the same time the baby boom generation retires, with the attendant strain on Social Security and Medicare.  It is impossible to justify these steep increases in costs, particularly since not one hearing was held on S. 4. We all agree there are problems with recruitment and retention in the military, but we did not get the benefit of expert testimony--or any testimony at all--as to why, nor did we get input on how best to address these problems before passing this very expensive solution. Last year Congress asked the General Accounting Office (GAO) to do a detailed study of recruitment and retention problems. GAO has been conducting surveys and interviewing troops in the field to find out why they may plan to leave the service. GAO's preliminary findings show that ``money has been overstated as a retention factor.'' GAO's report is due in just a few months. Similar studies by CBO and the Pentagon are due out shortly. Some experts have said that dissatisfaction over military health care and the operations tempo were more important issues for those leaving the military.  I find it most troubling that this bill was brought to the floor before we passed a budget resolution, and outside of the normal Defense Authorization bill. With no budget caps, and no other defense priorities to consider, the bill brought us into a never, never land of wishful thinking. The bill sets out the most generous package of benefits, but does not consider what might happen to the rest of the defense budget if these cost increases go into effect. Will we have to cut readiness, operations and maintenance, or procurement accounts? Will we be able to fund steps that could reduce the operations tempo or make it more predictable? Will we be able to fund improvements in military health care?  The so-called firewalls between defense and domestic discretionary spending are down. That means that, rather than cutting other parts of the defense budget to pay for these increases, we may have to cut domestic programs instead, like education, the environment, or transportation. According to the Concord Coalition, 57 percent of the budget was devoted to entitlements in 1998, but we are now on track to devote 73 percent of the budget to entitlements by 2009. This bill will worsen the entitlement picture, and mean that more and more discretionary spending will have to be cut to cover growing entitlements.  This was a very sad first bill for the Senate to consider after we finally turned the corner on deficits. We cannot go back to pre-1974 Budget Act spending patterns. We must not abandon fiscal discipline and spend the surplus before we even see a penny of it. I hope and expect that fiscal sanity will be restored and that, when the bill returns from conference or as part of a larger measure, I will be able to vote for a well-deserved pay raise for our military personnel and a reasonable retirement package, but a package that fits within the budget framework and discipline we have all embraced.                          ____________________
