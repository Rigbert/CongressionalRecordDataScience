Speaker, I rise to pay tribute to the life of heroic Sandusky, Ohio police officer Andrew Dunn. This past Friday, March 25, Officer Dunn, age 30, Badge #2083, was laid to rest in his hometown. His beloved wife Julie and young children Caleb, 2, and infant Conner, his parents, friends and neighbors were joined by thousands of citizens of all ages, hundreds of police officers from near and far, and the Sandusky police force to honor his last call.  Citizens who gathered formed a vanguard for America as their hearts united in deep gratitude as well as deep mourning. No words would capture the solemnity of the occasion nor the weight of loss all who knew Officer Dunn carry.  Praised as a loving husband, father, son, and friend, officer Dunn represented the very finest of citizens in our nation. He laid down his life for us, said those who spoke at the service, negotiating the thin blue line of freedom.  His comrades offered tributes and prayed in one voice the Policeman's Prayer:     Lord I ask you for courage     Courage to face and conquer my own fears     Courage to take me where others will not go     I ask for strength     Strength of body to protect others     And strength of spirit to lead others     I ask for dedication     Dedication to my job to do it well     Dedication to my family to love them well     Dedication to my community to serve it well and keep it safe     Give me Lord, concern for others who trust me     And compassion for those who need me     And Lord through it all, Be beside me  In honored memory of Andrew S. Dunn, March 11, 1981--March 19, 2011. Rest in Peace, good and faithful public servant.                          ____________________
