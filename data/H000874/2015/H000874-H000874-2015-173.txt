I think it is a very positive comment.  I will tell the gentleman, next week, perhaps you and I can talk about this towards that end because I think, if we talk about creation of jobs, we talk about giving confidence and stability to the economy, I think that is one way we could do it, and, hopefully, we can work together.  The last issue I would bring up, Mr. Leader, as you know, I worked with your predecessor, Mr. Cantor, very successfully on the reauthorization of Export-Import Bank. That issue is coming up, and it will be expiring at the end of June, on June 30. We need to reauthorize that.  I am someone who believes that that is critical in terms of our exports. I know there is some disagreement on that issue, maybe between the two of us and between our caucuses; but, as you know, there are 60 Members in your caucus who have written a letter to the Speaker indicating their support and urging that that be brought to the floor.  Very frankly, with 185-plus Members, I think we will be unanimous on it, as we were last time. That makes somewhere in the neighborhood of 240 to 250 votes on this floor for the reauthorization of Export-Import Bank.  Does the gentleman see any prospect of that bill coming to the floor any time in the near future? As I say, as you know, the authorization expires on June 30.  I yield to my friend.  Mr. McCARTHY. I thank the gentleman for yielding.  The gentleman is correct, the authority for the Export-Import Bank does expire at the end of June.  I know the respect the gentleman has, as I do, for regular order and working through committees. The committee of jurisdiction has had a few hearings, and I know they have some hearings scheduled in the future continuing.  Nothing is scheduled at this point, but, if anything comes forward, I will notify.
