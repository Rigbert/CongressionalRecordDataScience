Speaker, today in Toledo, Ohio, in the 19-county dioceseto which he dedicated his selfless life, the beloved most Reverend Roman Catholic Bishop Robert W. Donnelly was laid to rest. This ``priest of priests,'' gentle soul, humble leader, and compassionate shepherd passed from this life on July 21, 2014. With loving gratitude, our entire community extends its deepest appreciation for his life and deepest sympathy to his family and friends at his passing.  Bishop Donnelly's religious life spanned 57 years, and he served as parish priest for seven congregations and taught in two Catholic high schools. Everywhere, he was of the people and revered.  What a priest, what a bishop, what a shepherd was he--a gentle and holy man and a powerful religious leader. The thousands upon thousands of homilies and religious messages he shared were not bombastic but wise. He touched thousands upon thousands of people across generations with baptisms, graduations, communions, marriages, funerals, and confirmations. Bishop Donnelly was a man of peace. He was hardworking and always present when it mattered.  With his extraordinary brother priest, Father Martin Donnelly, with whom he retired, their service cannot be measured in years but, rather, in devotion to imbuing real meaning to the faith to which they devoted their lives.  May God grant him eternal rest as the joy of his spirit is released to eternity.              Most Rev. Robert W. ``Bishop Bob'' Donnelly       Most Reverend Robert William Donnelly passed on to eternal      life on July 21, 2014, surrounded by his family after a short      illness. Born in Toledo March 22, 1931, to Agnes (Quinn) and      Leonard Donnelly, he was a son of West Toledo's Most Blessed      Sacrament Parish, living close by and attending elementary      school there--the tallest kid in the 8th grade. As a teen he      worked summers as a day camp supervisor at Close Park. During      his high school years in the Class of 1949 at Central      Catholic he played football and CYO basketball and baseball,      and was an avid CCHS tennis player; he captained the tennis      team there. Later, at Quinn Family reunions he was the      pitcher for the annual softball games. He enthusiastically      donned costumes for family reunions and the Blessed Sacrament      Halloween Parades. And he had golf in his blood, avidly      playing the game.       Bishop Bob earned a Bachelor's degree in Philosophy at St.      Meinrad College Seminary. Ordained a priest May 25, 1957, he      loved his years in pastoral ministry at Sandusky St. Mary,      Landeck St. John, Spencerville St. Patrick, Rossford Ss.      Cyril & Methodius, Toledo St. Clement, Toledo St. Charles,      and Fostoria St. Wendelin; and teaching at Delphos St. John      and Oregon Cardinal Stritch high schools. In every      assignment, his heart was always with the people.       He earned a Master's degree in Theology at Saint John's      University, Collegeville, Minnesota and attended graduate      school programs at Mount Saint Mary Seminary, Norwood, Ohio;      Xavier University, Cincinnati; and the University of Toledo.      He was ordained Bishop on May 3, 1984. As Toledo Auxiliary      Bishop he was appointed to several diocesan positions,      serving as Vicar General for 20 years and diocesan      administrator following the death of Bishop James Hoffman; he      was chairman of the diocesan Ecumenical Commission, a Pro-     Synodal consultant, a director of RENEW, and a member of the      diocesan board of consulters. He also served on the National      Council of Catholic Bishops' committees for Pastoral      Practices, Evangelization, and African America Catholics as      well as local boards of St. Vincent's Hospital, United Way,      and Advocates for Basic Legal Equality (ABLE). He retired in      May 2006.       Brother priests have known him as ``a priest of priests.''      He is remembered as a truly gentle man, a warm and loyal      friend, a wonderful mentor, respectful, humble, a people      person. His friends and family say that he was always open      and would give his full attention to whatever they had to      say, putting them at ease; he could always find something      good in everyone. When he presided at Mass, people knew it      wasn't ``his'' Mass; it was a prayer of, and for, and by,      everyone. He gathered often with life-long friends for cards      and camaraderie, loved to vacation with family, and cherished      friendships with brother priests. He enjoyed cooking and was      good at it, taking special care with holiday dinners of crown      roast, apple dumplings, and caesar salad. He later shared and      traded secret recipes with his beloved cousin, cook,      housekeeper, and friend Dorothy ``Buck'' Taylor.       With subtle wit and care, Bishop Bob loved his family and      friends and took delight in children. His many cousins,      nieces, and nephews affectionately call him ``Uncle Father      Bishop Bob.'' He had a seemingly endless line of advice      seekers who he couldn't be more excited and willing to tend      to. His Irish heritage inspired him to take a group of the      younger generation of family members to Ireland to meet their      blood kin. When asked a question, his responses were well-     thought-out, detailed, and explained.       Bishop Bob was predeceased by his parents, brother Quinn      Donnelly, sister Mary Hendricks, and cousins Fr. Tom Quinn      and Betty Mears. He is survived by his brother, Fr. Marty      Donnelly, his brother-in-law Pat Hendricks, nieces and      nephews Ann (Tim) Doran, Larry (Sharon) Hendricks, Jim      (Julie) Hendricks, Mike (Kaye) Hendricks, Kay (Bill) Byrne,      and David (Betsy) Hendricks; 24 great nieces and nephews; and      12 great-great nieces and nephews.
