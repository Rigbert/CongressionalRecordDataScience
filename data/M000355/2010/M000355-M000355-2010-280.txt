 President, I want to take a few moments here to thank the distinguished Senator from Alabama who has been our leader on the Banking Committee and an expert on this very complex subject of financial regulation, for his steadfast effort in bringing us to where we are today. As Senate Republicans plus Senator Ben Nelson of Nebraska have demonstrated over the last few days, we believed the bill we started with was not insignificant but that it needed to be improved. Senator Shelby was given the opportunity, as a result of us staying together, to be empowered to improve the bill that had previously come out of the Banking Committee on a straight party-line vote. So I want to take the opportunity to thank all of my Republican colleagues, plus Senator Nelson of Nebraska, in giving us the opportunity to improve the underlying bill.  I want to thank the Senator from Alabama for his efforts in that regard. I think we have a better starting place than we would have had earlier and we look forward to, as the majority leader indicated, an open amendment process and plenty of opportunities to treat this like the serious comprehensive bill it is. We have many amendments we intend to offer. Our members will be prepared to accept reasonable and short time agreements so we can get these amendments up and voted on, and hopefully have an opportunity to make further improvements in the bill.  I know Senator Shelby may want to make a few observations.
