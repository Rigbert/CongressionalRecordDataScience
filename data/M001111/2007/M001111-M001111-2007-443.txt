 President, we have made some progress on the Homeland Security appropriations bill today. We just adopted some amendments and worked our way through several issues today. A number of Senators have offered amendments tonight. I hope that early tomorrow morning we can go to those amendments and get votes on them and begin to move this bill.  The majority leader has made it very clear to all of us that he wants this bill completed this week, and we intend to do that. If any Senators have amendments they would like to offer, we encourage them to come as early as possible tomorrow to get them offered so we can work our way through them and finish this bill in a timely manner.
