 President, I rise this morning because I am offering an amendment on youth summer jobs that will build on and extend the extremely successful summer jobs program we included in last year's Recovery Act. Last summer's program put over 313,000 young people to work and provided a much needed shot in the arm to them, their families, and businesses and communities around the country. I have personally heard stories from young men and women who participated in the program who told me how much it changed their lives and gave them the skills and the experience they know they need to exceed in school and in the workforce. That is why, while we are focusing on legislation that will support unemployed Americans and help workers get back on the job, we should also continue investing in a successful program that helps our young people get to work.
