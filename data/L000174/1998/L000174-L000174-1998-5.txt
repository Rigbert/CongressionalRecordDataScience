President, I first introduced this legislation over six years ago after the General Accounting Office concluded that U.S. policy to ensure imported food safety is inadequate and in need of reform. Changes have taken place since, but our policy of allowing pesticides that are prohibited for use within the United States be exported to other countries remains.  The United States should be proud of the strict regulations that we have on the production and use of pesticides. But we should be embarrassed that the loophole in current law allowing U.S. chemical companies to export dangerous pesticides--pesticides banned in the U.S.--has not been eliminated. This loophole must be eliminated to protect the American consumer and American farmer and to halt the immoral practice of sending dangerous pesticides overseas to be handled and applied by unsuspecting farmworkers.  My ``Circle of Poison'' bill is designed to protect the public from pesticide residues on imported food. It is unreasonable to expect that, in these timesof tight budgets and limited resources, the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) will be able to monitor each shipment of imported food for each pesticide that a foreign farmer may use. FDA import inspections have declined dramatically in just the last four years, so that now less than two percent of FDA-regulated imported food is subject to any type of inspection.  It is possible, however, to aid FDA by limiting the number of dangerous pesticides which U.S. chemical companies supply to foreign farmers. By banning the export of pesticides which EPA has not deemed safe, the ``circle of poison'' legislation will reduce the availability of some of the most hazardous pesticides. By curtailing the supply, it is less likely that foreign farmers will use these pesticides, and therefore, less likely that these pesticides will end up on food that Americans consume.  In addition, this bill puts American farmers on an equal footing with foreign farmers. Under the bill, if a pesticide is not legal for American farmers to use, it will not be legal for foreign farmers to use on food that is exported to the U.S. A simple and reasonable concept, but a concept which is not yet in place in the real world.  Finally, it is simply wrong to allow the export of illegal pesticides. If the Environmental Protection Agency does not allow our citizens and environment to be exposed to a pesticide, we should not subject other countries to the hazards of the pesticide. A pesticide that may endanger people and the environment in the U.S. does not diminish in toxicity simply because it has been exported.                          ____________________
