I was there when the stamp was unveiled over in the Senate a couple of years ago. I only wish they had enough foresight to have made it 33 cents. Of course it is 32 cents, so they are not as handy as they once were. We had a gentleman in my home county in Michigan, a guy by the name of Mr. Hein and he went out for every parade for years. He was out there with his little petition drive, signing people up; I was one of his early people. Sadly, he has now passed away, in need, I think, of an organ transplant. That certainly gave him a number of years that he did not have, and his family's work and really all folks across the country that helped bring that beautiful stamp into play was pretty marvelous.
