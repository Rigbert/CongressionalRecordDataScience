REID. I would say I thought my dissertation on the rabbits and cactus was okay. In fact, I wish I had known at the time how bad those rabbits were, and I may have talked about them in my book. I am becoming more of a coyote fan all the time, hoping that they win more battles with the rabbits.  Anyway, I would be happy to yield to the Senator from Illinois for a question only, without losing my right to the floor.
