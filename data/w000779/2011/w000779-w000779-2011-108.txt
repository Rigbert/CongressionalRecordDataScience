Enzi, Mr. Barrasso, and Mr.         Merkley):  S. 1144. A bill to amend the Soda Ash Royalty Reduction Act of 2006 to extend the reduced royalty rate for soda ash; to the Committee on Energy and Natural Resources.  Mr. President, today my colleagues Sen. Barrasso, Sen. Enzi, Sen. Merkley, and I are introducing the Soda Ash Competition Act. Soda ash, or ``disodium carbonate'', is an industrial mineral used in the production of glass and other products. In 2006, in response to efforts by foreign competitors to subsidize non-U.S. production and gain competitive advantages in the world market, including the partial suspension of value added taxes, VAT, by China, Congress enacted legislation to provide a partial suspension of Federal royalties on the ore mined to produce soda ash on Federal lands for 5 years. This royalty relief reduced the Federal royalty rate from 6 percent to 2 percent and helped U.S. soda ash producers to remain competitive in the international market. Over the past 5 years, the U.S. industry has been ableto invest hundreds of millions of dollars in production capacity and maintain its market here and abroad. As a result, American companies and workers have provided important economic activity here at home, provided a U.S. export valued at nearly $1 billion a year, all while continuing to generate tens of millions of dollars to the Treasury in mineral royalties.  Foreign competition continues to be an issue for the U.S. soda ash industry, including unfair manipulation of value added taxes that would otherwise be levied on competing foreign supplies. In 2007, China resumed its practice of suspending part of the 17 percent VAT on synthetic soda ash to aid its domestic producers. On May 31, 2011, members of both the House and Senate wrote to Commerce Secretary Gary Locke and U.S. Trade Representative Ron Kirk requesting this unfair trade practice be raised with China through the Joint Commission on Commerce and Trade.
