 President, I want to thank the majority leader for calling up these judicial nominations for votes by the Senate, and in particular for calling up Judge Jeffrey Miller, who has been nominated to the U.S. district court for the southern district of California in San Diego.  It was my distinct pleasure to recommend Judge Jeffrey Miller to the President. I feel strongly he is extremely well qualified for the position.  Judge Miller has been serving for 10 years as a superior court judge in San Diego, having been appointed by a Republican Governor, George Deukmejian, in 1987.  Judge Miller previously spent 19 years with the State attorney general's office.  He earned both his undergraduate and law degree from the University of California at Los Angeles in the 1960's. He first devoted himself to public service by working in the Peace Corps for a year.  During his experience in the Los Angeles attorney general's office from 1968 to 1974, he briefed approximately 60 cases on behalf of the people, urging affirmation of trial court convictions before the court of appeals in more than half of those cases.  Of those cases, published opinions were issued in 13, all but 1 affirming trial court convictions.  From 1974 to 1987, Judge Miller supervised attorneys and carried his own caseload in the tort and condemnation section of the attorney general's office, which oversaw the San Diego, Orange, San Bernardino, and Riverside areas. Here he represented the State in matters ranging from class action lawsuits to California Highway Patrol officers sued for false arrest.  Judge Miller has argued two cases before the U.S. Supreme Court. Both cases were argued successfully on behalf of the State.  His lengthy and distinguished experience as a prosecutor prepared him well for his appointment in 1987 as a superior court judge.  Since then, he has handled many sensitive high-profile criminal and civil cases including two murder cases where the juries rendered convictions with full sentences.  This has prepared him extremely well for the criminal and civil caseload facing the southern district judges.  Simply put, Judge Miller is one of the most respected and trusted judicial figures in the San Diego area. He is both fair minded and thoughtful, yet remains tough and decisive.  His bipartisan support and solid judicial background make him a strong nominee for confirmation. Among those who have endorsed Judge Miller's nomination are those who know the judge's work best:  Presiding Judge James R. Milliken of the superior court described Judge Miller as ``a superb judge'' and ``a fine, insightful person. He understands legal issues and problems and does an absolutely wonderful job in the courtroom.''  Judge Anthony Joseph, a colleague on the San Diego Superior Court, wrote: ``His positive outlook and pragmatic approach are essential in this era.''  Judge Daniel Kremer of the U.S. court of appeals noted that Judge Miller ``is particularly well known for his ability to handle complex cases efficiently and fairly.''  Retired Justice Charles Froehlich, Jr., of the court of appeals said: ``He is a person of very high ethical standards. He would indeed be a credit to the local district court bench.''  Judge Judith Haller of the court of appeals wrote: ``Judge Miller would be an outstanding selection and one which would be extremely well received by members of our legal community. He is one of those rare individuals who receives unanimous praise from all who have worked with him professionally or who know him personally.''  Judge Miller is an active member of the California Judges Association.  He has been elected to the executive committee and served on that committee as supervising judge of the north county branch of the San Diego Superior Court. He has also chaired the joint jury committee and the rules committee.  Let me conclude by saying how important it is to fill the vacancies on the southern district bench. Presiding Judge Judith Keep has provided some startling information about workload in the southern district, which I would like to submit for the Record.  There are currently two vacancies on the southern district bench. The six judges now serving in the southern district faced a caseload of 5,674 cases in 1996. Five years earlier, the total filings in this district were 2,914. That represents a 95-percent increase in the workload from 1991 to 1996 for the southern district judges.  In addition, the vacancy Judge Miller would fill has been vacant since December 28, 1994--more than 26 months. Judge Gordon Thompson took senior status on December 28, 1994.  This vacancy has only made the workload on the southern district more intense.  So I urge my colleagues to address the workload problem by confirming this eminently qualified candidate, Judge Jeffrey Miller.  I thank the Chair, and I yield the floor.                          ____________________
