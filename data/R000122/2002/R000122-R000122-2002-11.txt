President, I rise to express my reservations with the Medical Device User Fee and Modernization Act of 2002. While the legislation offers some improvements to the current medical device approval and regulation process, I have serious concerns about some aspects of the bill and about the process leading to its impending passage in the Senate.  User fees will allow the Food and Drug Administration, FDA, to expedite the review and approval of medical devices, resulting in faster patient access to new and potentially lifesaving technologies. Third party inspections similarly have the potential to enhance the agency's ability to ensure that manufacturing sites are meeting FDA quality standards for device production. And regulating the reprocessing of single use devices should be a positive step for the safe use of these devices. All of these elements of the legislation, however, carry significant potential risk. In our attempts to enhance the efficiency of an agency to which we are not able to give adequate appropriations, we run the risk of undermining FDA's scientific and policy authority and its vital public health mission.  It will be up to the Senate Health, Education, Labor and Pensions Committee, of which I am a member, to pay close attention to the health and safety implications of these provisions as they are implemented. As part of that ongoing oversight, the committee should review and evaluate the manner in which the bill was written and passed. While I understand the importance of this legislation, I am deeply troubled by the lack of a formal process in its development and consideration. I assure you and my colleagues that I will be paying close attention as these new provisions are implemented in the coming months, and I urge my colleagues to do likewise to protect the public health and maintain the vital mission of the FDA.
