Speaker, the other thing that the chairman did not say is that, after your last round of tax cuts, we had the deepest recession anybody in this body has experienced, starting in December 2007, when you had the Presidency, the House, and the Senate. You are at it again.  Mr. Speaker, I rise in sadness and disappointment that the House passed such an irresponsible, dangerous, and debt-exploding legislation yesterday. We should be better than this. We should be more responsible than this.  This bill gives 83 percent of its benefits to just 1 percent of the richest Americans.  Why didn't we have it reversed and give 83 percent to the people you talk about, Mr. Chairman?  It takes 13 million people off their health insurance coverage and it raises the deficit by $1.5 trillion.  There can be little doubt that the majority party is fixated on cutting taxes for the richest in our country.  Defeat this bill. Do right by the American people.
