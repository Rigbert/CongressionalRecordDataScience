Mr. Speaker, I would like to bring to the attention of my colleagues the so-called Tongass amendment. It disturbs me when I hear my friend, the gentleman from Illinois [Mr. Yates], speak about the Tongass because you have to understand what the Tongass amendment does.  First, you have to also understand what the Tongass is. The Tongass Forest is a forest of 17 million acres of land, 17 million acres of land, I hope all of my colleagues listen to this, 7 million acres of wilderness already set aside by this Congress; 8.3 million acres in fact is not suitable for timber harvest. We have now 1.7 million acres of land that could be available for harvesting. And because of the action of the Forest Service under this administration, it has taken 585,000 acres out of the remaining 1.7 million acres and made it not available, contrary to the action of this Congress.  I am going to suggest that the Tongass amendment does nothing to change the present law. This is in fact what was recommended by the Forest Service. What was previously said about exempting the Endangered Species Act is not true. What was said about cutting the rain forest is not true.  We have, as I said, over 7 million acres already set aside by this Congress of old growth preservation and wildlife habitat. Now we have the administration coming down and saying by the Undersecretary that we must set this aside for old growth preservation and wildlife habitat. If that is the case, then what are we doing with the 7-odd-million acres; did we make a mistake there? If so, then let us reopen that.  What we have done under this amendment that has been proposed by the Senator from my State is in fact set forth the original concept of the Forest Service itself. This is the Forest Service plan that was signed off by the Forest Service prior to this administration.  I can tell Members this. We have closed over 300 mills in the northern part of this great Nation of ours in California, Washington, and Oregon. The gentleman from Washington [Mr. Dicks] will recognize that, because of the Pacific pact. It is time to understand that this amendment offered by the other body is an amendment that creates jobs, still maintains the rain forest, the 7-odd-million acres. And those that suggest recommittal are in fact falling prey to those environmental groups that do not want Americans working, that would rather have Americans sitting idle and not harvesting those trees. The recommittal act itself is wrong. This is a bill that has been thought out, fought out and worked on. It should be accepted. We should vote ``yes'' on it.  I ask our Members to consider the history of the Tongass. If they have a question, come ask me.                              {time}  1630  Let me answer it. Do not read what is being said by certain groups who are not telling the truth. This is nothing new in this body. We have different groups telling flatout, dishonest, supposedly facts. Let us, in fact, have the truth. Vote for this bill, and vote against the motion to recommit.
