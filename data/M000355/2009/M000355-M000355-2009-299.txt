 President, I would like to take a moment to recognize an inspiring group of World War II veterans from the Commonwealth who visited our Nation's Capitol on the 65th anniversary of the D-day invasion. The noble work of the Honor Flight Program and the leaders at its Bluegrass Chapter made it possible for these World War II veterans to visit their memorial on the National Mall free of charge. I have been privileged to participate in previous Honor Flights from Kentucky, and I very much regret that my schedule prevented me from attending the one that took place on June 6, 2009. I hope to have the opportunity to join participants from my home State on Honor Flight trips in the near future.  I wish to express my tremendous gratitude to the 66 Kentucky veterans who were here that day for having served to protect our great Nation's principles from the enemies of freedom. As Americans, we are forever indebted to the heroic men and women of the U.S. military who defend this great Nation and all it represents. In fighting for prosperity and freedom around the world, the veterans of World War II risked everything, earning the title of the ``greatest generation.''  As General Eisenhower said in his message to the troops just before the invasion at Normandy: ``The eyes of the world are upon you. The hopes and prayers of liberty loving people everywhere march with you.'' These words ring true, even after 65 years, as our military continues to challenge threats to freedom, democracy and the American way of life.  Our country continues to do its best to honor the incredible bravery and sacrifice of our men and women in uniform. The Honor Flight Program is a reflection of the admiration and appreciation that all Americans have for the military. I take great pride in representing many brave veterans from Kentucky and in doing what I can to show our Nation's reverence for them.  The names of the 66 World War II veterans from the Commonwealth are as follows:       Richard Straub; George Hoffman; Robert Willman; Charles      Junkins; Norman Reiss; William Taylor; Mary Phillips; Walter      Brumfield, Sr.; Raymond Bumann; Lawrence Mayfield; Thomas      Crump; Albert Tomassetti; Eugene Heimerdinger; Fletcher      Williams; Paul Lawson; Millard Allen; Paul Jordan; Joseph      McConnell; Harry Greavesl; Robert Bohan.
