Speaker, for our nation to have a strong defense capability, we need to make certain that critical manufacturing capacity and skills are maintained. Some of the most vital are tool and die, mold making and precision machining. They represent the first step in manufacturing. These companies are family owned businesses located in every state of the union. They are characterized by highly skilled employees that provide the economic bedrock of our defense industrial base.  Many of America's small businesses that offer this capability to our defense infrastructure are closing their doors due to economic difficulties caused by the current economic recession facing our manufacturing industry. The National Tooling and Machining Association has stated that over 400 companies have closed since January of this year. We often find that prime contractors are subcontracting with foreign firms rather than American businesses. If steps are not taken now to assess and correct the situation, America may find itself without these critical capabilities and skills. As was learned in the West Coast dock work stoppage, some parts that are required by the U.S. military were unavailable. This situation highlights an important decision we must make. If we do not take steps immediately, our country will lose the capability to produce the parts that are needed to protect our country.  I appreciate the commitments I have received from the distinguished chairman and ranking member to work with us to secure within 60 days from the Department of Defense a report regarding what steps can be taken to increase procurement, development of contracts, and subcontracts, with these vital American small businesses.
