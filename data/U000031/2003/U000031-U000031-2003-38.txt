Speaker, I yield myself 1 minute.  Mr. Speaker, I would just like to say that the gentleman from Florida (Mr. Young) not only has a great legacy in this House for so many different issues, particularly as chairman of the Committee on Appropriations, but one of the issues that bonded our friendship early on was his direction and sponsorship of this issue.  I would like to say that when I was, I think, a freshman or a sophomore Member in this House, because of the battle he helped lead, I joined with so many other Members of this body to actually register myself with the National Bone Marrow Donor Registry. Ihope someday that I will be called. Thus far, I have not, but I am one of those that has voluntarily registered. I would love the afternoon that I might get a phone call to say, ``Come on down; I want to draw a sample.''  Mr. Speaker, I yield 3 minutes to the gentleman from Florida (Mr. Young).
