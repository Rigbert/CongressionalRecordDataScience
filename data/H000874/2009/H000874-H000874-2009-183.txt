Bill had been here for 6 or 7 years when I got here. He was on the Appropriations Committee; I went on the Appropriations Committee not too long after coming here.  Bill Hefner has been regaled by all of his friends from North Carolina. And I know Chairman Obey, who served with Bill on the Appropriations Committee as I did for well over a decade, can tell, I'm sure, numerous stories late into the night about Bill Hefner. And what warm memories I have of Bill Hefner sitting on the aisle back here. And all my colleagues remember he would sit on the aisle and you would go by and Bill would sort of look up with a twinkle in his eye and he would tell you story after story after story.  I remember one night I was going to give a speech and I wanted a few jokes, so I called Bill Hefner up and he gave me a couple of jokes, and I used them, and they worked very well. So I can say Bill Hefner was my writer, I suppose. But he was a wonderful, wonderful representative, and he was a representative in the best sense of that term. He represented his people. He represented North Carolina. He represented his country. He represented the men and women in our Armed Forces whom he loved and whom he served with great fervor and affection. Bill Hefner loved his country, he loved his colleagues, and his colleagues loved Bill Hefner.  It's been talked about how he loved to play golf. I like to play golf as well--I'm not very good, but I love to play, like so many other hundreds of thousands, maybe millions of people in this country who like to say we play golf. We play at it, I suppose. But Bill was a good golfer. And he had a tournament down at Pinehurst every year. And I used to go down and play at Pinehurst with Bill. And you not only went down to play golf, you just went down to have this warm, gracious, outreaching human being make you feel good about serving with him in the Congress and make you feel good about North Carolina and your country.  Bill Hefner was a great resource of North Carolina. He then moved further south and became a county commissioner for a little bit, my good friend is telling me.  Bill Hefner will be missed. Bill Hefner used to tell me, he said, You know, Steny, I was elected in my district; it was a safe district then, and I've worked very hard and I've turned it into a marginal district.  I think you all heard him say that. That was one of his favorite sayings, Larry.                              {time}  2115  Now, the good news for you, Mr. Kissell, is you're going to do the opposite. You're going to take a district that could have gone either way, and you're going to turn it into a safe district. I appreciate that, but nobody would have appreciated it more than Bill Hefner. My friend Brad Miller, a friend of Bill Hefner's and a colleague from North Carolina, told a story.  Bill Hefner was a singer. He was a real talent. He loved to sing, and he loved to entertain, and he loved to be a comedian, and he loved to make people, as I said, feel good. He accomplished that with great frequency and with great ability. We'll miss Bill Hefner. Bill Hefner was what's good about our country, which he loved so dearly.  As I said, he loved the men and women who served in the Armed Forces, and he served them so well as chairman of the Military Construction Committee. I remember I had the opportunity to travel to Germany and to some other NATO allies in Europe with him in the 1980s, and it was clear that he was extraordinarily knowledgeable about the needs of our men and women stationed overseas in terms of the quality of their lives. He mirrored Ike Skelton or Ike Skelton mirrors Bill Hefner in terms of his commitment to our men and women in the Armed Forces.  So I am pleased, Larry Kissell, to join you, your colleagues from North Carolina, my chairman--I served on the committee for 23 years--Chairman Obey, and my good friend Chet Edwards, who now chairs the same subcommittee that Bill Hefner chaired. Bill was also a member of the Armed Services Committee, of course. So I thank you for letting me know that you were doing this Special Order to rise in memory, respect and deep affection for a wonderful American, for a wonderful advocate of his faith, for a wonderful family man, and for a wonderful Member of this body.  God blessed America when he gave us William G. Hefner. I yield back.
