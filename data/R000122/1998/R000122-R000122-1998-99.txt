President, I rise to pay tribute to Frank Caprio of Providence, Rhode Island, who will be honored at the 37th Annual Verrazzano Day Banquet this Saturday.  A respected and admired Rhode Islander, Frank Caprio was born in Providence in 1936, the son of immigrants. His father peddled produce and delivered milk in the Federal Hill neighborhood, while his beloved mother cared for Frank, his two brothers, Antonio Jr. and Joseph, and dedicated herself to her Church and community.  Frank Caprio epitomizes the American dream. From his humble beginnings, he is today a respected lawyer, successful businessman, and Chief Judge of the Providence Municipal Court. At Central High School he was an all-state wrestler who was encouraged to learn a trade, but he aspired to attain a college education. And he did. He worked his way through Providence College, earning his Bachelor of Arts. He later earned his education certificate from Rhode Island College.  Frank taught American government by day and attended Suffolk Law School at night. Inspired by President Kennedy, he ran for Providence City Council in 1962 and served for eight years. He was a delegate to the Rhode Island Constitutional Convention in 1973, and he has been elected a delegate to the Democratic National Convention five times.  Frank Caprio has practiced law for more than 30 years and has a remarkably diverse practice. He has served as special counsel to Cookson America, a fortune 500 corporation, and as legal counsel to the Providence Redevelopment Agency and the Rhode Island Department of Transportation. But perhaps Frank's most revered clients are neighbors and friends, many of humble means, who seek out Frank as their defender, advocate, and voice. They cherish his friendship and offer trust in return, which is a wonderful tribute to Frank and a testament to the way he has led his life.  Through initiative, hard work and tireless energy, Frank has attained much success in business. He is a principal owner of the Coast Guard House, a historic waterfront restaurant in Narragansett and another popular restaurant, Casey's, in Wakefield. In addition to his success as a restaurateur, Frank is a principal owner of Cherry Hill Housing in Johnston.  Despite all of his success in law, government, and business, Frank has always understood the importance of community and public service. He serves on the board of Federal Hill House and as a volunteer at Nickerson House. He is a fellow of the Rhode Island Community Food Bank, and is a member of both the Bishop's Council and the State Board of Governors for Higher Education.  In honor of his own father, he established the Antonio ``Tup'' Caprio Scholarship at Suffolk University, and is the 1997-1998 Chairman of the Providence College Alumni Fund. He holds an Honorary Doctor of Law Degree from Suffolk and has been recognized by countless organizations for his spirit of community and his humanitarian efforts.  Mr. President, I am pleased today to salute Frank Caprio on receiving the prestigious Annual Verrazzano Day award, and I extend best wishes to Frank, his wife, Joyce, and their wonderful family on this momentous occasion.                          ____________________
