Speaker, I hate to disagree with colleagues on both sides of the aisle. I do not think it is tremendously important to the American people, you know, who allowed more amendments when.  The question is: What does this bill do to or for the American people? This Corporate Liability Shield Act which we will take up tomorrow I heard earlier described as pro-consumer, and I heard some discussion of Alice in Wonderland. If you think this bill is pro-consumer, you have stepped through the looking glass.  The next time the Ford Motor Co. knowingly puts out a defective product and keeps it on the road and people burn to death, they will have a little different equation to deal with. It will be easier to keep it on the road, because they know the punitive damages are going to be limited next time around. That is pro-consumer?  Is it pro-consumer to preempt the States, 200 years of State law, to preempt every jury in every State in America with your judgment and cap damages? I do not think that is pro-consumer.  And how about the special provision for the wealthy? You know, if you get punitive damages under this bill, you are going to enshrine something into Federal law. You can get three times your monetary damages, generally including your wages. So if you are an electrician and you earn $30,000 a year, you are limited, but if you are a fat cat and you earn $250,000 a year, you can get three times that amount. That is pro-consumer?  Well, I suppose that is pro-consumer if the people you think of as consumers are the wealthiest people in America.  This sticks it to average Americans, again, like every other bill this week.
