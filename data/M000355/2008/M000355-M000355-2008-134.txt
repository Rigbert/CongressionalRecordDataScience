 President, we will be able to construct later this afternoon a process by which we can go forward and consider amendments that would really have an impact on the problem. I look forward to getting back to the majority leader later in the afternoon on the prospects of entering into a consent agreement that will allow us to consider all of these important items--not 6 months from now but this week.  Mr. President, I yield the floor.
