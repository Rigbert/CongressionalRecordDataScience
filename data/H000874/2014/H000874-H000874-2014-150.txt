Chairman, I thank the ranking member for yielding.  I would first observe, Mr. Chairman, that the American people ought to lament another opportunity missed, an opportunity to come together and adopt a big, balanced plan for investment and balance in our fiscal system in America.  Mr. Chairman, last year, we adopted a budget. During the course of its implementation with the consideration of appropriation bills, the Republican chairman of the committee called the sequester numbers adopted in the 2014 Ryan plan unrealistic and ill-conceived.  For 2016 through 2024, Mr. Chairman, this budget has numbers below sequester levels that the chairman said were unrealistic and ill-conceived.  Chairman Rogers has called the numbers in this budget draconian, Chairman Rogers, responsible for funding the operations of government and assisting and building our economy and its people.  Mr. Chairman, I believe it is all that and a call to disinvestment. This budget is a call to disinvestment in America's growth and success.  We have heard a lot of claims, of course, about what the Republican budget will do for our country. I have heard those claims from previous Republican chairmen, frankly. They did not pan out.  Let me clear that fog away and get down to the raw numbers which reveal the magnitude of the damage the Republican budget will inflict. As a matter of fact, with all due respect, I call it a retreat--an alliterative retreat of course, the chairman's retreat.  First, the Republican budget would repeal the patient protections and other benefits of the Affordable Care Act, leaving millions without health insurance coverage.  Of course, it keeps the money; it just didn't give the benefits. It would turn Medicaid into a capped block grant program and cut its funding by $732 billion over the next decade.                              {time}  1700  That is from seniors who need long-term care. That is from people with disabilities who need medical services.  Two-thirds of Medicaid spending goes to low-income seniors, and the Republican budget cuts it by a quarter.  It would also end the Medicare guarantee and reopen the doughnut hole for prescription drugs, shifting costs back to seniors.  Secondly, the Republican budget disinvests, as I said, from many of the very important initiatives Congress has made a priority for the future growth and competitiveness of our economy.  It cuts over $120 billion from middle class college affordability programs like the Pell grant and will leave a college undergraduate taking out a student loan as much as $3,800 deeper in debt.  By eliminating funding for applied research, their budget will reduce Federal research grants by half--by half disinvestment. It could result in 2,400 fewer National Science Foundation research awards and 1,400 fewer National Institutes of Health awards.  The reality is, Mr. Chairman, the Republican budget would decimate pediatric research. We have heard a little bit about that. It would decimate pediatric research. It would decimate all other research as well and other medical research in the lifesaving diseases by billions of dollars, not just pediatric research: cancer, heart, lung, blood, Alzheimer's, and others. $173 billion will be cut from highway spending over the next 10 years, disinvestment, even though infrastructure investments are critical to the growth of our manufacturing sector and job creation.  The Acting CHAIR. The time of the gentleman has expired.
