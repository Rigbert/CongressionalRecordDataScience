President, a distinguished and giving Vermonter will be retiring after nearly 40 years of working on behalf of Vermont's prisoners and former prisoners. Rita Whalen McCaffrey is stepping down in May as the Executive Director of Dismas of Vermont, a residential program that helps former prisoners transition and reintegrate into society. Opened in Burlington in 1986, Dismas of Vermont has grown to provide supportive housing in three homes and three satellite apartments in the Burlington and Rutland communities, and has served more than a thousand men and women in the past 25 years.  Rita has engaged hundreds of Vermonters from all walks of life through the years to actively participate in the Mission of Dismas: to reconcile former prisoners with society and society with former prisoners through participation in a supportive family-like community. The Dismas model Rita founded in Vermont is powered by volunteers who cook and share the evening meal, choose to live in the community with the residents, and participate as active board members. The act of mutual reconciliation happens because community members come into the home and become a part of the Dismas family.  Rita's strong commitment to building and encouraging community support for former prisoners exemplifies the charitable spirit that has made Vermont one of the best places in the country to live. Her efforts have changed the direction of many lives and encouraged many to work towards reconciliation and respect. By steering former prisoners away from crime and toward a more constructive path, her work has also made the community a safer and better place to live. She leaves a legacy that is as inspiring as it is impressive, and her successor will have large shoes to fill.  As she moves on from a career path that began in 1974, I congratulate Rita for her invaluable service and leadership and I wish her a happy retirement.                          ____________________
