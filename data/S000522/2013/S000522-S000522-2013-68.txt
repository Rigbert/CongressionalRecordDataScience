I thank my good friend for yielding.  Madam Chair, I rise in strong support of the amendment offered by my good friend and colleague, Mr. Runyan, to ensure that the funding in this bill is targeted to those fishery disasters resulting from Superstorm Sandy.  Recreational angling contributes more than $125 billion annually to the American economy, Madam Speaker, in addition to creating and sustaining over 1 million jobs.  New Jersey has a long tradition of fishing along our 130-mile shoreline. Recreational and commercial fishing generates over $1.3 billion in New Jersey in economic activity and supports 8,500 Jersey jobs.  This vital industry not only creates and sustains good jobs but boosts fishery conservation efforts, tourism, and contributes significantly to the economy in coastal communities. The disaster declaration on November 16 and the modest funding provided in the pending legislation will help rebuild the damaged and destroyed infrastructure so that this industry can recover and return to pre-storm levels.  I urge all members to support the Runyan amendment.                              {time}  1700
