Speaker, I thank the former Speaker pro tem of the Maryland House for his kind words.  Mr. Speaker, I rise today in strong support of H.R. 915, which, as has been stated, is a bill that will provide the President with the authority to provide annual cost of living adjustments to our Nation's more than 1,300 Federal administrative judges, the same authority he now has, frankly, with respect to members of the Senior Executive Service. Currently the pay and step levels for administrative law judges are tied to the Executive Schedule, so they are unable to receive an increase in pay in the years when the Executive Schedule remains unchanged. Since 1991, the basic pay for administrative law judges has increased only three times, in 1992, 1993 and not until 1998, and only one time in the last 5 years, as the figures reflect.                              {time}  1530  That is in contrast to employees under the General Schedule and the Senior Executive Schedule, who have received a COLA increase in 4 of the last 5 years. This legislation will bring the pay of administrative law judges into line with career employees in the General Schedule and Senior Executive Service.  Mr. Speaker, prior to 1990, administrative law judges fell under the General Schedule and were paid at the GS-15 and 16 rates. In 1990, as part of the Federal Employees Pay Comparability Act, a legislation which I had the honor of sponsoring, the judges had their pay linked to the executive schedule.  While this legislation, H.R. 915, will not change the current grade and step structures for administrative law judges, it will tie each grade and step to fixed percentages of the SES.  I support this legislation, and hope this bill will provide increased competition, and draw the highly qualified candidates that these judgeship positions require for the sound administration of the Federal Government and Federal rules and regulations.  I urge my colleagues to join me and the gentlewoman from Illinois and the gentleman from Maryland in supporting this legislation.
