President, first I thank my colleague and friend, Senator Kerry, chairman of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, for coming to the Senate floor and speaking about our mutual friend and colleague, Senator Dick Lugar, who serves as the ranking Republican on the Senate Foreign Relations Committee.  I am a newcomer to that committee, but I am not a newcomer to my knowledge of Dick Lugar--who preceded my arrival in the Senate 16 years ago when he was well known throughout the Midwest for his extraordinary service as mayor of Indianapolis, where he did something that was miraculous--he combined and made more efficient local units of government, and I think the rebirth of Indianapolis is attributed to those early steps by Dick Lugar.  My wife Loretta and I came to know Dick and Char personally through the Aspen Institute, which is an effort that I think we need to encourage where members of both political parties, House and Senate, come together to discuss foreign policy issues--no lobbyists, no special interests. Dick Lugar was there and always a major contributor when it came to issues of importance.  Before I arrived in the Senate--while Senator Kerry was still here--he teamed up with Senator Sam Nunn to deal with an issue which related literally to the peace and security of the world.  What would happen, as the Soviet Union crumbled, to all of those nuclear weapons? Would they fall into the wrong hands? Would they fall into disrepair? And what could we do about it? Sam Nunn and Dick Lugar stepped up and said: We are going to work together on a bipartisan basis to deal with them.  Time and time again throughout his career Dick Lugar has focused on issues of strategic importance to the United States and our security. I can't agree with Senator Kerry more. He looked for a bipartisan approach to so many things. We always knew he was a Hoosier conservative. You weren't going to push over anything when it came to Dick Lugar. He was strong in his values, but he always listened and he was always a gentleman.  What a disappointment last night. I know Senator Kerry feels, as I do, that once you have been in this Chamber for a few years, you kind of reflect on those lions of the Senate who have come and gone, some because of the decision of the electorate and some because of passage of time and then fateful decisions that ended up with their departure. We think back on some of these great people.  John Chafee. John Chafee and Dick Lugar were soulmates in terms of their view on the Republican side of the aisle about how to work across the aisle to get things done.  A mutual friend--and I know Senator Kerry's close personal friend--Senator Kennedy. Senator Kennedy's success has always reached across the aisle. I noticed that. Sometimes to the frustration of those on the Democratic side who said: We have enough votes, Ted. We don't have to do this. He would reach across.  Of Bob Byrd, who used to sit right next to where Senator Kerry is sitting now, we think: What will the Senate be like without these great lions? Well, the Senate will go on. But the question is, Will we have learned from their example? Will we take their lives and their careers to build on to make this a better place or, as some have said, are we going to succumb to the temptation of just making this place more partisan, more hidebound, more dedicated to obstruction than moving forward?  I know that Dick Lugar in the remaining months is going to be an extraordinary servant to the people of Indiana and the Nation as he has been throughout his career, and I look forward to seeing him back on the Senate floor working, as he will, for the remainder of his term. But it is a loss. It is a loss to the Senate that he is leaving, and it is a sad day on both sides of the aisle when Dick Lugar won't be part of the Senate in person.                      Tribute to Senator Mark Kirk  I would like to speak about another Republican Senator while I have the floor: my colleague, Mark Kirk. Some of you have seen the video.  Mark had a stroke in January. He wrote about it in this morning's Chicago Tribune. He is 52 years of age, the picture of health, a Navy Reserve officer and a U.S. Senator from Illinois, actively engaged in our State, going back and forth, county to county, city to city. We work together on so many things. Then on that fateful day he was stricken, and with this stroke he suffered some very serious damage.  I was a little bit disturbed when his physician/surgeon came out and said, ``Well, here is what we can expect.'' And I am not going to go through the graphic details, but they were all sobering to think that he would be limited in any way by the stroke. I was upset because I thought: He doesn't know Mark Kirk. That isn't going to happen. Mark is going to fight back. He is going to be back, and he is going to defy the odds in terms of stroke victims.  Yesterday he released a video. It is inspiring. I hope everyone gets a chance to see it--I am sure it is readily available--showing him going through rehab, showing the efforts he is making to come back to the Senate. Mark called me earlier this week. We talked on the phone a couple of times since the stroke. He has been actively engaged mentally in everything we have done since the stroke occurred. But every day he tells me that he spends time on a treadmill, miles and miles walking on a treadmill so he will be able to come back. I told him we are on a different treadmill here and I am sure he wants to get back on it with us in the Senate.  He will be back. He said something I think we all ought to remember. He said he asked the staff to count the steps from where he would park outside the Senate Chamber up to the Senate Chamber. They counted the steps and they told him 45 steps and he would be back in the Senate. He said the day is going to come, and I am sure it will be soon, when he will walk those steps, and there will be many, myself included, from both sides of the aisle, cheering his return to the Senate. For Mark, his family, his doctors, his medical staff, and all: Thank you for this battle. Thank you for your efforts on behalf of our State. We look forward to your early return.  Mark and I have a joint town meeting, Republican and Democratic, every Thursday morning. The people sit there politely as we discuss issues and love it when we disagree because we do it without getting angry with one another. He will be back soon, not only at those meetings but also covering the State of Illinois as an effective, engaged Senator.  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the time from 2 p.m. until 5 p.m. be equally divided and controlled between the two leaders or their designees, and that all quorum calls in that period also be equally divided.
