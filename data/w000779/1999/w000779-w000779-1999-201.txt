 I have been here many fewer years than the Senator from South Carolina,but I can tell you, just listening to him over the last few minutes, I sure agree with what he has to say about Social Security, I sure agree with what he has to say about school violence and the connections that are so important in the community between law enforcement, counselors, and the students. I could go on and on. I have supported him on many of those issues in the past and am planning to do so in the future.  But I did want to take the floor for just a moment and address a couple of the points that were made with respect to the Y2K issue specifically.  I am very hopeful that we can still see the Senate come together on a bipartisan basis to deal with this issue. The fact of the matter is that the year 2000 problem is essentially not even a design flaw. It is a problem because a number of years ago, to get more space on a disc and in memory, the precision of century indicators was abandoned. And it is hard for all of us today to believe that disc and memory space used to be at a premium, but it was back then, and that is why we have this problem today.  So what a number of us in the Senate want is to do everything we possibly can to ensure companies comply with the standards that are necessary to be fair in the marketplace, but also to provide a safety net if we see problems develop and particularly frivolous, nonmeritorious suits.  Now, with respect to a couple of the points that have been made on the record, this notion that the sponsors, particularly Senator McCain and I, are trying to rewrite tort law for all time is simply not borne out by the language of this bill. This is a bill which is going to sunset in 2003. It is not a set of legal changes for all time. It is an effort to deal in a short period of time with what we think are potentially very serious problems.  In fact, the American Bar Association--this is not a group of people who are against lawyers, but the American Bar Association itself has said this could affect billions and billions of dollars in our economy. So this bill will last for a short period of time. It doesn't apply to personal injuries, whatever. If a person, for example, is injured as a result of an elevator falling because the computer system broke down and is tragically injured or killed, all of the legal remedies in tort law remain.  This is a bill that essentially involves contractual rights of businesses. We respect those rights first, and only when the marketplace breaks down would this law apply.  We have heard a number of comments in the last few hours that this legislation throws out the window the principle of joint and several liability, a legal doctrine that I, following the lead of the Senator from South Carolina, have supported in many instances, particularly when it relates to vulnerable individuals who might be the victim of personal injuries. But this legislation specifically says that joint and several liability will, in fact, apply if you have egregious or fraudulent conduct on the part of the defendant. And, second, it will apply if you have an insolvent defendant so there will be an opportunity for the plaintiff to be made whole. We also make changes relating to directors and officers to ensure that they have to be held accountable.  As to the evidentiary standard, the sponsors of this legislation have made it clear that they want to work with Senator Hollings and others who have questions about this standard to change it. What we wish to do is make it comply with the earlier legislation we overwhelmingly passed on Y2K.  There have been a number of comments made today about the Intel Corporation and their views. I ask unanimous consent that a letter from the CEO of the Intel Corporation be printed in the Record.  There being no objection, the letter was ordered to be printed in the Record, as follows:                                            Intel Corporation,                                  Santa Clara, CA, April 19, 1999.     Re Y2000 legislation.     Hon. Ron Wyden,     U.S. Senate,     Washington, DC.       Dear Senator Wyden: I write to ask for your help in      enacting legislation designed to provide guidance to our      state and federal courts in managing litigation that may      arise out of the transition to Year 2000-compliant computer      hardware and software systems. This week, the Senate is      expected to vote upon a bipartisan substitute text for S. 96,      the ``Y2K Act'', which we strongly support.       Parties who are economically damaged by a Year 2000 failure      must have the ability to seek redress where traditional legal      principles would provide a remedy for such injury. At the      same time, it is vital that limited resources be devoted as      much as possible to fixing the problems, not litigating. Our      legal system must encourage parties to engage in cooperative      remediation efforts before taking complaints to the courts,      which could be overwhelmed by Year 2000 lawsuits.       The consensus text that has evolved from continuing,      bipartisan discussions would substantially encourage      cooperative action and discourage frivolous lawsuits.      Included in its provisions are several key measures that are      essential to ensure fair treatment of all parties under the      law:       Procedural incentives--such as a requirement of notice and      an opportunity to cure defects before suit is filed, and      encouragement for engaging in alternative dispute      resolution--that will lead parties to identify solutions      before pursuing grievances in court;       A requirement that courts respect the provisions of      contracts--particularly important in preserving agreements of      the parties on such matters as warranty obligations and      definition of recoverable damages;       Threshold pleading provisions requiring particularity as to      the nature, amount, and factual basis for damages and      materiality of defects, that will help constrain class action      suits brought on behalf of parties that have suffered no      significant injury;       Apportionment of liability according to fault, on      principles approved by the Senate in two previous measures      enacted in the area of securities reform.       This legislation--which will apply only to Y2K suits, and      only for a limited period of time--will allow plaintiffs with      real grievances to obtain relief under the law, while      protecting the judicial system from a flood of suits that      have no objective other than the obtainment of high-dollar      settlements for speculative or de minimus injuries.      Importantly, it does not apply to cases that arise out of      personal injury.       At Intel, we are devoting considerable resources to Y2K      remediation. Our efforts are focused not only on our internal      systems, but also those of our suppliers, both domestic and      foreign. Moreover, we have taken advantage of the important      protections for disclosure of product information that      Congress enacted last year to ensure that our customers are      fully informed as to issues that may be present with legacy      products. What is true for Intel is true for all companies:      time and resources must be devoted as much as possible to      fixing the Y2K problem and not pointing fingers of blame.       For these reasons, we urge you to vote in favor of      responsible legislation that will protect legitimately      aggrieved parties while providing a stable, uniform legal      playing field within which these matters can be handled by      state and federal courts with fairness and efficiency.           Sincerely,                                                 Craig R. Barrett,                                           CEO, Intel Corporation.
