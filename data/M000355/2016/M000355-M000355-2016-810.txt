 President, today we will continue working on two appropriations measures that responsibly fund American priorities. The first will invest in our transportation infrastructure and fund economic development efforts. The second will support our veterans, servicemembers, and their families.  These are good, bipartisan bills that prioritize funding for important programs. They are the result of the continuing leadership of Senators Collins and Kirk. I would encourage my colleagues to work together to continue moving these appropriations bills forward.                          ____________________
