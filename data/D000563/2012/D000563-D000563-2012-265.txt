President, I thank my colleague from North Dakota, Senator Kent Conrad, who is the chairman of the Senate Budget Committee. He is retiring, unfortunately, for the Senate and for this country because he has brought to this Chamber and to the national debate on our deficits an insight and a knowledge of the subject that is unequaled. He has become a close and dear friend of mine, even closer over the last couple years, while we labored shoulder to shoulder on the Simpson-Bowles deficit commission and bipartisan efforts afterwards in the Senate to deal with the deficit.  I am disappointed and somewhat troubled by the argument made by many in this Chamber that the deficit is the most serious problem facing America and then, in the same breath, they call for extending tax cuts to the wealthiest people in this country. What we are proposing is a tax cut for those making up to $250,000 in income. That will certainly include all--all--of the middle class and working families across America.
