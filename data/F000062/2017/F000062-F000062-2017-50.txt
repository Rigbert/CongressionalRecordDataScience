 President, I rise today to introduce the Drone Federalism Act of 2017. ========================= END NOTE =========================   In recent years, small unmanned aircraft have emerged as a transformative new technology. These devices--more commonly known as drones--are highly capable, commercially available, and operable even by novice consumers.  The way that drones are flown in the daily life of our communities and in such great numbers has raised new challenges for safety, privacy, and security that demand cooperation between the federal, state, and local governments.  Today, drone operations present an astounding array of challenges. In just two years, over 2,500 drone incidents have been reported to the Federal Aviation Administration, or FAA. The most recent year of data, from October 2015 to October 2016, saw the number of incidents surge 166% over the prior year. In addition, there have been somealarming reports. On February 26th, 2017, a drone crashed through the 27th floor window of a Manhattan apartment building in New York City. The next month, on March 28th, a drone crashed through the 23rd floor window of City Hall in Buffalo, New York. Drones have repeatedly interfered with medical helicopters. On May 1st, 2016, a medevac helicopter trying to land at Florida Hospital East in Orlando was forced to abort its initial landing because of a drone. On November 14, 2015, a helicopter leaving children's hospital in St. Louis, Missouri had to take evasive action to avoid a drone, banking 60 degrees. Drones also interfere with emergency wild fire fighting. On April 30, 2017, multiple drones filming the Opera fire in Riverside, California forced firefighting helicopters to suspend operations. This happened eight times in 2015, and another eight times in 2016, in California alone. Drones have also crashed into the Golden Gate Bridge, including twice last month. On April 1st, a drone flown almost two miles beyond line of site fell from the sky into a lane of traffic, only a few feet from the crowded sidewalk. Again on April 9th, another drone flown beyond line of site crashed one of the bridge's towers.  These incidents are occurring throughout the nation, but each state has faced its own challenges. Half of all reported incidents came from just five States: California, Florida, New York, Texas, and New Jersey.  In fact, one-fifth of all drone incidents reported to the FAA occurred in California. What works for protecting urban areas will be different than what is needed in rural areas.  The current legal framework for managing the airspace, which evolved over a century of manned aviation, is a poor fit for these new challenges. Drones bear little resemblance to the manned aircraft that came before them.  First, drones intrude into the everyday life of our communities in a way that airplanes do not. Airplanes fly into and out of airports, and municipalities can try through zoning to minimize disruptions. Drones, on the other hand, can take flight from any location, can hover anonymously overhead, and are often used to film whatever aspect of public or private life may catch the operator's interest of the operator's.  Second, drones are seldom engaged in interstate commerce once they have been purchased. Short communication range and limited battery life means that commercially available drones are almost always operated locally, and are unlikely to be operated across state lines.  Third, there are far more drones than there are airplanes. Already, more than 750,000 drones have been registered, and the FAA anticipates up to 4 million drones by 2020. By contrast, there are little more than 200,000 manned aircraft registered in the United States.                           WHAT THE BILL DOES  The Drone Federalism Act would address the modern challenges of drone operations and provide a clear legal framework to regulate drones. The bill has three provisions.  First, the bill preserves the authority of State, Tribal, and local governments to issue reasonable restrictions on the time, manner, and place of drone operations within 200 feet of the ground or a structure. These could include speed limits, local no-fly zones, temporary restrictions, and prohibitions on reckless or drunk operators, for example.  There are regulations that the FAA must issue uniformly throughout the country to ensure the safety and efficiency of the national airspace. This bill does not interfere with that authority. However, the bill does require the FAA to consider legitimate state and local interests when exercising preemption, and to respect any reasonable additional low-altitude restrictions that state and local governments choose to impose.  Second, the bill reaffirms that the federal government will respect private property rights to the airspace in the immediate reaches above a property, including at least the first 200 feet. Neither Congress nor the FAA may authorize drone operations immediately over property without the owner's permission.  Third, the bill promotes cooperation between the levels of government by directing the FAA to partner with a diverse group of cities and States to test out different approaches and report on best practices.              STATE AND LOCAL GOVERNMENTS REGULATE DRONES  The Drone Federalism Act is consistent with the recent action taken by States to regulate drone operations. In response to drone incidents and the concerns of their communities, lawmakers throughout the country have identified the need for a variety of new approaches to managing drones. Indeed, at least 38 States are considering drone legislation this year, according to the National Conference of State Legislatures.  These proposals include: definitions of harassment and voyeurism, airport protections, penalties for interfering with emergency responders, protections against the delivery of contraband at prisons, bans on flights over football games, and definitions of aerial trespass, among others.  This exercise of the laboratories of democracy is appropriate. Our communities should not have to rely on an already overburdened federal agency to craft specific regulatory protections for every local context, supply on-the-ground enforcement agents, or pursue complicated civil cases in court for every infraction. Local police should be empowered to issue citations akin to a traffic violation for clear-cut infractions, without having to prove an action meets a vague tort law standards of negligence and harm. There should be no question that a State has a right to prevent drones from interfering with emergency responders or delivering contraband into prisons; to criminalize hit-and-runs, voyeurism, stalking, or harassment with a drone; to allow judges to deny drones to sex offenders.  Neither should there be any question that a State or municipality has a right to restrict the use of drones where it would be hazardous. Just as the federal government has banned drone operations over Federal Parks, States should have the option to protect State parks. Just as the Federal Government banned flights over sensitive areas, like the entire Capital region, cities should have the option to protect schools or other sensitive areas of their own. Just as the Federal Government can impose temporary flight restrictions over major sporting events or airshows, a county should have the option to protect its summer fairgrounds or holiday parade route.                               CONCLUSION  The Drone Federalism Act that I am introducing today, along with Senators Lee, Blumenthal, and Cotton, is a proactive, affirmative solution. It recognizes the federal interest in protecting the safety and efficiency of the national airspace, while also respecting private property rights, Tribal sovereignty, the powers reserved to the States by the Tenth Amendment, and the general principle of local self-determination.  This bill will invite the democratic participation of government at every level, avoid the need for years of litigation about the scope of preemption, and enable effective local enforcement. It is incumbent on Congress to provide clarity and to guarantee all sides an equal voice moving forward.  This bipartisan bill is the way to do that.                                 ______                                       By
