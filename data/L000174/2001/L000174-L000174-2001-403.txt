President, I am pleased to join with Senator DeWine in introducing bipartisan legislation to provide common-sense tax incentives to help address asbestos liability issues.  First, our legislation would exempt investment income in an asbestos-related designated settlement funds from Federal income tax, much as the investment income in a 401(k) savings plan is exempt from Federal income tax under current law. To qualify for this exemption from Federal taxation, the principal purpose of the asbestos-related designated settlement fund must be to pay present and future claims to asbestos victims and their families. This tax incentive encourages businesses to create settlement funds to meet their asbestos-related liabilities, just as the tax incentive for 401(k) savings plans encourages workers to invest for their retirement.  Second, our legislation recognizes the unique nature of asbestos-related diseases by providing a special ``carry-back'' rule for a company's losses from paying claims to asbestos victims and their families. Under current law, a company may carry back these costs from products sold in the last ten years. This carry-back period, however, fails to match the realities of asbestos-related diseases, which are often latent for forty or more years. In many cases, companies are paying asbestos-related claims for exposure to products that were produced a half-century ago.  Our legislation would permit companies for whom the ten-year period provides no relief to carry back their current expenses from asbestos payments to victims and their families to the years in which the company produced the asbestos product. This extension of the carry-back tax rule is only fair given the long latency period of asbestos-related diseases.  I agree with Supreme Court Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg in the Amchem Products decision that Congress can provide a secure, fair and efficient means of compensating victims of asbestos exposure. The appropriate role for Congress is to provide incentives for private parties to reach settlements, not to take away the legal rights of asbestos victims and their families. Our bipartisan bill provides these tax incentives for private parties involved in asbestos-related litigation to reach global settlements and for asbestos victims and their families to receive the full benefit of the incentives.  Encouraging fair settlements while still preserving the legal rights of all parties involved is a win-win situation for business and asbestos victims. For example, Rutland Fire Clay Company, a family-run, 118-year-old small business in my home state of Vermont, recently reached a settlement with its insurers and the trial bar concerning the firm's asbestos problems. Unlike some big businesses that are trying to avoid any accountability for their asbestos responsibilities through national ``tort reform'' legislation, the Rutland Fire Clay Company and its President, Tom Martin, are doing the right thing within the legal system. The tax incentives in our bipartisan bill will support the Rutland Fire Clay Company and its employees while providing financial security for its settlement with asbestos victims and their families.  I believe it is in the national interest to encourage fair and expeditious settlements between companies and asbestos victims. The legislation we are introducing today will encourage payments to victims while ensuring defendant firms remain solvent.  I thank Senator DeWine for his leadership on this issue. I urge my colleagues to support our bipartisan approach to provide a secure and fairmeans of compensating victims of asbestos exposure and to permit businesses with asbestos liabilities to efficiently meet their responsibilities.                                 ______                                       By
