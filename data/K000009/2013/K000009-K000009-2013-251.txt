Speaker, I rise today to acknowledge the outstanding accomplishments of Doctor Joseph Calabrese, professor of psychiatry at Case Western Reserve University and director of the Mood Disorders Program at University Hospitals Case Medical Center in Cleveland. Doctor Calabrese recently gained international acclaim when he was presented with the Lifetime Achievement Award by the European Bipolar Forum at its annual meeting in Seville, Spain.  The accolades are well deserved--and I speak from personal experience--because Doctor Calabrese has taken the lead role in a major initiative that I helped launch under the auspices of the U.S. Department of Defense to study the effects of post-traumatic stress disorder on soldiers returning from combat zones. I have watched as Doctor Calabrese, working in concert with doctors at the University of Toledo, has conducted truly groundbreaking research involving combat veterans who suffer from PTSD.  As a member of the Defense Subcommittee of House Appropriations, I have long been concerned about the incidence of suicide among our combat veterans. In communities and families throughout our country, we have seen the devastating impact of PTSD. The ambitious research project by Doctor Calabrese that I have been privileged to support has studied the relationship between PTSD and suicidal ideation among members of the Ohio Army National Guard.  After completing a research fellowship at the National Institute of Mental Health, Doctor Calabrese returned to Cleveland to start the Mood Disorders Program. He also co-directs, along with Doctor Robert Finding, M.D., the NIMH-funded Bipolar Research Center in Cleveland. Doctor Calabrese has been the recipient of no fewer than five federal research grants from the NIMH. The Mood Disorders program at University Hospitals Case Medical Center was designated as a Center of Excellence under Dr. Calabrese's exceptional leadership.  Dr. Calabrese has dedicated his work to the improvement of clinical outcomes in under-served populations of bipolar disorder, including people who receive care at community health centers, children, adults, older adults, those in prison and those currently abusing alcohol or drugs. His research reflects a caring nature and true gift of service.  During the course of his career, Doctor Calabrese has published more than 300 peer-reviewed papers. He is a member of a number of scientific advisory boards and is affiliated with the American Psychiatric Association.  I am proud to support his clinical efforts and his exemplary service to the Cleveland community, our nation, and veterans everywhere. I am pleased to commend Doctor Joseph Calabrese on the occasion of his receipt of the European Bipolar Forum's Lifetime Achievement Award and thank him for his noble work.                          ____________________
