President, I join all Vermonters in congratulating David and Ann Scoville on receiving the National Crime Victim Service Award of 2002. We thank them for all they do to help the victims of crime and to help the public understand victims' needs.  Nearly 20 years ago the Scovilles suffered every parent's nightmare--the disappearance and murder of their daughter, Patricia. The crime that took her from them remains unsolved to this day--a situation that has compounded the Scovilles' suffering andone that also torments many other families.  Through their lives and examples, the Scovilles have become role models for grieving families who have suffered similar losses. They have summoned the courage and compassion to harness their pain for positive outcomes. They have made it their work to help other families escape the anguish they endured, and to help raise the awareness of public officials about the importance of victims' participation throughout all phases of the criminal justice process.  Victims of murder, rape, domestic violence, sexual assault and other crimes deserve the understanding and support of the American people and of the Congress. We have a duty to ensure that the criminal justice system is one that respects the rights and dignity of crime victims, rather than one that complicates or even exacerbates the suffering of those already victimized.  Congress has listened to their counsel and to the counsel of other victims of crime. Over the past two decades many of us have worked hard to pass laws that have provided victims with greater rights and assistance, including stronger protection for witnesses of crime; a Victims' Bill of Rights; protection for female victims of violence; mandatory restitution for crime victims; special awareness of the needs of victims with disabilities; special programs for victims of terrorism; and an act for victims of trafficking.  We continue the fight to win more rights and help for victims of crime, largely because the victims' rights agenda in Congress has been advanced, year by year, by advocates like the Scovilles. I, with Senator Kennedy, have introduced the Crime Victims Assistance Act of 2001, which focuses on protecting victims' rights, including victims' enhanced participatory rights at trial and sentencing.  This legislation requires that a responsible official consult with victims prior to detention hearings, and consider victims' views about any contemplated plea agreement. It calls for the presiding judge to inquire regarding victims' views on detention, and prohibits the court from entering a judgment upon a guilty plea without regarding victims' views. The bill also provides for enhanced victims' rights regarding the right to attend the trial and sentencing. Victims are also given specific rights regarding notice of sentence adjustment, discharge from a psychiatric facility and executive clemency.  In addition to these improvements to the Federal system, this legislation proposes several programs to help States provide better assistance for victims of State crimes. These programs would improve compliance with State victims' rights laws, promote the development of state-of-the-art notification systems to keep victims informed of case developments and important dates on a timely and efficient basis, and encourage further experimentation with the community-based restorative justice model in the juvenile court setting.  We were able to include much of the Crime Victims Assistance Act in last year's USA PATRIOT Act supported by Republicans and Democrats. One major provision that remains to be achieved, however, is to eliminate the artificial cap on the Crime Victims' Fund, which has prevented millions of dollars from reaching victims and from supporting essential services for them.  While we have greatly improved our crime victims assistance programs and made advances in recognizing crime victims' rights, we still have more to do. I commend David and Ann Scoville for their leadership and look forward to continuing to work with them to advance crime victims' rights legislation, and to make a difference in the lives of crime victims.                          ____________________
