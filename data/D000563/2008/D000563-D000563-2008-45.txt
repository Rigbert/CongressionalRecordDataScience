President, I ask unanimous consent that when the Senate completes its business today, it stand in recess until 10 a.m. on Thursday, October 2; that following the prayer and pledge, the Journal of proceedings be approved to date, the time for the two leaders be reserved for their use later in the day, and that the Senate then proceed to a period of morning business, with Senators permitted to speak for up to 10 minutes each.
