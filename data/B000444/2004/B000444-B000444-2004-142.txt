 President, I rise today to introduce the Anticounterfeiting Act of 2004, along with Senators Murray, Hollings, Smith, and Allen.  Two years ago, I held a hearing entitled, ``Theft of American Intellectual Property: Fighting Crime Abroad and At Home,'' and I issued a report on the status of our fight against this crime. Today, I attended a hearing chaired by Senator Specter on a similar topic, again driving home for me the serious problems encountered in today's world by American intellectual property.  What I have learned is that every day, thieves steal millions of dollars of American intellectual property from its rightful owners. Over a hundred thousand American jobs are lost as a result.  American innovation and creativity need to be protected by our government no less than our personal property, our homes and our streets. The Founding Fathers had the foresight to provide for protection of intellectual property, giving Congress the power to ``promote the progress of science and useful arts'' by providing copyrights and patents.  American intellectual property represents the largest single sector of the American economy, employing 4.7 million Americans. It has been estimated that software piracy alone cost the U.S. economy over 118,000 jobs and $5.7 billion in wage losses in the year 2000. Even more, the International Planning and Research Corporation estimates that the government loses more than a billion dollars worth of revenue every year from intellectual property theft.  To put that in perspective, with a billion dollars in additional revenue, the American government could pay for child care services for more than 100,000 children annually. Alternatively, $1 billion could be used to fund a Senate proposal to assist schools nationally with emergency school renovations and repairs.  There is another problem. Counterfeiters of software, music CDs and motion pictures are now tampering with authentication features. Holograms, certificates of authenticity, watermarks and other security features allow the copyright owners to distinguish genuine works from counterfeits. But now, highly sophisticated counterfeiters have found ways to tamper with these features to make counterfeit products appear genuine and to increase the selling price of genuine products and licenses. Put another way, not only do crooks illegally copy American intellectual property, they also now illegally fake or steal the very features property owners use to prevent that theft.  Copyrights mean nothing if government authorities fail to enforce the protections they provide intellectual property owners. The criminal code has not kept up with the counterfeiting operations of today's high-tech pirates, and it's time to make sure that it does. The Anticounterfeiting Act of 2004 updates and strengthens the Federal criminal code, which currently makes it a crime to traffic in counterfeit labels or copies of certain forms of intellectual property, but not authentication features. For example, we can currently prosecute someone for trafficking in fake labels for a computer program, but we cannot go after them for faking the hologram that the software maker uses to ensure that copies of the software are genuine.  In addition, many actions that violate current law go unprosecuted in this day and age when priorities, such as the fight against terrorism and life-threatening crimes, necessarily take priority over crimes of property, be they intellectual or physical. Moreover, the victims of this theft often do not have a way to recover their losses from this crime. For this reason, the Anticounterfeiting Act of 2004 also provides a private cause of action, to permit the victims of these crimes to pursue the criminals themselves and recover damages in federal court.  Current law criminalizes trafficking in counterfeit documentation and packaging, but only for software programs. The Anticounterfeiting Act of 2003 updates and expands these provisions to include documentation and packaging for phonorecords, motion pictures, other audiovisual works, and copies of other copyrighted works.  The existing provision with regard to counterfeiting addresses certain items of intellectual property, including motion pictures, software, and phonorecords. The Anticounterfeiting Act of 2004 updates the coverage of this statute to include other copyrighted works, such as books. As published books and ebooks begin to be subject to the piracy already witnessed by motion picture, softward and recording industries, they need the same protection.  This issue is not going way; to the contrary, it is growing, and Congress continues to focus on potential solutions, as evidenced by today's hearing in the Senate Judiciary Committee, and an upcoming hearing in the Foreign Relations Committee. The 2002 version of this bill did not manage to secure passage and enactment into law, but there is reason for optimism that this year its fate will be different. America's content providers, and the many jobs that depend on them, could certainly use the help.  America is a place where we must encourage diverse ideas, and with that encouragement we must protect those ideas. They are the source of our music, our art, our novels, our movies, our software, our products, all that is American culture and American know-how. The Anticounterfeiting Act of 2004 gives our ideas the protection they deserve.  I ask unanimous consent that the text of this bill be printed in the Record.  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the Record, as follows:                                S. 2227       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of      the United States of America in Congress assembled,     SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.       This Act may be cited as the ``Anticounterfeiting Act of      2004''.     SEC. 2. FINDINGS.       Congress finds that--       (1) American innovation, and the protection of that      innovation by the government, has been a critical component      of the economic growth of this Nation throughout the history      of the Nation;       (2) copyright-based industries represent one of the most      valuable economic assets of this country, contributing over 5      percent of the gross domestic product of the United States      and creating significant job growth and tax revenues;       (3) the American intellectual property sector employs      approximately 4,300,000 people, representing over 3 percent      of total United States employment;       (4) the proliferation of organized criminal counterfeiting      enterprises threatens the economic growth of United States      copyright industries;       (5) the American intellectual property sector has invested      millions of dollars to develop highly sophisticated      authentication features that assist consumers and law      enforcement in distinguishing genuine intellectual property      products and packaging from counterfeits;       (6) in order to thwart these industry efforts,      counterfeiters traffic in, and tamper with, genuine      authentication features, for example, by obtaining genuine      authentication features through illicit means and then      commingling these features with counterfeit software or      packaging;       (7) Federal law does not provide adequate civil and      criminal remedies to combat tampering activities that      directly facilitate counterfeiting crimes; and       (8) in order to strengthen Federal enforcement against      counterfeiting of copyrighted works, Congress must enact      legislation that--       (A) prohibits trafficking in, and tampering with,      authentication features of copyrighted works; and       (B) permits aggrieved parties an appropriate civil cause of      action.
