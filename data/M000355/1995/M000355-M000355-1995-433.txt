 Coverdell):  S. 218. A bill to repeal the National Voter Registration Act of 1993, and for other purposes; to the Committee on Rules and Administration.                   THE MOTOR-VOTER REPEAL ACT OF 1995 Mr. McCONNELL. Mr. President, the States may finally receive some long-awaited relief from unfunded mandates, thanks to the winds of change which blew through the country last November. With passage of the unfunded mandates bill currently before the Senate, Congress will not be able to pile mandates on States as it has in the past. However, the unfunded mandates bill is prospective and will not undo the damage which past Congresses have done. The bill I am introducing today would undo some of the unfunded mandates damage by undoing a mandate. Specifically, it would repeal the so-called motor-voter law.  The motor-voter law made for a nice signing ceremony at the White House in 1993, a veritable extravaganza, in fact. It was an easy political hit. Proponents could revel secure in the knowledge that motor-voter sounded good and by dumping the burden on the States no unpopular budget offsets were required on the part of Congress or the President to pay for it.  But, as David Broder wrote in the Washington Post at that time, it was the kind of ``underfunded, overhyped legislation that gives Congress and Washington a bad name.''  Proponents said then that cost was not a problem, that it was a cheap bill. In that case, then finding a way to pay for it should not have been a problem. But Congress did not pay for it. And the fact is, State and local governments are finding that motor-voter is far more expensive than it was slated to be. Take Jefferson County, KY, for instance.  A Louisville Courier-Journal story reported just last month that Jefferson County clerk Rebecca Jackson estimates it will cost the county up to $1.4 million in just the first year. That tally includes over $700,000 for computer equipment and mailing costs of $165,000 annually. Seven employees may have to be hired as well, to cope with the added workload. These costs are not inconsequential, particularly at a time when everyone is feeling squeezed, not least of all--the taxpayers.  California Gov. Pete Wilson estimates it would cost his State alone nearly $36 million. That is why California and several other States are so put out by the motor-voter mandate that they have filed a lawsuit on the grounds that it violates the 10th amendment of the Constitution.  Those who would oppose this repeal will hold up retroactivity as some bugaboo that should not even be seriously considered. But this is one mandate, no doubt there are others, on which the clock should be turned back. It is not enough to keep things from getting worse, we must strive to make them better. From the standpoint of States and taxpayers, repealing motor-voter would be a big step forward.  What is the worst that could happen under a repeal? Why, some States might opt out. Others may not. The fact is, Congress was behind the curve in 1993: 27 States already had some form of motor-voter, and it stands to reason that they would continue to do so were the Federal mandate repealed. The critical point is that it would be their choice.  There would be nothing stopping States from adopting these provisions, other than cost. States would be at liberty to provide motor-voter, mail registration, and agency-based registration, just as they were prior to this mandate.  If they could afford it, fine. If they could not, fine. It should be their call. If motor-voter supporters in Congress would like to devise a model program--such as Federal grants to entice States into participating--go for it. Figure out a way to pay for it and let's vote on it. But the 1993 mandate was a bad deal for States, a bad deal for taxpayers, and it should be repealed.                                 ______      By
