 President, I wish to congratulate our new colleague from Georgia on his insightful and accurate assessment of the biggest challenges confronting our country. Not only did he lay out the biggest challenges, he certainly laid out the best solutions to those challenges to get this country moving again and to guarantee, as he put it, that we leave behind for the next generation a better country than our parents left behind for us.  I congratulate our new colleague for an outstanding major speech.
