President, I rise today to recognize April 28, 1999, as ``Illinois Student Technology Day.'' On that day, approximately 140 schools will participate in school technology demonstrations at the eighth annual Students for the Information Age program at the Illinois State Capitol Building in Springfield.  During this all-day event in the middle of National Science & Technology Week, over 300 Illinois students will demonstrate the important impact technology, and access to it, has had in their classrooms.  The advancements that have been made in technology, and the role it has played in increasing access to valuable information and resources, has improved the learning experience for many of our nation's students. Technology has clearly become a powerful instrument for enhancing the learning process. With the advent of the information age, it is more important than ever to expose students to technological innovations that will play a crucial role in their intellectual development. We need to redouble our efforts to ensure that more students, especially those in rural and impoverished areas, have access to these technological advancements.  I hope that we can look at what will take place in Springfield, IL, on April 28, 1999, as a sign of the continuing commitment to give our students the best possible opportunity to learn and succeed both in the classroom and in their later careers.                          ____________________
