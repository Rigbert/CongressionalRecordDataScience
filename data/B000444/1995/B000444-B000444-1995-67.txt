 President, the reconciliation bill promises to cut corporate welfare, save taxpayers' money and balance the Federal budget. Yet, tucked away, deep in the more than 2,000 pages of the bill, is a golden giveaway of billions of taxpayers' dollars to a powerful special interest lobby.  Initially passed to encourage settlement of the West, the anachronistic 1872 mining law enables gigantic mining interests--many of which are foreign-owned--to purchase the right to mine Federal land for as little as $5 per acre. Literally, for the price of a McDonalds value meal you can buy an acre of Federal land, loaded with gold, silver, platinum and palladium. If this was not enough of a ripoff, the law does not require mining concerns to pay any royalties to American taxpayers for these minerals, an annual loss of roughly $100 million. The net effect of this law is simple: Foreign mining companies get the gold, and American taxpayers get the shaft.  The sham reform contained in the bill does little to change the current situation. Though the bill requires that fair market value be paid, it only applies this standard to the surface of, what is often times, barren desert land. No consideration is given to the minerals, to the gold, silver and platinum, which are buried underneath the ground. It sounds good on its face--paying fair market value--but this alleged reform is nothing more than face-saving.  Our conservative colleagues argue endlessly that we need to run the Federal Government, more like a business. But how could any business survive, even for a day, by opening its warehouse doors and giving away its products?  On top of these fraudulent prospective changes, the bill's grand fathering provisions guarantee the status quo for over 200 claims currently pending with the Interior Department. These applications, involving over 130,000 acres of public land, 18 national parks, and more than $15 billion in precious minerals, would be granted without the rightful payment to the taxpayers who own the land. Again, billions of taxpayers' money is given away, just handed over due to this antiquated law.  Just last month, Secretary of the Interior Babbitt was forced to sign away over 100 acres of land, containing 1 billion dollars' worth of minerals to a Danish mining conglomerate which paid an embarrassing $275--Federal couch change. This century-old practice has become eerily reminiscent of the Teapot Dome scandal during the 1920's.  Unlike farmers and ranches who have a vested interest in preserving their land, miners have virtually no stake in using the land in an environmentally sound manner. After the gold is taken, the shaft is plugged, and the company abandons the land, often times we are left with dangerous, toxic abandoned mines, which require millions of taxpayers' dollars to clean up. In fact, the Superfund national priority list of hazardous waste sites contains 59 properties associated with mining.  The cosmetic mining law reform in this bill is exactly the type of nonsensical policy that has angered many Americans and caused them to lose faith in Government's ability to improve the lives of ordinary people. It ought to be rejected: The pot of gold should be found at the end of the rainbow, not at the end of a patent application. Americans deserve better.                                  eitc
