Mr. Speaker, I rise today to express my disappointment regarding the progress of the Czech Republic in its on-going transition from Communist dictatorship to democracy. Overall, the Czech record is quite good. And the Czech Republic has made, possibly, the greatest strides of any countries in the region in its efforts to establishing a functioning free market. But in one particular area, the Czech record has been abysmal. Since the breakup of the Czechoslovak Federation at the end of 1992, the Czech Republic has imposed a citizenship law that discriminates against the Czech Republic'slargest minority group, the Roma, and violates international law.  The Helsinki Commission, which I now chair, flagged this problem in a report in 1994. More recently, in early April, the Council of Europe and the UNHCR each released reports on the Czech Republic. Although the reports differ in their specific mandate and analysis, their final conclusions are consistent: The current Czech citizenship law, both as drafted and applied, violates international standards. In particular, both reports found that--contrary to the previous assertions of the Czech Government--the Czech law has created both de jure and de facto statelessness. The Council of Europe report used particularly pointed language, noting that while some of the practices associated with the implementation of the law ``might have been lawful under the Czech law of 1967. * * * [they] clearly do not meet European legal standards.'' Moreover, according to the recently released State Department country report, some who are affected by this law have been deported, contrary to the assurances I had previously received from Czech officials.  I appreciate that efforts have been made to improve the citizenship law and strengthen its association with international human rights norms. In particular, I understand an amendment to the law was passed on April 26. That amendment, however, fails to address the fundamental shortcomings of the law.  For example, it appears that former Czechoslovaks who were long-term residents of the Czech Republic must still make cumbersome applications and pay so-called administrative fees in order to be considered for citizenship in the only homeland they have ever known. In addition, it has been reported that the amended law gives the Ministry of Interior complete discretion to require those applicants to have a clean criminal record. It seems to me that this would be like telling charter 77 dissidents that of course they have a right to free speech--provided they got a waiver from the Ministry of Interior before exercising it. In short, even as amended, the Czech citizenship law still stands in violation of the Czech Republic's international commitments.  In a few weeks, Czechs will return to the polls to elect a new parliament. In that context, the significance of the citizenship law is all the more poignant: those wrongly denied citizenship are also wrongly denied the right to vote.  Mr. Speaker, I do not understand what benefit the Czech Government sees in maintaining provisions of this law that have generated international criticism. Those who have criticized this law, including the Helsinki Commission, are not proposing that the Czech Republic adopt dual citizenship; we are not proposing that former Czechoslovaks who were or are permanent residents in Slovakia be given citizenship; and we are not saying that the Czech Republic does not have a right to protect its borders. Instead, a finite number of people, all of whom are, by definition, permanent residents in the Czech Republic anyway, must have their citizenship restored if the Czech Republic is to bring its law into conformity with the international standards it has adopted.                          ____________________
