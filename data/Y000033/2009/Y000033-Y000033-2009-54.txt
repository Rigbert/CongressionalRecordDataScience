I thank the gentleman for yielding to me.  Madam Speaker, I rise in support of H.R. 844, the Marine Mammal Rescue Assistance Amendments of 2009. This important piece of legislation continues to build upon the original legislation this body passed in 1972, the Marine Mammal Protection Act.  Continuing to recognize the importance of marine mammals and the fragile state of some of their populations, Congress passed the Marine Mammal Rescue Assistance Act in 2000 and created the John H. Prescott Marine Mammal Assistance Program.  Keeping with the spirit of these achievements in marine mammal protection, I introduced this legislation which builds upon our earlier successes and expands the Prescott Grant Program. This bill will allow the Secretary of Commerce to provide grants to participants who assist in removing ropes and other materials from marine mammals while at sea.  By providing grants to institutions such as the Alaskan Sealife Center, untold numbers of marine mammals have been positively impacted. Support for this bill will further invest in the health of our oceans and its numerous marine resources.  Again, I urge my colleagues to support marine mammals and the passage of H.R. 844.
