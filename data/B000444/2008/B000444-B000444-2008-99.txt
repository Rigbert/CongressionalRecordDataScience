 Dr. Harris is capable of being a Senator. She has the capability and competence to do any number of jobs I can think of.  I compliment my colleague for inviting the Rev. Dr. Harris to open the Senate this morning. As you could tell by Senator Carper's reference to Reverend Harris, Senator Carper is a man of deep faith, as I know the Chair is and as I am. We share different faiths, but we share a common set of values, as almost all the confessional faiths do, not just the Christian faith which we share. I am a Roman Catholic, my friend is a Presbyterian, and Dr. Harris is a Methodist.  The thing about Dr. Harris--and I will not take a lot of the Senate's time--the thing about Dr. Harris that has impressed me from the many years--my Lord, I think it may be more than a couple decades. I have known her a long time. She was an incredibly well-respected figure in my State before she went to the ministry--before. Since then, she has carried on that same path of excellence that she did prior to the ministry. But if I can take a page from my colleague's book in referencing Dr. Harris's opening prayer, she talked about wisdom, which she knows we need in abundance. But she also talked about--she used the word that, if I had to describe her, would be the word I would use. She talked about tolerance. The thing that most impresses me about the Rev. Dr. Harris is her literal--not figurative, not rhetorical--commitment to the notion of tolerance.  She has such an expansive view of human nature. She has such a welcoming--not only faith but personality.  I think if I had a wish, if the Lord came down and sat at my desk and said: Joe, you get one wish. What is the one attribute you would like to pervade this Chamber? Maybe even more than wisdom, it would be tolerance.  Tolerance is not engaging in relativity. Tolerance does not mean we don't have strong beliefs and strong opinions and strong positions on faith. Tolerance is what not only our Christian religion teaches us but Judaism and Islam and Hinduism. It is about tolerance. It seems to me that is the single most lacking element in American society today.  I think if you get to know her--you are not going to get to know her, I realize that is a bit of an exaggeration--I hope you get a chance to engage Rev. Dr. Harris today. She exudes the notion of tolerance which equates with her notion of equality. It gets to what--I will conclude--my friend Tom said, the two great commandments: love thy God and love thy neighbor. This is all about loving thy neighbor. We are the single most heterogenous democracy in the history of mankind. It is unable to function--I look at the pages wondering: What is this old guy saying? This country is unable to function without the lubricant of tolerance. And Dr. Harris embodies that.  I am honored to be here this morning with her. I, again, compliment my colleague on not only his comments but inviting Dr. Harris to be here and introducing her to all of you and to those who are watching C-SPAN this morning, watching her.  I yield the floor.                          ____________________
