 President, as my good friend the Democratic leader used to remind me, the majority leader always gets the last word.  This is not a new issue. It was around during the previous Congress. Other committees acted--other committee chairmen like what Chairman Burr and Vice Chair Feinstein have done. Hopefully, we can minimize sort of manufacturing problems here that keep us from going forward when it appears to me that both sides really would like to get an outcome and believe it would be best for the country to get an outcome before we go into the recess. We will continue to discuss the matter and hope that we can find a way forward.  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Lankford). The Senator from Oregon.
