President, I rise to celebrate our Nation's 33rd Hispanic Heritage Month, which commemorates Hispanic Americans and their contributions to the strength of our Nation in the past, present, and future.  Congress started the tradition of Hispanic Heritage Month in 1968 with the National Hispanic Heritage Week, and expanded the annual celebration to a month-long event in 1989. This year, the month follows the terrorist attacks on our country on September 11. More than ever, it is essential to take this opportunity to recognize the many hardworking Hispanic Americans who have helped make our country great and will continue to do so throughout our future. Our country stands united, with Americans of Central and South American descent standing alongside Americans with roots from all over the world.  There are many shining examples of Hispanic Americans who have stood up for our country and communities in times of war and peace. Ancestors of present-day Hispanics sacrificed or risked their lives throughout the many years of North American history that led to our country's beginning. Hispanic Americans have served the United States in every war since World War I. Many Hispanic American service members have earned distinction in our military, such as Emilio A. De La Garza, who entered the U.S. Marine Corps in Illinois and was awarded the Medal of Honor, America's highest decoration for valor.  In Silvis, IL, there is a monument to eight heroes of Mexican-American descent who gave their lives in defense of this nation. The street the monument is on was once called Second Street USA, but it is now called Hero Street USA. The street's name honors 84 men from the 22 families on one small block of this street participated in World War II, Korea and Vietnam. Many of them grew up on this street, some working for the railroad as their fathers did in Mexico. Today the street serves as a remembrance of those who courageously served our country.  Other Hispanic Americans stand up for their communities on a daily basis. Whether serving in our town councils, fire departments, or police departments, they are always working to advance our safety and quality of life. These local heroes include Raymond Orozco, who led the Chicago Fire Department with distinction until his recent retirement, and Jaime Gonzalez, the first Hispanic police officer in Elgin, IL.  Hispanic Americans also have enhanced our national prosperity and will continue to play an important role in our economy. A study by the National Academy of Sciences found that the Latino community contributes about $10 billion to the U.S. economy per year. According to the Census, Hispanics owned about 1.2 million nonfarm businesses in 1997, employing over 1.3 million people and generating $186.3 billion in business. The Small Business Administration tells us that minority and women-owned businesses are the most rapidly growing segments of the business community, and the number of Hispanic-owned businesses has increased by over 600 percent over the past 20 years. Female Latino-owned businesses are growing faster than any other segment of business owners. According to the Center for Women's Business Research, two-thirds of Latina entrepreneurs came into business ownership not by purchasing, inheriting or acquiring a business, but by starting their own. These are women like Chicagoan Sonia Archer, who, while raising a child, founded a home-based business marketing discounted legal services for people who cannot afford attorneys' fees. Stories like Sonia's illustrate how Hispanic Americans bring great innovation and success to our economy.  A wide array of talented Hispanic Americans enrich arts and athletics in our country. In the literary world, Sandra Cisneros brings us powerful, eloquent stories of young women growing up in communities in Chicago, or on the Mexican border, that are full of challenges and beauty. Tito Puente, known as ``El Rey'' or The King of Mambo, delighted audiences around the world with his musical gifts, using the timbal, vibraphone, trap drums, conga drums, claves, piano, saxophone, and clarinet. Hispanic Americans have also brought tremendous talent to America's pastime: baseball. Among the earlier figures was Roberto Clemente, who played right-field for the Pittsburgh Pirates from 1955 to 1972, and won four National League batting titles, twelve Golden Glove awards, and the title of National League's Most Valuable Player in 1966. Then there is Nomar Garciaparra, who in 1997 set several rookie records during what Baseball Weekly called the greatest rookie season in history. Today we have Sammy Sosa, who is outfielder for the Chicago Cubs and the only player in the history of baseball to hit 60 home runs in each of three different seasons.  As we take time to reflect upon the strength Hispanic Americans bring to our country, we must also remember that many Latinos face challenges in our society. Fair and equal treatment of all Americans is a cornerstone of our society and our political system. Unfortunately, despite great progress, the struggle for civil rights and equal treatment under the law continues today for many citizens, including our fellow Hispanic Americans.  A time of national crisis reminds us that we must unite against hate and bigotry. I support several key bills that would bring us closer to this goal. First, I hope to see passage of the Local Law Enforcement Enhancement Act of 2001, also known as the hate crimes bill. Among other things, this legislation would expand current Federal protections against hate crimes based on race, religion, and national origin; authorize grants for programs designed to combat and prevent hate crimes; and enable the Federal Government to assist State and local law enforcement in investigating and prosecuting hate crimes. I have also introduced the Reasonable Search Standards Act, which would prohibit United States Customs Service personnel working at our borders and in our airports from searching or detaining individuals solely based on their race, religion, gender, national origin, or sexual orientation. Finally, I am cosponsoring the End Racial Profiling Act, which would make profiling by any law enforcement agent or agency a crime prosecutable in any State court of general jurisdiction or in a District Court of the United States; and would require Federal, State, and local law enforcement agencies receiving Federal grants to maintain adequate policies and procedures designed to eliminate racial profiling. I believe these measures take important steps toward preventing discrimination and violence based on race and ethnicity.  There are currently 31.5 million Hispanic Americans living in the United States, and Hispanic Americans comprise 35 percent of the population under the age of 18. Sadly, only 57 percent of Latino students complete high school and only 10.6 percent earn a bachelor's degree. We can do better. This year Congress has worked with the administration to facilitate real education reform based on high standards and meaningful accountability measures. As we work to raise the bar for students and teachers, we must also ensure that schools across the country have adequate resources to hire and train teachers and principals, help all students attain fluency in English, integrate technology effectively in the classroom, and provide children with enriching after-school activities. I support the 21st Century Higher Education Initiative, which will substantially expand college opportunity through student aid, early intervention efforts, and more resources to strengthen minority-serving institutions. I also introduced the Children's Adjustment, Relief, and Education, CARE, Act to enable immigrant children to fulfill their potential and pursue higher education on the same terms as other children.  According to the 2000 Census, 60 percent of Latinos in this Nation are natives of the United States. Whether Hispanic Americans were born here or moved to our country later in life, most of them feel the impact of immigration policy. Many live in immigrant families or communities, and many, like most Americans, have strong memories of or connections to our immigrant heritage. I support reforming immigration laws to ensure the due process rights of immigrants, so that they are guaranteed fairness in our courts and are not unnecessarily detained for indefinite periods. We also need to enhance the efficiency and accountability of the Immigration and Naturalization Service. Finally, it is essential to protect the safety of our Nation's immigrants and their due process rights at our borders, while enforcing our immigration laws and protecting our national security.  Hispanic Heritage Month in 2001 gives us an opportunity to deepen our understanding, appreciation, and common bonds with each other. It also gives us pause, reminding us of the American ideals we must continue to fight for. The challenges that we face in Congress and our Nation are not insurmountable. Together, we can stand up for the rights of all Americans, including our Hispanic American friends. And together, we can recognize how our diverse cultures and talents contribute to our collective strength as Americans.                          ____________________
