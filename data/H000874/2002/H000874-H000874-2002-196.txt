Speaker, the gentleman from Texas said they must have been out of their minds. Of course it was his side of the aisle that included this provision. Remember that, I say to the gentleman, and tell them that.  Mr. Speaker, we are here today for one reason and one reason only: to indulge the GOP in its pavlovian policy prescription for every occasion: tax cuts. The GOP sold its tax cuts last year by telling the American people they were overcharged. Democrats fought for and are still for affordable tax relief. But we knew the projected surplus might never materialize, and we were right.  Mr. Speaker, $5.6 trillion the President said we had; he came down to us now and says we have $.6 trillion. The President's own budget says the tax cut was the single biggest factor in erasing our surplus. So is the GOP here to say they made a mistake, to say, let us stop the raid on Social Security and Medicare? Of course not.  With deficits projected every year for the next 10 years and an unchecked raid on Social Security and Medicare, the GOP proposes a bill that would deplete an estimated $7 trillion from the Social Security and Medicare trust funds.  I asked Secretary O'Neill that yesterday, whether $4 trillion to $7 trillion was the accurate figure, and he said he thought it probably was. Just as the baby boomers become of age, to take Social Security, we are doing this to them.  Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to reject this demagogic, reckless, irresponsible piece of legislation.
