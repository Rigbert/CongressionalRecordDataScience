President, if the majority leader is still on the floor, I hope that he realizes--I am sure he does--that there are many of us--I would say the majority of both Democrats and Republicans--who do want to come together on this issue and get it here in the Senate and get this finished. He mentioned the foreign ops bill, which is one where the distinguished Senator from Kentucky [Mr. McConnell] and I had the bill on the floor. We had, I believe, 193 items in disagreement with the other body. We settled 192 of the 193, and I think it is unfortunate that it is held up.  It is beginning to create a problem in the Middle East peace process with the Camp David countries. I think that is of some significance. I know all of us on the floor support the help we give those countries, especially at this critical time. I hope we might work that out. I think we can go through dozens of other issues, where it seems that the solution is so close and so within our grasp. Frankly, Mr. President, I wish the majority leader, the Speaker, and the President all the best in their negotiations, and the distinguished Democratic leaders in both the House and the Senate, who will join with them.                          ____________________
