President, I rise today to introduce a Congressional Joint Resolution to prevent the sale of $53 million worth of arms to the Government of Bahrain.  As I witness the series of extraordinary events that are sweeping across the Arab world, I am reminded of our own history, and America's struggle that led to the ideas that are enshrined in our Constitution. Freedom of speech. Freedom of religion. The right of people to peaceably assemble, and to petition their government for a redress of grievances. The Arab Spring, reminds us that these freedoms are indeed universally sought.  The United States should stick up for individuals seeking such freedoms. not reward those who violently suppress such aspirations.  Selling weapons to the Government of Bahrain right now is about as backwards as a teacher giving the playground bully a pair of brass knuckles instead of putting him in detention. When the rulers of Bahrain are committing human right abuses against peaceful protesters, should we really be rewarding this type of behavior?  First, some context. Protests erupted in Bahrain on the heels of protests in neighboring Tunisia and Egypt, as part of what is being called the Arab Spring. For many years the Shiite majority of Bahrain has been ruled by a Sunni royal family that has excluded most Shiites from political power and economic opportunity. When the people of Bahrain went to the streets to protest, the government responded with crushing force. Police opened fire on unarmed demonstrators, killing seven and seriously wounding hundreds. Protestors and dissident leaders were rounded up and arrested.  It is estimated that 30 people have been killed by government security forces since the start of these largely peaceful protests. Government agencies also fired more than 2,500 people suspected of sympathizing with the protestors and their democratic demands. A special military court was established by decree and has convicted over 100 people on dubious grounds.  Recently, 20 doctors who were caught treating wounded protestors were sentenced to prison terms as long as 15 years. One of the doctors said she was tortured and threatened with rape while in custody. In explaining the reason for her offense, the doctor said ``My only crime is I did my job; I helped people.'' Amnesty International has pointed out that an increasing number of cases involving civilians arrested are now being primarily tried in military court, without due process.  Human Rights Watch also reports that four people have died in custody. Their suspected cause of death is torture, and medical neglect. Leading political opposition figures who are demanding democratic reforms have been sentenced, in some cases, to life in prison, solely for their role in organizing peaceful protests.  Life in prison just for trying to hold their government democratically accountable. Just because they want the same opportunities as their Sunni neighbors. Just because they want to petition their government for a redress of grievances. I read these reports and I ask myself what our own constitutional framers would have to say about such actions.  So what's the Administration's response to Bahrain's actions? What's our government's response to these human rights violations? Well, Mr. President, the Administration has publicly called for an end to the violence. Secretary Clinton has said that the murder of unarmed protesters must stop.  However, at the same time, the Administration formally notified Congress on September 14 of its plans to sell the ruling regime of Bahrain 44 Armored High Mobility Multipurpose Wheeled Vehicles, over 200 anti-tank missiles and 50 bunker buster missiles, 48 missile launchers, spare parts, support and test equipment, personnel training and training equipment, technical and logistics support services, among other things, all for 53 million dollars. The State Department also notified Congress that it is preparing to send $15.5 million in Foreign Military Financing to Bahrain.  Like I said we are giving the bully brass knuckles--and then some.  Should our country really reward a regime that has stifled its citizen's freedom of speech; a regime that has openly fired on peacefully assembled protestors; a regime who has tortured doctors for simply treating their fellow citizens?  I cannot support this sale while these abuses continue. That is why I, along with my colleague Congressman McGovern in the House of Representatives, am introducing this Congressional joint resolution. I hope my colleagues will join me in sending a message to Bahrain that we will not reward human rights abuses.  To quote from the President's address to the United Nations General Assembly last month: ``Something is happening in our world. The way things have been is not the way they will be. The humiliating grip of corruption and tyranny is being pried open. Technology is putting power in the hands of the people. The youth are delivering a powerful rebuke to dictatorship, and rejecting the lie that some races, religions and ethnicities do not desire democracy.'' Well it is clear that the people of Bahrain desire greater democracy and opportunity and we should not be rewarding their oppressors with an arms sale at this time. Colleagues, please join me in cosponsoring this Congressional joint resolution.  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the text of the joint resolution be printed in the Record.  There being no objection, the text of the joint resolution was ordered to be printed in the Record, as follows:                              S.J. Res. 28       Whereas the Kingdom of Bahrain is a party to several      international human rights instruments, including the      International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights, adopted      December 16, 1966, and entered into force March 23, 1976, and      the Convention Against Torture and Other Cruel, Inhuman or      Degrading Treatment or Punishment, done at New York December      10, 1984;       Whereas the Government of Bahrain had made several notable      human rights reforms during the 2000s;       Whereas, despite those reforms, significant human rights      concerns remained in early 2011, including the alleged      mistreatment of detained persons and the discrimination      against certain Bahraini citizens in the political, economic,      and professional spheres of Bahrain;       Whereas this discrimination has included the banning of      particular religious groups from holding specific government      positions, including the military and security services,      without reasonable justification;       Whereas hundreds of thousands of protesters in the Kingdom      of Bahrain have significantly intensified their calls for      government reform and respect for human rights starting in      February 2011;       Whereas independent observers, including the Department of      State, Human Rights Watch, Human Rights First, Amnesty      International, and Freedom House, found that the majority of      protesters have been peaceful in their demands, and that acts      of violence by protesters have been rare;       Whereas the Government of Bahrain has systematically      suppressed the protests through a wide range of acts      constituting serious and grave violations of human rights;       Whereas, according to the Project of Middle East Democracy,      at least 32 people have been killed by the Government of      Bahrain's security forces since February 2011;       Whereas at least three deaths occurred while the      individuals were in detention, according to the Ministry of      Interior of the Government of Bahrain;       Whereas there have been credible reports from Human Rights      Watch, Human Rights     First, Physicians for Human Rights, and the Bahrain Center      for Human Rights of severe mistreatment of detainees,      including acts rising to the level of torture;       Whereas the Government of Bahrain has investigated and      prosecuted individuals who were only peacefully exercising      their rights to freedom of expression, political opinion, and      assembly;       Whereas the Government of Bahrain has continued to      prosecute civilians, including medical professionals, in      military-security courts;       Whereas cases continued to be tried in the military-     security courts despite promises by the Government of Bahrain      to transfer those cases to civilian venues;       Whereas the military-security courts' procedures and      actions severely limited due process rights or complied with      due process formally rather than substantively;       Whereas the Government of Bahrain's recent promises to have      civilian courts hear the appeals from military-security      courts are insufficient to rectify the due process violations      that occurred at the trial stage;       Whereas the Government of Bahrain has moved quickly to      prosecute and sentence political opponents to lengthy prison      terms, while at the same time slowly investigating, or      failing to investigate at all, government and security      officials who appear to have committed or assisted in human      rights violations against political opponents;       Whereas Physicians for Human Rights has documented that the      Government of Bahrain's security forces have targeted medical      personnel by abducting medical workers, abusing patients,      intimidating wounded protesters from accessing medical      treatment, and sentencing medical professionals to lengthy      prison terms in the military-security courts for protesting      the government's interference in treating injured protesters;       Whereas the Government of Bahrain has destroyed more than      40 Shi'a mosques and religious sites throughout Bahrain since      February 2011;       Whereas Bahrain's legislative lower house, the Council of      Representatives (Majlis an-nuwab) is constituted of      disproportionately drawn districts that violates the      principle of equal suffrage for Bahraini citizens,      particularly the Shi'a community;       Whereas the Government of Bahrain employed tactics of      retribution against perceived political opponents, dismissing      more than 2,500 workers, academics, medics, and other      professionals from their places of employment;       Whereas the Government of Bahrain has violated      international labor standards through the dismissals of the      aforementioned citizens;       Whereas the Department of Labor has received an official      complaint regarding the failure of the Government of Bahrain      to live up to its commitments with respect to workers' rights      under its Free Trade Agreement with the United States;       Whereas the state-run media of Bahrain have gone beyond      legitimate criticism of political opponents towards      explicitly and implicitly threatening the physical safety and      integrity of those opponents specifically and the Shi'a      community generally, creating greater animosity amongst the      entire population and making reconciliation of all Bahraini      citizens more difficult;       Whereas the Government of Bahrain has expelled      international journalists and stopped issuing visas to      journalists on grounds that do not appear to be justified by      legitimate safety or security concerns;       Whereas the Department of State included Bahrain among a      list of countries necessitating additional human rights      scrutiny in a June 15, 2011, submission to the United Nations      Human Rights Council;       Whereas the Government of Bahrain has taken limited      positive measures in recent months, including agreeing to      allow the establishment of the Bahrain Independent Commission      of Inquiry (BICI) composed of well-renowned international      human rights experts who are authorized to investigate human      rights violations and recommend measures for accountability;       Whereas the BICI human rights report is due to be submitted      to the Government of Bahrain on October 30, 2011;       Whereas the Department of Defense notified Congress on      September 14, 2011, of a proposed military arms sale to      Bahrain worth approximately $53,000,000;       Whereas the Department of State notified Congress on      September 13, 2011, of a proposed obligation of Foreign      Military Funds in the amount of $15,461,000 for the upgrading      and maintenance of certain military equipment;       Whereas other military allies of the United States,      including the United Kingdom, France, Spain, and Belgium,      have suspended or limited certain licenses and arms sales to      Bahrain since February 2011;       Whereas evidence gathered from protesters by the Bahrain      Center for Human Rights indicated that tear gas canisters      used against peaceful protesters contained markings which      showed they were manufactured in the United States; and       Whereas providing military equipment and provisions for      upgrades to a government that commits human rights violations      and that has undertaken insufficient measures to seek reform      and accountability is at odds with United States foreign      policy goals of promoting democracy, human rights,      accountability, and stability: Now, therefore, be it       Resolved by the Senate and House of Representatives of the      United States of America in Congress assembled,     SECTION 1. LIMITATION ON CERTAIN PROPOSED SALES OF DEFENSE                    ARTICLES AND DEFENSE SERVICES TO THE KINGDOM OF                    BAHRAIN.
