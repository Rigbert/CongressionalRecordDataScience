 Ukraine is a friend of the United States and it has looked to the West to meet naked Russian aggression.  As President Poroshenko's speech reminded us, there are objectives that bind our countries, such as the pursuit of freedom and representative government. Let's make it clear. We stand with Ukraine. We stand with the Ukrainian people in their struggle against external aggression and we stand with them in their struggle to secure the same kinds of rights and liberties each of us enjoy in America.                          ____________________
