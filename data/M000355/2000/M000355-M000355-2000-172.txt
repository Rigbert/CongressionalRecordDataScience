 President, I ask unanimous consent that when the Senate completes its business today, it stand in adjournment until 9:30 a.m. on Wednesday, June 21. I further ask unanimous consent that on Wednesday immediately following the prayer, the Journal of proceedings be approved to date, the morning hour be deemed expired, the time for the two leaders be reserved for their use later in the day, and Senator Graham of Florida be recognized in morning business for up to 40 minutes, to be followed by Senator Voinovich for 40 minutes, and the Senate then resume consideration of the foreign operations appropriations bill.
