 I made an offer to do so because it is hard to see the point in allowing yet another day to elapse when everyone has already had a chance to say their piece, when the end game appears obvious to all, and when the need to move forward in a thoughtful but expeditious manner seems perfectly clear. But this is the Senate, and Members are entitled to different views and Members have tools to assert those views. It is the nature of the body where we work.  Moreover, it is important to remember that it was not just the denial of consent which brought us to where we are. The kind of short-term extension that would have provided the Senate with the time and space it needed to advance bipartisan compromise legislation through regular order was also blocked in a floor vote.  But what has happened has happened, and we are where we are. Now is the time to put all that in the past and work together to diligently make some discrete and sensible improvements to the House bill.  Before scrapping an effective system that has helped protect us from attack in favor of an untried one, we should at least work toward securing some modest degree of assurance that the new system can, in fact, actually work. The Obama administration also already told us that it would not be able to make any firm guarantees in that regard--that it would work--at least the way the bill currently reads. And the way the bill currently reads, there is also no requirement--no requirement--for the retention and availability of significant data for analysis. These are not small problems.  The legislation we are considering proposes major changes to some of our Nation's most fundamental and necessary counterterrorism tools. That is why the revelations from the administration shocked many Senators, including a lot of supporters of this legislation. It is simply astounding that the very government officials charged with implementing the bill would tell us, both in person and in writing, that if it turns out this new system doesn't work, then they will just come back to us and let us know. If it doesn't work, they will just come back and let us know. This is worrying for many reasons, not the least of which is that we don't want to find out the system doesn't work in a far more tragic way. That is why we need to do what we can today to ensure that this legislation is as strong as it can be under the circumstances.  Here are the kinds of amendments I hope every Senator will join me in supporting today.  One amendment would allow for more time for the construction and testing of a system that does not yet exist. Again, one amendment would allow for more time for the construction and testing of a system that does not yet exist.  Another amendment would ensure that the Director of National Intelligence is charged with at least reviewing and certifying the readiness of the system.  Another amendment would require simple notification if telephone providers--the entities charged with holding data under this bill--elect to change their data-retention policies. Let me remind my colleagues that one provider has already said expressly and in writing that it would not commit to holding the data for any period of time under the House-passed bill unless compelled by law. So this amendment represents the least we can do to ensure we will be able to know, especially in an emergency, whether the dots we need to connect have actually been wiped away.  We will also consider an amendment that would address concerns we have heard from the nonpartisan Administrative Office of the U.S. Courts--in other words, the lifetime Federal judges who actually serve on the FISA Court. In a recent letter, they wrote that the proposed amicus provision ``could impede the FISA Courts' role inprotecting the civil liberties of Americans.''  I ask unanimous consent that the full text of that letter be printed in the Record at the conclusion of my remarks.  So the bottom line is this: The basic fixes I have just mentioned are common sense. Anyone who wants to see the system envisioned under this bill actually work will want to support them. And anyone who has heard the administration's ``we will get back to you if there is a problem'' promise should support these modest safeguards as well.  We may have been delayed getting to the point at which we have arrived, but now that we are here, let's work cooperatively, seriously, and expeditiously to move the best legislation possible and prevent any more delay and uncertainty.  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in the Record, as follows:                                      Administrative Office of the                                         United States Courts,                                      Washington, DC, May 4, 2015.     Hon. Devin Nunes,     Chairman, Permanent Select Committee on Intelligence, House          of Representatives, Washington, DC.       Dear Mr. Chairman: I write regarding H.R. 2048, the ``USA      Freedom Act,'' which was recently ordered reported by the      Judiciary Committee, to provide perspectives on the      legislation, particularly an assessment that the pending      version of the bill could impede the effective operation of      the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Courts.       In letters to the Committee on January 13, 2014 and May 13,      2014, we commented on various proposed changes to the Foreign      Intelligence Surveillance Act (FISA). Our comments focused on      the operational impact of certain proposed changes on the      Judicial Branch, particularly the Foreign Intelligence      Surveillance Court (``FISC'') and the Foreign Intelligence      Surveillance Court of Review (collectively ``FISA Courts''),      but did not express views on core policy choices that the      political branches are considering regarding intelligence      collection. In keeping with that approach, we offer views on      aspects of H.R. 2048 that bear directly on the work of the      FISA Courts and how that work is presented to the public. We      sincerely appreciate the ongoing efforts of the bipartisan      leadership of all the congressional committees of      jurisdiction to listen to and attempt to accommodate our      perspectives and concerns.       We respectfully request that, if possible, this letter be      included with your Committee's report to the House on the      bill.                          Summary of Concerns       We have three main concerns. First, H.R. 2048 proposes a      ``panel of experts'' for the FISA Courts which could, in our      assessment, impair the courts' ability to protect civil      liberties by impeding their receipt of complete and accurate      information from the government (in contrast to the helpful      amicus curiae approach contained in the FISA Improvements Act      of 2013 (``FIA''), which was approved in similar form by the      House in 2014). Second, we continue to have concerns with the      prospect of public ``summaries'' of FISA Courts' opinions      when the opinions themselves are not released to the public.      Third, we have a few other specific technical concerns with      H.R. 2048 as drafted.                       Nature of the FISA Courts       With the advent of a new Congress and newly proposed      legislation, it seems helpful to restate briefly some key      attributes of the work of the FISA Courts.       The vast majority of the work of the FISC involves      individual applications in which experienced judges apply      well-established law to a set of facts presented by the      government--a process not dissimilar to the ex parte      consideration of ordinary criminal search warrant      applications. Review of entire programs of collection and      applications involving bulk collection are a relatively small      part of the docket, and applications involving novel legal      questions, though obviously important, are rare.       In all matters, the FISA Courts currently depend on--and      will always depend on--prompt and complete candor from the      government in providing the courts with all relevant      information because the government is typically the only      source of such information.       A ``read copy'' practice--similar to the practices employed      in some federal district courts for Title III wiretap      applications--wherein the government provides the FISC with      an advance draft of each planned application, is the major      avenue for court modification of government-sought      surveillance. About a quarter of ``read copies'' are modified      or withdrawn at the instigation of the FISC before the      government presents a final application--in contrast to the      overwhelming majority of formal applications that are      approved by the Court because modifications at the ``read      copy'' stage have addressed the Court's concerns in cases      where final applications are submitted.       The FISC typically operates in an environment where, for      national security reasons and because of statutory      requirements, time is of the essence, and collateral      litigation, including for discovery, would generally be      completely impractical.       At times, the FISA Courts are presented with challenging      issues regarding how existing law applies to novel      technologies. In these instances, the FISA Courts could      benefit from a conveniently available explanation or      evaluation of the technology from an informed non-government      source. Congress could assist in this regard by clarifying      the law to provide mechanisms for this to occur easily (e.g.,      by providing for pre-cleared experts with whom the Court can      share and receive information to the extent it deems      necessary). The ``Panel of Experts'' Approach of H.R. 2048 Could Impede the FISA                               Courts' Work       H.R. 2048 provides for what proponents have referred to as      a ``panel of experts'' and what in the bill is referred to as      a group of at least five individuals who may serve as an      ``amicus curiae'' in a particular matter. However, unlike a      true amicus curiae, the FISA Courts would be required to      appoint such an individual to participate in any case      involving a ``novel or significant interpretation of law''      (emphasis added)--unless the court ``issues a finding'' that      appointment is not appropriate. Once appointed, such amici      are required to present to the court, ``as appropriate,''      legal arguments in favor of privacy, information about      technology, or other ``relevant'' information. Designated      amici are required to have access to ``all relevant'' legal      precedent, as well as certain other materials ``the court      determines are relevant.''       Our assessment is that this ``panel of experts'' approach      could impede the FISA Courts' role in protecting the civil      liberties of Americans. We recognize this may not be the      intent of the drafters, but nonetheless it is our concern. As      we have indicated, the full cooperation of rank- and-file      government personnel in promptly conveying to the FISA Courts      complete and candid factual information is critical. A      perception on their part that the FISA process involves a      ``panel of experts'' officially charged with opposing the      government's efforts could risk deterring the necessary and      critical cooperation and candor. Specifically, our concern is      that imposing the mandatory ``duties''--contained in      subparagraph (i)(4) of proposed section 401 (in combination      with a quasi-mandatory appointment process)--could create      such a perception within the government that a standing body      exists to oppose intelligence activities.       Simply put, delays and difficulties in receiving full and      accurate information from Executive Branch agencies      (including, but not limited to, cases involving non-     compliance) present greater challenges to the FISA Courts'      role in protecting civil liberties than does the lack of a      non-governmental perspective on novel legal issues or      technological developments. To be sure, we would welcome a      means of facilitating the FISA Courts' obtaining assistance      from non-governmental experts in unusual cases, but it is      critically important that the means chosen to achieve that      end do not impair the timely receipt of complete and accurate      information from the government.       It is on this point especially that we believe the ``panel      of experts'' system in H.R. 2048 may prove counterproductive.      The information that the FISA Courts need to examine probable      cause, evaluate minimization and targeting procedures, and      determine and enforce compliance with court authorizations      and orders is exclusively in the hands of the government--     specifically, in the first instance, intelligence agency      personnel. If disclosure of sensitive or adverse information      to the FISA Courts came to be seen as a prelude to disclosure      to a third party whose mission is to oppose or curtail the      agency's work, then the prompt receipt of complete and      accurate information from the government would likely be      impaired--ultimately to the detriment of the national      security interest in expeditious action and the effective      protection of privacy and civil liberties.       In contrast, a ``true'' amicus curiae approach, as adopted,      for example, in the FIA, facilitates appointment of experts      outside the government to serve as amici curiae and render      any form of assistance needed by the court, without any      implication that such experts are expected to oppose the      intelligence activities proposed by the government. For that      reason, we do not believe the FIA approach poses any similar      risk to the courts' obtaining relevant information.   ``Summaries'' of Unreleased FISA Court Opinions Could Mislead the                                  Public       In our May 13, 2014, letter to the Committee on H.R. 3361,      we shared the nature of our concerns regarding the creation      of public ``summaries'' of court opinions that are not      themselves released. The provisions in H.R. 2048 are similar      and so are our concerns. To be clear, the FISA Courts have      never objected to their opinions--whether in full or in      redacted form--being released to the public to the maximum      extent permitted by the Executive's assessment of national      security concerns. Likewise, the FISA Courts have always      facilitated the provision of their full opinions to Congress.      See, e.g., FISC Rule of Procedure 62(c). Thus, we have no      objection to the provisions in H.R. 2048 that call for      maximum public release of court opinions. However, a formal      practice of creating summaries of court opinions without the      underlying opinion being available is unprecedented in      American legal administration. Summaries of court opinions      can be inadvertently incorrect or misleading, and may     omit key considerations that can prove critical for those      seeking to understand the import of the court's full opinion.      This is particularly likely to be a problem in the fact-     focused area of FISA practice, under circumstances where the      government has already decided that it cannot release the      underlying opinion even in redacted form, presumably because      the opinion's legal analysis is inextricably intertwined with      classified facts.               Additional Technical Comments on H.R. 2048       The Judiciary, like the public, did not participate in the      discussions between the Administration and congressional      leaders that led to H.R. 2048 (publicly released on April 28,      2015 and reported by the Judiciary Committee without changes      on April 30). In the few days we have had to review the bill,      we have noted a few technical concerns that we hope can be      addressed prior to finalization of the legislation, should      Congress choose to enact it. These concerns (all in the      amicus curiae subsection) include:       Proposed subparagraph (9) appears inadvertently to omit the      ability of the FISA Courts to train and administer amici      between the time they are designated and the time they are      appointed.       Proposed subparagraph (6) does not make any provision for a      ``true amicus'' appointed under subparagraph (2)(B) to      receive necessary information.       We are concerned that a lack of parallel construction in      proposed clause (6)(A)(i) (apparently differentiating between      access to legal precedent as opposed to access to other      materials) could lead to confusion in its application.       We recommend adding additional language to clarify that the      exercise of the duties under proposed subparagraph (4) would      occur in the context of Court rules (for example, deadlines      and service requirements).       We believe that slightly greater clarity could be provided      regarding the nature of the obligations referred to in      proposed subparagraph (10). These concerns would generally be      avoided or addressed by substituting the FIA approach.      Furthermore, it bears emphasis that, even if H.R. 2048 were      amended to address all of these technical points, our more      fundamental concerns about the ``panel of experts'' approach      would not be fully assuaged. Nonetheless, our staff stands      ready to work with your staff to provide suggested textual      changes to address each of these concerns.       Finally, although we have no particular objection to the      requirement in this legislation of a report by the Director      of the AO, Congress should be aware that the AO's role would      be to receive information from the FISA Courts and then      simply transmit the report as directed by law.       For the sake of brevity, we are not restating here all the      comments in our previous correspondence to Congress on      proposed legislation similar to H.R. 2048. However, the      issues raised in those letters continue to be of importance      to us.       We hope these comments are helpful to the House of      Representatives in its consideration of this legislation. If      we may be of further assistance in this or any other matter,      please contact me or our Office of Legislative Affairs at      202-502-1700.           Sincerely,                                                    James C. Duff,     Director.                          ____________________
