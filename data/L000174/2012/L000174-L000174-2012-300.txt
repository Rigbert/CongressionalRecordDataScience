President, I appreciate the work the leadership has done, and I know Senator Murray has been very involved with that too, and I appreciate her help in getting us to a point where we now have a unanimous consent to get to votes and we can finally pass this bill.  I think sometimes a bill like this is an abstract matter. It is not an abstract matter to the women's organizations that support it. It is not abstract to law enforcement who support it. And if I might speak personally for a moment, it is not an abstract matter to me.  The distinguished Presiding Officer and I come from probably the safest, lowest crime State in the country, but we both know that crimes do happen. We also know that in a rural State, oftentimes domestic violence is not reported. We don't talk about this outside the family. And I know that in some of those instances, when I had the privilege of serving as a prosecutor in Vermont, they didn't talk about it. I first heard about it usually in the morgue or at the great Fletcher Hospital. I learned about it because when the body was picked up, either the undertaker or the police or the ambulance driver realized this was not a natural cause, and then we would sort of roll the clock back. In rolling the clock back, we found that all these warning signals were there. There was nowhere for the victim to go. The things we now have were not there then.  I was able to prosecute a number of these people. In fact, I probably brought some of the first successful domestic violence prosecutions we had. But police and prosecutors will say that those are always after the fact.  So how do we stop this from happening in the first place? That is what the Leahy-Crapo Violence Against Women Reauthorization Act is about. It is there to stop the crime before the crime happens. This bill is based on months of work with survivors, advocates, and law enforcement officers from all across the country, of all political persuasions. I never knew a timewhen somebody would come to a crime scene and say: Is this victim a Democrat or Republican, gay or straight, immigrant or not? We would say: How do we catch the person who did this?  We listened to what the survivors, advocates, and law enforcement officers told us. They told us what worked, what did not work, and what could be improved. Then we carefully drafted the legislation to fit these needs, and that is why our bill is supported by more than 1,000 Federal, State, and local organizations, service providers, law enforcement, religious organizations, and many more.  There is one purpose, and one purpose only, for the bill Senator Crapo and I introduced and others cosponsored: It is to help and protect victims of domestic and sexual violence. Our legislation represents the voice of millions of survivors and advocates across the country. The same cannot be said with the Republican proposal brought forward in the last couple of days. That is why that proposal is opposed by such a wide spectrum of people and organizations.  Domestic and sexual violence knows no race, gender, ethnicity, or religion. Its victims can be your next door neighbor, your colleague, a fellow church member, or your child's teacher at school. The Violence Against Women Reauthorization Act seeks to ensure that services to help victims of domestic violence reach all victims, no matter who they are. That is why civil and human rights organizations like the NAACP, the Leadership Conference on Civil and Human Rights, Human Rights Watch, and End Violence Against Women International have urged Congress to act to reauthorize VAWA. I ask consent that these letters be printed in the Record.  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in the Record, as follows:                                      National Association for the                                Advancement of Colored People,                                   Washington, DC, April 25, 2012.     Re: NAACP Support for S. 1925, the reauthorization of the          Violence Against Women Act (VAWA) and our opposition to          weakening amendments     Members,     U.S. Senate,     Washington, DC.       Dear Senator: On behalf of the NAACP, our nation's oldest,      largest and most widely-recognized grassroots-based civil      rights organization, I strongly urge you to support the      speedy reauthorization of the Violence Against Women Act      (VAWA), S. 1925. As you consider this legislation on the      Senate floor, I further urge you to oppose any weakening      amendments. Since it was first enacted in 1994, this      important legislation has sought to improve community-based      and criminal justice system responses to domestic violence,      dating violence, sexual assault and stalking in the United      States.       The NAACP strongly supported passage of the original VAWA      in 1994, and since that time no other law has done more to      stop domestic and sexual violence in our communities. The      resources and training provided by VAWA have changed      attitudes toward these reprehensible crimes, improved the      response of law enforcement and the justice system, and      provided essential services for victims struggling to rebuild      their lives. It is a law that has saved and improved      countless lives, and should clearly be reauthorized and      strengthened. Within the United States, domestic violence      related homicides have dropped significantly since the      passage of VAWA.       On Wednesday, November 30, 2011 Senators Patrick Leahy (VT)      and Mike Crapo (ID) introduced S. 1925, a bipartisan bill to      reauthorize and improve VAWA. The NAACP has, through its      Washington Bureau and in collaboration with the National Task      Force to End Sexual and Domestic Violence Against Women,      worked closely with these Senators to ensure that under S.      1925 VAWA will continue to fund programs which have proven      themselves to be effective and that key changes will be made      to streamline VAWA and make sure that even more Americans      have access to safety, stability and justice.       In addition to supporting enactment of the VAWA in 1994,      the NAACP has joined bipartisan supporters in reauthorizing      this important legislation in 2000 and 2005. We have seen the      VAWA change the landscape for victims in the United States      who once suffered in silence. Victims of domestic violence,      dating violence, sexual assault and stalking have now been      able to access services, and a new generation of families and      justice system professionals have come to understand that      domestic violence, dating violence, sexual assault and      stalking are crimes that our society will no longer tolerate.       I look forward to working with you to pass a strong      reauthorization of the Violence Against Women Act to honor      the memory of the women that have lost their lives and      endured these atrocities and for the hope that this bill will      continue to protect future generations of women. Thank you in      advance for your attention to the NAACP position. Should you      have any questions or comments, please do not hesitate to      contact me at my office at (202) 463 2940.           Sincerely,     Hilary O. Shelton,       Director, NAACP Washington Bureau & Senior Vice President,      Advocacy and Policy.
