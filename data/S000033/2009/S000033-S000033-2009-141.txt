 President, I am pleased to introduce legislation to establish a Home Energy Retrofit Finance Program. My office has worked closely with a number of stakeholders and experts in developing this Program. It is supported by the Vermont Energy Investment Corporation, the National Trust for Historic Preservation, Green for All, the Apollo Alliance, and the Union of Concerned Scientists, because they know that improving residential sector energy use is a strategy to address global warming, save families on their utility bills, and create jobs.  Households across the Nation will be able to lower their energy bills and generate their own renewable energy through the Program. It would provide initial capital to States, according to the established State energy program formula, to set up state revolving finance funds. These State funds would in turn provide financial support for local government programs, such as clean energy district financing, and energy utility programs, such as on-bill financing.  There are already a number of innovative programs to help finance residential energy efficiency and renewable energy across the country. For example, States such as Vermont, New Mexico, California, Virginia, Texas, and Maryland have authorized local governments to provide financing to homeowners for energy improvements. Homeowners then can pay back the cost of the improvements over time on their property tax bills.  The Home Energy Retrofit Finance Program would give these efforts a boost by supporting local government and utility programs that provide households with cost-effective financing for energy efficiency measures and renewable energy. This Program offers a win-win situation where we can achieve our economic and environmental goals. I ask that my colleagues consider the merits of the Home Energy Retrofit Finance Program as we move forward with comprehensive energy and climate change legislation.  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be printed in the Record.  There being no objection, the text of the bill was ordered to be printed in the Record, as follows:                                S. 1246       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of      the United States of America in Congress assembled,     SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.       This Act may be cited as the ``Home Energy Retrofit Finance      Program Act''.     SEC. 2. FINDINGS.       Congress finds that--       (1) many families lack access to upfront capital to make      cost-effective energy improvements to homes and apartments;       (2) a number of States, local governments, and energy      utilities are considering enacting, or have already enacted,      innovative energy efficiency and renewable energy finance      programs;       (3) home retrofits create and support jobs in the United      States in a number of fields, including jobs for      electricians, heating and air conditioning installers,      carpenters, construction, roofers, industrial truck drivers,      energy auditors and inspectors, construction managers,      insulation workers, renewable energy installers, and others;       (4) cost-effective energy improvements pay for themselves      over time and also save consumers energy, reduce energy      demand and peak electricity demand, move the United States      towards energy independence, reduce greenhouse gas emissions,      and improve the value of residential properties;       (5) modeling has shown that--       (A) energy efficiency and renewable energy upgrades in just      15 percent of residential buildings in the United States      would require $280,000,000,000 in financing; and       (B) the upgrades described in subparagraph (A) could reduce      carbon dioxide emissions by more than a gigaton; and       (6) home retrofits--       (A) are a key strategy to reducing global warming      pollution; and       (B) create and support green jobs.     SEC. 3. DEFINITIONS.
