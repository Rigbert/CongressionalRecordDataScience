  Choosing to serve in the Peace Corps is an admirable decision for anyone to make but, especially for Ms. Yunker, who is making this decision later in life. At a time in her life when most people are beginning to think of retirement and slowing the pace of their lives, Ms. Yunker is instead boldly venturing out on a new journey. She is reaching high for a new goal that will not only make a lasting impact on her own life, but also on the lives of those she leaves the country to help.  Ms. Yunker enters the Peace Corps with the benefit of a lifetime of learning and preparation, making her an ideal candidate for service. She completed the necessary academic requirements by earning a college degree, and further earned a master's degree from the Patterson School of Diplomacy and International Commerce at the University of Kentucky.  The Peace Corps was created in 1961, by President John F. Kennedy, and is an international service organization dedicated to helping developing countries. My wife, Elaine L. Chao, headed the Peace Corps from 1991 to 1992, and it was under her tenure that service programs in the newly independent states of the former Soviet Union, including Ukraine, began. We take great personal pleasure that Ms. Yunker, a fellow Kentuckian, will be working in a service program Elaine helped create. Elaine's leadership of the Peace Corps made us both acutely aware of the kind of committed, hands-on approach to service that participation in the Corps entails. We applaud you, Ms. Yunker, for accepting the challenges the Peace Corps will surely present you over the next two years. The commitment you have made is admirable and your passion to serve others is an example to us all.  Congratulations, Ms. Yunker, on your acceptance into the Peace Corps, and thank you for your enthusiastic willingness to serve. On behalf of myself, my wife, and my colleagues in the United States Senate, I wish you the all the best.  Madam President, I ask that a Louisville Courier-Journal article from January 18, 2000, be printed in the Record.  The article follows:          [From the Louisville Courier-Journal, Jan. 18, 2000]              Woman Rejected in '61 Gets Into Peace Corps                           (By Chris Poynter)       Nicholasville, KY.--Thirty-nine years ago, the Peace Corps      told Wini Yunker no.       She didn't have enough education, the Peace Corps said.       But it has now learned that you don't tell Wini Yunker no.       She graduated from college at age 58. She learned to ski a      year later.       At 60, she earned a master's degree from the Patterson      School of Diplomacy and International Commerce at the      University of Kentucky.       Now, at 65, she's set to leave her home in Nicholasville to      finally join the Peace Corps.       At the end of the month, she'll join 30 other Peace Corps      volunteers who are teaching Ukrainians how to run a business      in a free-market democracy, rather than under communism; the      country was a republic of the former Soviet Union until 1991.       Yunker, born and raised in Nicholasville, just south of      Lexington, said she's joining the Peace Corps because she      wants a challenge, enjoys teaching and will feel good about      helping a country become more democratic.       ``I'm ready for a new phase in my life,'' she said.       The response is typical Yunker, who zigs when others zag.      She's never been one to sit around and wait for life to come      to her.       Some of her relatives think she's insane for leaving the      comfort of her home and family to spend two years in an      emerging democracy, where the winters are brutally cold.       Her brother-in-law tried to discourage her, sending her      this rhyme: ``If you have any sense in your brain, you will      stay away from the Ukraine.''       Yunker is one of a number of senior citizens who are      joining the Peace Corps, which since its inception in 1961      has been populated mainly by freshly minted college      graduates. The volunteers dedicate two years of their lives      to working in developing countries.       When the Peace Corps was created by President John F.      Kennedy, few members were senior citizens. This year, 7      percent--476--of the volunteers are over 50. Brendan Daly, a      spokesman for the agency, said that figure has hovered      between 6 percent and 8 percent in the 1990s, in part because      seniors are more active and more educated than ever and are      looking for something unusual to do.       In some respects, senior volunteers are better prepared      than younger people. They have a wealth of life experiences      to share and are enthusiastic about becoming part of a new      culture, Daly said.       ``They may not be the youngest in years, but they are the      youngest in heart,'' he said.       Yunker definitely fits that description. Three years ago,      she and her only child, 22-year-old Joe, rappelled off the      scenic cliffs of Red River Gorge in Eastern Kentucky.       A colleague at work nicknamed her ``Flash'' because she's      always darting around the factory at Sargent & Greenleaf in      Nicholasville, which makes high-security locks for banks,      vaults and safes.       Yunker will officially retire on Friday, after nearly 17      years with the company. But last Friday, the 160 employees      came together to honor Yunker, a silver-haired woman who      always wears a cheerful smile and is known for her long,      dangling earrings.       Yunker is the administrative assistant to company President      Jerry Morgan. Morgan told the employees Yunker will be      missed. And he noted the she had raised her son in a single-     parent home but still found time to earn two degrees,      volunteer for the United Way and teach in a literacy program,      Operation Read.       He presented her with a gold watch before she took the      microphone. She cried at times as she read from a prepared      speech, and some co-workers dabbed tears from their eyes.       Yunker preached about the importance of education and      encouraged the company's employees to take advantage of its      program that pays for college tuition if they maintain a B      average.       That's how Yunker earned her marketing degree from Spalding      University. Every third weekend for four years, she would      drive about 70 miles to downtown Louisville, where she stayed      in a dormitory and studied as part of Spalding's weekend      program.       The entire Sargent & Greenleaf factory helped her earn her      degree, she said. Workers in the manufacturing, sales and      engineering departments aided her with homework, and Patsy      Gray, the woman who hired her, proofread and edited her term      papers and essays.       While she was a student at Spalding, Yunker remembered that      day in 1961 when she was living in Washington and went to      Peace Corps headquarters to inquire about joining. The Peace      Corps was the idea of President Kennedy who, while      campaigning in October 1960, proposed an international      volunteer organization. Since then, more than 155,000      Americans, including 1,079 Kentuckians, have traveled across      the globe, helping people in villages, towns, and cities with      education, health, transportation, business and other needs.       Yunker remembers being disappointed when she was turned      away in 1961 because she didn't have a college degree. So,      after graduating from Spalding, she called to see if the      Peace Corps still existed. When she learned it did, she began      planning to join in seven years, when she would retire and      her son would be old enough to live alone. A Peace Corps      official suggested she earn a master's degree in the      meantime. She did.       In 1998, she applied to the Peace Corps and had her      employers and others write letters of recommendation. Last      October, she learned that she had been accepted, but with      some conditions.       For health reasons, she had to have three of her teeth,      which had been capped, either replaced or removed. She chose      removal to save money. She also had to have a bunion removed      from one foot.       About the same time, Yunker decided to stop coloring her      gray hair black. ``I just decided I can't continue to be that      vain if I'm going to be in a foreign country,'' she said.       On Jan. 31, she'll fly to Kiev, the capital of Ukraine, and      take a bus to Cherkassy, a city of about 300,000 where she'll      live with a family for four months while studying the      language and culture eight hours a day. Then, she'll go to a      university--she doesn't know which one or where--to teach      business.       Her biggest concern is learning the language. She's not      worried about the teaching. For six years, she had      volunteered for Operation Read, and she recently taught      English to a Korean immigrant who lives in Nicholasville.       ``When we started in June, she couldn't speak English at      all. And of course, I don't speak Korean,'' Yunker said.      ``And now, we can talk about even personal things and have      conversations on the phone.''       Velma J. Miller is among Yunker's co-workers concerned      about her living in Ukraine.       Miller said Yunker, a longtime friend, is the kind of      person who brought fresh flowers, food and cards when Miller      was undergoing chemotherapy for breast cancer in 1998.       When Miller learned that Yunker had to have three teeth      removed, she pulled her aside in the restroom and asked,      ``Wini, do you reckon that God's trying to tell you not to      go?''       Yunker said her only worry is her five siblings, all of      whom are older. She made each promise not to get sick while      she was away.       Likewise, Yunker's son is worried, but also excited for his      mother. Joe Yunker, an emergency medical technician in      Jessamine County, said he knows that being a Peace Corps      volunteer is one of his mother's life dreams. He's heard      about it since he was 11.       ``My mom can do anything,'' he said.                          ____________________
