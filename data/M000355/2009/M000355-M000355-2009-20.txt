 President, I just want to take this opportunity to thank the clerks. I know it has been a challenging experience to have to read for the last 7 or 8 hours, but I just wanted to thank them for their good work and good spirits in the holiday season; and for those who substituted during the process, I hope you will extend to them our thanks as well.
