There will be no Federal funds and not on Federal lands. It is not on Federal property as was just mentioned? I think the point here, and I have, as the gentleman from Oregon knows, some great interest in condemnation proceedings, which I do not approve of, but I do think it is wrong, though, for this body to get involved in a local government and in a State process in a condemnation deciding which side it should be on. It should be left up to the local governments to do this because there are no Federal lands involved and no Federal funds. I think gentleman's presentation is correct. Although, I do not like condemnation proceedings, I do think we have to look at the local government's position as well as the State, and we should butt out, frankly.
