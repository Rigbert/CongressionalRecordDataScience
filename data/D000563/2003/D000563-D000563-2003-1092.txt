Someone said this morning the White House said it is baked and he is not going to change a word of it. I cannot say if they are being called in as a focus group to see if there is anything they find objectionable. I think it is probably more likely that they already know in advance they are going to have a warm reception from the special interest groups for the State of the Union Address.
