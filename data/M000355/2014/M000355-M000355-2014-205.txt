  What we have been talking about is how to create jobs. Unfortunately, the agenda of the Senate Democratic majority does just the opposite. It appears as if we are not likely to be able to get any amendments offered that would actually create jobs and opportunity for our people.  One of the things I have been so disturbed about over the years is the inability of employees to make a voluntary choice about whether they want to belong to a union.  In addition to the energy jobs measures we are discussing here today, I have another related measure I would like to highlight. As I mentioned earlier this morning in my opening remarks, enacting national right-to-work legislation is just plain common sense. My colleague from Kentucky, Senator Paul, has been the leader on this issue.  This is a fundamental issue of worker freedom. This amendment would empower American workers to choosewhether they would like to join a union. It would protect a worker from getting fired if she would rather not pay dues to a union boss who fails to represent her concerns and her priorities. According to one survey, 80 percent of unionized workers agreed that workers should be able to choose whether to join a union.  It is an issue of upward mobility. A worker should be able to be recognized and rewarded for her individual hard work and productivity.  This is paycheck fairness. A worker should no longer be held back by an antiquated system where pay raises are based on seniority rather than on merit.  This is an issue of leveling the playing field. Workers in all States would have a more equal chance of finding work in every State, and they would no longer see their communities failing to secure new investments because their State hasn't passed a right-to-work law.  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that it be in order for me to offer my amendment No. 2910, which I have just described to my colleagues here in the Senate.
