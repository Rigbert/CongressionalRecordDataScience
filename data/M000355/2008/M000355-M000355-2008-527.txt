 Talks are moving forward on an economic growth package between the Secretary of the Treasury, the House Republican leader, and the Speaker, and there is good reason to expect an important national security achievement on FISA at the latest by next week.  I had hoped we would move to FISA first, since nothing could be more urgent than protecting this vital national security tool before its expiration on February 1. Our first duty is to protect Americans from harm, and we know for a fact this law has helped us--helped us--detect and disrupt terrorist plots. It would be grossly irresponsible for Congress to weaken it or to let it lapse. And the notion that some in Congress would even consider filibustering this vital antiterror tool is difficult to comprehend.  Fortunately, common sense seems to have prevailed. I was encouraged to see that my good friend, the majority leader, believes we can pass a FISA bill with sufficient time to get it signed before it expires. I am very pleased to see that the chairman of the Intelligence Committee believes the bipartisan version reported out of his committee last fall will be the one that will ultimately pass, hopefully, by February 1. This is good news not only because the Intelligence Committee's version is the best, but, most importantly, with some modification it is also the only one the President will sign.  We have put this off long enough. Let's work to pass this bill. I know the majority leader believes we should move forward on it as well. I certainly concur in his judgment on that matter.                          ____________________
