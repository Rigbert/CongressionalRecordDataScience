 Let me explain that Senate Democrats allege that Republicans, then in the minority and anticipating a change in power in the 1980 election, stalled the approval of President Carter's judicial nominees. The Majority points to a discussion at an executive business meeting which took place on September 10, 1980, when Ranking Member Thurmond asked Chairman Kennedy to hold over 13 nominees for 1 week because their background investigations were not complete. However, this allegation is not accurate.
