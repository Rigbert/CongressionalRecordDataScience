President, the intention this afternoon, awaiting Senator Levin's return, is we will discuss further the Dorgan amendment on a Truman Commission approach and then a Byrd amendment with respect to a second Deputy Secretary of Defense for Management, I believe, and then Senator Nelson and others in regard to the SPD offset amendment. So we are prepared to return at 2:15 p.m. and continue to work on the bill.
