Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.  Mr. Speaker, I can only echo what has been said about Donny Edwards. He called me Donny Young, he was Donny Edwards. In fact, I had an amendment to the bill. I was going to strike out Edwards and put ``Young'' after ``Don'' in each one of them. I am confident that would kill the bill for sure.  But in reality, I would like to suggest that he was an asset to this House when he served, the time that he served with distinction. I know this area, being from California, and being much wiser in going to Alaska. I recognize the importance of this area.  This is a tribute to Mr. Edwards and his support. Maybe someday after I have left this great House, they will be able to take and name the refuge after me.  Just keep that in mind, my fellow colleagues.  I again want to express my support for this legislation in recognition of a good friend that left here. Although he and I were not many times on the same sides of issues, he was a gentleman and indeed he brought a great deal of respect to this House.  Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.
