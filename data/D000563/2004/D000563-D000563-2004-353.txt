President, the second issue I would like to address is an issue that could not be more timely. The issue is ``March Madness.'' Frankly, everywhere I have gone today--in the airport, while traveling, as I came back to my office--everybody is abuzz about the basketball games over the weekend.  I am happy the University of Illinois is going into Sweet 16. There have been upsets and great victories, and those who love college basketball cannot wait each year for the NCAA tournament. It is college basketball really brought home to America in a way like no other sport. Sixty-five teams start, and in the end one will be champion.  But, frankly, when we take a closer look and understand the reality of who the players are, it calls into question whether or not in many cases this is college basketball.  Let me tell you what I mean.  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to have printed in the Record today's lead editorial in the Chicago Tribune of March 22.  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in the Record, as follows:                       [From the Chicago Tribune]                         The Real March Madness       If you're a basketball fan, you know how many college teams      qualify each year for the NCAA men's tournament: 65. But can      you guess how many schools would be playing if there was a      requirement that they had to graduate at least half of their      athletes?       If you guessed a third, you'd be about right.       Commentary about college sports often focuses on programs      with serious shortcomings. So let it be noted that there are      some universities that have exemplary records combining      athletics and scholarships. Among the schools with teams in      this year's tournament, Kansas graduates 73 percent of its      players within six years of their original enrollment. At      Dayton, 82 percent get a degree, and at Lehigh, the figure is      90 percent. Atop them all is Stanford, with a 100 percent      graduation rate (and a number one seed in the tourney).       Three years ago, the Knight Foundation Commission on      Intercollegiate Athletics proposed that postseason      competition be limited to teams that graduate at least 50      percent of their players. But the NCAA obviously has a long      way to go. Of the 65 teams playing this year, only 21 would      qualify under that rule--down from 22 last year.       For that matter, 10 of the teams fail to graduate even 20      percent of their players. But they're not the worst.      Commission Chairman William C. Friday, president emeritus of      the University of North Carolina, noted that ``four of the      teams in the men's tournament failed to graduate a single      athlete over the period we reviewed.'' He was kind enough not      to identify them.       Basketball fans may be aghast to think what March Madness      would look like if the commission had its way. Only three of      this year's first-round games could be played if its rule      were in effect--Gonzaga v. Valparaiso, North Carolina vs. Air      Force, and Mississippi State vs. Monmouth. A tournament like      that would make for a short, craze-free March.       But if the rule were in effect, you can be sure schools      would be taking the steps needed to strengthen their academic      mission. They'd recruit kids capable of doing college-level      work, and they'd structure their programs to assure that      players devote as much time and energy to their studies as to      their sport. If every school that hoped to play in the      tournament had to graduate 50 percent of its players, just      about every school would graduate 50 percent of its players.       That's as it should be. Most college basketball players      will never play professionally. They need an education that      prepares them for life after sports.       The Knight Foundation Commission goal is hardly outlandish,      as the teams in the women's tournament regularly demonstrate.      Of the 63 women's teams for which the commission had      sufficient data to judge, only 10 failed to graduate half      their players.       And there's no apparent conflict between success in the      classroom and success on the court: At many of the perennial      powers, such as Connecticut, Tennessee, Texas and Duke,      upwards of 67 percent of players get degrees.       On the men's side, though, most schools apparently care      more about winning than anything else. That approach creates      far too many losers.
