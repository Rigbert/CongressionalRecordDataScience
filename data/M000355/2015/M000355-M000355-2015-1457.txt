 President, let me say to my good friend from Vermont, the Finance Committee is scheduled to deal with the trade promotion authority issue this afternoon. There are over 200 amendments. I would say to my friend, all this objection is going to do will be to require us to recess after the votes on trafficking and stay in session because we are going to finish the bill in the Finance Committee today. I appreciate the Senator's opposition, but I want to make clear to him and to our colleagues that it will not prevent the trade promotion authority bill from being dealt with in Finance today. We will simply go into recess after we finish the trafficking bill and stay in recess, and the committee will work until it reports out the bill.  I understand the Senator's vigorous opposition to it. The Senator has made that quite clear. It is certainly understandable. The Senator has a right to do that. I am just making the point that this particular way to oppose it will not be successful today.
