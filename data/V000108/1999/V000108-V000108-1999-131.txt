Speaker, it gives me great pleasure to pay tribute to an outstanding citizen of Indiana's First Congressional District, James W. Holland. On Saturday, January 16, 1999, Mr. Holland, along with his friends and family, will celebrate his retirement and honor his five decades of public service. The celebration will take place at Marquette-on-the-Lagoon in Gary, Indiana.  In 1943, James Holland graduated from Rock Island High School in Illinois. After earning a Bachelor of Science degree in Education from Northwestern University in 1950, he continued his education at Valparaiso University, completing a Master's degree in Liberal Studies. From 1951 through 1968, he taught twelfth grade Government and Economics in Gary. In 1968, Mr. Holland became the executive for the City of Gary Model Cities Program. Subsequently, as Principal Associate of Jacobs Company, he authored administrative manuals that became the national standard for the Model Cities Program. Mr. Holland devised and established basic Model Cities structures for 15 cities, which led to lengthy on-site consultancies in major United States cities. In 1980, he was one of twenty Fellows selected annually from hundreds of nominees to attend the Harvard University Fellow Program for Senior Executives. Additionally, he served as Deputy Mayor of the City of Gary from 1976 through 1988. As Deputy Mayor, he supervised 38 department heads and administered an over $40 million annual budget, as well as over $100 million in federal programs.  Mr. Holland has dedicated a substantial portion of his life to the betterment of Northwest Indiana, especially the transportation systems of Gary, Indiana.  After 10 years of dedicated service, Mr. Holland is retiring as President of Gary Intercity Lines and General Manager of the Gary Public Transportation Corporation. Under his management, Gary Public Transportation Corporation has won numerous safety awards and other awards from the Indiana Transit Association and the American Public Transportation Association. Additionally, Mr. Holland has served on numerous transportation committees. Mr. Holland was Chairman of the Northwest Indiana Regional Planning Commission, as well as a past member of the Executive Board of the Northwest Indiana General Assembly Study Commission on State Transportation.  On this special day, I offer my heartfelt congratulations. Mr. Holland's large circle of family and friends can be proud of the contributions this prominent individual has made. His exceptional work in the transportation sector of Northwest Indiana will be greatly missed. Fortunately, the community as a whole will continue to profit from his unselfish involvement to make Northwest Indiana a better place in which to live and work. I sincerely wish him a long, happy, healthy and productive retirement.                          ____________________
