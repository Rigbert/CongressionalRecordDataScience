 At the beginning of my comments, which started some time ago, I started off by saying that the more things change the more they remain the same. I cited my experience as a county councilman dealing with bus service in our most populous county. Some of my friends said it had to be totally self-sufficient. So the bus service was put in the position of having to cut routes that were not, in fact, profitable. As they cut routes that were not profitable, exponentially ridership dropped off. The more they cut one route, twice as many riders dropped off because fewer options were available because of transit changes.  Once you start down that road, you are headed for the demise of the system. What I am saying to the Senator is that this is only one of the three pieces of effort we have to have underway. I am suggesting that I, personally, and I suspect everyone who supports Amtrak, understands and appreciates that it is in everybody's best interests if eastern Oregon has access, if eastern Oregon has the Pioneer. The more you invest, the more ridership you generate. But I think we put an artificial timeframe on Amtrak and a standard, a bar, so high they cannot possibly meet it.  I see my colleagues are standing on the floor here. Before I yield to the chairman of the subcommittee and the ranking member, I would like to acknowledge, because he asked for a couple of minutes and I will let the ranking member conclude when that should occur, but the man who, in fact, wrote the book about the megalopolis, I mean literally, not figuratively, literally, literally the guy who wrote the book is the senior Senator from Rhode Island. I say to my friend from New Jersey--he asked whether or not at some point, shortly, we would be willing to yield him 2 minutes. But I will yield the floor and let the chairman make the decision.
