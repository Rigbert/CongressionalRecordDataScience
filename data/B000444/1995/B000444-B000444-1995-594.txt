 President, I have a parliamentary inquiry.  I am a supporter of this amendment. I voted for the amendment, and I will vote for it again if it comes up in a similar form that it came up now.  But I have a parliamentary inquiry. When the majority leader changed his vote from ``yes'' to ``no'' and did not make the motion to reconsider, is it within the province of the majority leader at any time at any place as long as the Senate is in session to move without debate to the motion to reconsider?
