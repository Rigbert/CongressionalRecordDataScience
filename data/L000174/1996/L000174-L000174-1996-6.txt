President, I would like to engage the Senator from Iowa, Mr. Harkin, the ranking member of the Senate Appropriations Subcommittee on Agriculture, Rural Development and Related Agencies, Mr. Bumpers, the chairman of the VA-HUD Subcommittee, Mr. Bond, and other Senators in a discussion relating to the Pesticide Data Program.  It is my understanding that the new pesticide legislation requires more complete and thorough pesticide residue data collection. Because of the sequence of passage of the Agriculture Appropriations Act and the Food Quality Protection Act, the Pesticide Data Program, essential to collecting pesticide residue data, had been left without funding. Would the Senator from Iowa agree with this assessment?
