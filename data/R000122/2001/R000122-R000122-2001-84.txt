President, I rise to recognize the outstanding service to our nation of Lieutenant General Daniel William Christman, the 55th Superintendent of the United States Military Academy. On June 30, 2001, General Christman will retire from the United States Army after an outstanding career of more than 36 years of service in peace and in war to the Army and the Nation.  General Christman is a modern model of the soldier-scholar. After graduating first in his class from West Point in 1965, then young second Lieutenant Christman traveled to Fort Benning to undertake the Ranger Course. He then served as a Platoon Leader and later as a Commander in the 2d Infantry Division, Korea. In 1969, he commanded a company in the 101st Airborne Division in Vietnam.  Returning from combat, General Christman went on to distinguish himself in numerous command and staff positions with U.S. Forces, both overseas and in the Continental United States. In Europe, his assignments included serving as the 19th U.S. Representative to the NATO Military Committee in Brussels, Belgium, and Commander of the 54th Engineer Battalion in Wildflecken, Germany.  General Christman's key command positions included service as the Commanding General of the U.S. Army Engineer Center and Commandant of the U.S. Army Engineer School at Fort Leonard Wood, Missouri, and Commander of the Savannah District, U.S. Army Corps of Engineers in Savannah, Georgia.  General Christman occupied senior executive positions in Washington, D.C. which required creative leadership and strategic vision. He served as a Staff Assistant with the National Security Council during the Ford Administration, and as Assistant to the U.S. Attorney General for National Security Affairs in the Reagan Administration. General Christman was the Director of Strategy, Plans and Policy at the Department of Army Headquarters. In this capacity, he supported negotiations relating to the Conventional Forces in Europe arms control talks between NATO and the Warsaw Pact on behalf of the Chief of Staff of the Army and the Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff. He also served as Assistant to General Shalikashvili, Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff advising the Secretary of State on a broad range of military and national security issues such as arms control with the Russian Federation and the Middle East peace negotiations between Israel and Syria.  Over the years, General Christman also found time to continue his own education. He earned a Masters Degree in Civil Engineering and a Masters Degree in Public Administration from Princeton University, and holds a Law Degree from George Washington University.  For his service, General Christman has received, among others, the Defense Distinguished Service Medal, the Army Distinguished Service Medal, the Defense Superior Service Medal, Legion of Merit, Bronze Star Medal, Merit Service Medal and the Air Medal.  General Christman has made many valuable contributions to our nation and the Army, but I believe that he has left his most indelible mark on the United States Military Academy, the institution where he began, and will soon end his Army career. After his graduation, General Christman first returned to his alma mater in 1970 as an Instructor, and later Assistant Professor in the Department of Social Sciences. Then in 1996, General Christman undertook his last assignment as Superintendent. For the past five years, he charted the course for officer education into the new century.  Under his guidance, the Academy crafted a new mission statement, strategic vision, and a new public funding paradigm to enable the institution to compete and excel in an era of transformation. His assessment of current needs and insight of future possibilitieshas resulted in a revised academic curriculum and an increased focus on the profession of officership. From the outset, General Christman sought the insight of Academy graduates and the neighboring community, where appropriate, to give these groups a closer identification with his decisions.  A consummate professional, General Christman's dedication to excellence and his unsurpassed devotion to duty, honor, and country have marked his distinguished service over the last 36 years. His service reflects a deep commitment to West Point, the Army, and our nation. I ask my colleagues to join me in thanking General Christman for his honorable service to the citizens of the United States of America. I wish him, his wife Susan, and their children, continued success and happiness in all their future endeavors.                          ____________________
