Speaker, I would ask, if I might, for the distinguished gentlewoman from California, Nancy Pelosi, to join us, with the gentleman from Maryland, Mr. Cummings. She is a sister of the former mayor of Baltimore, and a distinguished daughter of the city which Mr. Cummings will represent.  There was no objection.
