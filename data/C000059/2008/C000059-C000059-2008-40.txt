Riverside has been fortunate to have dynamic and dedicated community leaders who willingly and unselfishly give their time and talent and make their communities a better place to live and work. John ``Terry'' Mylne is one of these individuals. On December 30, 2007, John's term representing Western Municipal Water District on the Metropolitan Water District board of directors ended. He was recently recognized for his dedicated service and retirement at a December board meeting of the Western Municipal Water District.  A fourth generation Riverside native, Terry Mylne represented the District for 29 years. He served as a Western board member from 1978 to 1995 and was on the Metropolitan board representing Western since 1993.  Prior to and during his tenure with the District, Terry excelled in every endeavor. He obtained his bachelor's degree in engineering and master's degree in business administration from Stanford University, before beginning his career as manager of irrigation science for the Toro Company. He was elected to serve as a Western board member from 1978 to 1995, and served as Western's representative on the board for the Metropolitan Water District of Southern California since 1993.  Terry was appointed to many Metropolitan committees during his years representing Western's interests, including serving as chairman of the finance and insurance committee, engineering and operations committee, land committee, committee on legislation, subcommittee on annexations, the facility naming ad hoc committee, and the electric industry restructuring ad hoc committee.  Terry is an active member of the Association of California Water Agencies; he has also served as director of its municipal water district section, its Joint Powers Insurance Authority board, its executive committee, and as a member of its directors and building committee.  Terry's tireless passion for community service has contributed immensely to the betterment of the community of Riverside, California. I am proud to call John a fellow community member, American and friend. I know that many community members are grateful for his service and salute him as he ends his term.                          ____________________
