Speaker, on January 25, 1995, I joined the chairman of the Helsinki Commission, Chris Smith, in introducing H. Con. Res. 136, legislation which advocates a peaceful end to the conflict between the Government of Turkey and Kurdish militants. I urge my colleagues to join us as cosponsors of this important resolution aimed at ending a vicious cycle of violence and terror which has claimed so many lives over the past decade and has eroded the impressive strides made by a government committed to achieving full-fledged democracy.  Mr. Speaker, for more than a decade Turkey's citizens, especially those residing in the southeast, have suffered the horrors of terrorism and the excesses of a government committed to eradicating terrorism at any cost. More than 20,000 people have died in clashes among security forces, the Kurdistan Workers Party [PKK] and shadowy Muslim fundamentalist groups. Turkish troops in southeast Turkey have forcibly evacuated or destroyed more that 2,650 Kurdish villages, burned crops, killed livestock, and displaced more than three million people. Citizens are detained, tortured, extrajudicially executed or disappear without a trace. The PKK has also killed innocent civilians, mined local roads, and set off bombs in populated areas--contributing to the cycle of violence and the climate of fear that pervades southeast Turkey.  Mr. Speaker, earlier this month, European newspapers printed color pictures of Turkish soldiers posing with the heads of decapitated Kurdish guerrillas. These gruesome and despicable photos all too graphically underline the hatred and brutality fueling this conflict. But even more, the pictures reinforce the urgent need for reconciliation. Violence and terrorism will not resolve this conflict. Only dialog can help overcome bitterness inspired by 12 years of war. House Concurrent Resolution 136 promotes an end to violence and a beginning for efforts promoting reconciliation and understanding.  Mr. Speaker, Chairman Smith and I are sending letters to officials of the Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe [OSCE] urging them to initiate and support steps to resolve the escalating conflict in Turkey. We believe the OSCE should establish a million of long-duration to monitor human rights abuses and help defuse sources of conflict and have asked that the OSCE chairman-in-office send a personal representative to develop recommendations concerning the mandate and scope of future OSCE activities in Turkey. We have also asked the president of the OSCE Parliamentary Assembly to designate a parliamentary delegation to Turkey to assist in this task. The OSCE has played a critical role in conflict prevention, mediation, and human rights monitoring in the former Yugoslavia, the Caucasus, the Baltic States, and elsewhere. An OSCE presence in Turkey would be especially helpful as local non-governmental organizations, international humanitarian groups, including the International Committee of the Red Cross, and even journalists are not allowed by authorities to operate freely in this region.  Mr. Speaker, Turkey and Israel are the only functional democratic states in the Middle East. Turkey is a NATO ally and OSCE member. The government's inability to peacefully and democratically resolve the Kurdish conflict jeopardizes Turkey's democratic foundations, drains a stumbling economy, threatens regional stability, and makes closer relations with Europe and the United States problematic. Our Government has been instrumental in helping resolve conflicts in the Middle East, the Balkans and elsewhere. Mr. Speaker, if we truly value our strategic, economic and political partnership with Turkey, and I believe we do, we must act now to help end this brutal conflict. It is precisely because of that partnership that we seek to assist Turkey in ending this conflict.  Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to review House Concurrent Resolution 136. I believe it represents a balanced and thoughtful first step that our Government can and should take to promote peaceful resolution of a difficult and divisive conflict. I call on all my colleagues who value human rights and our partnership with Turkey to cosponsor this resolution. We must try to help stop the violence.                          ____________________
