Mr. Speaker, the Permanent Council of the OSCE has adopted a statement on Chechnya which emphasizes the seriousness of the violation of human rights and international humanitarian law that has characterized the Russian military action in Chechnya.  Affirming that respect for OSCE commitments is a legitimate concern of all signatory states, the OSCE has called for an immediate ceasefire and the beginning of negotiations for a political settlement, while respecting the territorial integrity of the Russian Federation.  Mr. Speaker, the OSCE had welcomed Russia's stated willingness to cooperate with the OSCE in stabilizing the region and restoring constitutional order and in the early dispatch of an OSCE mission to that country. However, it now appears that the Russians may permit an OSCE peace mission only after the offensive has ceased. That is totally unacceptable.  Mr. Speaker, any delay means more carnage, more dead civilians, more dead soldiers. The OSCE mission must be allowed immediate access to Chechnya, and this must be done with dispatch.  Mr. Speaker, for many days the administration has called this aggression an internal affair. Thankfully there has been a shift in the administration's position.  Next week as chairman of the Helsinki Commission, I plan to hold a hearing on this important matter, and hopefully we will see some progress then and now.                          ____________________
