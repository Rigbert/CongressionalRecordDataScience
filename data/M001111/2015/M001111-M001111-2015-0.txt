 President, today I wish to engage in a colloquy with my colleague from Florida to speak briefly about the Senate's recent passage of S. 142, the Child Nicotine Poisoning Prevention Act of 2015, which was introduced by Senator Nelson and which I cosponsored, along with many of our colleagues on both sides of the aisle.  Liquid nicotine is very dangerous: even a small amount on the skin is enough to make a small child very ill. A 15-milliliter bottle, like those sold in stores and online--often without any verification that the buyer is not a minor--contains enough liquid nicotine to kill four children. This substance is marketed in bright colors and sweet flavors, so it is no surprise that it finds its way into the hands of our children. In 2014 alone, the American Association of Poison Control Centers reported over 1,500 liquid nicotine exposures. These exposures resulted in many serious injuries and at least one tragic death of a child in New York.
