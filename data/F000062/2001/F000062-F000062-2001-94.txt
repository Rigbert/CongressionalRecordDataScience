  Mr. Barreto has been involved with small business concerns from an early age. His father, Hector Barreto, Sr., helped found the U.S. Hispanic Chamber of Commerce. As a young adult, the nominee helped his father manage a family restaurant, an export-import business, and a construction company.  In 1986, Barreto founded a small business of his own: Barreto Insurance and Financial Services.  The entrepreneur designed the firm to address a lack of financial services available to Southern California's rapidly growing Latino population.  Today, the firm generates $3 million in sales a year, and is considered one of the premier insurance and retirement planning firms in Los Angeles.  Barreto also acts as the vice chairman of the board of the Hispanic Chamber of Commerce and until 1997, he was chairman of the board for the Latin Business Association in Los Angeles.  Barreto founded the Latin Business Association Institute, an extension of the Latin Business Association, to provide technical assistance, education, and business development opportunities to Latin Business Association members.  For his dedication and commitment to the Latino Business Community, Barreto was awarded the Gold Medal of honor by the Multicultural Institute of Leadership for his work in promoting diversity and improving race relations.  In addition, he has received special recognition from Congress, the California State Senate and Assembly, the County of Los Angeles, the Mayor's office, the City of Los Angeles, YMCA, and the American Red Cross.  The number of small businesses continues to rise exponentially both in California and across the country. I look forward to working with Mr. Barreto to see that our small businesses flourish. I am pleased to support his nomination.
