                              Exhibit 1               [From the Harford Courant, June 25, 2000]                   Require Certainty Before Executing                           (By Jon O. Newman)       The execution of Gary Graham demonstrates the need to make      one simple change in America's death penalty laws: a      requirement that no death sentence can be imposed unless the      trial judge certifies that the evidence establishes the      defendant's guilt to a certainty.       Under current law, a death sentence requires first a jury's      finding of guilt of a capital crime and then a jury's      selection of the death penalty. In deciding both guilt and      the death penalty, the jury must be persuaded beyond a      reasonable doubt. That is a high standard, but it is not as      high as a requirement that the trial judge certify that guilt      is certain.       Experience has shown that in some cases juries have been      persuaded beyond a reasonable doubt to convict and vote the      death penalty even though the defendant is innocent. The most      common reason is that one or more eyewitnesses said they saw      the defendant commit the crime, but it later turned out that      they were mistaken, as eyewitnesses sometimes are.       But when even one eyewitness testifies that the defendant      did it, that is sufficient evidence for a jury to find guilt      beyond a reasonable doubt, and neither the trial judge nor      the appellate judges can reject the jury's guilty verdict      even though they have some doubt whether the eyewitness is      correct.       Our system uses the standard of proof beyond a reasonable      doubt, rather than certainty, to determine guilt and thereby      accepts the risk that in rare cases a guilty verdict might be      rendered against an innocent person. Procedures are available      for presenting new and sometimes conclusive evidence of      innocence at a later time.       But with the death penalty, such exonerating evidence      sometimes comes too late. Every effort should therefore be      made to assure that the risk of executing an innocent person      is reduced as low as humanly possible.       Requiring the trial judge to certify that guilt has been      proven to a certainty before a death penalty can be imposed      would limit the death penalty to cases where innocence is not      realistically imaginable, leaving life imprisonment for those      whose guilt is beyond a reasonable doubt but not certain.       Certification of certainty might be withheld, for example,      in cases like Gary Graham's, where the eyewitness had only a      fleeting opportunity to see an assailant whom the witness did      not previously know, or in cases where the principal accusing      witness has previously lied or has a powerful incentive to      lie to gain leniency for himself.       On the other hand, certification would be warranted where      untainted DNA, fingerprint or other forensic evidence      indisputably proved guilt or where the suspect was caught in      the commission of the crime.       In state courts (unlike Connecticut's) where judges are      elected and sometimes succumb to public pressure to impose      death sentences, certification of certainty might be      entrusted to a permanent expert panel or might be made a      required part of the commutation decision of a governor or a      pardons board. In federal courts, the task could      appropriately be given to appointed trial judges.       Even certification of certainty of guilt will not eliminate      all risk of executing an innocent person. But as long as the      death penalty is used this is a safeguard that a civilized      society should require. Adding it to the innocence protection      bill now being considered in Congress would help that act      live up to its name.                          ____________________
