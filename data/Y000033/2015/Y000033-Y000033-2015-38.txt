Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.  Mr. Speaker, H.R. 336 would direct the General Services Administration on behalf of the National Archives to convey property in Alaska to the city of Anchorage.  I am pleased to be the sponsor of this legislation, which will bring savings to the taxpayer. The National Archives has determined that it no longer needs the property to be conveyed in the bill and wants to sell it as part of its efforts to shrink its space footprint and reduce costs to the taxpayer.  The bill will require fair market value for the property based on an independent appraisal.  I urge my colleagues to support the passage of this legislation, and I yield back the balance of my time.
