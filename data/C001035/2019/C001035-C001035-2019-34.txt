President, I rise to introduce a bill to ensure that the treatment of the State and Local Property Tax deduction, also known as the ``SALT deduction,'' does not unfairly penalize married taxpayers. The SALT Deduction Fairness Act would eliminate the marriage penalty imposed by the current $10,000 cap on SALT by doubling this amount for married filers.  The SALT deduction has been in the tax code since 1913 when the income tax was first established and is intended to prevent double taxation. The original Senate tax reform bill in 2017 would have eliminated the deduction altogether. During the consideration of the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act, I fought to keep the SALT deduction in the Federal tax code because of the incredible tax burden a complete elimination of this deduction would have imposed on American taxpayers, many of whom pay high taxes on everything from their incomes to their vehicles.  My amendment, which was adopted by the Senate, retained the SALT deduction for up to $10,000 in State and local taxes such as State income taxes, local property taxes, and vehicle excise taxes. This was especially important to families living in high-tax states like Maine, which not only has one of our Nation's highest tax burdens, but also a relatively low per household income--approximately $6,300 below the U.S average. Maintaining the deduction provided important tax relief for those hard-working Mainers who continued to itemize.  But a basic unfairness still exists in the tax code that penalizes married couples. Currently, individual taxpayers can deduct up to $10,000 in State and local taxes. If two people marry, however, the deduction remains at $10,000. As a result, a couple could be financially better off not getting married when it comes to the current SALT deduction.  This legislation very simply would remove the marriage penalty by doubling the SALT deduction from $10,000 to $20,000 for joint filers. This straightforward change would remove a bias against marriage from the tax code. And, most important, it would help make the dream of home ownership a reality for married couples.  The National Association of Realtors recently wrote to me about the importance of eliminating this marriage penalty, stating, ``Homeownership has long been a vital part of the American Dream. Research shows that an overwhelming majority of current renters aspire to own a home, and we know that our Nation's faith in homeownership has persisted through the Great Recession. For well over a century, our tax system has helped American families in reaching this Dream.''  Mr. President, we should not unfairly penalize American taxpayers for being married. This common sense legislation will fix this undue burden who are penalized for their filing status.                                 ______                                       By
