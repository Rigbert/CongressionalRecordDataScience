Speaker, I rise in support of the rule and of the conference report. Our out-of-control legal system is ruining the productivity of American manufacturing. Because the price of all of these crazy lawsuits and big judgments and product liability insurance premiums are all folded into our products that we try to sell, both at home and abroad, we end up being at a significant competitive disadvantage to our foreign competition, and specifically the British and the Germans and the Japanese.  This legislation is a significant step forward to bringing American manufacturing more competitive. When that happens, that is going to mean more jobs for American people. So we are not talking about protecting big business here, we are talking about creating jobs at home, rather than having our legal system destroy jobs at home and create jobs abroad.  Second, the original bill that passed the House contained medical malpractice insurance reform. It is no longer necessary to consider that issue in the context of this legislation, because the House took care of that issue last night when we passed the insurance reform bill with a medical malpractice reform component in it. So splitting off medical malpractice into other legislation has made this legislation easier to pass through reaching an agreement in the conference committee.  I want to commend the gentleman from Illinois [Mr. Hyde], the chairman of the Committee on the Judiciary and chairman of the conference committee, for crafting a very good bill that will be in the public interest. I hope it passes by more than a two-thirds vote today, because that will send the White House a needed message to sign this legislation.
