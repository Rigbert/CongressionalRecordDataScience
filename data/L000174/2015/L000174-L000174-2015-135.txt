President, I would like to pay honor to a Vermont legend who passed away last month. Marselis Parsons, known to friends as ``Div,'' was a deeply respected newsman in my home State. His low, steady voice in anchoring the evening news became a mainstay in living rooms for decades. Div Parsons knew news. He knew the importance of having personal connections, and he built trust based on his integrity and fairness.  Div Parsons rose through the ranks at Vermont's CBS affiliate, WCAX Channel 3, and he never became too important in his own mind that he wouldn't report on a fire or track down a lead. In short, he knew the pulse of the State, and he reported on what he knew. He also shared his years of experience with young reporters, many of whom he hired straight out of college and gave them the break they needed.  When he wasn't working long hours at the station, he was known to take to the waters of the great Lake Champlain, either on his antique power boat or, if the winds held up, under full sail. In retirement, he still relished tracking the latest political news.  I am grateful for our friendship and our many conversations over time, and I am grateful that he was able to cherish the recent birth of his granddaughter, Pippa. Div Parsons' death will leave a void, no doubt, but we'll have many memories to share.  I ask unanimous consent to have printed in the Record a fitting tribute to Div Parsons that ran in the Times Argus newspaper.  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in the Record, as follows:           [From Barre Montpelier Times Argus, June 1, 2015]                             `Div' Departs       This last week saw the departure of Bob Schieffer from the      anchor desk of the CBS show ``Face The Nation,'' and closer      to home, the passing of a Vermont television icon, Marselis      Parsons. While Schieffer occupied a place in the national      consciousness, it is not a mistake to place the two men in      company. They represent the best of an era in television that      is rapidly receding into history.       For Vermont, Parsons was the face that a generation of      Vermonters grew up with, in an era when the habits of the      populace were still to turn on the local news at 6 p.m.,      followed by the national report at 7 p.m. He was both larger      than life, and unassuming in a way that led us to welcome him      into our homes. ``Div,'' as he was nicknamed through obscure      origins, was for many the one and only local news anchor they      knew.       Because of the vagaries of television transmission over the      hills of Vermont, many children in rural homes--and their      parents--had just one or two options on the dial beyond the      local PBS station. Even then, the reception was sometimes      tricky leading to elaborate coat hanger antennas on the TV      and ``snow'' making the picture a bit fuzzy. But the      television was often the window to the wider world--both the      world at large, and because of Parsons and family-owned WCAX,      the world in the next town over, or in the state of Vermont      at large.       He was the guide to the stories that connected Vermont and      gave us a sense of shared identity, whether we turned on the      evening news in Derby Line or in Tinmouth. He reported on the      first Green Up Day, in 1970, on the return of hostages from      Iran in 1980, and was the anchor the day that Dick Snelling      died and Howard Dean was sworn in as governor. Parsons became      synonymous with Channel 3, and both remain Vermont      institutions.       He looked us in the eye and told us the bad news when      tragedy had struck; he also shared the triumphs of the day,      or narrated some kind of community gathering in one of the      tiny towns that Vermont is known for. He often shared a      chuckle with his co-anchors, but never allowed his      personality--of which there was plenty--or his demeanor to      outshine the efforts of the team as a whole.       He could be, as his former colleague Kristin Carlson      recalled, unscripted and direct on live television, meaning      the reporters in the field had better know their story and be      able     to go off the script. Carlson grew up watching Parsons, and      like dozens of television reporters, was mentored by him and      grew to serve the state of Vermont better because of it.       After his start in television in 1967, Parsons worked as a      reporter for years, and only took over the anchor desk in      1984, on the death of his predecessor, Richard Gallagher. By      then much of the most tumultuous period in Vermont's modern      history was over: Act 250 was in place, Vermont had rapidly      transitioned from a conservative, rural state to a      politically diverse, rural state, and the social and      governmental change ushered in by the '60s and '70s was in      full swing. There was much to come, however, and Parsons was      a constant throughout--the rest of the Kunin years, the rise      of Howard Dean, civil unions and the Jim Douglas era.       The days of the network evening news are rapidly passing      on. The news world has further fragmented with the rise of      the Internet. In some ways, the new world is better. We have      many choices now, and our ability to connect to others around      the state and the world has never been greater. Our choices      for information are more diverse.       In other ways we feel the pangs of nostalgia for times gone      by, when there was a constant presence who would share the      news of the day before saying ``Good Night''. The sense of      loss is for one of our familiar community, and of a person      who did not put himself before the news.       There are many examples of the anchor desk lending too much      ego to the occupant. Often today an anchor desk is almost      like a podium or a stage. But Parsons had no need to      exaggerate or embellish who he was. He was a different kind      of anchor. In the current era of flamboyance and      exaggeration, his humility, compassion and honesty stand out.      Parsons was not a ``personality.'' He was not acting or      putting on a show while on air--the man he was was what you      saw. He was steady and sometimes deadpan, and committed      entirely to the Green Mountain State.       While we are grateful to have had him, it is our great loss      that he is gone.                          ____________________
