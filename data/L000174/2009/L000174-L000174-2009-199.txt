President, I see my friend, the distinguished Senator from Alabama, on the floor. We have also discussed this. Senator Sessions and I will open the debate, as the leader has said. I suggest everybody on this side check with the staff to set up a list.  Again, I urge people to come at the time they said. I agree with the leader, if they do not, we go to the next person and finish it up. I hope it will not be the case we will be in long quorum calls and then everybody says let's talk. I think the leaders have set a fair schedule, and we should go forward.
