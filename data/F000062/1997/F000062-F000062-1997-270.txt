 I want to read my amendment's specific language. The language does not talk about any specific capital budget plan. All the language says is ``Nothing in this article shall preclude the authority to enact and implement a separate capital budget for those major capital improvements which require multi-year funding and which would be excluded from the requirements of section 7.'' That is the requirement that outlays and expenditures balance.  I will tell the Senator what I would develop a capital budget. I would set a basic amount of capital. Whether that amount would be anything above $5 million, $10 million, $15 million, or $20 million would be up to the Congress. But you set the basic amount for major capital purchases, for bridges, office buildings, or a battleship, whatever you want that to be. Also, because you float debt to be able to fund these items, you would also set a debt limit. That would most likely be a percentage of our Gross Domestic Product. For example, 2 percent of GDP would provide about $160 billion, 3 percent would be more, and so on.  As I mentioned, we have dramatically dropped our infrastructure spending. It was 6 percent of the budget in the 1960's. It is now down to 3 percent of the budget.
