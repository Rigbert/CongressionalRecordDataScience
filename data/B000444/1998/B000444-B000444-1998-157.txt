 President, last night I was not present to vote on the two motions to table because I was in Wilmington attending the high school graduation ceremony of my godson and nephew, Cuffe Owens.  When I left the Senate yesterday, it was not clear that any votes would take place later in the evening and I did not anticipate that I would miss any votes. Nonetheless, after consultation with my colleagues, I left with the belief that, If these votes were ordered, my absence would not affect the outcome, and it did not. Had I been present, I would have voted to table the Gramm amendment, and against tabling the Daschle amendment.  Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, after consultation with the majority leader and the Democrat leader and the Senator from Massachusetts, it is now our intention to move to an amendment on the Democratic side and lay it down, tomorrow morning debate it, and then move to a Gramm amendment after that.  It is my understanding that it is the intention of the majority leader, and I am sure he will make it clear, to have votes on these some time around 6 o'clock on Monday evening, dispose of those amendments, and it would be our intention to go back to a Democrat amendment.  I yield the floor.  Mr. McCAIN. I suggest the absence of a quorum.  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Bennett). The clerk will call the roll.  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.
