 But I hope they will be paid on what they collect, a percentage of what they collect. In other words, I certainly would not want to pay them a salary. I do not believe they would be as diligent or that they would work as hard. Billions of dollars in America is collected each day, probably based on incentives. Incentives do matter. As with the Department of Education debt collection contracts, the base compensation, I hope, would be calculated as a percentage of account dollars collected, or included in repayment schedules agreed to by the debtors. Also, a competitive environment would be structured so that it would reward productive contractors who comply with the law and who do not generate debtor complaints, do not abuse people and penalize unproductive or compliant ones. That is who we look forward to working with.
