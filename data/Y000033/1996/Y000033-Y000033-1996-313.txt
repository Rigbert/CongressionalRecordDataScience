 Mr. Speaker, sustainable development is a catch phrase that is heard a lot in Washington, DC, these days. This is a resource management concept which recognizes that renewable resources can be harvested without endangering long-term survival of the resource.  While the concept is gaining support in this country and in Congress, there are still those who resist the sustainable harvest of some of our resources.  Another concept discussed a lot in management debates is wise-use. This concept is closely related to the idea of sustainable development. Proponents of the wise-use movement argue that resources of a nation can and should be used for the benefit of the nation and its people.  In order for our renewable natural resources to be managed for long-term sustainability, it is important to have three things: Good data, good science to interpret the data for making sound decisions, and good management and enforcement. Without any of these three, the long-term viability of the resource may be compromised.  The U.S. Congress is currently working to reauthorize the Magnuson Fishery Conservation and Management Act, the law which governs domestic fisheries. It is important, not only for the health of the resource, but also for the health of the commercial fishing industry and coastal fishing communities, to manage the Nation's fishery resources for the long term.  In recent years, the United States has experienced resource depletions in some fisheries, the most recent and most reported on is the situation with New England groundfish stocks. The cause of this resource depletion may be a number of things including loss of habitat, overfishing, increased predation, or changes in temperature and climate.  Fishery resources are vitally important to many regions of the country and the protection oft he stocks is important to keeping many coastal communities alive. The Magnuson Fishery Conservation and Management Act tries to maintain the balance of allowing the sustained harvest of our fishery resources as well as protecting the stocks from overfishing. These concepts are transferrable to other renewable natural resources; however, other domestic resource laws do not always recognize that development and conservation can coexist.  In the United States, bowhead whales are harvested by Alaskan Natives for subsistence purposes at a sustainable level. Care is taken to determine the population of the stocks being harvested, the level of acceptable harvest is carefully determined, and rigorous monitoring and enforcement measures are followed. The villages which participate in the hunt for the bowhead must and do continue to remain concerned about the long-term health of the stocks and treat the resource with the respect it requires.  This combination of good data, careful scientific use of the data, and rigorous monitoring have allowed the sustainable harvest for subsistence purposes for these Alaskan Natives in the same manner that has allowed fishermen to harvest fishery resources in most areas of the country without harming the long-term health of the resource.  The United States is working internationally to ensure the sustained development of marine fishery resources. An International Conference on the Sustainable Contribution of Fisheries to Food Security was held December 4-9, 1995 in Kyoto, Japan. The international delegates of this conference promoted the enhancement of subregional and regional cooperation in establishing conversation and management measures to protect marine fishery resources.  This conference followed up on concerns and ideas discussed at the 27th session of the Food and Agriculture Organization [FAO] held in November 1993 and detailed in the U.N. Agreement on Straddling Fish Stocks and Highly Migratory Fish Stocks in December 1995. The sustainable development of fishery resources will again be discussed this coming November at the world food summit which is being convened by the FAO of the United Nations.  The marine fishery resources of the United States and the world will obtain the protections they need when the United States and the international community work together to develop conservation and management measures that allow marine fishery resources to be harvested at a sustainable levels. Moreover, these sustainable harvest levels will also sustain the livelihoods of those individual dependent on marine fishery resources.                          ____________________
