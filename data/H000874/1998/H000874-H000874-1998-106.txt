Chairman, I move to strike the requisite number of words.  Mr. Chairman, I share the chairman's position on this but not his passion.  A, not only should the President of the United States not be embarrassed, every American ought to thank the President of the United States for standing up to make our streets safer, for taking on some very powerful interest groups to try to save children, save police officers, save our fellow neighbors. That is what the President of the United States is trying to do, and he ought not to be embarrassed, and is not embarrassed for one second, in his efforts to try to do that.  I supported that ban. I supported the assault weapons ban when we passed it in the House and sent it over to the Senate, and I support it today.
