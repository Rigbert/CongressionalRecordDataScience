Chairman, I thank the distinguished member of the Committee on the Judiciary for yielding.  There are not many, there are some but not many, who have stood on this floor and either voted for or advocated for the pay raises not only for Federal employees but for Members of Congress than I.  I, however, in this instance, although understanding the concern that some have with respect to impact on Members' pay, want to strongly join the chairman of the committee in his comments with respect to delinking.  Very frankly, my friends, this has to do with whether or not the Congress of the United States has either the courage or judgment to stand and do what I think the overwhelming majority voted to do back in 1989, and that is take a cost-of-living adjustment, not a pay raise, but a cost-of-living adjustment to keep pay even. That is what a cost-of-living adjustment does. It keeps pay even.  Now, if we think we ought not to do that for ourselves, what the Chairman is saying, we ought not to tie in others to that same position, which in my opinion relates not to the equity of pay but relates all to politics. I understand that. I criticize no one for that. But I was going to support the Chairman's inclusion of the delinking in the bill.  Many on my side have not have done that, Mr. Chairman, as my colleagues know. And, frankly, some of my strongest allies on the other side on the pay issue would not have supported it. But I think it is wrong that we continue to keep the judiciary tied to the political vagaries of what this body is willing to do for itself.
