 President, I rise to speak to the amendment that is before the Senate--the Dorgan-Grassley amendment--on payment limitations; in other words, limiting the amount of money that one farming operation can get from a farm program in a specific year.  The second reason I come to the floor is to address the issue of the President's suggested veto of the farm bill because it contains tax provisions that, presumably, the White House does not like.  I would like to give a justification for the provisions that are in this bill. I think everybody in this body would agree we need to provide an adequate safety net for our family farmers. In recent years, however, assistance to farmers has come under increased scrutiny. The largest corporate farms are reaping the majority of the benefits of the farm payment program. These payments were originally designed to benefit our small- and medium-sized farmers but instead have contributed to the demise of the small- and medium-sized family farmers. I believe we need to correct our course and modify the farm programs before those programs cause further concentration and consolidation in agriculture.  Today, most commodities are valued off demand, and the market dictates profitability. When farmers overproduce by planning for the farm program or expand rapidly because of the security of those programs, then the markets are not functioning. Unlimited farm payments have placed upward pressure on land prices and have contributed to overproduction and lower commodity prices.  I am going to refer to a series of charts that I have. Increased land prices and cash rents are driving family farmers and making it difficult, particularly for young farmers, to get into family farming--something that is probably there because for generations families have been farming sometimes the same land.  For instance, in Iowa, you can see how the value of farmland has very dramatically increased, particularly very recently. Around my hometown of New Hartford, IA, land is selling somewhere between the poor land at $4,000 an acre and the very best land for $6,000 an acre. In my home county of Butler, the value of an acre is up 64 percent since 2000. Across the entire State of Iowa, the average land value per acre rose 72 percent just in the last 6 years.  You will see from the next chart that the average typical cash rent per acre in Iowa rose 25 percent in that same timeframe. So you can legitimately ask, how are family farmers, particularly young farmers who cannot buy land and who have to rent land, going to survive when they have had such a rapid increase in either the price of land, on the one hand, or cash rents on the other hand? How are they even going to be able to get into farming for the very first start?  I have been hearing directly from producers for years what former Secretary Johanns heard in the series of farm meetings. I think either the Secretary, or his staff, had well over 100 hearings on proposed farm legislation prior to--well, during the years 2005 and 2006. So I have heard what Secretary Johanns has heard in his farm bill forums: Young farmers cannot carry on the tradition of farming because they are financially unable to do so because of high land values and cash rents.  What does all this have to do with farm programs? I am going to quote a famous and well-known Midwestern agricultural economist, Dr. Neil Harl, now emeritus. He came out with a report on this subject. He is and was at Iowa State University. The report states:       The evidence is convincing that a significant portion of      the subsidies are being bid into cash rents and capitalized      into land values. If investors were to expect less Federal      funding--or none at all--land values would likely decline,      perhaps by as much as 25 percent.  So here we have an article from last year's Washington Post, when the Post did a series of articles on the disparity that farm program supports are causing. They reported:       The largest farms' share of agricultural production has      climbed from 32 percent to 45 percent, while the number of      small and medium-sized farms has tumbled from 42 percent to      27 percent.  I assume the printing on the chart is so small that you will have to take my word for it that is what it says. The law creates a system that is clearly out of balance.  If we look at the results posted here, we have a system where 10 percent of the biggest farmers get 73 percent of the benefits from the tax-supported farm programs. Worse yet--or more extraordinary, I should say--the top 1 percent get almost 30 percent of all of those payments. I tend to concentrate on the top 10 percent of the biggest farmers getting 73 percent. But I think this other top 1 percent of--how do you say it--the big farmers, the top 1 percent are getting 30 percent of all of the benefits out of the Treasury. So we are back where we were 5 years ago.  This body passed as part of the farm bill, by a vote of 66 to 31, putting limits on farm payments. Well, it didn't survive a House-Senate conference. Senator Dorgan and I were working together then, and here we are back 5 years later. The farm bill is up for reauthorization, and we are filing an amendment that, I believe, will help revitalize the farm economy for young people across this country.  This amendment that Senator Dorgan put before the Senate this morning--actually, Senator Reid did it for Senator Dorgan--will put a hard cap on farm payments at $250,000. No less important, it will close the loophole that has allowed large operations to avoid even the existing $360,000 limit and, as a result, receive benefits far exceeding the limit.  If I could say that another way, we have a situation where we do have caps in place, but there is legal subterfuge to get around those caps. One of them is the three-entity rule--split up your farming operation into three entities, and each one of those could qualify for that $360,000 limit.  The other one is where generic certificates are used. Those are not included in the limit. So that is why you read where some farmers are getting millions of dollars through the farm program.  We use the adjective, hard cap; $250,000 is the absolute limit. We do away with the legal subterfuge of getting around the cap to make it so it works and so it is effective.  I have another article by the Washington Post from last year outlining the ongoing abuse of farm support programs. It is entitled ``Farm Program Pays $1.3 Billion to People who Don't Farm.'' We are paying $1.3 billion to people who are not actively engaged in the business of farming. Senator Dorgan spoke better about this last night and this morning and gave better examples than I can on that point. We have examples of people who live on land collecting direct payments because a commodity was once grown on that land. Any agricultural use, including having a horse on that land, qualifies them for a direct payment, even though they are not even growing a crop.  Our bill addresses these problems by doing away with the loopholes people have abused over the years to continue to get the payments. I have already referred to the three-entity rule. We also put in place a system we call direct attribution. Most importantly, we tighten up what is already in the law but not enforced by the U.S. Department of Agriculture, that you have to be ``actively engaged'' in the business of farming.  I wish to make a very clear distinction. Some Members of the Senate have advocated that the Dorgan-Grassley amendment is not as tough as what is in the Senate Agriculture Committee bill before us. I wish to explain why that is not true.  I have another chart. We have to compare apples to apples. Saying the committee has a hard cap on payments at $200,000 is not accurate. They only have a hard cap on two categories of payments: direct payments and countercyclical payments. The Dorgan-Grassley amendment actually caps those at $100,000.  In addition, my amendment will cap marketing loan gains at $150,000, while the committee bill before us that the Dorgan-Grassley changes leaves the marketing loan unlimited in the amount of money you can get through the marketing loan.  This actually weakens current law, and if you can believe, after all the bad publicity about 10 percent of the biggest farmers getting 72 or 73 percent of the benefits out of the farm program, why, the Agriculture Committee might write a bill that actually weakens current law. But I wish to make clear our bill at $250,000 is a hard cap, and it is more effective in taking care of this issue of the biggest 10 percent getting 73 percent of the benefits.  I anticipate there will be other votes on other types of reforms, including even means testing, also known as the adjusted gross income limit. I wish to make sure my colleagues are awarethat an adjusted gross income cap and a hard cap on payments are two very different things and each should be looked at and considered individually.  Back in 2002--and I referred to this before, that Senator Dorgan and I have been working together--back in 2002, I voted against the farm bill out of conference committee. A lack of payment limits in that bill because it was lost in conference, the Senate position was lost to the House position, was one of my reasons for voting against the bill.  I have been fighting to reduce large-scale subsidies since I was a Member of the House of Representatives in the 1970s. Then we were, believe it or not, arguing over a $50,000 limitation.  Our amendment produces some considerable savings. Senator Dorgan and I have identified very critical and essential programs to help producers and farmers, small business owners, conservationists, and low-income people, including seniors and children. We support beginning farmer and rancher programs and the Rural Microenterprise Program. These programs are crucial to bolstering young farmers and to helping main streets across America.  It will also provide funds for the organic cost-share program and the farmers Market Promotion Program. These growing components of our food supply system will create new opportunities for farmers and increase healthy food options for our consumers.  A large priority of mine has always been seeing justice for Black farmers--discrimination cases brought against the USDA, but not everybody eligible got in on it. This amendment puts some money, double the amount provided by the committee, in for late filers under the Pigford consent decree for farmers who haven't gotten a chance for their claims to be heard. It is time to make it right for these farmers who were discriminated against in their attempts to get help from the Federal Government in farming.  We also support the Grasslands Reserve Program and the Farmland Protection Program with additional dollars. Conserving our natural resources is one of the most important components of agriculture, and this investment will make a substantial difference in the availability of these programs.  Finally, while the Agriculture Committee makes significant contributions to the nutrition and food assistance programs, they were not able to go far enough due to tight budget constraints. So Dorgan-Grassley adds money to this program so it can be adjusted for inflation and other nutrition priorities to assist low-income seniors, as well as children.  I worked with Senator Dorgan on a similar measure, as I have said for the third time, in 2002, and it passed with bipartisan support by a vote of 66 to 31. Unfortunately, it was stripped out of conference. My colleagues might remember the last time we had a vote on payment limits was on the budget resolution. Many of my colleagues said they agreed with what we were trying to do, but they voted against us at that particular time because they said doing it on the budget resolution in the middle of a farm bill authorization of 5 years was not the right time. Everybody said it needed to be done the next time the farm bill came up for debate.  Well, that time is right now, and I ask those who maybe thought it shouldn't be done on the budget resolution a couple years ago to remember what they said. They came up to us individually and said: We agree with what you are trying to do, but it shouldn't be in the middle of the farm bill reauthorization, and it shouldn't be done on the budget resolution. The inference was they will be with us at the right time. The time is right now, or within the next 24 hours, when we vote on this amendment.  I remind this body that in addition to what was said by our colleagues at that particular time, in the last farm bill, we set up, as supposedly a sop for those of us who didn't get what we wanted in payment limitations out of conference 5 years ago, a commission on the application of payment limitations for agriculture.  This commission was set up, and for a couple years they studied this issue. The purpose was to conduct a study on the potential need for further payment limitations on farm programs. The commission met. Farmers, agricultural economists--I can't think of everybody who was on it, but they knew the business of agriculture. This commission recommended the very same loophole-closing measures which we included in this amendment that is now before the Senate. Those people who thought they threw us a sop or some sort of a compromise that we ought to accept a commission instead of the real hard change in law to accomplish what we wanted to accomplish, that we would have people study it and then give some respectability to it, or maybe they thought we would forget about it and go away 5 years later, we haven't forgotten about it; we haven't gone away.  We are taking the recommendations of this commission that was set up to say what we ought to do in the area of payment limitations, and we are doing exactly what they said. We not only have the promise of those people who said it shouldn't be done on the budget resolution, we have the recommendations of all these experts of how it ought to be done, when it ought to be done, and why it ought to be done. It is for all those reasons that we have Dorgan and Grassley back again suggesting what we thought should have been done 5 years ago. If it had been done 5 years ago, we wouldn't have this problem of 10 percent of the biggest farmers getting 73 percent of the benefits out of the farm program.  There are several problems connected with that situation. One, when urban people read about this, they are going to say: Why do you need a farm safety net if all the help is going to biggest farmers? So we lose urban support. We lose support of a farm program in the House of Representatives controlled by urban people, and we don't have a farm safety net, and family farmers don't have the ability to withstand a lot of situations that are beyond their control. We also have a situation where we drive up the price of farmland so the next generation of farmers cannot get started. But also, we depart from the principle of a farm safety net of the last 70 years that was supposed to be directed to medium- and small-sized farmers, the very same people who produce the food we eat in a way so consumers spend less of their income on food than any other society anywhere on this globe, and to keep them strong when they cannot withstand natural disasters or the politics of agriculture or a war or energy problems. They don't have the staying power, but the larger farmers do.  For 70 years, we have directed the benefit of a farm program, until very recently, to small- and medium-sized farmers. How it gets out of whack so we get 10 percent of the biggest farmers getting 73 percent of the benefits of the program is hard to explain. But it has happened, and we are trying to get back to the original purpose of farm programs to help small- and medium-sized farmers over the hurdles they have to cross, through no fault of their own, situations they cannot control, that larger farmers have the ability to have a little more staying power.  So here we are. By voting in favor of the Dorgan-Grassley amendment, we can allow young people to get into farming and lessen dependence on Federal subsidies. This will help restore public respectability for Federal farm assistance by targeting this assistance to those who need it the most.  So let us quit dragging our feet and let us pass real reform with a real payment for real farmers. I call upon my colleagues to support this commonsense legislation that is referred to as Dorgan-Grassley.  I told you, Mr. President, in my opening remarks that I wished to address a second issue as well, directly related to the farm bill, but including some issues that are a little bit broader than the farm bill, and that deals with the tax policy.  Remember, a very significant part of this farm bill is tax policy that we in the Finance Committee--Senator Baucus, me, and the other 19 members of the committee--set up that are directly related to soil conservation and drought relief, and we raise revenue to pay for it. In the process of this broad policy, we have freed up money the Agriculture Committee would otherwise spend on a lot of programs, such as disaster relief and conservation, so the Agriculture Committee would have a little more leeway to do what needs to be done in farm policy, and that is directly related to the fact that under the budget adopted by this Congress,we find the Agriculture Committee $15 billion under benchmark, and that is a big bite to swallow with the needs in American agriculture. So we have come up with, in the Finance Committee, a little bit of help for the Agriculture Committee.  As recently as yesterday, the President, or his people, have suggested because of the tax policy that is in this bill, they might veto the whole farm bill. I want to tell the President why that is a crazy idea--a crazy idea--so I will take the time to comment, then, on the revenue raisers that are in this farm bill.  The revenue raiser is a proposal to clarify a judicial doctrine in the tax law known as the economic substance doctrine. I am here not so much to justify revenue raising through this definition of economic substance, but I am here to say there are four circuit courts of appeal in different parts of the country that have had four different decisions on economic substance and each has said Congress ought to define economic substance. So as far as I am concerned, in putting economic substance in here, it is not just to raise revenue and to have an offset for the programs we have set up, it is for Congress to do the job of making the Tax Code on economic substance clear so the courts are not defining it, and most importantly so that four different courts aren't defining it in four different ways. We need to have some certainty, and this bill brings that certainty to the definition of economic substance.  But before I get into that, I have to be a little more general. For a lot of folks, this proposal may sound like an esoteric tax policy matter, and they might wonder why I am focusing on it today. The reason is the White House has indicated the President will veto the farm bill if this proposal is included in the bill sent to the President's desk.  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to have printed in the Record the Washington Post article reporting on the President's suggested veto of the bill.  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in the Record, as follows:                [From washingtonpost.com, Nov. 6, 2007]                  Bush Vows To Veto Senate's Farm Bill                            (By Dan Morgan)       The Bush administration, setting the stage for another      confrontation with Congress over a major spending measure,      issued a veto threat yesterday against the Senate version of      the $288 billion farm bill.       The announcement came as a disappointment to bipartisan      Senate supporters, who had hoped the farm legislation avoided      some of the pitfalls that prompted a similar veto threat this      summer against a House-passed version.       But in a news briefing held as Senate debate began      yesterday, acting Agriculture Secretary Charles F. Conner      charged that the five-year legislation had been inflated by      $37 billion through the use of ``tax increases and budget      gimmicks.''       ``It will need significant changes. . . . We have a long      way to go,'' he said. Conner said details of the      administration critique will be issued shortly in the hope      that they ``will impel Congress to work with us.''       Despite the enormous congressional popularity of the bill--     which funds farm subsidy programs, food stamps, environmental      programs and biofuels research--the administration believes      it can sustain a veto by rallying Republicans against tax      provisions used to fund some of the new outlays.       Conner charged that the bill's funding depends on $15      billion in new taxes and added that ``we don't believe other      sectors should pay'' so that farm subsidies can go to      ``millionaires living on Park Avenue.''       Most House Republicans voted against that chamber's version      of the bill in July after Democrats offset new spending on      nutrition programs by tightening tax rules on U.S.      subsidiaries of foreign companies. Democrats said they were      merely closing a loophole, but Republicans and the White      House branded it a tax increase.       The Senate version, which includes a new $5.1 billion fund      that farmers could tap when hit by weather losses, would be      financed in part by a different set of measures clamping down      on tax-avoidance techniques used by business.       Conner also said the bill contains too little reform of      subsidies. He said the administration is dissatisfied that      the bill does not place stricter limits on subsidy payments      to rich farmers.
