 President, quickly, before I begin, I also wish to send my very deep condolences to those families who will have lost their loved ones in this very tragic bridge collapse. I heard the mayor on the television this morning, and it brought me back to my days as mayor. I know what thiskind of difficulty--whether it is an earthquake or a bridge collapse--brings for a city.  I wish to extend my thanks to the wonderful efforts made by the emergency forces and the medical team of the city of Minneapolis. I think it was very special. I saw many acts of heroism.  I very much agree with what the majority leader said about our deteriorating infrastructure. My thoughts went to the great Golden Gate Bridge. I think we need to pay more attention to our homefront and to those items. But at this point I send my very deep condolences to those who will have lost family members and loved ones.  Mr. President, if I may, I wish to present a unanimous consent agreement regarding speakers on our side directly following my remarks: Senator Lieberman, for 10 minutes; Senator Obama, for 10 minutes; Senator Feingold, for 10 minutes; Senator Durbin, for 10 minutes; and Senator Reid, for 10 minutes of leader time, I believe.
