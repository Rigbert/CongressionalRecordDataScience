President, there has been discussion of the great honor that the distinguished senior Senator from Hawaii earned. He actually earned it when I was a child. He earned it on the battlefield in Europe, particularly in Italy, my mother country.  I will speak further on this at a more appropriate time. But I have served with Dan Inouye for 25 years, and only because I was managing this bill was I not with him when he received the honor today. I talked to him before. I told him how enormously proud I am of him--all of his colleagues are proud of him--for the 25 years that I have served with him.  While he did not receive the honor at the time it was due--and many know why--his bravery was so well demonstrated at a time in this country when our sense of inclusion of people of all races was not as good as it is today. But I think the feeling of veterans and the feeling of historians have vindicated his achievements throughout all of this time.  I think of one thing. I was overseas for the 50th anniversary of D-Day, and when Dan Inouye walked onto the stage when his name was announced, veterans from all over this country cheered and applauded. He was accompanied by another distinguished Member of this body who was also cheered, from the Presiding Officer's State, Senator Dole. It was an emotional moment for all Senators who were there to see two such loved Members of this body received that way.  Today we open a new chapter in our country--closing not a very good chapter--and we did the right thing telling everybody that Dan Inouye earned the Congressional Medal of Honor.  I yield the floor.                          ____________________
