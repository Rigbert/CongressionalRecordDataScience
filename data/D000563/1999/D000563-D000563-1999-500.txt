President, I rise today to pay tribute to my longtime friend, Douglas R. Aurand of Rockford, IL. Doug has served as Winnebago County Treasurer for 28 years and Rockford Township Trustee for 2 years. He retired earlier this month as treasurer.  Doug has been an Illinois resident his entire life, born in Dixon and raised in Pecatonica. He married the former Julie Moore and they have two children, David and Christine. Retirement will give Doug more time to spend with his grandchildren, Billy and Tommy Schwengels.  After graduating from Pecatonica High School, Doug served in the U.S. Air Force for four years. He was first elected to public office as Winnebago County Treasurer in 1970, at the age of 29. He held his office for six consecutive terms, becoming the longest serving elected official in the same office in northern Illinois.  Doug has worked tirelessly for more than 28 years as a public servant and for the taxpayers of Winnebago County. During this time, he has reduced his staff by 60 percent.  Responsible for funds exceeding $387 million year, he has earned over $44 million in interest for taxpayers in Winnebago County through his wise investments. He is responsible for the administration and collection of 110,000 tax bills which bring in approximately $285 million for the 72 taxing districts in his county.  In short, Doug Aurand has given remarkable service as Winnebago County Treasurer, and I commend him for his achievements. His leadership and fiscal management skills have made a difference in Winnebago County and he will most certainly be missed.  I congratulate Doug Aurand and, once again, commend him for the last impact he will leave on Rockford, Winnebago County, and the State of Illinois. My best wishes to Doug and Julie Aurand as Doug begins his well deserved retirement.                          ____________________
