Speaker, I rise today to honor and pay tribute to an individual whose dedication to the community and to the overall well-being of California's Inland Empire and the nation is unparalleled. The Inland Empire has been fortunate to have dynamic and dedicated business and community leaders who willingly and unselfishly give time and talent to making their communities a better place to live and work. Mr. Bill North is one of these individuals.  On January 27, 2001, Bill North was honored by the Jurupa Valley Chamber of Commerce during his installation dinner, not only for being the singular individual in the Chamber's history to serve three consecutive terms but also for his life-long service to the community and our country. In 1989, Bill and his wife, Debbie, joined the Chamber of Commerce as the owners of Eagle One Security. In those 12 years they have given time and time again, and are still at it.  Bill North's life is a testament to the founding principles of our great nation. One of twelve children born in Cawood, Kentucky, Bill grew up working in tobacco fields and on his family farm. At only seventeen he enlisted in the United States Army, training with the British Commandos to become an Airborne Ranger. As a soldier he fought in more than his share of battles, including: Normandy, the Battle of the Bulge, the Rhineland, Northern Europe and Central Europe Campaigns. His bravery and heroism earned him a Silver Star, five Bronze Stars, a Presidential Citation, two Purple Hearts and many other citations. The war not only introduced him to seemingly impossible challenges--such as when his outfit mistakenly parachuted behind enemy lines and landed in a concentration camp, engaging in heavy combat, and liberating the victims--but also afforded him the opportunity to share a meal with Winston Churchill and having General Patton remark to him, ``You'll Make It Kid,'' while riding on the General's tank.  After the war, Bill's long and prosperous career included a stint in the steel mills of Detroit and government work in California, welding titanium heat shields for the first manned orbital space flight. However, it is his community involvement that has set Bill apart, including: fifty-seven years as a Shriner within the Masonic Order, the Elk & Moose, Junior Mechanics, Odd Fellows, Red Man and numerous others. These groups have allowed him to continue to express his care for humanity by delivering meals to those in need and visiting terminally ill children in the hospital. Bill is also a co-founder of the Concerned Citizens on Patrol and currently volunteers as a Social Investigator with the Riverside County Probation Department's Youth Accountability Board Program.  Bill North's incredible devotion to our nation and his outstanding work to promote the businesses, schools and community organizations of the Jurupa Valley Chamber of Commerce make me proud to call him a community member and fellow American. I know that all of the Inland Empire, including myself, are grateful for his contribution to the betterment of our community and salute Bill as he commences his fourth term (third consecutive term) as President of the Jurupa Valley Chamber of Commerce. I look forward to continuing to work with him for the good of the community well into the future.                          ____________________
