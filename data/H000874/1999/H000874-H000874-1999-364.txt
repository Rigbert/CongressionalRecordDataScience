Speaker, I rise today to honor an extraordinary woman, Mrs. Ruth Ann Hall of Waldorf, MD who passed away on January 18, 1999. Her passing is a tremendous loss for her family and all the people who knew her.  Ruth Ann graduated from Charles County Community College and the University of Maryland and was a teacher for the Charles County Public Schools for more than 20 years. She was voted outstanding teacher of the year in the mid-1980s, was a past president of the Education Association of Charles County and was active in many political associations.  Christa McAuliffe, one of our country's best known teachers, used as her credo: ``I touch the future, I teach.'' Ruth Ann touched, indeed she embraced and shaped, the future. Ruth Ann fought tirelessly for children and for their teachers. She advocated public policies that would benefit our students and recognize the critical importance and inestimable worth ofthose we entrust to expand the minds of our children, our teachers.  Ruth Ann was the embodiment of excellence and enthusiasm. She inspired her students and colleagues. She was what every parent would want for their children--a person with great ability, who loved children and enriched their lives and shaped their future and, in turn, our country's future.  Her love of politics was a joy to behold. She was a leader--by example, by conviction, by courage, and by extraordinary competence.  Ruth Ann Hall was, in sum, one of those very special people who make a difference. She was a good and decent person, whose goals and ideals motivated her actions. I extend my deepest sympathy to Ruth Ann's husband, Bob; her parents George and Anna Collier, her brother George Collier, Jr., her son and daughter-in-law, Bruce and Laura Ann Johnson, and her granddaughters, Kaitlyn and Eryn Johnson. Ruth Ann Hall will be remembered as an outstanding teacher, a loving wife and mother, and a very special friend to all who knew her.                          ____________________
