President.  I thank Senator Schatz for all the work he did to put together this effort tonight.  I simply want to say that when you look at the data from the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration and the National Academy of Sciences, I believe you reach a blunt judgment: Climate change is the scientific equivalent of a speeding Mack truck. So tonight it is appropriate that Senators start getting into these issues with practical approaches. We have done our part in a bipartisan effort to promote hydropower. I am very pleased the President has a new approach in terms of dealing with wildfire, which is also bipartisan, because fires we are seeing are getting bigger and hotter, and there are steps we can take to deal with those urgent problems. This evening is all about sensible action.  I yield the floor.
