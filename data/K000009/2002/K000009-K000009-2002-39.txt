Speaker, I rise this evening to continue what has become my weekly clocking of the continuing Republican raid on our Nation's Social Security trust fund.                              {time}  1715  Four weeks have passed since I first came to this floor, unveiled our debt clock and our debt graphs and started documenting the truth to the American people about the Social Security trust fund.  The truth is that House Republican leaders have turned their back on America's senior citizens and are raiding billions every day from our Social Security trust fund. When President Clinton left office, our Nation had finally moved into an annual balance of accounts, and we were yielding even a small surplus. Though we had a huge accumulated debt that we were beginning to pay off, our Nation's financial house was put in order.  What has happened in just a few years under Republican leadership is that we have begun now to amass huge additional debts nationally, and there is only one place where they are going to get the funds to pay for the war, to pay for the tax breaks that have been given to the wealthiest in this country and the corporate cowboys that we see now being brought before congressional committees, and that is, our Nation's Social Security trust fund.  Do the Republicans have a plan to stop this raid? No, they do not, and in fact, today, the total raid has run now to over $235 billion. That averages out to about $837 for every single American who will qualify for Social Security. When I first came to this floor 4 weeks ago, they dipped into the Social Security trust fund to a raid of $208 billion, and in just 4 weeks, that has gone up an additional $27 billion.  The Republicans in this institution, at least their leadership, are in avoidance, hoping to dodge this issue in the fall's election. They will not even allow a debate on Social Security reform because they know that their risky idea of privatization to try to cover up what is really going on with the accumulated trust funds will be exposed for what it is, and that is, a gamble, not a guarantee.  Just look at what has been happening in the stock market, if my colleagues want to know something about gambles. The American people deserve better. Our working families deserve better and our seniors deserve better.  Working families have earned the right, not the privilege, the right to a secure retirement, and Republican leaders must put Social Security first, not dip further and further into the trust fund, violating the very lock box promise they made seven times not to dip into Social Security reserves in order to pay for other things.  The urgency is real and especially pronounced in the wake of the Enron collapse, WorldCom and other corporate scandals. Thousands have already lost their retirement checks in the private sector across this country, and many have been forced to return to work or to extend their career.  In his own case, President Bush yesterday in a White House press conference commented about confusing accounting procedures that were used to mask nearly three-quarters of a million dollars that he yielded from the early sale of stock in a firm on which he had sat, actually an oil company on which he had sat on the board. When the national press asked him how it was possible that he had sold this stock early and yielded those dollars, he said he still had not figured it out completely. That was reported in three different newspapers today.  Let us reflect on that statement for a moment. President Bush, a former corporate director and member of the auditing committee of that corporation, when pressed about possible corporate bookkeeping practices, replies, I still have not figured it out completely.  Should the American people expect that? We should expect more. We deserve more. America needs tough accounting standards for private sector plans, and it needs tough accounting standards for Social Security because these dollars have to be replaced somehow.  So the time has come for financial and political accountability. Republican leaders should be held responsible and they will be in this coming November's election.                          ____________________
