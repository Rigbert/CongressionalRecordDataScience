 President, this morning the Senate will resume debate on the conference report to accompany H.R. 2673, the Omnibus appropriations bill. Under the order, there will be 4\1/2\ hours for debate prior to a second cloture vote. It is my hope that cloture will be invoked and that the Senate can then conclude action on this vital funding measure. Senators should therefore expect at least one vote--we hope two, beginning at approximately 2 this afternoon. If time is yielded back, that vote may come earlier. As always, we will notify Senators when the vote is expected.  On behalf of the majority leader, I would also announce that if we finish the Omnibus this afternoon, the Senate may begin consideration of the pension rate reform bill. Prior to our adjournment, we reached a unanimous consent agreement for the consideration of that bill. Members who intend to debate and offer amendments to the pension rate bill should remain available following today's Omnibus vote.  I thank all colleagues for their attention and we hope to wrap up the Omnibus this afternoon.  I yield the floor.                          ____________________
