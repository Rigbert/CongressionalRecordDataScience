Speaker, I rise today to pay tribute in advance of this Monday's Memorial Day celebrations to the brave men and women who have sacrificed their lives while serving our country in the armed services. Memorial Day, originally founded as Decoration Day in 1868, is the one day a year that all Americans pay their respects to those killed in war.  The day's rituals are rooted in the tradition established by family members and friends who gathered in cemeteries to adorn the grave sites of loved ones who had died in battle with flowers, ribbon, and memorabilia. Today, we continue that tradition and gather as a country at important places of remembrance, such as Arlington National Cemetery or the World War II Normandy American Cemetery and Memorial in France, to demonstrate our appreciation and acknowledge the sacrifice of those who lost their lives in our perpetual fight to maintain our freedom and sovereignty.  This unique holiday is a time to reflect on what those who have died sacrificed on our behalf and give tribute to their selfless spirit. On November 11th, we laud our veterans for their bravery and dedication to duty. We hail our Independence on the 4th of July. On Thanksgiving Day, we give thanks for all that we have. The last Monday in May, however, is set aside to mourn those who died on the battlefield defending our Constitution, our country and our way of life--although we should certainly not confine our recognition to this one day.  We see this recognition and appreciation carried out in acts around the country, such as that of the 1,200 soldiers of the 3rd U.S. Infantry who place small American flags at each of the more than 260,000 gravestones at Arlington National Cemetery and patrol the Cemetery without cessation throughout the weekend to ensure each flag remains standing; or that of the Boy Scouts and Girl Scouts who place a candle at each of the approximately 15,300 grave sites of soldiers buried at Fredericksburg and Spotsylvania National Military Park on Marye's Heights.  Throughout the country, our landscape is embedded with powerful symbols and monuments that reflect our heritage. These symbols strive to keep us aware of all of those who have come before us. In our busy lives however, we often take our veterans and war heroes for granted. But I believe most Americans would agree that their valiant efforts should always be at the forefront of our collective memory and we should be careful to observe this important day to honor our fallen countrymen.  September 11th emphasized the importance of words like liberty, freedom and justice. We lost a tremendous number of men and women through an act of cowardice that caught us off-guard. And as so many had done before them, our nation's service men and women responded to our nation's call in the wake of that attack with fervor.  In Congress, we are working to support our troops abroad and strengthen America at home. The Department of Defense Authorization bill that recently passed the House of Representatives authorized over $7 billion to combat terrorism and weapons of mass destruction. The bill also included pay raises of 4.1 percent or more for military personnel, over $10 billion for military construction and family housing projects, and extended pay for certain reservists.  It also mends a disparity for military retirees who have not been able to receive their retiree pay as well as their disability pay. This bill will help improve our defensive readiness and improve the quality of life for all our active duty and veteran service men and women.  The fallen heroes who acted selflessly throughout our history in the face of tyranny and oppression fought a foe that we are still fighting to this very day. President John F. Kennedy once said, ``A man does what he must--in spite of personal consequences, in spite of obstacles and dangers--and this is the basis of all human morality.'' All American's can learn from the bravery and courage of our lost soldiers. I urge my Colleagues to take a moment this Memorial Day and appreciate the freedom we have by remembering our fallen heroes.                          ____________________
