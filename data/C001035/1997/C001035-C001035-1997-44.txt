President, I am pleased to join my friend and colleague from Rhode Island, Senator Reed, in offering an amendment to restore $35 million in funding for the State Student Incentive Grant Program.  First, I want to thank and recognize the able leadership of the Senator from Rhode Island in this area. I also want to say I very much appreciate the work of the managers of this bill, Senators Specter and Senator Harkin, in working with Senator Reed and myself to find an offset that will allow us to achieve funding for this very important program.  The SSIG program has successfully leveraged a relatively small Federal contribution and investment in student aid to build a State-Federal partnership supporting grants to the neediest college students. Last year, a Federal appropriation of $63 million resulted in a match of $784 million in State expenditures for need-based scholarship grants. In the State of Maine alone, 12,000 students received assistance under this important program. Nationally, grants averaging $1,200 were awarded to about 700,000 students. The recipients, Mr. President, come from families with average incomes of $12,000 a year. As the Senator from Rhode Island has pointed out, that is below the Federal poverty level for a family of four.  Mr. President, it would be a serious mistake to terminate this program. Every single Federal dollar that it provides goes to students with financial need. The States bear the administrative costs, so every single Federal dollar goes for the grants for these needy students. This program helps to close the widening gap between what students receive in grant assistance and what they are forced to borrow to pay for the ever-increasing costs of a college education.  Because of high tuition costs and increased borrowing, students are graduating from college with higher and higher debt burdens. This Congress has recognized the problem that this mountain of debt poses for new graduates. It has attempted to ease that burden by making the interests on student loans tax deductible, but then if we turn around and eliminate the Federal contribution to the SSIG program we will, in fact, be counteracting part of this benefit to the most deserving students by increasing their loan burden.  Now, Mr. President, opponents to continuing the SSIG program arguethe purpose for the program no longer exists since each of the 50 States have established a grant program. However, this overlooks the importance of SSIG as the Federal-State partnership and the important role this program plays in maintaining the State commitment to these grants. According to the National Association of State Student Grant and Aid Programs, 43 States--43 States--would reduce their need-based grants if the SSIG program were eliminated. Some would clearly terminate their grant programs altogether without the SSIG contribution. Clearly, in spite of the impressive efforts ahead by many States to help their neediest students, this program continues to be a critical catalyst for State action.  As college costs continue to grow faster than income and grant aid, and as the grant-loan imbalance widens for students of modest means, the need for SSIG is more important than ever before. This Congress has just acknowledged the value of grants by voting for a modest increase in the maximum amount of Pell grants. It would be inconsistent and incredibly poor timing if at the time we are recognizing the need for an increase in the grants under the Pell program, we turn around and reduce assistance under the SSIG program.  Mr. President, I recently received a letter from Stephanie D'Amico of Biddeford, ME, who speaks far more eloquently about the importance of this program than I can. I ask unanimous consent her entire letter be printed in the Record.  There being no objection, the letter was ordered to be printed in the Record, as follows:     Hon. Senator Collins,     U.S. Senate,     Washington, DC.       Dear Senator Collins, I am writing to ask for your support      of State Student Incentive Grants (SSIG). College is one of      the best investments we can make in America's future. It is      critical to a strong democracy and a healthy economy. To me      personally, it represents opportunity for the future.       Unfortunately, a college education is becoming harder and      harder to afford. The costs of college are rising, but      financial aid remains inadequate. The average full time      student must devote 24 hours each week to work rather than      studies. And this is just to make ends meet.       SSIG is one of the best federal programs helping to provide      access to education. The federal money put into SSIG is      matched by each state. So for every federal SSIG dollar, two      dollars are spent on students that need it. Seventy percent      of the students who receive SSIG funds come from families      with incomes of less than $20,000. Without this program, it      is likely that 18 states will lose their entire grant      program, putting a college education at risk for many      students.       Students and families need help with the costs of college.      With students now graduating with decades of debt, loans are      not the answer. Studies show that students with grants are      more likely to stay in school. SSIG is a good, working      program that should be fully funded.       Thank you for making education funding a priority. I look      forward to hearing from you. Please let me know what you are      doing to support increased funding for education.           Sincerely,                                                Stephanie D'Amico.
