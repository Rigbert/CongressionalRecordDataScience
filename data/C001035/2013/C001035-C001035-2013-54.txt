President, in one terrifying week this spring, Lewiston, ME, my State's second largest city, was attacked by arsonists who destroyed nine buildings and left hundreds of people homeless. I rise today in tribute to the firefighters of Lewiston who answered those cruel attacks with skill and courage and who saved their city with no loss of life or serious injury.  We have always had a deep respect and admiration for our firefighters andfirst responders. In recent years, however, the American people have been reminded of the vital protections they provide to our communities. From the Twin Towers in 2001 to the Boston Marathon in 2013, we have seen these heroes rush into danger that others flee. We have seen them risk their lives to save the lives of others.  That is precisely what the people of Lewiston have seen since their first fire company was established in 1849. Through the years, fire has claimed textile and lumber mills, stores and schools, homes and even city hall. Yet never has a fire, no matter how fierce, been allowed to spiral out of control into a conflagration. The willingness of the people of Lewiston to always rebuild is testament to the confidence they have that their valiant firefighters will protect their property and their lives.  That protection comes at a high price. The Lewiston Firefighters Memorial bears the names of nine men who made the ultimate sacrifice in the line of duty.  Today, under the leadership of Fire Chief Paul LeClair and International Association of Firefighters Local 785 president Rick Cailler, the Lewiston Fire Department is recognized as one of the best in Maine, known for its professionalism, efficiency, and dedication. In the special language of the firefighter community, the Lewiston firefighters are considered ``the toughest Jakes on the job.''  They are tough yet filled with community spirit and compassion. Through the generosity of its members, the Local 785 Community Fund sponsors youth sports teams, charities, and the arts, and provides children in need with Christmas toys. Their annual ``Fill the Boot'' campaign raises many thousands of dollars for the fight against Muscular Dystrophy.  America's firefighters play a vital role in the security of our Nation and the safety of our people. Whether it is in response to a terrorist attack, a natural disaster, or a fire, Americans rely on our firefighters, and our firefighters always answer the call. The firefighters of Lewiston, ME, are a shining example of that commitment, and I join the people of their city in saluting them.                          ____________________
