 I would like to ask the Senator from Nevada, is it not true we have approved over 100 nominees from the Bush White House, and 100 of those were under Senator Leahy, the Democratic chairman of the Judiciary Committee? And is it not also true that among those nominees were people who were generally conservative in terms of their political beliefs, who have been approved by the Judiciary Committee, and by the Senate, because we understood where they particularly held their beliefs and went forward and gave them approval?
