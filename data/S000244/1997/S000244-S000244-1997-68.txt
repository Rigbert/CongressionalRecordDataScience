Chairman, I yield 2 minutes to the distinguished gentleman from New Jersey [Mr. LoBiondo].  Mr. LoBIONDO. Mr. Chairman, I wish to engage in a colloquy with the chairman.  It is my understanding that because H.R. 1271 would authorize $672 million over the next three fiscal years for the Federal Aviation Administration's research, engineering and development programs, some of the functions of the FAA technical center in Pomona, NJ, are within that authorization.
