 President, I am going to speak for about 5 minutes. Before I begin, I will reference an item that I ask unanimous consent be printed in the Record following my speech.  I rise to share real stories of real hardships from hard-working families in my home State of Iowa. Seven years ago, Americans were promised that the Affordable Care Act would make health insurance cheaper and healthcare more accessible. Well, I will not pretend to break any news here.
