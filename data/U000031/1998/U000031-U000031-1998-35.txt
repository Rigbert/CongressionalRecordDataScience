Speaker, I rise today to recognize the accomplishments of a great community leader and a good friend, Mr. Wes Freeland. This year, after more than thirty years, Wes is stepping down as Kalamazoo County Administrator. Though his career with the county may be drawing to a close, his service to our community will continue as Wes takes a position with the Kalamazoo Foundation.  Under his steady hand and trusted leadership, Wes guided the county's finances through good economic times and bad. He has played a role in guaranteeing our region's growth and helped paved the way for many more years of financial stability.  Wes will continue to play a leading role in helping to shape the region. The Kalamazoo Foundation is dedicated to supporting our community by providing a wide variety of resources to support education, housing, and economic development.  Mr. Speaker, I know that all of my neighbors in Kalamazoo County join me in thanking Wes for his many years of support, dedication and leadership. I urge my colleagues to join me in congratulating Wes for his great work and wishing him all the best in his new position.                          ____________________
