I want to acknowledge that she shares the important position that the Senator from Wisconsin, Senator Kohl, has taken on this legislation.  I have a query of the Senator from California. Many of the critics who come here saying this is unnecessary,it is impractical, are the same people who have lamented, along with all of America, the tragic loss of life involved in children picking up guns. I will offer another amendment later on dealing with what I believe to be the responsibility of gun owners when they have a gun in the presence of a child.  The Senator from California, though, really raises this question about a very important mechanical part of this equation: Shall we put on each handgun in America a device which will protect it so that if the gun owner is not present and a child picks it up, the child can't hurt himself?  I brought with me evidence of that, which I am happy to share with the Senator from California, to show exactly what we are talking about. This is a trigger lock. And this trigger lock, as the Senator from California has noted, is easily disengaged, just with the turn of the key, and opened.  I first saw one of these when I went to Elgin, IL, and the chief of police showed me that every officer going home in the evening takes a trigger lock and puts it on the gun. Of course, the officer may need the gun for self-defense or law enforcement; they don't think a trigger lock is an impediment. With the key not in it, that gun can't be used.  I pose this question to the Senator from California: Is the Senator from California aware that the Federal Bureau of Investigation requires that all of its agents have trigger locks on the guns that they take home in the evening?
