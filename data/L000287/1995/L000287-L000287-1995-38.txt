Mr. Chairman, I thank my friend, the gentleman from Michigan [Mr. Conyers], for yielding me the time.  Mr. Chairman, let me tell this to my colleague from Georgia. I live in my district. I live in the city of Atlanta. I know the people of Atlanta. I have visited and stayed overnight on more than one occasion in the projects. I served on the city council in that city for almost 6 years, served on the public safety committee. I know the police department of that city.  This amendment is about fairness, equality and justice. It is about treating our poor and minorities the same way we treat others in our society.  Chemically, crack and powder cocaine are the same drug. They are the same in every way but one. Poor people use crack. People of color use crack. People who use crack go to jail.  On the other hand, more affluent people use powdered cocaine; and when they are caught and arrested and prosecuted, they often go free or get lighter sentences than those who use crack cocaine. This is not only wrong, it is unjust, and it should not be.  These are the facts. The way the law is designed, it sends poor people to jail. It sends people of color to jail. This is not justice. This law is not right. It is not fair.  My colleagues, cocaine is cocaine. Breaking the law is breaking the law. It is time to stop discriminating against the poor and people of color. It is time to treat poor people the same way we treat the rich. It is time to treat each and every person who uses cocaine the same.  The Conyers amendment will go a long way to restoring fairness to our justice system. It will restore faith and confidence. As recent events have shown, many of our citizens see two different judicial systems. They see different laws for different people. They see statutes that discriminate and a system that does not treat all people equally under the law. That is not the American way. That is wrong. It is dead wrong, and it must be changed. We have an opportunity tonight to change it.  I urge my colleagues to support justice, equality, fairness and integrity. Support the Conyers amendment.                              {time}  1845  Mr. McCOLLUM. Mr. Chairman, I yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from Missouri [Mr. Emerson].  (
