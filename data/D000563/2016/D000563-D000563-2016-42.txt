President, this year marks the 75th anniversary of the establishment of the Illinois Association of Chiefs of Police, and I wish to commend the association for its seven-and-a-half decades of dedicated service to the people of Illinois.  Since its creation in 1941, the association has worked to elevate the training and professional development of law enforcement leadership throughout the State, including working to establish the Police Training Institute at the University of Illinois. The association makes sure that police chiefs have the information and training they need to engage in effective community policing. From its headquarters on Fifth Street in Springfield, the association's influence has spread across the Nation and the world, with seven members of the association having served as the president of the International Association of Chiefs of Police.  Throughout its history, the association has worked to earn and maintain the respect of the people the association's members serve. The association has been guided by its values of compassion, integrity, accountability, fairness, professionalism, innovation, continuous improvement, diversity and inclusion. Not only has the association represented the voices of Illinois' law enforcement leaders as they work to protect the community, but the association also has given back to the community through its longstanding support of the Special Olympics and other charitable causes.  As the association comes together on October 1, 2016, to celebrate its 75th anniversary, I want to recognize and honor the Illinois Association of Chiefs Of Police, its more than 1,200 members from nearly 500 agencies across Illinois, its staff, and its board of officers: President Chief Steven Casstevens of the Buffalo Grove Police Department, First Vice President Chief James Kruger of the Oak Brook Police Department, Second Vice President Chief Brian Fengel of the Bartonville Police Department, Third Vice President Chief Steven Stelter of the Westchester Police Department, Fourth Vice President Chief James Black of the Crystal Lake Police Department, Immediate Past President Chief Frank Kaminski of the Park Ridge Police Department, and Parliamentarian Chief Russell Laine of the Fox Lake Police Department.  Our men and women in law enforcement put their lives on the line every day to help protect and serve our communities. For the past 75 years, the Illinois Association of Chiefs of Police has been there to help support and guide Illinois' police chiefs and their departments every step of the way. I am grateful to the association for its steadfast service to our State, and I commend and honor the association on the occasion of its 75th anniversary.                          ____________________
