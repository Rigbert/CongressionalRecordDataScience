Hoekstra for his excellent idea.  As you will recall on the floor, I indicated we would adopt it immediately on the spot if he would agree to a unanimous consent request to strike the ``promptly'' and insert ``forthwith'' so that we would not, in adopting Mr. Hoekstra's good idea, kill the bill. He rejected that idea, at which point in time I made the representation that we will introduce that bill as a suspension and bring it to the floor next week.  I tell my friend, that is exactly what we have done. Mr. Hoekstra made a determination, very frankly from my perspective, that he was more interested in trying to politically put some people on the hook for a vote on a proposition that he knew and we knew they were for but they did not want to kill the Intelligence bill in the process.  Now people will say it doesn't kill the bill, that is accurate, but it clearly delays the bill. There was no reason to delay the bill because had Mr. Hoekstra agreed, contrary to the advice he was receiving, to yes, I will strike ``promptly,'' insert ``forthwith'' so that my proposition can be adopted immediately, which would have been the case.                              {time}  1930  So I think any criticism of sinking to a new low, very frankly, if politics had not been played with this proposition, it would be on the authorization bill to the Senate as we speak. This proposition, which Mr. Hoekstra came up with, as you recall I said on the floor, we think this is a good idea. Proving that we thought it was a good idea, we have brought it to the floor today for passage.  Mr. Hoekstra, who I now see is on the floor, made a determination he did not want to adopt, in the way that we suggested, his proposition last week. So we are going to adopt it this week.  I would hope that all of us would vote for it, because, as I told Mr. Hoekstra then and believe now, Mr. Hoekstra's idea was a good idea. It is a good idea. We are going to pass it, hopefully, tomorrow morning by an overwhelming majority vote.  I thank the gentleman for yielding.
