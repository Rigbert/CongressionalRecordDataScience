Speaker, on November 3, 2011, I was absent from the House and missed rollcall vote 825.  Had I been present for rollcall 825, on passage of H.R. 2930, a measure to amend the securities laws to provide for registration exemptions for certain crowdfunded securities, and for other purposes, I would have voted ``no.''                          ____________________
