I thank the gentleman for yielding. I rise to express my concerns about our strategic ports. First, I want to thank the chairman and the ranking member, Mr. Smith, and members of the Armed Services Committee for supporting an amendment that I offered with Ms. Bordallo that would direct specific study and analysis of critical infrastructure needs at our Nation's DOD-designated strategic seaports. I think the chairman would agree that understanding and addressing vital infrastructure needs at our strategic seaports is of major importance.  Mr. McKEON. Will the gentleman yield?
