 President, the issue of constitutional amendment for a balanced budget that has been before us for a week and probably will be before this body for several more days before we make a final decision has had the debate on that issue intertwined pretty much with the present budget situation and even lately with the budget that the President has presented to this specific Congress.  The President's budget of yesterday reflects an abdication of leadership. It fails not only to put the budget on a glidepath toward balance, it also fails to seek even the President's own goal and promise to the American people. That promise, if you remember, Mr. President, was as stated in the 1992 campaign that the deficit would be cut in half by the 1996 election. That will not be the case under the budget that the President has presented to Congress.  So I am overcome by the farcical vision of how this budget must have been sent up here to Capitol Hill. Members of the President's team lined up on Pennsylvania Avenue and punted. They punted copies of that budget up here one by one.  On January 24, after the President's State of the Union Address, I had occasion to remark when I was asked about his address that it seemed that the President was very willing to accept the leadership of Congress and to follow our agenda because he recognized the outcome of the election. That election gave Republicans the responsibility to lead. Today, through his actions, the President confirmed my suspicion and submitted a budget that says, ``Let Congress make the tough choices. Let Congress lead.''  According to reports, several of the President's high-level advisers counseled that, since the administration has failed to get credit from previous deficit reductions, there is little wisdom in trying to cut more. I hope that this is not the case. For, if it were true, there would be no clearer signal of the absence of leadership from this administration.  Just last month administration officials were boasting about their achievements on the deficit front. They were bemoaning the fact that the message of what they supposedly have cut and accomplished on the deficit scene was not getting out.  So why are they now abandoning what they consider a virtuous policy instead of working to get that message out, if they want to be viewed with any sort of credibility? Because in my estimation, in abandoning their goal of more deficits, the administration has also abandoned its promise to the American people and, as a consequence, the President has lost all moral authority to lead.  Clearly, this President has chosen to play defense; that is, after the punting of the budget to us, they are now saying ``You''--meaning Republicans--``call the plays, now. It is your turn with the ball and let us see if you can do any better.'' We have heard that for a long period of time and just this morning on the floor of this body.  I believe that Congress can do better. For the sake of our children and grandchildren, we can and must do better. The President has followed the lead of the American people who spoke in November. Thus he has passed the mantle of leadership on to us.  With that leadership, the Republican Congress has already delivered on making Congress more accountable to the public and State governments, and now we will work toward making Congress more accountable to our children and grandchildren.                          ____________________
