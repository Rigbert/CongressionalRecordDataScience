President, I will have two resolutions that we will be voting on at the appropriate time. One is expressing the sense of the Senate that the violent crime reduction trust fund not be cut. Notwithstanding the tremendous violence we have seen in New York, Oklahoma, and elsewhere, the House of Representatives voted on April 5 to cut $5 billion from the violent crime reduction trust fund and to give it for a tax cut.  They congratulated themselves on this, but have not explained to the American people that they are cutting out money in a trust fund set aside to fight violent crime.  Frankly, I think that is more important than to give a tax break to the wealthiest. We will be voting on that.  Earlier this year, on April 7, 1995, the Senate passed a resolution reaffirming our support for State and local law enforcement when their integrity was challenged.  When we passed Senate Joint Resolution 32 we were responding to remarks, by a well-known attorney in connection with a high-profile criminal case, that unfairly and inaccurately maligned the integrity of the Nation's law enforcement officers.  On April 19, 1995, a bomb exploded outside a Federal building in Oklahoma City killing scores of Americans, including a number of Federal law enforcement employees. There is reason to believe the bomb was directed at the Federal Government and its law enforcement officers.  This bombing has served to focus our attention on the real threats of violent extremism here at home and foreign terrorism. We will soon have an opportunity to consider legislative efforts to provide additional resources and better coordination of Federal, State, and local law enforcement efforts to deal with these threats.  Today, my purpose is a related one: I ask my colleagues to join with me to pass this resolution reaffirming our commitment and appreciation for Federal, State, and local law enforcement and the outstanding job that they do under the most difficult and dangerous circumstances and to reject House attempts drastically to cut our financial support for their efforts.  Since the bombing there has been a lot of public debate and comment about the activities of law enforcement and the rhetoric that has been used over the past few years to disparage and malign these dedicated public servants and the law enforcement agencies in which they serve.  I submit that law enforcement deserves better. We owe these men and women our respect, appreciation, and public, moral, and financial support.  Even had we not recently noted the increasing threats against the safety and lives of law enforcement officers, the Oklahoma bombing and the reports of attacks against park rangers, Forest Service employees, Treasury employees, and others all make the gruesome point too well.  Moreover, there has been a lot of recent discussion about the way responsible citizens converse about law enforcement and other public officials. I certainly understand President Bush's reaction when those with whom he served and who have made the ultimate sacrifice in the service of public safety are being criticized unfairly.  I commend our colleagues, from both sides of the aisle, who have tried to tone down the rhetoric and to turn the focus of debate to responsible efforts to assist law enforcement to do its job.  Likewise, I appreciate the apology recently issued by the National Rifle Association of the intemperate tone of certain remarks.  I have spoken about my revulsion with celebrities talking about how to shoot Federal agents and their using representations of our President for target practice. This is vile and reprehensible.  If we are to preserve freedom of speech in this increasingly violent and confrontational society, we need to use our freedoms to reject violent extremism and hatemongering. We need to remind ourselves that we live in the freest nation on Earth because the rule of law is respected, as are people's rights to speak, associate and petition the government.  We need to speak out ourselves against those who would portray the President, the Congress, the Government or law enforcement as conspirators intent on taking away people's rights. To the contrary, the dedicated men and women in Federal, State, and local government and law enforcement work long hours for limited financial reward in order to serve the public, protect us, and preserve our freedom. [[Page S7318]]   It is in this context that I was concerned when the House of Representatives voted on April 5 to offset certain tax reduction proposals by cutting $5 billion from the violent crime reduction trust fund.  As it congratulated itself on its first 100 days and adjourned for its April recess, the House majority did not explain to the American people that it was invading the violent crime reduction trust fund and making it impossible to pay for the law enforcement and crime prevention programs of the Violent Crime Control Act of 1994, which the President signed into law only last summer.  Although this major crime bill was 6 years in the making, the House is apparently prepared to gut it. I hope and trust that our Senate colleagues will reject this $5 billion cut in funding to Federal law enforcement and Federal assistance to State and local efforts.  When we passed the crime bill last year we paid for its program. A trust fund was established from the saving of the downsizing of the Federal Government by some 250,000 jobs. The violent crime reduction trust fund contains funds dedicated to law enforcement and crime prevention programs, and is intended in large part to provide Federal financial assistance to critical Federal, State, and local needs.  On April 5, the House invaded that trust fund without debate and slashed our anticrime funding by $5 billion to help offset the budget deficit the House tax bill would create. This is wrong.  Since passage of the Violent Crime Control Act, the U.S. Department of Justice has been doing a tremendous job getting these resources to the field. I commend the Associate Attorney General John Schmidt and Chief Joe Brann, who directs the community policing programs for their quick work.  I know that funding to assist local law enforcement hire additional officers went out almost immediately based on simple, one-page applications. Vermont received commitments of over $2 million toward 35 new officers in 34 jurisdictions, for example. The House action would cost Vermont, for example, the equivalent of 50 State and local law enforcement officers over the next 5 years.  The House would have us turn our backs on law enforcement and prevention programs and the commitments we made in the Violent Crime Control Act. Law enforcement and community-based programs cannot be kept on a string like a yo-yo if they are to plan and implement crime control and prevention programs.  What we need to do is to follow through on our commitments, not to breach them and violate our pledge to law enforcement, State, and local government, and the American people. Invading trust funds dedicated to crime control purposes is simply no way to justify the elimination of the corporate alternative minimum tax or capital gains taxes.  From our Attorney General to the Fraternal Order of Police, International Brotherhood of Police Officers, National Association of Police Organizations, National Sheriffs Association, and the Police Foundation, dedicated law enforcement officers are justifiably outraged by this arbitrary action.  Funding for important programs implementing the Violence Against Women Act and our rural crime initiatives should not have been cut by one-sixth or at all, let alone without debate and justification.  I will work with the Attorney General and my Senate colleagues to reject the ill-advised House action and preserve the violent crime reduction trust fund so that we can fulfill the promise of the Violent Crime Control Act and our commitment to all that we can to reduce violent crime in our local communities.  I have noted that this is not the time to undercut our support for Federal law enforcement or the assistance provided State and local law enforcement. After the tragedy in Oklahoma City, I was certain that the House would abandon this ill-conceived plan.  Yet, in spite of all that has happened, the House chose to reaffirm its intention to proceed with this $5 billion cut in law enforcement funding, which it included in the House-passed budget resolution last week.  Accordingly, I offer this amendment as an embodiment of the Senate's resolve against the House-passed cuts to the violent crime reduction trust fund and reductions in funding of Federal, State, and local law enforcement.  Now is not the time to cut law enforcement funding and this is not the way to show our support for those whom we ask to protect public safety and preserve our precious freedoms.                 Protecting Federal Nutrition Programs  My other resolution is very simple. It says that the infant formula that is purchased by the WIC Program be done under competitive bidding.  The House of Representatives gave in to some very powerful lobbyists and very powerful drug companies, and removed the amendment which requires competitive bidding for WIC. That meant the taxpayers will give a $1 billion windfall to four drug companies, and they will take 1.5 million pregnant women and newborn infants off the WIC Program.  This sense of the Senate says we ought to take care of the women and the infants before we do the drug companies, especially at taxpayers' expense.  It also says we ought to have real nutritional standards in school lunch. Not what the fast food industry would like, but perhaps what mothers, fathers, and children should like and should have.  Mr. President, this amendment is very simple.  It says that it is the sense of the Senate that infant formula be purchased by the WIC Program under competitive bidding. It says that school lunches should meet minimal nutrition requirements and that the content of WIC food packages be based on scientific evidence.  That has been the case for years and should continue. I am offering this amendment because the House-passed welfare reform bill does not follow that longstanding approach to child nutrition programs.  I am very pleased that the Senate Budget Committee majority report does not assume that the Senate wants to eliminate those protections for children.  The Contract With America, as passed by the House, would allow States to serve junk foods with lunch. The Senate should stand up to that challenge and say ``no.''  It would allow States to waste Federal taxpayer dollars on needlessly expensive foods for the WIC Program.  I have spent 8 years protecting the WIC Program from drug companies. Now the House Contract With America changes that. A few years ago, I called on the Federal Trade Commission to investigate price-fixing and bid-rigging regarding infant formula companies and the WIC Program.  I introduced bills, which all my Senate colleagues supported, to require that WIC buy infant formula under competitive bidding rules similar to rules used by the Federal Government, and most State governments, to purchase goods.  These WIC procedures save $1 billion a year. That money keeps 1.6 million pregnant women, infants, and children on WIC at no additional cost to taxpayers.  The House bill does not require competitive bidding. Instead it includes paltry cost containment requirements that are a sham.  It is hard to imagine a provision that better symbolizes what is wrong with the Contract With America.  The contract could give up to $1 billion to four corporate giants and take 1.6 million low-income women, infants, and children off the WIC Program.  For 8 years as chair of the Agriculture Committee, I tried to make our work on nutrition programs bipartisan. And I am pleased that the Senate Budget Committee report is supportive of the WIC Program.  Last year both the Senate and the House passed the child nutrition reauthorization by unanimous agreement.  That reauthorization act maintained the principle that school lunches provide one-third of the nutritional requirements for each day. It maintained strong competitive bidding procedures for the WIC Program.  And it ensured that foods of minimum nutritional value may not be sold with school lunches. It passed the Senate without objection last year.  The House bill eliminates minimum nutritional requirements for school lunches. I fought Coca-Cola and the [[Page S7319]] fast food companies last year to make school lunches healthier.  Congress reduced the saturated fat content of school meals, and clarified that schools have the right to say ``no'' to Coca-Cola and Pepsi-Cola.  Under the House Contract With America, soft drinks can be sold to school children during lunch instead of milk. Candy companies, fast food giants, and junk food purveyors are the big winners. Children and dairy farmers are the big losers.  The House-passed Contract With America could hurt child nutrition programs by eliminating what we put into law last year.  I hope the Senate tells the lobbyists for the soft drink bottlers that Coke or Pepsi should not be part of a school lunch or breakfast.  I hope the Senate tells the lobbyists for drug companies that make infant formula that the Senate wants to continue to save taxpayers $1 billion a year in the WIC Program by mandating strong competitive bidding procedures.  Remember, before the Congress required competitive bidding, many States did not use those procedures that now put 1.6 million more pregnant women, infants, and children on the WIC Program at no additional cost to taxpayers.  I hope the Senate rejects the House approach that repeals scientific standards for the WIC food package. These standards make WIC a success.  I want to make one additional point not directly related to the amendment I am offering. I believe it is a mistake to block grant food stamps.  On December 2, 1969, President Nixon said in a speech that relying on local governments meant that ``our Nation's food programs have been shot through with inequities.''  Chairman Goodling put it another way when he opposed block grants a few years ago--he said that a ``child's basic nutrition needs do not vary from State to State.''  I joined with Senator Dole in opposing block granting some years ago. He said, and I agreed with him, that the ``Federal Government should retain primary responsibility for nutrition programs in order to guarantee some standardization of benefits.''  We have to recognize that food stamps are America's best and largest child nutrition program.  Over 80 percent of food stamp benefits go to families with children; and over 90 percent of food stamp benefits go to families with children, or the elderly or disabled.  I am pleased to report that as the economy has grown over the last year, participation in food stamps has dropped by 1 million persons.  It is crucial to me that food stamps not be block-granted--I agree with the House of Representatives and Chairman Roberts, Chairman Emerson and Chairman Gunderson on this issue.  Their view is that food stamps is the final safety net and that it should neither be block-granted nor cashed out. In rejecting block grants, the House used some of the same points made years ago by President Nixon.  In closing, I urge my colleagues to support my amendment.  Mr. President, I thank the managers for their courtesy.                   Privatizing PMA's is Backdoor Tax
