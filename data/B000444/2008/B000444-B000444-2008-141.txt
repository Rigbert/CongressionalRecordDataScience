 President, I rise today with my colleagues Senator Hatch and Senator Specter to introduce the Child Protection Improvements Act of 2008. This bill will expand and make permanent the national child safety pilot program that we passed as part of the PROTECT Act back in 2003. This bill is, in my view, an absolutely essential step towards developing a comprehensive approach to protect our Nation's children.  Human service organizations rely on volunteers and employees to provide services and care to children. These individuals coach soccer games, mentor young people, run youth camps, and much more. Approximately 61 million adults currently volunteer--with 27 percent dedicating their volunteer service to education and youth programs. By volunteering, they necessarily gain very close, often unsupervised access to our children. Of course, the vast majority of these people have the best interest of our children at heart--and we need as many volunteers as we can get. But, at the same time, we have to understand that bad people will take any step they can to gain access to children and many attempt to do this by volunteering.  Congress has previously attempted to ensure that States make FBI criminal history record checks available to organizations seeking to screen employees and volunteers who work with children, through the National Child Protection Act of 1993 and the Volunteers for Children Act. However, according to a report from the Attorney General, these laws ``did not have the intended impact of broadening the availability of checks.'' A 2007 survey conducted by MENTOR/National Mentoring Partnership found that only 18 States allowed youth mentoring organizations to access nationwide Federal Bureau of Investigation background searches. And, even when states do provide access to background checks, it can be expensive and time consuming.  With the PROTECT Act pilot we decided to give some groups a direct line towards obtaining a national background check from the FBI and obtaining a fitness determination by the National Center for Missing and Exploited Children to see whether the applicant could present a potential threat to children. Thanks to the hard work and commitment of NCMEC, the FBI, MENTOR/National Mentoring Partnership, and others this pilot program has proven incredibly effective. During the course of the pilot, we conducted roughly 37,000 background checks. Of these checks, 6.1 percent of prospective volunteers were found to have a criminal record of concern--including very serious offenses like sexual abuse of minors, assaults, murder, and serious drug offenses. In all, this represents over 2,200 dangerous people we prevented from working as volunteers with children. In addition, over 40 percent of the individuals with criminal records had committed an offense in a state other than where they were applying to volunteer, meaning that a state-only search would not have found relevant criminal records. In my view, this speaks to the urgent need of expanding this pilot to more groups and towards making the program permanent.  Despite these successes, the pilot was limited in several respects. The pilot was limited in scope with only a few youth-serving entities able to participate, and irregularities with respect to the annual appropriations process made it extremely difficult to operate the program to its fullest extent. With the legislation, we are introducing today, we build upon the lessons learned by taking the following steps: make the program permanent, which will help ensure that long-term investments are made to make the program effective and inexpensive; establish an Applicant Processing Center, APC, to assist youth serving organizations with the administrative tasks related to accessing the system, such as obtaining a fingerprint and handling billing with the FBI; and permanently establish and upgrade the fitness determination process at the National Center for Missing and Exploited Children.  In addition, we authorize the collection of a small surcharge to pay the FBI fee and offset the expenses incurred by National Center for Missing and Exploited Children and the Applicant Processing Center. With literally millions of volunteers working with our Nation's youth every year, it is imperative to provide a mechanism to allow more youth-serving organizations access and ensure a steady stream of resources to allow the program to grow toward the goal of protecting more children. This bill will do that.  Before closing, I want to touch on fee for service component which is added to this bill. Of course, the goal has always been that the checks have to be fast, inexpensive, and accurate for these checks to be suitable for non-profit organizations. By adding a small surcharge to the fee the FBI charges, we maintain that goal while expanding access. The bottom line is this--youth-serving organizations have told us that the ability to consistently obtain background checks and fitness determinations is critical and they will pay a little more to have access. Because Federal resources are simply not sufficient to provide wide access, and because the ebb and flow of the appropriations process creates instability with respect to how many checks can be completed, we felt that a small surcharge was the right approach.  Even with the surcharge, we still keep the cost very low. The bill calls for a fee no greater than $25 or the actual costs of preparing the application, running the background check by the FBI, and making the fitness determination by NCMEC for nonprofits. The applicant processing center created in this bill will collect this fee and make sure that all the costs are offset. And the goal is that this fee will offset all of the costs so that we can grow a system that is available to a wide range of entities that work with children. As of today, the American Camp Association, the Afterschool Alliance, the America's Promise Alliance, Big Brothers Big Sisters of America, Boys and Girls Clubs of America, Communities In Schools, Inc., First Focus, MENTOR/National Mentoring Partnership, and YMCA of the USA all agree with this approach.  In addition, the bill authorizes $5 million in 2009 for startup costs and to develop new processes and technologies to automate and streamline the functions to keep costs down. And, while it's not a part of this legislation, I hope that we can get some of our great technology companies to help us with this effort by possibly donating some of their time, expertise, and ingenuity towards helping us automate the process--especially with the fitness determination process at the National Center for Missing and Exploited Children which is a time consuming, labor-intensive process involving the manual review of criminal rap sheets. We formed a similar public-private partnership when we established the National Domestic Violence Hotline, and I hope we will be able to replicate that success here. Once we get this bill passed, I will be reaching out to some of our best technology companies to see if they can help us ensure that these checks remain inexpensive andavailable for as many youth-serving groups as possible.  I would once again like to thank my colleagues Senator Hatch's and Senator Specter's work on crafting this bill. We proved that we can help protect children at a low cost with the pilot program, and I believe that this bill will help expand access to a greater number of groups so that we can grow that number of protected children exponentially. To me, this is exactly the kind of service that the government owes to its people, and I look forward to its prompt passage before the expiration of the pilot program on July 30th, later this summer.  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be printed in the Record.  There being no objection, the text of the bill was ordered to be printed in the Record, as follows:                                S. 2756       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of      the United States of America in Congress assembled,     SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.       This Act may be cited as the ``Child Protection      Improvements Act of 2008''.     SEC. 2. FINDINGS.       Congress finds the following:       (1) In 2006, 61,200,000 adults (a total of 26.7 percent of      the population) contributed a total of 8,100,000,000 hours of      volunteer service. Of those who volunteer, 27 percent      dedicate their service to education or youth programs, or a      total of 16,500,000 adults.       (2) Assuming recent incarceration rates remain unchanged,      an estimated 6.6 percent of individuals in the United States      will serve time in prison for a crime during their lifetime.      The Integrated Automated Fingerprint Identification System of      the Federal Bureau of Investigation maintains fingerprints      and criminal histories on more than 47,000,000 individuals,      many of whom have been arrested or convicted multiple times.       (3) A study released in 2002, found that, of individuals      released from prison in 15 States in 1994, an estimated 67.5      percent were rearrested for a felony or serious misdemeanor      within 3 years. Three-quarters of those new arrests resulted      in convictions or a new prison sentence.       (4) Given the large number of individuals with criminal      records and the vulnerability of the population they work      with, human service organizations that work with children      need an effective and reliable means of obtaining a complete      criminal history in order to determine the suitability of a      potential volunteer or employee.       (5) The large majority of Americans (88 percent) favor      granting youth-serving organizations access to conviction      records for screening volunteers and 59 percent favored      allowing youth-serving organizations to consider arrest      records when screening volunteers. This was the only use for      which a majority of those surveyed favored granting access to      arrest records.       (6) Congress has previously attempted to ensure that States      make Federal Bureau of Investigation criminal history record      checks available to organizations seeking to screen employees      and volunteers who work with children, the elderly, and      individuals with disabilities, through the National Child      Protection Act of 1993 (42 U.S.C. 5119 et seq.) and the      Volunteers for Children Act (Public Law 105-251; 112 Stat.      1885). However, according to a June 2006 report from the      Attorney General, these laws ``did not have the intended      impact of broadening the availability of NCPA checks.''. A      2007 survey conducted by MENTOR/National Mentoring      Partnership found that only 18 States allowed youth mentoring      organizations to access nationwide Federal Bureau of      Investigation background searches.       (7) Even when accessible, the cost of a criminal background      check can be prohibitively expensive, ranging from $5 to $75      for a State fingerprint check, plus the Federal Bureau of      Investigation fee, which ranges between $16 to $24, for a      total of between $21 and $99 for each volunteer or employee.       (8) Delays in processing such checks can also limit their      utility. While the Federal Bureau of Investigation processes      all civil fingerprint requests in less than 24 hours, State      response times vary widely, and can take as long as 42 days.       (9) The Child Safety Pilot Program under section 108 of the      PROTECT Act (42 U.S.C. 5119a note) revealed the importance of      performing fingerprint-based Federal Bureau of Investigation      criminal history record checks. Of 29,000 background checks      performed through the pilot as of March 2007, 6.4 percent of      volunteers were found to have a criminal record of concern,      including very serious offenses such as sexual abuse of      minors, assault, child cruelty, murder, and serious drug      offenses.       (10) In an analysis performed on the volunteers screened in      the first 18 months of the Child Safety Pilot Program, it was      found that over 25 percent of the individuals with criminal      records had committed an offense in a State other than the      State in which they were applying to volunteer, meaning that      a State-only search would not have found relevant criminal      results. In addition, even though volunteers knew a      background check was being performed, over 50 percent of the      individuals found to have a criminal record falsely indicated      on their application form that they did not have a criminal      record.       (11) The Child Safety Pilot Program also demonstrates that      timely and affordable background checks are possible, as      background checks under that program are completed within 3      to 5 business days at a cost of $18.     SEC. 3. BACKGROUND CHECKS.       The National Child Protection Act of 1993 (42 U.S.C. 5119      et seq.) is amended--       (1) by redesignating section 5 as section 6; and       (2) by inserting after section 4 the following:     ``SEC. 5.
