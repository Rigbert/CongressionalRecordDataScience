President, I believe we are ready with our amendment, and under the unanimous consent we would be next. We are making some modifications right now. We could use a little time. We are ready to go in our place in line, unless it works out by unanimous consent that Senator Ensign and I change places so that my amendment would come up after the next Democratic amendment. That is what I will be willing to do.  I ask unanimous consent that we stay on the current unanimous consent request, with the exception that Senator Ensign's amendment be traded with mine, and I will take his place after the next amendment.
