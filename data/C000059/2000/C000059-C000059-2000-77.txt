Speaker, I thank the gentleman for yielding me time.  Mr. Speaker, I rise in opposition to the President's veto of H.R. 8, the Death Tax Elimination Act. One point I want to make, those 2 percent we keep hearing from our friends on the right, or on the left, I should say, those 2 percent hire a substantial amount of the people that work in this country. Keep that in mind.  This estate tax plan is simple, and we need to make sure that we sustain the President's veto.  It is disgraceful as a result of the estate tax more than 70 percent of family-owned businesses do not survive the second generation. Seventy percent of family-owned businesses do not survive the second generation.  Earlier this summer we had a vigorous debate about free trade, protecting jobs of American men and women, and then forcing 70 percent of Americans to sell off a family-owned business to protect American jobs. It this the American dream? I do not think so.  This estate tax is simply Uncle Sam double-dipping into the pockets of hard-working Americans. First we pay income taxes, then Uncle Sam comes back for more and more taxes, and the estate tax, which is now taking 55 percent of the value of an estate upon death.  This estate tax is extremely hard felt in my State of California where land prices are extremely high. Please vote to override.
