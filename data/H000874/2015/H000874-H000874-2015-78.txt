Speaker, we are going to be in session next week. Normally, as you know, we have a colloquy on the schedule. There is no colloquy today because, essentially, there is no schedule. We don't know what is going to be proposed to fund government, which will shut down in approximately 14 days if this body does not act. Actually, it is less than 14 days. It is 6 legislative days, Mr. Speaker.  The Export-Import Bank has been allowed to essentially go out of business for new loans, and we are losing jobs, Mr. Speaker, but there is no schedule. The highway bill on which States, cities, counties, localities, and private sector relies for some degree of certainty, there is no schedule, Mr. Speaker.  I regret that we do not have a colloquy today. I regret that the Export-Import Bank was not moved yesterday, today, or is not on the schedule for next week.  Mr. Speaker, it is time that the majority party sets forth a schedule to make sure America succeeds.                          ____________________
