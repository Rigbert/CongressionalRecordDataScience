 President, last Thursday, 55 of us joined Senators Leahy of Vermont and Hagel of Nebraska in cosponsoring the Landmine Elimination Act of 1977. This landmark legislation will bar, as of January 1, 2000, the use of any U.S. funds for new deployments of antipersonnel landmines.  I am proud to be one of the cosponsors of this legislation, which addresses a subject of terrible urgency. Every hour, more innocent civilians are killed or wounded by landmines in Angola, Afghanistan, Bosnia, Cambodia, Ecuador, and elsewhere. The scourge of landmines is so great that the United States and other governments have special aid programs to help locate and destroy landmines left over from the wars of the past.  The United States is pursuing many avenues to battle this plague. We are a signatory of the antipersonnel landmine protocol to the Convention on Conventional Weapons, which I would hope the Senate will give its advice and consent to ratification of that protocol sometime this year. That protocol bans undetectable mines, such as the toy-like plastic butterfly mines that maim so many children. The United States is well on its way toward converting all its nondetectable mines, so there will be very few costs associated with ratification of this protocol.  We are also engaged in negotiations in Geneva and working with the Government of Canada on the projected Ottawa convention in hopes of obtaining a worldwide ban on antipersonnel landmines. But those negotiations have left the United States in a quandary. Russia and China--the world's major suppliers of antipersonnel landmines--have refused to participate in the Ottawa process to achieve an immediate ban on these mines. And Mexico has blocked the U.N. Conference on Disarmament from opening the formal negotiations in which Russia and China are willing to participate.  Nobody is clear on whether Mexico's step reflects frustration with the idea of gradualism in eliminating antipersonnel landmines, or a desire to continue using such mines in Mexico's own war against the domestic guerrilla movements. What is clear, however, is that bold steps are needed to regain momentum in the crusade to end this most horrendous aspect of modern warfare.  Two years ago, two-thirds of this body voted for a moratorium on new antipersonnel landmine deployments, beginning in February 1999. The Landmine Elimination Act of 1977 will go a giant step further, by committing the United States to just say no to these mines on January 1, 2000. This action will put the United States on a higher moral plane than ever before on this issue. With a legally binding commitment to end our own role in sowing needless destruction, perhaps we can more effectively influence Russia and China and Mexico to step up to the responsibility of protecting the innocents even when we make war on our enemies.  S. 896 is a carefully constructed bill, Mr. President, and that is a sign of the seriousness with which this body approaches the topic of landmines. Subsection 2(d) of the bill permits the President to delay application of the ban with respect to the Korean peninsula on a yearly basis if he determines that new deployments would be indispensable to the defense of the Republic of Korea if war should occur there. This is a broader exemption than that in the moratorium we passed 2 years ago, which allows such mining only along international borders and in the DMZ. Given the risk that a dying Stalinist regime in North Korea might throw all its forces into a last-gasp effort to conquer the South, this broader exemption is sensible indeed.  S. 896 also is clearly limited to the most heinous landmines: Mines delivered by artillery, rocket, mortar, or similar means, or dropped from an aircraft. The bill goes to state, at subsection 4(b): ``The term `anti-personnel landmines' does not include command-detonated Claymore munitions.''  Command-detonated landmines do not cause the many civilian casualties that have prompted work action. They are generally set off either by a nearby soldier, who waits for the enemy to approach, or by a tripwire in an ambush. They are used often to blow up tanks, and do not leave the indiscriminate killing fields that so plague farmers and travelers and children today.  Nobody is comfortable manufacturing any instrument of death. But at least Claymore munitions are targeted munitions, designed to kill the enemy rather than his neighbors and his children.  The care with which S. 896 has been drafted makes this a bill that all of us can support. I am happy to cosponsor it and I am confident that it will be enacted into law.                          ____________________
