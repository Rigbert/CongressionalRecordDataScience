 In any event, I think that is appropriate, and I am hopeful that we can, in fact, accomplish that.  I want to tell the majority leader from my perspective that if we don't get that done in the short term, then I would be very reluctant to support continuing resolutions at the level which has now been substituted for the agreement that was reached in the bipartisan budget agreement.  There are substantial differences, as you know, in the 302(a) allocation, the allocation of discretionary spending, one at $1.012 trillion and one at $986 billion, so that there is a substantial discrepancy between those figures.  We reached agreement on the higher number. The Senate came down about 45, the House went up about 45 and reached a compromise. I think America was pleased that we reached a compromise. I would want to be on therecord as saying that if we went to longer term CRs, I would want to have some serious discussions about the level of those CRs in terms of the operations of government.  The other issue I wanted to ask the gentleman about, as you know, we had a previous question yesterday. That previous question, had it been defeated, would have allowed the House to consider the extension of unemployment insurance for 3 months, consistent with what the Senate had proposed. Now, the Senate has not reached agreement on this issue, but unfortunately that has not been considered on the floor this week. As the gentleman knows, 72,000 people a week are losing their unemployment insurance. That adds to 1.3 million that have already lost their own insurance on December 28.  I know it is not listed on your sheet, nor did you mention it in your comments on the floor. Can the gentleman tell me whether there is any prospect of the unemployment insurance bill coming to this floor? Mr. Tierney has a bill that he has introduced that I think probably enjoys, at this point in time, well over 150 Democrats, and I think all Democrats will sign on to it. I would hope that we together, as we did when President Bush was President, and we did it five times, I would hope that we could extend unemployment for those people who were relying on it to put food on their tables.  I yield to my friend.
