  Mr. DeFAZIO. Mr. Speaker, Veterans Day, November 11, 150,000 veterans will have waited 6 months or longer for appointments for medical care; 14,000 veterans have been waiting 15 months or longer for expedited disability claims; 560,000 disabled veterans will be forced to pay the disabled veterans tax. It does not have to be this way. But we are confronted with the most anti-veteran, anti-veteran administration in Congress in history.  The President refused to spend $275 million in emergency money. He cut off veterans' health care for 160,000 Category 8 veterans. Although there are 373 cosponsors to do away with the disability tax, the President has threatened to veto the bill if we do away with the veterans' disability tax, and Republican leaders refuse to bring up that bill here in the House.  It would be better to celebrate Veterans Day with actions that delivered on our promises to veterans than laudatory words; but I fear that we will just hear words and not see actions from this Congress and this administration.                          ____________________
