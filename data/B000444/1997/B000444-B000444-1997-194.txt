 President, this is condition No. 30. As was indicated at the outset of the unanimous-consent agreement, the Senate has now agreed to 28 of the 33 conditions that were attached to the treaty that is before us today.  As I indicated at that time that I would be moving to strike five of the conditions, any one of which--at least four of which--if adopted, would essentially vitiate the treaty; would make our ratification useless.
