 President, I rise today, along with Senators, Hatch, Kerry, Harkin, Reid, and D'Amato  to introduce the Federal Gang Violence Act of 1996--legislation that makes the Federal Government a more active partner in the war against violent and deadly organized gangs.  Mr. President, today's gangs are not the bands of loosely organized street kids glamorized in West Side Story. Today's gangs are very different. Consider this:  Just last week, the U.S. attorney's office in San Francisco made arrests in a major alien smuggling operation run by organized gangs based in New York and San Francisco. Operation Sea Dragon netted 23 people in connection with a large-scale plan to smuggle two boatloads of more than 270 aliens from China into the United States in 1993.  According to the U.S. attorney's office, a number of powerful New York-based gangs, including the White Tigers, Fuk Ching, and the Broom Street Boys joined forces with two bay area gangs to off load the smuggled aliens. A San Francisco-based Vietnamese gang was responsible for furnishing thefishing boats to ferry the smuggled aliens ashore, where a Chinese gang out of Oakland had provided land transportation and drop houses to facilitate the aliens travel to New York. Presumably, once in New York, these illegal aliens were to live in indentured servitude while they paid off the up to $30,000 in crossing debts that the gangs typically charge each passenger.  Alien smuggling is a very lucrative international business--law enforcement estimates it brings in $3 billion a year for smugglers.  But alien smuggling is just one example of the kinds of dangerous criminal activities modern gangs are engaged in. Today's gangs are organized and sophisticated traveling crime syndicates--much like the Mafia--that regularly cross State lines to recruit new members, traffick in drugs, weapons, and illegal aliens, and steal and murder.  In just one city, Los Angeles, nearly 7,300 of its citizens were murdered in the last 16 years from gang warfare. This is more people than have been killed in all the terrorist fighting in northern Ireland.  Gangs were responsible for: 43 percent of all homicides in Los Angeles in 1994; 41 percent of homicides in Omaha, Nebraska in 1995; and more than half of all violent crimes in Buffalo, NY, in 1994.  In Phoenix, AZ, gang-related homicides jumped 800 percent between 1990 and 1994; and  In Wichita, KS, drive-by shootings jumped from 8 in 1991 to 267 in 1993--a 3000-percent increase in just 2 years. This in a small city of 300,000.  These are just a few examples of the alarming rise in gang violence gripping our streets. We are becoming numb to the violence.  In Los Angeles in February, City Councilwoman Laura Chick, chair of the LA Public Safety Committee, received a faxed report that six people had been murdered over the weekend in LA--and it was not even reported in the press.  Criminal gangs are now engaged in million dollar heists, home and business invasions, major narcotics and weapons trafficking, and yes, illegal alien smuggling.  And they are crossing State lines to establish criminal operations in other States looking for untapped markets.  Sgt. Jerry Flowers with the gang crime unit in Oklahoma City captured the migration instinct of these gangs when he said: ``the gang leaders realized that the same ounce of crack cocaine they sold for $300 in Los Angeles was worth nearly $2,000 in Oklahoma City''.                            BLOODS and CRIPS  The Bloods and the Crips, gangs that originated in Los Angeles in the late 1960's, are the Nation's two largest street gangs. And they are expanding.  Local police and the FBI have traced factions of these gangs to more than 119 cities in the West and Midwest with more than 60,000 members. According to the FBI, narcotics trafficking is their principle source of income.                           gangster disciples  The Gangster Disciples, according to local authorities, is a Chicago-based 30,000 member multimillion dollar gang operation spanning 35 States.  They traffic in narcotics and weapons, and are said to operate much like a ``Fortune 500 Company'' with two boards of directors--one in prison and one outside--a layer of Governors and regents, a tax collector and some 6,000 salespersons. Their income is estimated at $300,000 daily.                          russian crime gangs  Russian organized crime activity in the United States has been expanding for the past 20 years, but its most significant growth has occurred during the past 5 years. Twenty-nine States now report activities by Russian crime groups.  FBI Director Louis Freeh stated that more than 200 of Russia's 6,000 crime gangs operate with American counterparts in the United States.  Russian gangs tend to be more loosely organized than other gangs, but they have formed networks that operate and shift alliances to meet particular needs.  The California Attorney General indicates that the most common criminal activities by Russian organized crime gangs are fraud schemes involving fuel tax, insurance, and credit card fraud. But they also engage in more common organized crime activities-extortion, loan sharking, drug trafficking, auto theft, and prostitution.                              asian gangs  The Department of Justice indicates that, among ethnic gangs, Jamaican and Asian gangs are considered by many law enforcement officials to pose the largest threat. Asian gangs have been identified as major threats in more than 17 cities.  In Los Angeles alone there are more than 100 Asian gangs with 10,000 members.  Illegal activities include: alien smuggling, murder, kidnapping, extortion, home invasion robberies, high-technology heists, and firearms trafficking.  Vietnamese gangs, in particular, have become a serious threat in many cities. They tend to be very violent, are more sophisticated organizationally, and have specialized in stealing multimillion dollar quantities of computer chips.  At least 400 Silicon Valley businesses that deal in computer chips have been hit in the last year and a half, losing tens of millions of dollars. Computer firms lose as much as $1 million a week in thefts.                        current laws not enough  Mr. President, Federal laws now on the books were designed to fight one type of organized crime--the Mafia. And I believe today's laws just are not enough to take on these modern gangs.  For the past 7 months, my staff has met with prosecutors, law enforcement officers, and community leaders to search for solutions to the problem of gang violence. The legislation I am introducing today, The Federal Gang Violence Act of 1996, is the result of our work.  This legislation strengthens Federal law by attacking gang violence on three fronts:  It doubles the sentence for any member of an organized criminal gang who commits a Federal crime;  Expands the scope of gang-related criminal acts to include such activities as carjacking and drive-by shootings, and significantly increases penalties for those crimes; and  Checks the growth of gangs by making the recruitment of minors into criminal gangs a Federal offense with stiff penalties.  Specifically, this legislation:  First, doubles the actual sentence for any member of an organized criminal street gang who commits a Federal crime.  Current Federal law increases the penalties for organizers, leaders, managers, and supervisors of criminal activity--including gang leaders--who commit a federal crime. However, members of known criminal street gangs currently are not subjected to higher penalties when a Federal crime is committed.  Many prosecutors and law enforcement leaders indicate that gang members--in addition to the leaders and supervisors of gangs--should see their penalties increased to provide a stronger deterrent for children to stay away from gangs.  This legislation amends the sentencing guidelines so that individual gang members convicted of felonies would have their sentencing level approximately doubled. For example: Now if a first-time offender who is a member of a gang is convicted of gun trafficking, he would get a minimum of 4\3/4\-6 years in jail. Under this legislation, the sentence would be increased to 9-11\1/4\ years.  Second, expands the definition of criminal street gangs in Federal law to better reflect modern-day gang activity.  The bill broadens the definition of criminal street gang activity in title 18 of the Criminal Code to include many types of State crimes, such as drive-by shootings, rape, torture, carjacking, kidnaping, and assault with a deadly weapon.  This legislation also lowers the number of participants--from five members to three members--required to meet the definition of a gang.  Third, doubles penalties for interstate, gang-related crimes and expands the Travel Act to respond more effectively to the growing problem of highly sophisticated, mobile, and organized street gangs.  The Travel Act was originally written in 1961 with Mafia-style activity in mind. While the Travel Act as it is now written allows prosecutors to targetsome gang activities--such as drug trafficking--the list is not complete. Law enforcement leaders and prosecutors have indicated that the act needs to be modernized to better reflect current crimes by gang members.  Under this legislation, the list of unlawful activities in the Travel Act will be expanded to include the following crimes: Drive-by shooting; robbery; burglary; assault with a deadly weapon; intimidation of witnesses, victims, jurors, or informants; assault resulting in bodily injury; possession and/or trafficking of stolen property; alien smuggling; firearms trafficking; kidnaping; and insurance fraud.  In addition, under this legislation, the maximum penalties are doubled from 5 to 10 years for those who violate these provisions without intending to commit violent crimes themselves.  A conspiracy provision is also added to this statute to make it easier to prosecute all the gang members who help to commit these crimes.  This act also doubles the base offense levels under the sentencing guidelines for: Traveling in interstate or foreign commerce in aid of a street gang, from 6 to 12, which increases the base sentencing range from a low of zero to 6 months and a high of 12 to 18 months, to a new low of 10 to 16 months and a new high of 30 to 37 months; and committing violent crimes in aid of street gang or racketeering activity from 12 to 24, which increases the base sentencing range from a low of 10 to 16 months and a high of 30 to 37 months, to a new low of 51 to 63 months and a new high of 100 to 125 months.  Fourth, solicitation or recruitment of persons into gang activity: Current Federal law contains no penalty for recruiting minors to participate in gang activity. Law enforcement officials indicate that sophisticated organized crime syndicates will recruit minors to do the dirty work so that the organizers of the criminal activity cannot be convicted of a crime.  This legislation makes the recruitment or solicitation of persons to participate in gang activity subject to a 1-year minimum and 10-year maximum penalty, or a fine of up to $250,000. If a minor is recruited or solicited, the minimum penalty is increased to 4 years. In addition, the person convicted of this crime would have to pay the costs of housing, maintaining and treating the juvenile until the juvenile reaches the age of 18 years.  Fifth, this bill makes the use of a minor in the commission of a Federal crime a RICO predicate.  Identifying an organization dedicated to criminal activity in accordance with the RICO Statute results in asset forfeiture and a maximum of 20 years in prison.  Sixth, transfer of firearms to minors for use in crime.  It is now a crime under Federal law to knowingly transfer a firearm to be used to commit a violent crime or a drug trafficking crime.  This legislation adds a mandatory minimum penalty of 3 years imprisonment if the gun to be used in crime is transferred to a minor.  Seventh, this legislation increases penalties for transferring handguns to minors.  The Youth Handgun Safety Act, passed by Congress as part of the 1994 crime bill, does not contain sufficient penalties against juveniles who possess handguns.  In fact, one provision of the current Youth Handgun Safety Act requires only mandatory probation for a first-time juvenile offender who possesses a handgun. Such a weak penalty has meant few prosecutors would utilize the Youth Handgun Safety Act to target gang members. In addition, current law sets different penalties for juveniles and adults who transfer a weapon to a minor.  The Federal Gang Violence Act toughens the penalties against juveniles and adults who transfer a firearm to a minor--and subjects juveniles and adults to the same penalties for violating this law.  This legislation changes the Youth Handgun Safety Act by:  Setting a 1-year minimum sentence for anyone--adult or juvenile--who provides a minor with a handgun.  Holding juveniles accountable when they unlawfully give another minor a firearm by applying the same 5-year maximum sentence now given to adults.  Setting a 1-year minimum sentence and applying the same 10-year maximum sentence to adults and juveniles who give a firearm to a minor and should have known the gun would be used in a crime of violence. Currently, the 10-year maximum sentence only applies to adults.  Juveniles under 13 years old, however, would not be subject to these mandatory minimum sentences.  Eighth, the James Guelff Body Armor Act: Many police officers around the country are confronting heavily armed gang members who are wearing bullet-proof vests. This legislation makes it a separate crime to wear body armor in the commission of a Federal offense, which would be punished by automatically adding 2 years to the sentence for the original crime.  Ninth, serious juvenile drug offenses as Armed Career Criminal Act predicates:  The Armed Career Criminal Act provides that if a person has three or more prior convictions for certain crimes--is a career criminal--and he possesses, ships, transports, or receives a gun or ammunition, is armed, he will be subject to a mandatory minimum 15-year penalty and fine of up to $25,000.  Serious drug offenses are already in the list of crimes which count toward the three-conviction minimum; this bill would allow juvenile convictions for serious drug offenses to also count toward that three-conviction minimum. This would not apply to nickel-and-dime possession offenses, but to drug dealing which is punishable by ten or more years in prison.  Tenth, expands the time limit for bringing juvenile proceedings to trial.  Presently, a 30-day time limit exists. With crimes being committed by juveniles becoming increasingly violent and complex, prosecutors need additional time to adequately develop cases. This legislation increases the time limit to 70 days.  Eleventh, adds firearms violations, such as trafficking, to the list of crimes that can be attacked by prosecutors under RICO.  Currently, firearms violations are not RICO predicate acts. Prosecutors and law enforcement officials indicate an increasing use of firearms by criminal street gangs to commit home robberies, business invasions, and attacks on rival gangs.  Since most of the firearms have moved in interstate commerce--and because firearms are such an integral part of the gang's activity--law enforcement officials have suggested that firearms violations become predicate acts under RICO.  Twelfth, this legislation promotes the use of State Department linguists to assist in translating and monitoring wiretaps in gang investigations. Federal law enforcement and courts report that they are experiencing difficulty and high costs in locating and employing certified translators for Southeastern Asian languages and Chinese dialects used by some gangs.  Thirteenth, this legislation provides $100 million over the next 5 years for hiring additional Federal prosecutors to prosecute violent youth gangs.  Mr. President, the legislation I have laid out for you today is a starting point, and I think it is long overdue. I know there is no silver bullet to cure our Nation of the ills wrought by street gangs. But this legislation takes an important step forward by adding the Federal Government's weight to what has thus far been largely State and local war on gangs by significantly strengthening the Federal laws that deal with gang crime.  It is my belief that the only real long-term solution lies in combining forces at the Federal, State, and local level.  And I am pleased to say that thus far, this legislation has received nearly 80 endorsements from local California law enforcement, including Los Angeles County District Attorney Gil Garcetti, Los Angeles County Sheriff Sherman Block, and Police Chiefs in Fresno, Oakland, and Sacramento.  I urge my colleagues to support this legislation, and I welcome their input as this bill moves forward.
