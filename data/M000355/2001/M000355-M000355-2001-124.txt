 President, I rise today to offer an amendment to the BEST Act which incorporates the provisions of legislation I introduced earlier this year, the Paul D. Coverdell Teacher Protection Act. This important legislation extends protections from frivolous lawsuits to teachers, principals, administrators, and other education professionals who take reasonable steps to maintain order in the classroom.  The Teacher Liability Protection Act builds upon the good work Congress began in 1997 when it enacted the Volunteer Protection Act. As Senators may recall, the Volunteer Protection Act provides liability protections to individuals serving their communities as volunteers. After bringing several volunteer protection amendments to the floor through the 1990's and introducing the Volunteer Protection Act during the 104th Congress, I was blessed when Senator Paul Coverdell joined me in helping to steer this measure through the 105th Congress and have it enacted in 1997. Now, we need to extend similar liability protections to our nation's teachers, principals, and education professionals who are responsible for ensuring the safety of our children at school.  Everyone agrees that providing a safe, orderly environment is a critical component of ensuring that every child can reach their full academic potential. Teachers who are unable to maintain order in the classroom cannot reasonably be expected to share their knowledge with their pupils, whether it be in math, science, or literature. Disruptive, rowdy, and sometimes violent students not only threaten the immediate safety of their classmates, they threaten the very future of our children by denying them the opportunity to learn. Unfortunately, teachers, principals, and other education officials share an impediment in their efforts to ensure that students can learn in a safe, orderly learning environment: the fear of lawsuits. All too often, these hard-working professionals find their reasonable actions to instill discipline and maintain order are questioned and second guessed by opportunistic trial lawyers.  Today's teachers will tell you that the threat of litigation is in the back of their minds and forces them at times to act in a manner which might not be in the best interests of their students. A 1999 survey of secondary school principals found that 25 percent of the respondents were involved in lawsuits or out-of-court settlements in the previous two years--an amazing 270 percent increase from only 10 years earlier. The same survey found that 20 percent of principals spent 5 to 10 hours a week in meetings or documenting events in an effort to avoid litigation. This is time that our educators should spend counseling students, developing curriculum, and maintaining order--not fending off frivolous lawsuits.  Mr. President, allow me to illustrate my point with several examples.  In May of 1998, representatives of the Bethlehem Area School District learned that one of their students, Justin Swidler, had created a web site where he solicited money to hire a hit man to kill his math teacher, Mrs. Kathleen Fulmer. According to a local newspaper account, the web site contained images of the principal being shot and ``a picture of Fulmer which changed, or ``morphed'' in to a portrait of Adolf Hitler.'' The site, which bears a name I cannot repeat on the Senate floor, also listed reasons ``Why Fulmer Should be Fired'' and then reasons ``Why She Should Die.'' I think that deserves repeating: The list was not limited to the typical juvenile carping about a teacher. It listed why she should die.  The school district, much to its credit, expelled Justin Swidler. However, rather than encouraging young Justin to take responsibility for his actions, the response of Justin's parents was all too predictable--they hired a lawyer and they sued. First, they sued the school district. Then, they sued the principal. After that, they sued the superintendent. Finally, in the coup de gras of the litigation, the Swidlers sued the teacher whom their son had threatened to kill. I repeat, the Parents sued the teacher whom their son had threatened to kill.  What reasons did the Swidlers give for their suit? they claimed, among other things, to have suffered ``embarrassment, ridicule, humiliation, isolation and severe emotional distress'' as well as financial loss and ``inconvenience.'' The Swidlers wanted the school to pay because they suffered ``embarrassment'' and ``inconvenience'' because their son threatened the life of his math teacher? That is utterly outrageous. The boy's father, Howard Swidler, also claimed his son had difficulty enrolling in a new school because ``teachers wouldn't provide recommendations.'' I can imagine that. The teachers at Nitchmann Middle School didn't want to write a letter of recommendation for this kid who had compared a fellow teacher to Hitler and threatened to have her killed. What nerve of those teachers not to write a recommendation under those circumstances.  These lawsuits and countersuits drug out in the courts for more than 2\1/2\ years. During this time, good reputations were besmirched, distinguished careers were ruined, and each party accumulated what we can only estimate to be thousands of dollars in legal bills.  After all of this litigation, who finally won here?  The student didn't win. His expulsion was upheld and worse yet, he learned from his parents that the appropriate way to defend indefensible behavior is to file a lawsuit. That is what he learned.  The teacher didn't win. Upon returning to teaching, she found that the publicity surrounding the case had irreparably damaged her credibility in the classroom, and she was forced to leave her chosen profession.  The principal didn't win. He found himself so thoroughly frustrated and saddened by the toll the incident had taken on his school, he decided to take early retirement.  Justin's classmates didn't win. The school's students were denied resources which should have been used for their education that were instead used to defend the school from a lawsuit.  After all of this, I think the only possible winners in this case were the lawyers who generated 2\1/2\ years worth of billable hours, from the Swidlers, the Fulmers, the principal, the school district, and, yes, the students.  Let me give you another example.  Three students in Anchorage, AK, were caught accessing pornographic material over the Internet during a computer class at school. The school, acting within its discretion, removed the students from that class and gave them an F for the semester. However, one of the students had earned a grade point average which placed him at or near the top of his class. Realizing that the F would prevent the student from being honored at his graduation, the student's family hired a lawyer and sued the school.  After a protracted legal battle, the school was forced to withdraw the F in a settlement once the judge warned the school he would likely rule against it. Is this what we want? Do we want lawyers and judges deciding what grades a student should receive or aren't we better off leaving this to the teachers in the classroom and principals in the schools?  Another example: Last year, a high school cheerleading coach in Labanon, TN, required her squad to run some laps during practice. One of the girls objected to this assignment and referred to it as a ``piece of [blank]''. In response to the girl's insubordinate and vulgar language defying her coach in front of her teammates and classmates, the coach suspended her for an upcoming game against Lebanon's arch rival, Mount Juliet High.  Those of you who have been listening closely to my remarks can guess what the girl's family did next. Why, of course, they hired a lawyer, and they sued the coach. What is amazing is that the cheerleader won an injunction against the coach hours before the ball game with the court requiring that she be given the opportunity to cheer. While this case might cause us to chuckle, it points to a real problem. It sends a horrible message to wayward students that school officials don't have any real authority and students don't take any responsibility. If you don't like a teacher's decision or a principal's decision, just hire a lawyer and sue the teacher. Don't listen to your teacher; listen to your lawyer.  These are but a few of the instances in which frivolous lawsuits threaten to undermine discipline in our Nation's classrooms. While each of these cases is troubling, what I find more disturbing are the cases that aren't publicized at all. These are the cases where the teacher or principal looks the other way or decides not to discipline a misbehaving student because of the fear--the fear--of a lawsuit.  Many educational organizations recognize frivolous lawsuits as a problem. That is why the Teacher Protection Act has the support of the National Association of Secondary School Principals and the National Association of Elementary School Principals. I respectfully ask unanimous consent that letters from these organizations be printed in the Record.  There being no objection, the letters were ordered to be printed in the Record, as follows:                           National School Boards Association,                                    Alexandria, VA, Apr. 27, 2001.     Senator McConnell,     U.S. Senate,     Washington, DC.       Dear Senator McConnell: The National School Boards      Association (NSBA) understands that you plan to introduce an      amendment to the Elementary and Secondary Education Act      (ESEA) regarding liability protection for school officials      who take reasonable actions to maintain order, discipline,      and an appropriate educational environment. NSBA is pleased      that the amendment extends liability protection to individual      school board members.       This provision is necessary because frequently, a student      will sue the school district (meaning school board), and then      they will sue the teacher, the principal, the superintendent,      and the board members in their individual capacities. As a      result, the school district expends time and money defending      these claims brought against school board members acting in      their individual capacity. School district budgets are      stretched too far, and unnecessary litigation results in less      money being spent on educating our nation's students.      Providing individual school board members liability      protection will reduce litigation costs in local school      districts and will also provide for the swift dismissal of      suits against individual school board members.       We recognize that this narrow exception may raise concern      that professional staff might feel they have a ``free hand''      in the discipline of students. In this regard, it should be      emphasized that with respect to school discipline,      professional educators are subject to school district      policies, court enforceable due process requirements, and in      any extreme cases, the criminal code. And when it comes to      such areas as criminal conduct and gross negligence, the      exemption of this amendment would not apply. In all cases,      the school district can still be sued. Accordingly, this      amendment retains the limits and deterrence of possible      professional error or misconduct through other legal avenues      while enabling school officials to do their jobs, without      fear of litigation, in rendering their sound judgement in the      great majority of situations involving student safety and a      sound learning environment.       NSBA supports your effort to provide liability protection      to individual school board members and looks forward to the      measure being adopted when the full Senate considers ESEA. If      you have any questions please contact Lori Meyer, director of      federal legislation, at 703-838-6208.           Sincerely,                                               Michael A. Resnick,                                     Associate Executive Director.                                       ____                                           National Association of                                  Secondary School Principals,                                        Reston, VA, Feb. 28, 2001.     Hon. Mitch McConnell,     U.S. Senate, Senate Russell Office Building, Washington, DC.       Dear Senator McConnell: On behalf of the National      Association of Secondary School Principals--the preeminent      organization representing the interests of middle level and      high school principals, assistant principals, and aspiring      principals--I would like to thank you for introducing S. 316,      a bill that provides for teacher and principal liability      protection.       As a nationwide survey of principals conducted last year      indicates, schools across the nation are eliminating or      altering basic programs and activities due to the fear of      lawsuits. Twenty percent of those responding reported      spending 5-10 hours a week in meetings or documenting events      in efforts to avoid litigation and six percent put that      number at 10-20 hours a week. At a time when society is      heaping greater academic expectations on our schools, we      cannot afford to lose one minute, or one dollar, or one      school program to frivolous litigation.       There is a growing shortage of qualified candidates      applying to be principals occurring at the same time that      roughly 40 percent of practicing principals are expected to      retire from their jobs within the next five to ten years. A      study conducted last year by the Educational Research Service      on behalf of NASSP and the National Association of Elementary      Principals reflects that two of the three primary reasons      that discourage candidates from applying is because the      position is too stressful and there is too much time required      for the requisite responsibilities. There is no doubt that      frivolous lawsuits and activity related to that litigation      contributes to the level of stress experienced by principals.       While we applaud your efforts to provide liability      protection to teachers and note that the bill's definition of      ``teachers'' is inclusive of principals, we believe the title      and references contained in the bill should reflect this      intent. Principals, as school leaders, are typically named on      lawsuits involving teachers.           Sincerely,                                         Gerald N. Tirozzi, Ph.D.,     Executive Director.                                  ____                                       National Association of                                 Elementary School Principals,                                   Alexandria, VA, March 13, 2001.     Hon. Mitch McConnell,     Russell Senate Office Building, Washington, DC.       Dear Senator McConnell: On behalf of the National      Association of Elementary School Principals (NAESP),      representing more than 28,000 elementary and middle school      principals, I am writing to express our support for your      bill, the Paul D. Coverdell Teacher Liability Protection Act      of 2001. If enacted, this measure, S. 316, would be helpful      to principals, teachers, and other professional school staff.      While we welcome accountability, we are very concerned about      the proliferation of lawsuites.       Recent surveys conducted by NAESP and the American Tort      Reform Association indicate that there has been a significant      increase in lawsuits against educators. Nearly a third of the      suits were dropped, about one-quarter were settled out of      court, and the remainder were resolved in the principal's      favor. Virtually no judgments were found against principals,      a fact that leads one to conclude that many of the suits      could be described as frivolous. Each time there is a      lawsuit, valuable time must be taken away from the teaching      and learning process and devoted to legal matters. A      principal in Washington State spent more than 100 hours one      year on legal work surrounding one special education case.      This principal is responsible for a school with 500 students      and a staff of 40. Not only do lawsuits exhaust many hours;      even worse is the effect they have had on principal-student      and principal-family relationships. Principals are      increasingly cautious about the decisions they make,      including implementing changes in the way students are taught      and disciplined. This is obviously a hindrance to effective      school reform efforts. The simple act of comforting a child      in distress has also changed; no longer do school staff      members feel that they can put a hand on a child's shoulder      to calm the child down or provide an encouraging pat on the      back.       Although your bill's title refers only to teachers, its      definition of ``teachers'' clearly includes principals, and      we appreciate that. Thank you for your work to turn down the      heat, so to speak, and discourage unnecessary lawsuits.           Sincerely,                                            Vincent L. Ferrandino,                                               Executive Director.  Mr. McCONNELL. In fact, frivolous lawsuits are such a concern to educators that many teachers unions tout liability insurance as a key reason for joining their union. The Missouri NEA advertises on its website that:       A $2 million educators employment liability (EEL) policy is      the cornerstone of MNEA's professional protection plan. The      coverage, automatic with membership, includes up to $2      million in damages and additional payment for legal fees for      most civil and some criminal lawsuits arising out of job-     related incidents while members are working.  In Texas, where the legislature has already adopted a comprehensive teacher protection bill, the Texas State Teachers Association, TSTA, touts its insurance program as a strong incentive for joining its union:       For the times when life goes haywire and people are      reacting with emotions rather than reason, rest assured that      TSTA is watching out for you. Our $6 million liability policy      sets a new standard for professional protection and coverage      is automatic with your [union] membership.  For my Senate colleagues who question whether or not this is indeed a serious problem, you ought to know that the Maine NEA disagrees with you. This is what the Maine NEA says:       If something happens to a student in your class, on your      bus, or in your area of supervision, you can be sued and held      individually liable. By virtue of your employment, you could      place your home and savings at risk due to the claims of an      angry parent.  However, Maine teachers should not fear, the e-mail continues:       All MEA members are immediately protected by NEA's $1      million professional liability policy from their first day of      membership.  This legislation is structured similarly to the Volunteer Protection Act of 1997 and is nearly identical to teacher protection legislation introduced by Paul Coverdell, S. 1721, in the 106th Congress. Simply put, this amendment extends a national standard to protect from liability those teachers, principals, and education professionals who act in a reasonable manner to maintain order in the classroom. It does not preempt those States that have already taken action to address this problem, and it allows any State legislature that disagrees with these strong protections to opt out at any time. Since the legislation builds on Senator Coverdell's fine work, my colleagues and I thought it would be highly appropriate that it bear his name.  At the same time, it is important to note that this amendment is not a ``carte blanche'' for that minuscule minority of school officials who abuse their authority. The amendment does not protect those teachers who engage in ``willful misconduct, gross negligence, reckless misconduct, or a conscious flagrant indifference to the rights or safety'' of a student. Nor does the amendment preclude schools or local law enforcement entities from taking criminal, civil, or administrative actions against a teacher who acts improperly. Rather, the amendment is simply designed to protect those teachers, principals, and educational professionals from frivolous lawsuits.  This is not new ground for our colleagues in the Senate. In 1999, the Senate agreed to a similar amendment offered by Senator Ashcroft. During the second session of the 106th Congress, Senator Coverdell successfully included a nearly identical amendment in the Senate's version of the ESEA reauthorization bill. It was approved by this body by an overwhelming vote of 97 to 0. Unfortunately, as we all know, efforts to reauthorize the ESEA stalled on the Senate floor. It is now the appropriate time for the Senate to revisit this issue, and I hope give its full endorsement.  I look forward to working with my fellow original co-sponsors and the rest of the Senate to see that these important protections are enacted into law on behalf of America's hard working and dedicated teachers.  Again, Mr. President, we voted on this in the last Congress. This amendment was approved 97-0. It is my hope that it will be accepted by the Senate this year. It has widespread support on a bipartisan basis and would add greatly to the underlying bill.  I have completed my opening observations on the amendment, and I yield the floor.
