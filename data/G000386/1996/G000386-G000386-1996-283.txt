 President, I rise today to mourn the untimely passing of a former Senate staff member, great Iowan, and personal friend. Stanley Browne started from very humble roots, one of six children born to a school administrator and housewife in Sioux Falls, SD, in 1923. His father Walter died suddenly when Stan was just 6 years old. From that day on, he watched the determination and selfless dedication of not only his mother Ida, as she cared for the family all day, then scrubbed floors and cleaned homes evenings, but also his oldest brothers as they dropped out of school, and sacrificed their futures--all to enable their family to stay together. He grew up rather quickly, acutely aware of both the value of hard work and money, for then there was no such thing as welfare. He became an Eagle Scout and served in various leadership roles in Scouting as an adult. He served our country in world war II, as a Paratrooper with the 13th Airborne Division, 326th Glider Infantry in central Europe, European African Middle East theater. After the war, he rekindled an acquaintance with a wonderful lady named Coral Jane Freeman. Theywould have celebrated their 48th wedding anniversary this Thursday June 13. Stan Browne, both with the help of this great country's GI bill and the hard work ethic installed upon him and embedded in his mind as young child, went on to graduate from Drake University Law School in Des Moines, IA, while simultaneously juggling several part-time jobs to make ends meet. While at Drake he was president of the Delta Theta Phi law fraternity. Upon graduation, he practiced in the law firm of Wilson and Browne. He was active in Republican politics as both a candidate and campaign manager. After a victorious Senate campaign, Stan Browne became Senator Jack Miller's administrative assistant for 12 years. He served as president of the Administrative Assistants Association and was a member of St. Marks Presbyterian Church in Bethesda, MD. As current member and past chairman of the 116 Club, he was especially proud to have been responsible for admitting the very first woman to this formerly male dominated organization during his tenure. After his departure from the hill, Stan Browne entered the private sector, joining the DuPont Corp., serving as its Washington counsel until his retirement in 1986. He served on the board of directors for the PUBCO and Bobbie Brooks Corp., based in Cleveland, OH. He was also a former member of the Iowa State Bar Association, Polk County Bar Association and the Jr. Bar Association, Worshipful Master of New Century Masonic Lodge, past president of the Central Iowa Multiple Sclerosis Society, and a member of the Landings Club in Savannah, GA. Both on and off ``the Hill,'' Stan Browne was known for his modesty, humbleness, honesty and integrity. With his calm and cool demeanor, he was highly respected and well known for his effective low-key and behind-the-scene accomplishments. In addition to his wife of nearly 48 years, Coral, he leaves behind two children; Laurel Bigelow and Neal Browne--currently in the Senate Document Room--14 years service--daughter-in-law Lisa Browne, three surviving siblings; Norma Egland, Barbara Fonder, and Miles Browne, seven grandchildren; Daniel Bigelow, Thomas, Scott, and Joshua Trickett, Adam and Rachel Browne, Skylar Hattrich; and one great grandson, Christopher Bigelow.                          ____________________
