 President, on one other item, yesterday we said goodbye to our former colleague, Senator Jesse Helms. A significant number of our colleagues were in attendance at the funeral in Raleigh. Since his passing was expected, we certainly did not suffer from shock. It was anticipated that our friend and colleague would soon pass away, so in many respects it was a celebration of the life of a unique and great American.  I was honored by Mrs. Helms to be asked to do one of the eulogies at the funeral yesterday. I ask that my remarks be printed in the Record for any of our colleagues who might want to see what I had to say on behalf of our friend and colleague yesterday as we bid him farewell.  I ask unanimous consent to have those remarks printed in the Record.
