 President, I want to express my support for Senator Kyl's amendment establishing a sense of the Congress regarding Medicare beneficiaries freedom to privately contract with physicians. I understand there has been a lot of misinformation about private contracting and the Balanced Budget Act provision. But the fundamental issue behind this debate has always been clear. What this really boils down to is what is the appropriate role of the government. And I just don't believe that the federal government should tell seniors how they can or cannot spend their own hard earned money. While the Balanced Budget Act allows private contracting on a limited basis, most beneficiaries will not have this freedom because physicians who privately contract will have to opt out of the Medicare program for 2 years. Most physicians won't be able to do that, and most beneficiaries would not want their doctor to do this. Therefore, I support the Kyl amendment to give seniors the freedom of choice to privately contract.
