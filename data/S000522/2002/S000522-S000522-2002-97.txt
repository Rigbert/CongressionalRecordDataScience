Mr. Speaker, I rise in strong support of H. Con. Res. 188, expressing the sense of Congress that the Government of the People's Republic of China should cease its persecution of Falun Gong practitioners. Ms. Ros-Lehtinen, I commend you for introducing this legislation and for the leadership you have shown as Chair of the Subcommittee on International Operations and Human Rights in speaking out against human rights abuses throughout the world.  Members of Congress need to be aware of the brutal suppression of human rights and religious freedoms being carried out by the People's Republic of China. From forced abortion and labor camps, to the imprisonment and sometimes even execution of brave Chinese who dare to stand up for their faith or political beliefs, Jiang Zemin's regime is one of the worst violators of human rights in the world.  While Christians, Tibetan Buddhists, and Muslim Uighurs are all being persecuted for their faith, the suffering of peaceful Falun Gong practitioners has been especially intense. In 1999, China's dictators launched a brutal campaign to completely eradicate Falun Gong from their country through whatever means necessary, claiming that Falun Gong was a threat to ``social order'' in China. The reason behind this campaign of brutality is clear: by the mid to late 1990s, the number of Falun Gong practitioners began to exceed the number of members of the Communist Party. Like all dictators and totalitarian terror systems, the PRC fears and hates what it cannot control. So it sought to destroy and intimidate those who practice Falun Gong.  Falun Gong is not a religion, per se, but rather more like a philosophy. Based on the principles of Truthfulness, Compassion, and Tolerance, Falun Gong uses a series of five physical and mental exercises to assist its members purify themselves spiritually and peacefully resolve conflicts. Whatever one may say about the merits of their beliefs, the evidence is very clear that Falun Gong practitioners are peaceful individuals who want to be left alone to practice their beliefs as they see fit.  To carry out the task of smashing those who practice Falun Gong, the Beijing dictatorship created ``610'' offices throughout China to oversee and direct the persecution of Falun Gong through brainwashing, torture, and murder.  The State Department Human Rights Report for 2001 has several pages detailing and documenting the plight of the Falun Gong. We know at least 250 Falun Gong have died as a result of torture thus far. Other estimates place the true body count much higher. Bodies of the tortured victims are often cremated immediately to conceal evidence of torture. The report indicated that Falun Gong adherents sent to mental health institutions have been administered psychiatric drugs and electric shock treatments by Chinese authorities.  Tens of thousands of Falun Gong practitioners are held in labor camps, prisons, and mental hospitals, where they are forced to endure torture brainwashing sessions. Chinese-American permanent residents are not spared in the PRC's disgusting torture and brainwashing campaign.  One American permanent resident, Ms. Teng Chunyan, was arrested in May 2000 and sent to prison for three years solely on account of her beliefs. She was sent to Beijing ``re-education center'' in June 2000. The PRC--in a move that most American POWs from Korea and Vietnam would immediately see through and recognize--put Ms. Teng on public display on November 20, 2001 after its ``re-education'' center had thoroughly broken and brainwashed this poor woman.  In the macabre display gleefully published by the Chinese embassy--which I will include for the public record--Ms. Teng disavowed her affiliation to the Falun Gong and stated that ``I have never been abused since my detention and have not seen any sign of beating or admonishment here. Police in the center are very polite and kind. . . . The re-education center is more comfortable than my home and I am gaining weight here.'' American POWs who endured horrible torture at the hands of Communists would recognize these kinds of forced statements immediately as a pathetic farce. We might never know what kinds of terrible things were done to Ms. Teng and her family to get her to make these kinds of statements under duress. This is just one example of how China uses its state controlled media to inundate the public with anti-Falun Gong propaganda.  As my colleagues know, a sizable number of Falun Gong practitioners reside here in the United States. They attempt to raise awareness about the horrors their fellow believers are subject to through meeting with government officials and through holding peaceful protests. Just this past weekend Falun Gong members gathered on the Mall to pass out literature and inform Americans of the great suffering those in their faith are enduring. When Jiang Zemin and other state leaders responsible for this purge are visiting foreign countries, Falun Gong members travel overseas to protest and raise awareness of the brutal persecution.  In response, China's persecution against the Falun Gong has moved outside of China's own borders. A few weeks ago, Falun Gong practitioners--U.S. citizens--were denied visas to travel to Iceland during Jiang Zemin's visit to that country. An Icelandic newspaper known as ``The Morgunblad'' wrote that it ``has reliable sources that Chinese authorities have demanded from the Icelanders that Falun Gong members not be in the country during the visit.'' They even reportedly demanded that no Falun Gong protesters be seen from the Saga Hotel where Jiang Zemin was staying.  Persecution of Falun Gong in China is horrific enough itself. The fact that China is now exporting its repression to weaker foreign nations under the guise of ``safety'' and ``public order'' is even worse. We must not forget that Iceland has been a strong democratic ally of the United States and a founding member of NATO. The fact that peaceful American citizens attempting to travel to a fellow NATO nation were detained and harassed, had their names placed on an Icelandic government ``blacklist'' and their tickets revoked, presumably at the behest of thugs in Beijing, is an outrage and must not be tolerated. The cancer of China's repression is spreading all over the world. The PRC is not content to beat and torture and silence those inside its own borders. Now it is seeking to bully other nations into doing its bidding. When will this country wake up and stand up to this kind of nonsense?  I call upon all members of this body to support H. Con. Res. 188. I call on the administration to step up its efforts to speak up for the Falun Gong and out against the actions of the Chinese government immediately. Teng Chunyan: I Am Pleased to Shake off the Spiritual Shackle of the                        Falun Gong Cult (11/20/01)       ``I hope that my experience help transform those obsessed      Falun Gong followers,'' said Teng Chunyan on November 20      surrounded by media at a Beijing-based re-education center.      With her short hair neatly combed and eyebrows noticeably      trimmed, the confident 38-year-old woman looked at least ten      years younger than her age.       ``The reeducation center is more comfortable than my home      and I am gaining weight here,'' said Teng smiling shyly. The      beaming Teng, who has received systematic training in Chinese      herbal medicine, cannot be compared with the Falun Gong      devotee she once was.       Teng came to China from the U.S. many times between      February and May of last year to collect information on the      Chinese Government's handling of Falun Gong issues for      Beijing branches of foreign news agencies and introduced      Falun Gong followers to foreign reporters. Teng was born in      Harbin, capital of northeast China's Heilongjiang Province      and went to the United States in 1990. She was detained by      police when she tried to enter China via the Luohu Port in      Shenzhen in May 2000 and was sentenced to a 3-year term of      imprisonment according to Chinese law.       Her belief in the Falun Gong cult began to waver after she      was sent to a Beijing-based re-education center in June 2000.      Recalling her former devotion to Falun Gong, Teng said that      persuasion from family members and friends could not lessen      her blind enthusiasm for the cult. ``I completely rejected      contacts with the outside world and only believed in the      Falun Gong cult and its propaganda which is flooded on the      cult web site,'' Teng said.       Teng started to doubt the credibility and motives of the      cult web site when she found that her re-education center      roommate Yao Jie, who was reported dead by the web site      because of her conversion, was actually living a normal life.      ``What helped to change your belief in Falun Gong?'' asked a      reporter. ``Truth can never be concealed for long. I saw with      my own eyes police patiently helping educate Falun Gong      followers and trying their best to save lives of believers      who tried to commit suicide,'' said Teng.       Teng has also talked with many former Falun Gong followers      and was deeply impressed with their experiences. ``My      personal experiences made me reconsider the so-called facts      published by the cult and I completely changed my mind,''      said Teng. When asked about her conversion process, Teng      said: ``true belief conversion can never be forced.'' ``I am      pleased to shake off the spiritual shackle of the Falun Gong      cult and return to a normal life.''       Teng Chunyan is now an active member of the re-education      center dancing troupe and     is busy preparing for an upcoming art performance organized      by the center. ``I have never been abused since my detention      and have not seen any sign of beating or admonishment here.      Police in the center are very polite and kind,'' said Teng.       Jin Hua, vice director of the re-education center, said      that police in the center are required to treat every Falun      Gong follower in the center equally, and discrimination is      absolutely forbidden. Jin said: ``We encourage Falun Gong      followers to communicate with their family members. ``They      can write to or call their family members as well as meet      with relatives once a month.''       The 75-year-old father of Teng Chunyan came from      Heilongjiang Province last week to visit her and was relieved      to see his daughter regaining energy and vigor. ``I am happy      now,'' Teng said. ``Justice will finally defeat evil.''                                  ____Statement of Tracy Zhao Falun Gong practitioner and Former Detainee in                           China March 2, 2000             Hearing on ``Human Rights in China and Tibet''       Good afternoon everyone. I would like to thank the members      of this committee for the opportunity to speak at this      hearing today. I hope that my testimony will help shed some      light on what is happening right now in China regarding the      suppression of Falun Gong and the persecution of innocent      Chinese citizens.       Before I begin, I would like to briefly introduce myself.      My name is Tracy Zhao. I was born and raised in Beijing,      China. Currently, I am an American citizen residing in      Queens, New York. I am 30 years old and work as a flight      attendant. I am also a Falun Gong practitioner.       Falun Gong, also known as Falun Dafa, is a spiritual      practice based on ancient Chinese principles. It has five      sets of traditional exercises and teaches practitioners to      follow the universal virtues of ``Truth, Compassion, and      Tolerance.'' It has attracted millions of people all over the      world, because of the positive effects it has on people's      overall health and well-being.       In early February of this year, I traveled to Beijing with      a number of other practitioners. I was interested to see what      it was like for Falun Gong practitioners in China. I had      heard stories through news reports and friends, but I wanted      to get a first-hand look at what was really going on. I had      no intention of participating in any protests, nor was I      there to cause trouble. I simply wished to observe the      situation first-hand.       Shortly before midnight on February 4th, which was the      night before the Chinese New Year, I arrived at Tiananmen      Square. I saw many policemen beating and kicking Falun Dafa      practitioners, and dragging them into police vans. Many      policemen were without coats and were sweating profusely from      beating people. The practitioners were trying to peacefully      practice their meditative exercises as a way to appeal to the      government to allow them their constitutional right to      freedom of belief, assembly, and speech.       I quickly took out a camera to take a picture. The flash      caught the attention of the police and three of them      immediately pushed me into the police van without asking me      any questions. We were all taken to the nearby police      station. There were hundreds of practitioners being held      there. Some were bleeding in the face; others had bruises or      black eyes. There were children in detention, too.       These Falun Gong practitioners had not committed any      criminal acts but had only been exercising their      constitutional rights. The Chinese government claims it is a      country ruled by law, but it often violates its own laws. In      the early hours of February 5th, around 1,200 practitioners,      including myself, were taken to the Dong Cheng detention      center on the outskirts of Beijing. For 24 hours there was no      water or heat. Each of us received only two pieces of Chinese      bread for food. And we were not allowed to use the bathroom.       After 24 hours, the police questioned me and I told them I      was an American citizen. They did not believe me and sent me      to a prison cell. There were 15 other people there. Six of      them were practitioners and they told me they had been      secretly tried and had been sentenced for up a year. All they      had done was go to the government office of appeals to offer      their personal testimony to the government on how Falun Gong      had improved their health and made them better people. They      were arrested the moment they got there.       The Premier of China has recently urged the Government      Offices of Appeals to improve their operating procedures, so      that the offices would become better places for citizens to      voice their concerns without fear of retribution. But for      Falun Gong practitioners, walking into these offices is more      like walking directly into prison.       Every practitioner in my cell had been abused at some point      by the prison guards and policemen. In prison, we were given      two meals a day, and it was always two pieces of Chinese      bread with cabbage soup. At night all of us slept on one big      wooden platform, with one blanket for two people and no      pillows. It was very crowded. In the entire time I was there,      we weren't allowed to take any showers. None of the      practitioners were allowed any contact with the outside, nor      were family or relatives allowed to visit. And the families      usually also faced huge fines.       In one instance a female practitioner was trying to do the      meditative exercises. But each time she started, a prison      guard kicked her to the ground. This scene repeated itself      many times until she had been kicked into a corner. The guard      finally left her alone, and she finished her exercises.       While I was in prison, the police interrogated me and      threatened that if I didn't answer all their questions I      would be kept in prison forever. Finally, with the assistance      of the U.S. Embassy and reports made by the international      media, I was released and deported on February 12th, the      eighth day of my detainment. I was not allowed to make any      contact with anyone the entire time.       Since the ban on Falun Gong was announced on July 20th,      1999, the brutality with which this ``ban'' has been enforced      has continued to escalate. It is reported that more than      5,000 practitioners, including the elderly, pregnant women,      and young children have been sent to labor camps without      proper legal procedures--without trial, legal representation,      or due process.       In addition, more than 300 practitioners have been tried in      secret and jailed with sentences of up to 18 years. In      November, an internal government report stated that in      Beijing alone, more than 35,000 practitioners have been      detained, with many being under extremely inhumane      conditions. So far, 11 people are know to have died while in      police custody, while countless others remain unaccounted      for.       Unfortunately, as I mentioned before, the scope and      severity of this persecution continues to escalate. For      example, in January of this year the Hong Kong-based      Information Center of Human Rights and Democratic Movement in      China discovered that some Falun Gong practitioners were now      being held in mental hospitals where they were being injected      with various drugs and were subject to other tortures. This      situation has been reported in the world news by CNN, AP, and      Agency France Press, to name a few. All this is ironic in      light of the fact that The People's Daily, the state-owned      paper, published a report just last May stating that Falun      Gong is a `beneficial practice' with no political motives      that can help people improve their health. This was prior to      the current crackdown.       Other television programs drew similar conclusions back      then as well. Despite the overwhelming brutality currently      happening in China, I would like to make it clear that Falun      Gong practitioners are not against the Chinese government,      nor do they seek any particular political change or reform.      What they ask is that they regain the basic human rights to      freedom of assembly and freedom of belief, which are      protected under China's own constitution as well as under the      UN Declaration of Human Rights that China has signed.       In short, we seek your help to open a dialogue with the      Chinese government so as to peacefully resolve this crisis.      On behalf of tens of millions of Falun Gong practitioners      around the world, we want to thank Congressman Chris Smith      for introducing House Resolution 218 that condemns China's      brutal persecution of Falun Gong practitioners in China. This      House Resolution 218 was unanimously passed on November 18,      1999. I would like to personally thank the United States      government for the many steps it has taken thus far to      encourage the Chinese government to end this persecution, and      I hope you will continue to support a peaceful resolution.      Thank you.
