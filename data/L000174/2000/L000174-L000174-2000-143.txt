President, I note that each of the component parts of the Latino and Immigrant Fairness Act were filed long before July 25. Democratic Senators repeatedly asked for hearings on this proposal, and those requests were repeatedly denied.  It is not fair to say that this legislation is neither ``Latino'' nor ``fair.'' If anybody wants to know whether it is something that the Latino community wants and whether the Latino community thinks it is fair, just ask them. They will tell you the Latino fairness bill is supported by the Latino community and it is a fair bill.  I do thank my chairman, my close friend, that we are getting this through.
