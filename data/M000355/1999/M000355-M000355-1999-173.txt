 President, I rise today to pay tribute to the life of George P. Crounse, who passed away on August 22, 1999. His death marked the end of a five-decade career of entrepreneurship, community building, and philanthropy in Paducah, Kentucky.  A native of Minneapolis, Minnesota, George worked for the Tennessee Valley Authority and then Arrow Transportation Company, an Alabama firm. George served his country in the U.S. Navy during World War II, and came to Paducah in 1945, to work for Igert Towing. George realized the potential of his new hometown as a crossroads of the nation's major river ways, and Crounse Corporation began operations in 1949, when its first towboat, The Alice, began operation on the Ohio River. This was the beginning of George's dream to have his own company.  Crounse Corporation continued to grow over the years, and expanded operations to other parts of the inland waterway system. From that single boat, the Alice, grew one of the nation's largest towing companies which presently operates 25 towboats and 750 barges. Even more amazing, the only time George borrowed money for his operation was the $60,000 he borrowed to help construct that first boat. Aside from that initial loan, the Crounse Corporation balance sheets never showed debt. George continued to run the company as its chairman until only a few weeks prior to his death.  George led not only his own company to prosperity, but helped establish Paducah as a major center for river shipping, bringing economic growth and jobs to the area. His business acumen also was highly sought out in other areas such as banking. George was a firm believer in the principle of giving back to the community that had been so good to him, his family, and business. Entities such as the Paducah Public Library, Tilghman High School, and the new River Heritage Museum benefitted from George's generosity and guidance. We will probably never know the true extent of George's work to better the lives of all those in his community, and that's just the way George, a humble and modest man, would have wanted it.  George Crounse perhaps will best be remembered as a dogged advocate for education. In 1968, as a board member of Paducah Junior College, he helped bring the school into the statewide network of the University of Kentucky Community College System. George made sure that PJC retained ownershipof the property and buildings, making it the only community college in Kentucky controlled by the local community. When it appeared that the area was handicapped by the lack of an engineering school to serve college students in the area, George worked to establish an extension of the UK engineering school in Paducah. In fact, George and his wife, Eleanor, gave $4 million to help build a suitable facility to house the program. Though George was reluctant, the building was named Crounse Hall to acknowledge his leadership and generosity in bringing the dream to reality.  George's passing leaves a great void is left in Western Kentucky. His was truly a life well lived. I offer condolences to his wife of many years, Eleanor, and the entire Crounse family. I ask that my colleagues join me in honoring the achievements and contributions of this outstanding Kentuckian, and that an article from the Paducah Sun be printed in the Congressional Record.  The article follows.                   Crounse's Legacy One of Generosity                            (By Joe Walker)       People who knew barge company mogul George P. Crounse Sr.      remember him for his ceaseless giving to the Paducah area and      helping mold it into a hub of the nation's river industry.       ``I was honored to be able to tell people that George      Crounse was my friend,'' said Paducah Community College      President Len O'Hara. ``He was a wise, visionary and generous      man. There's no doubt that he did more to shape the face of      the college--both Paducah Community College and Paducah      Junior College--than any other individual.''       Mr. Crounse, 86, died at 8:24 p.m. Sunday at Western      Baptist Hospital. Friends may call at Roth Funeral Chapel      from 5 to 8 p.m. today.       Memorial services will be at 11 a.m. Wednesday at First      Presbyterian Church, where he was a member. The Rev. Lynn      Shurley will officiate. Burial will be private.       He was founder and past chairman of Crounse Corp., which he      built from a single, leased boat to one of the nation's      largest barge lines. He started the firm in 1948 after having      worked with the Tennessee Valley Authority and seen how its      dams improved navigation on the Tennessee River. He also knew      Paducah was ideally situated near the confluence of two major      rivers.       ``I had learned earlier that the Tennessee (river) is a      side street,'' be once wrote, ``and the Ohio and Mississippi      are the main highways.''       About a month ago, in failing health, Mr. Crounse became      chairman emeritus of the firm, making way for President Bill      Dibert to take over as chairman. Mr. Crounse's son, Avery, a      noted filmmaker, assumed the role of vice chairman.       My father was the first to show us to always plan for the      inevitable,'' said Avery Crounse, who returned to Paducah to      help run the business while continuing to make films. ``We've      often said that no one will fill his shoes, but several of us      will try to do that.''       The same is true for Paducah, which will miss Mr. Crounse      immeasurably, said O'Hara. ``People don't have any idea how      much he's given to this community, not only with his mind,      but also contributions of money.''       In 1968, as a member of the Paducah Junior College Board of      Trustees, Mr. Crounse fashioned the legal structure that      brought the school into the University of Kentucky community      college system while maintaining local ownership.       ``He made sure PJC retained ownership of the property and      buildings, so the community still owns the college,'' O'Hara      said. ``It's the only one in the nation that is locally      owned.''       Mr. Crounse, who told O'Hara repeatedly that higher      education was Paducah's greatest need, and his wife, Eleanor,      gave $4 million toward the PCC engineering school. But O'Hara      said Mr. Crounse was reluctant to publicize the gift or have      the school named after him and his wife.       ``I told my staff this morning that I'm so happy to have      been able to get it finished and for it to become a community      icon before his passing,'' O'Hara said.       Because of Mr. Counse's modesty, Paducahans will never know      the real extent of his beneficence, O'Hara said.       ``The (public) library owes a great deal to George Crounse.      Paducah Tilghman High School does, too, and a lot of other      less visible charities,'' he said. ``He was very quiet about      it and didn't want his named passed around, but he was always      there.''       In the 1960s, Mr. Crounse used his business savvy to boost      the growth of Peoples First Corp., which became a large,      regional banking firm before merging with Union Planters last      year Aubrey Lippert, head of Union Planters' Paducah      operation, was executive vice president when Mr. Crounse      was a Peoples board member.       ``He was probably one of the best thinkers I've seen in      being able to put together business plans and concepts and      then methodically talk through how you would execute them,''      Lippert said. ``He was always very quiet, but as we used to      say around our board table, when Mr. Crounse speaks, you need      to listen because he always has his thoughts in order.''       Lippert said Mr. Crounse's generosity began when he came to      Paducah in 1948 and continued throughout his life.       ``He was a fine family man, had a great family and I have      great admiration for Eleanor,'' Lippert said. ``He was the      kind of citizen that you would love to have as many of as you      could possibly have in the community. We'll sure miss George      Crounse.''       A native of Minneapolis, Mr. Crounse worked for TVA and      later Arrow Transportation, a river towing company in      Sheffield, Ala. After serving in the U.S. Navy in World War      II, he joined Igert Towing in late 1945 and moved to Paducah.      All along, he had a desire to form his own company.       That happened three years later when Mr. Crounse put down      $40,000 in cash and borrowed $60,000, which he said gave him      $88,000 to build his first towboat and $12,000 for working      capital. He rented a towboat to get started.       In 1949, Mr. Crounse finished construction. The Alice,      named after his aunt, and immediately starting towing      chemical barges on the Ohio River. Steady growth of the      company led to purchasing barges in 1951 and finishing a      second towboat. The Louise, in 1952. By then, coal was the      main cargo.       John Cathey remembers working on The Alice and becoming      pilot of The Louise, named after Mr. Crounse's mother. As the      firm added towboats, Mr. Crounse ran out of family names and      began naming vessels after the wives of employees like      Cathey's wife, Hazel.       ``That was a real honor at that time,'' Cathey said. ``He      was a really smart man, and he had a good relationship with      all the employees. There were times when people came in off      the boats and were troubled, and he'd talk to them.''       Cathey saw the firm grow gradually, expanding to the Green      River in 1956 and buying Clifton Towing Co. in 1959. Renamed      Southern Barge Line Corp., the Clifton operation remained a      subsidiary until 1980.       In June 1965, Crounse Corp., moved from a converted      residence into its current headquarters at 2626 Broadway. In      1969, Mr. Crounse completed another major expansion by      opening a branch in Maysville in eastern Kentucky to serve      the upper Ohio River.       Cathey remained with Crounse Corp. for nearly 30 years,      retiring as senior vice president. Aside from his initial      loan to build The Alice, Mr. Crounse ran the firm in the      black, Cathey said.       ``One of the things I always admired him for was, we never      went into debt,'' he said. ``We paid as we went.       Mr. Crounse is survived by his wife Eleanor Buchanan      Crounse; his son, Avery Crounse of Paducah; his sister,      Barbara Kleet of Naples, Fla.; nine grandchildren; and eight      great-grandchildren.       He was preceded in death by a son, George P. Crounse Jr.;      and his daughter, Virginia Cramp. His parents were Avery      Fitch Crounse and Louise Ray Crounse.
