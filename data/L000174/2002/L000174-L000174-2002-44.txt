President, last night the Senate passed, by unanimous consent, the Hatch-Leahy PROTECT Act providing important new tools to fight child pornography. I want to take a moment to speak about the passage of this important bill and the effort that it took to get to this point. Although they have recessed subject to the recall of the Speaker of the House, I also want to implore the Republican leadership in the House of Representatives not to miss this important opportunity to pass such important bipartisan legislation as this.  In April, I came to the Senate floor and joined Senator Hatch in introducing S. 2520, the PROTECT Act, after the Supreme Court's decision in Ashcroft v. Free Speech Coalition (``Free Speech''). Although there were some others who raised constitutional concerns about specific provisions in that bill, I believed--and still believe--that unlike the Administration proposal, it was a good faith effort to work within the First Amendment.  Everyone in the Senate agrees that we should do all we can to protect our children from being victimized by child pornography. That would be an easy debate and vote. The more difficult thing is to write a law that will both do that and will stick. In 1996, when we passed the Child Pornography Prevention Act, ``CPPA'', many warned us that certain provisions of that Act violated the First Amendment. The Supreme Court's recent decision in Free Speech has proven them correct.  We should not sit by and do nothing. It is important that we respond to the Supreme Court decision. It is just as important, however, that we avoid repeating our past mistakes. Unlike the 1996 CPPA, this time we should respond with a law that passes constitutional muster. Our children deserve more than a press conference on this issue. They deserve a law that will last.  It is important that we do all we can to end the victimization of real children by child pornographers, but it is also important that we pass a law that will withstand First Amendment scrutiny. We need a law with real teeth, not one with false teeth.  After joining Senator Hatch in introducing the PROTECT Act, I convened a Judiciary Committee hearing on the legislation. We heard from the Administration, from the National Center for Missing and Exploited Children, NCMEC, and from experts who came and told us that our bill, as introduced, would pass constitutional muster, but the House-passed bill would not.  I then placed S. 2520 on the Judiciary Committee's calendar for the October 8, 2002, business meeting. I continued to work with Senator Hatch to improve the bill so that it could be quickly enacted. Senator Hatch circulated a Hatch-Leahy proposed Judiciary Committee substitute that improved the bill before our October 8 business meeting. Unfortunately the Judiciary Committee was unable to consider it because of procedural maneuvering by my colleagues that had nothing to do with this important legislation, including the refusal of Committee members on the other side of the aisle to consider any pending legislation on the Committee's agenda.  I still wanted to get this bill done. That is why, for a full week in October, I worked to clear and have the full Senate pass a substitute to S. 2520 that tracked the Hatch-Leahy proposed committee substitute in nearly every area. Indeed, the substitute I offered even adopted parts of the House bill which would help the NCMEC work with local and state law enforcement on these cases. Twice, I spoke on the Senate floor imploring that we approve such legislation. As I stated then, every single Democratic Senator cleared that measure. I then urged Republicans to work on their side of the aisle to clear this measure--so similar to the joint Hatch-Leahy substitute--so that we could swiftly enact a law that would pass constitutional muster. Unfortunately, instead of working to clear that bipartisan, constitutional measure, colleagues on the other side of the aisle opted to use this issue to play politics before the election.  They redrafted the bill, changed crucial definitions, and offered a new version. Facing the recess before the mid-term elections, we were stymied again.  Even after the election, however, during our lame duck session, I have continued to work with Senator Hatch to pass this legislation through the Senate. As I had stated I would do prior to the election, I called a meeting of the Judiciary Committee yesterday. In the last meeting of the Judiciary Committee under my Chairmanship in the 107th Congress, I placed S. 2520, the Hatch-Leahy PROTECT Act, on the agenda again. At that meeting the Judiciary Committee approved this legislation, as amended. We agreed on a substitute and to improvements in the victim shield provision that I authored. Although I did not agree with two of Senator Hatch's amendments because I thought that they risked having the bill declared unconstitutional, I nevertheless both called for the Committee to approve the bill and voted for the bill in its amended form.  I then sought, that same day, to gain the unanimous consent of the full Senate to pass S. 2520 as reported by the Judiciary Committee, and I worked with Senator Hatch to clear the bill on both sides of the aisle. I am please that late last night that the Senate passed S. 2520 by unanimous consent. I want to thank Senator Hatch for his help clearing the bill for passage last night.  I am glad to have been able to work hand in hand with Senator Hatch on S. 2520, the PROTECT Act, a bill that gives prosecutors and investigators the tools they need to combat child pornography. The Hatch-Leahy PROTECT Act strives to be a serious response to a serious problem.  The provisions of the Hatch-Leahy bill, S. 2520, as we introduced it are bipartisan and good faith efforts to protect both our children and to honor the Constitution. At our hearing last month, Constitutional and criminal law scholars--one of whom was the same person who warned us last time that the CPPA would be struck down--stated that the PROTECT Act could withstand Constitutional scrutiny, although there were parts that were very close to the line.  Unfortunately these experts could not say the same about the administration's bill, which seems to challenge the Supreme Court's decision, rather than accommodate the restraints spelled out by the Supreme Court. I have also received letters from other Constitutional scholars and practitioners expressing the same conclusion, which I will place in the Record with unanimous consent. The Administration's proposal and House bill simply ignore the Supreme Court's decision and reflect an ideological response instead of a carefully drawn bill that will stand up to scrutiny.  The PROTECT Act is a good faith effort, but it is not perfect and I would have liked to have seen some additional changes to the bill. Unfortunately, I could not obtain agreement to make the following modifications:  First, regarding the tip line, I would have liked to clarify that law enforcement agents cannot ``tickle the tip line'' to avoid the key protections of the Electronic Communications Privacy Act.  Second, regarding the affirmative defense, I would have liked to ensure that there is an affirmative defense for the new category of child pornography and for all cases where a defendant can prove in court that a specific, non-obscene image was made using not any child but only actual, identifiable adults.  Nevertheless, we were able to reach agreement in Committee on modifying the bill with my amendment to the victims' shield law by giving federal judges and prosecutors the discretion to override the new victim shield law when there is good cause, such as cases where the shield law is actually used as a sword by the defendant to help assert a defense.  As a general matter, I would have thought it far simpler to take the approach of outlawing ``obscene'' child pornography of all types, which we do in one new provision that I suggested. That approach would produce a law beyond any possible challenge. This approach is also supported by the National Center for Missing and Exploited Children, which we all respect as the true expert in this field.  Following is an excerpt from the Center's answer to written questions submitted after our hearing, which I will place in the Record in its entirety:       Our view is that the vast majority (99-100%) of all child      pornography would be found to be obscene by most judges and      juries, even under a standard of beyond a reasonable doubt in      criminal cases. Even within the reasonable person under      community standards model, it is highly unlikely that any      community would not find child pornography obscene. . . .       In the post Free Speech decision legal climate the      prosecution of child pornography under an obscenity approach      is a reasonable strategy and sound policy.  Thus, according to the National Center for Missing and Exploited Children, the approach that is least likely to raise constitutional questions--using established obscenity law--is also an effective one.  Because that is not the approach we decided to use, I recognize that S. 2520 contains provisions about which some may have legitimate Constitutional questions. These provisions include:  A new ``pandering'' provision with a very wide scope;  a new definition of `obscenity' that contains some, but not all, of the elements of the Supreme Court's test;  a new affirmative defense for pornography made not using any minors that does not apply to one new category of child pornography.  These provisions raise legitimate concerns, but in the interest of making progress I am pleased, as Chairman of the Judiciary Committee, to have tried to balance all the competing interests to produce a bill with the best chance of withstanding a constitutional challenge.  That is not everyone's view. Others evidently think it is more important to make an ideological statement than to write a law. A media report just this week on this legislation noted the wide consensus that S. 2520 is more likely than the House bill to withstand scrutiny, but quoted a Republican House member as stating: ``Even if it comes back to Congress three times we will have created better legislation.''  To me, that makes no sense. Why not create the ``better legislation'' right now for today's children, instead of inviting more years of litigation and putting at risk any convictions obtained in the interim period before the Supreme Court again reviews the constitutionality of Congress' effort to address this serious problem? That is what S. 2520 seeks to accomplish as drafted.  I want to commend Senator Hatch for working with me to include many other important provisions in the Hatch-Leahy bill that we developed together and are not as controversial. These include:  A tough new private right of action for victims of child pornography with punitive damages;  a victims' shield law to keep child victim's identity out of court and prevent them from suffering a second time in the criminal process;  a new notice provision designed to stop ``surprise defenses;''  sentencing enhancements for recidivists and a directive to correct the disparity in the current sentencing guidelines that provides a lighter sentence for offenders who cross state lines to actually molest a child than for offenders who possess child pornography that has crossed State lines.  These provisions are important, practical tools to put child pornographers out of business for good and in jail where they belong.  I support S. 2520 as a good faith effort to protect our children and honor the Constitution, and the Committee substitute, which improved upon the original bill.  There were two amendments adopted in Committee to which I objected. I felt that they needlessly risked a serious constitutional challenge to a bill that already provided prosecutors the tools they needed to do their jobs. Let me discuss my opposition to two amendments offered by my good friend Senator Hatch that were adopted by voice vote by the Judiciary Committee.  Although I worked with Senator Hatch to write the new pandering provision in S. 2520, I do not support Senator Hatch's amendment, which criminalizes speech even when there is no underlying material at all--whether obscene or non-obscene, virtual or real, child or adult.  The pandering provision is an important tool for prosecutors to punish true child pornographers who for some technical reason are beyond the reach of the normal child porn distribution or production statutes. It is not meant to federally criminalize talking dirty over the internet or the telephone when the person never possesses any material at all. That is speech, and that goes too far.  The current pandering provision in S. 2520 is quite broad, and some have argued that it presents constitutional problems as written, but I thought that prosecutors needed a strong tool, so I supported Senator Hatch on the current provision.  I was heartened that Professor Schauer of Harvard, a noted First Amendment expert, testified at our hearing that he thought that the provision was Constitutional, barely.  Unfortunately, Professor Schauer has since written to me stating that this new amendment ``would push well over the constitutional edge a provision that is now up against the edge, but probably barely on the constitutional side of it.'' I will place that letter and other materials in the Record with unanimous consent of the Senate.  Because this amendment endangers the entire pandering provision, because it is unwise, and because that section is already strong enough to prosecute those who peddle child pornography, I oppose this amendment. Nevertheless, in light of the broader support for this amendment on the Committee, it was adopted over my objection.  Senator Hatch and I agree that legislation in this area is important. But regardless of our personal views, any law must be within constitutional limits or it does no good at all. Even though it is close to the line, I support S. 2520 as Senator Hatch and I introduced it in the Senate. Senator Hatch's amendment which would include all ``virtual child pornography'' in the definition of child pornography, in my view, crosses the constitutional line, however, and needlessly risks protracted litigation that could assist child pornographers in escaping punishment.  Although I joined Senator Hatch in introducing S. 2520, even when it was introduced I expressed concern over certain provisions. One such provision was the new definition of ``identifiable minor.'' When the bill was introduced, I noted that this provision might ``both confuse the statute unnecessarily and endanger the already upheld `morphing' section of the CPPA.'' I said I was concerned that it ``could present both overbreadth and vagueness problems in a later constitutional challenge.''  The Supreme Court made it clear that we can only outlaw child pornography in two situations: No. 1, it is obscene, or No. 2, it involves real kids. That is the law as stated by the Supreme Court, whether or not we agree with it.  The ``identifiable minor'' provision in S. 2520 may be used without any link to obscenity doctrine. Therefore, what saves it is that it applies to child porn made with real ``persons.'' The provision is designed to cover all sorts of images of real kids that are morphed or altered, but not something entirely made by computer, with no child involved. That is the provision as Senator Hatch and I introduced this bill.  The Hatch amendment adopted in Committee that redefined ``identifiable minor'' by creating a new category of pornography for any ``computer generated image that is virtually indistinguishable from an actual minor'' dislodged, in my view, that sole constitutional anchor. The new provision could be read to include images that never involved real children at all but were 100 percent computer generated.  That was never the goal of this provision and that was the reason it was constitutional. There are other provisions in the bill that deal with obscene virtual child pornography that I support. This provision was intended to ease the prosecutor's burden in cases where images of real children were cleverly altered to avoid prosecution.  I support the definition of `identifiable minor' as we originally wrote and introduced it. Because Senator Hatch's amendment seriously weakened the constitutional argument supporting this entire provision, I opposed it. Nevertheless, given the broader support for this amendment on the Judiciary Committee it was been adopted, over my objection and I still sought passage of the bill, which we achieved last night.  Even though S. 2520 is not perfect, I was glad that I was able to work with Senator Hatch to secure its approval last night. I had hoped that the House of Representatives would adopt the bill before they recessed for the end of the year. That way, we could have sent a bill to the President for his signature right now. Instead, the House of Representatives' Republican leadership decided to adjourn without either taking up the Hatch-Leahy bill or working with us to resolve any differences. I hope that the House leadership will reconsider this decision and consider this measure, rather than start all over again in the next Congress. It is certainly unfortunate that the House Republican leadership would rather adjourn for a recess than take the opportunity to pass a bipartisan bill which passed the Senate unanimously.  As I have explained, I believe that this issue is so important that I have been willing to compromise and to support a measure even though I do not agree with each and every provision that it contains. That is how legislation is normally passed. Again, however, I fear that some in the Administration and the House have decided to play politics with this issue that is so important to our nation's children. I urge them to reconsider their ``take it or leave it approach'' and consider the Hatch-Leahy PROTECT Act--or at least come back to discuss our differences.  I ask unanimous consent that the letters and materials to which I referred be printed in the Record.  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in the Record, as follows:                                            University of Virginia                                                School of Law,                                              Charlottesville, VA.     Senator Patrick J. Leahy,     Chairman, Senate Committee on the Judiciary, Washington, DC.       Dear Chairman Leahy: On October 2, 2002, I testified before      the Senate Judiciary Committee concerning S. 2520 and H.R.      4623. Each of these bills was drafted in response to Ashcroft      v. Free Speech Coalition, 122 S. Ct. 1389 (2002), in which      the Supreme Court threw out key provisions of the federal      child pornography laws. As I stated in my testimony, the new      sections contained in S. 2520 have been carefully tailored      with an eye towards satisfying the precise concerns      identified by the Supreme Court. Recently, Senator Hatch      offered an amendment in the nature of a substitute to S. 2520      (hereinafter ``the Hatch Substitute''). I have examined the      Hatch Substitute, and I believe that it contains a definition      of child pornography that is nearly identical to the      definition rejected by Free Speech Coalition. Therefore, the      Hatch substitute is unlikely to survive constitutional      challenge in the federal courts, and the Committee should      decline to adopt it.       As you know, each of these bills contains some complicated      provisions, including especially their definition sections.      As you also     know, this complexity is unavoidable, for the Congress aims      to intervene in and eliminate some of the complex law      enforcement problems created by the phenomenon of virtual      pornography. In the following comments, I will try to state      my concerns about the Hatch Substitute as concisely as      possible, while identifying the statutory nuances that are      likely to generate significant constitutional questions in      the event that the Hatch Substitute is enacted.       In Free Speech Coalition, the Supreme Court scrutinized      provisions of the Child Pornography Prevention Act of 1996      (``CPPA'') that were designed to eliminate obstacles to law      enforcement created by virtual child pornography. The      proliferation of virtual pornography has enabled child      pornographers to escape conviction by arguing that it is so      difficult to distinguish the virtual child from the real one      that (1) the government cannot carry its burden of proving      that the pornography was made using real children and/or (2)      the government cannot carry its burden of providing scineter      because the defendants believed that the images in their      possession depicted virtual children, rather than real ones.      In order to foreclose these arguments, the CPPA defined      ``child pornography'' broadly so that it extended not only to      a sexually-explicit image that had been produce using a real      minor, but also to an image that ``appears to be of a minor''      engaging in sexually-explicit conduct. Free Speech Coalition      rejected this definition of First Amendment grounds. The      Court reaffirmed the holding of New York v. Ferber, 458 U.S.      747 (1982), under which the government is free to regulate      sexually-explicit materials produced using real minors      without regard to the value of those materials. However, the      Court refused to extend the Ferber analysis to sexually-     explicit materials that only appear to depict minors. The      court noticed that many mainstream movies, as well as works      of great artistic, literary, and scientific significance,      explore the sexuality of adolescents and children. Such      works, including ones that are sexually explicit, are      valuable in the eyes of the community, and, as long as      their production involves no real children, such works are      protected by the First Amendment against governmental      regulation.       In Free Speech Coalition, the Supreme court expressly      considered and rejected a number of arguments made by the      Solicitor General on behalf of the CPPA definition. One of      these arguments was that the ``speech prohibited by the CPPA      is virtually indistinguishable from child pornography, which      may be banned without regard to whether it depicts works of      value.'' In his opinion for the Court, Justice Kennedy      explained that this argument fundamentally misconceived the      nature of the First Amendment inquiry. Materials that satisfy      the Ferber definition are regulable not because they are      necessarily without value; to the contrary, Ferber itself      recognized that some child pornography might have significant      value. Indeed, the Court there reasoned that the ban on the      use of actual children was permissible in part because      virtual images--by definition, images ``virtually      indistinguishable'' from child pornography--were an available      and lawful alternative. Hence, as Justice Kennedy put it:      ``Ferber, then, not only referred to the distinction between      actual and virtual child pornography, it relied on [the      distinction] as a reason supporting its holding. Ferber      provides no support for a statute that eliminate the      distinction and makes the alternative mode criminal as      well.''       S. 2520 aims to reform the CPPA in ways that are sensitive      to these First Amendment value judgments. By contrast, the      Hatch Substitute proposes that the Congress should reenact a      definition that is almost identical to the one that the      Supreme Court just rejected. In the Hatch Substitute, the      definition of child pornography would cover, among other      things, sexually-explicit materials whose production involved      the use of an ``identifiable minor.'' The Hatch Substitute      defines ``identifiable minor'' as including a ``computer or      computer generated image that is virtually indistinguishable      from an actual minor.'' As I explained above, the Solicitor      General suggested in Free Speech Coalition that the First      Amendment would be satisfied if the Supreme Court limited the      CPPA to depictions that are ``virtually indistinguishable''      from child pornography, and the Court rejected that      interpretation. To put it mildly, it is hard to imagine that      the Supreme Court would be inclined to view the Hatch      Substitute as a good faith legislative responses to Free      Speech Coalition when all it does is reenact a definition      that the Court there expressly considered and disapproved.      You will notice that I here am paraphrasing the definition      provisions in the Hatch Substitute and omitting some of their      complexity. In particular, the Hatch Substitute provides a      further definition of the phrase ``virtually      indistinguishable,'' requiring that the quality of the      depiction be determined from the viewpoint of an ``ordinary      person'' and providing an exception for ``drawings, cartoons,      sculptures, or paintings.'' But neither the definition of      ``identifiable minor'' nor these refinements of ``virtually      indistinguishable'' are calculated to satisfy the concerns      raised in Free Speech Coalition. As Justice Kennedy explained      for the Court, an absolute ban on pornography made with real      children is compatible with First Amendment rights precisely      because computer-generated images are an available      alternative, and, yet, the Hatch Substitute proposed to      forbid the computer-generated alternative as well. Likewise,      an exception for cartoons and so forth is insensitive to the      Supreme Court's commitment to protect realistic portrayals of      child sexuality, a commitment that is clearly expressed in      the Court's recognition of the value of (among other things)      mainstream movies such as Traffic and American Beauty.       In this regard, you will notice that the Hatch Substitute      closely resembles some of the defective provisions of H.R.      4623, which would prohibit virtual child porn that is      ``indistinguishable'' from porn produced with real minors.      Unlike S. 2520, both H.R. 4623 and the Hatch Substitute seem      to embody a decision merely to endorse the unconstitutional      portions of the CPPA all over again. The Committee should      refuse to engage in such a futile and disrespectful exercise.      The law enforcement problems posed by virtual pornography are      not symbolic but real, and the Congress should make a real      effort to solve them. In my judgment, S. 2520 is a real      effort to solve them, and the Committee should use S. 2520 as      the basis for correcting the CPPA.       The Hatch Substitute contains additional innovations that      the Committee should study carefully. Because this letter      already is too long, I will allude to only one of them here.      The ``pandering'' provision set forth in the Hatch Substitute      contains some language that strikes me as being both vague      and unnecessarily broad, and the provision therefore is      likely to attract unfavorable attention in the federal      courts. The Hatch pandering provision would punish anyone who      ``advertises, promotes, presents, distributes, or solicits .      . . any material or purported material in a manner that      conveys the impression that the material or purported      material'' is child pornography. To be completely candid, I      am not sure that I understand what problems would be solved      by defining the items that may not be pandered so that they      include not only actual ``material,'' but also ``purported      material.'' I suppose that there might be cases where a      person offers to sell pornographic materials that do not      actually exist and that the person might make the offer in a      manner that violates the pandering prohibition. If that is      the problem that the drafters of the Hatch Substitute have in      mind, it seems that they might solve that problem more      cleanly by adding the word ``offers'' to the list of      forbidden conduct and deleting the references to ``purported      material.'' (In other words, the provision would punish      anyone who ``advertises, offers, promotes, presents,      distributes, or solicits through the mails . . . any material      in a manner that conveys the impression that the material''      is child pornography.) If that is not the problem that the      Hatch Substitute has in mind, I would suggest that the      drafters identify the problem precisely and develop language      that is clearer and narrower than the phrase ``purported      material,'' for that ambiguous term is likely to generate      First Amendment concerns that otherwise could and should be      avoided.           Respectfully yours,                                                 Anne M. Coughlin,     Class of 1948 Research Professor of Law.                                  ____                                    The Communitarian Network,                                 Washington, DC, October 11, 2002.     Hon. Patrick J. Leahy,     Chairman, U.S. Senate, Committee on the Judiciary,          Washington, DC.       Dear Chairman Leahy: I want to thank you for your efforts      to protect American children by filling the gap left by the      Supreme Court's decision to strike down the Child Pornography      Prevention Act. Ashcroft v. Free Speech Coalition dealt a      blow to those who appreciate the important role the federal      government must play in protecting young people from those      who would exploit them. Your efforts to craft a bill, the      PROTECT Act, that will withstand Constitutional scrutiny      deserves the public's applause.       I would like to draw your attention to a similar, but      separate, matter that also reflects on the health and      security of our children in regards to pornography. Like the      Child Pornography Prevention Act, the Child Internet      Protection Act (CIPA), which was passed by the 106th      Congress, has been struck down by the federal judiciary. In      American Library Association, et al. v. United States of      America, et al, a District Court in Pennsylvania threw CIPA      out, arguing that its efforts to prevent children from      exposure to harmful material on school and library computers      amounted to a violation of the First Amendment. The Justice      Department has appealed that case to the Supreme Court, where      the lower court's decision will very likely be upheld.      Unfortunately, as Harvard Law School professor Frederick      Schauer testified at the hearing you recently held on CPPA,      ``constitutionally suspect legislation under existing Supreme      Court interpretation of the First Amendment, whatever we may      think of the wisdom and accuracy of those interpretations,      puts the process of [prosecution] . . . on hold while the . .      . courts proceed at their own slow pace.''       I think we ought not wait for what will likely be a      disappointing conclusion. Rather, I hope you will lead an      effort to craft new legislation which (1) passes      Constitutional muster, and (2) better enables schools and      libraries to protect children from harmful images and      websites. Let me take a moment to delimit how exactly a new,      improved Children's Internet Protection Act would differ from      the bill passed by the 106th Congress.       First, a new bill should distinguish clearly between      measures affecting adults and minors. Though the title of the      legislation is     the Children's Internet Protection Act, it requires      technology protection measures on all computers with Internet      access, regardless of the age of the patron using each      computer. If the aim is to protect minors, it is unnecessary      to put filters on every computer in a library. This, of      course, was one of the District Court's primary concerns. I      hope you will draft legislation requiring separate computers      for adults and minors. All those under 18 should be required      to use filtered computers, unless accompanied by a parent or      teacher. Those over 18 should have access to un-filtered      computers in a separate area. In smaller facilities, where      only one computer is available, special adult hours could be      set during which the filter is disabled and only adults may      use the computer. The rest of the time a filter would be in      place.       Second, I would encourage you to incorporate language that      distinguishes children 12 and under from teenagers 13-18.      Teenagers have greater capacities to process information than      children, as well as different needs for information. In      recognition of this, I would hope that your new bill would      require different policies for children and teenagers, such      as providing different filter settings.       Third, I hope you will consider expanding the scope of your      bill to include provisions that protect minors from violent      images as well as sexual ones. I realize that limiting the      access of children to violent content poses a potentially      more difficult constitutional question, but based on the      weight of social science evidence showing the harm caused to      children by violence in the media, I believe that violence      must be included in any definition of content that is      ``harmful to children.''       To further explain the reasoning behind these      recommendations, I am enclosing a law review article, ``On      Protecting Children from Speech,'' which will be published      next fall in the Chicago-Kent Law Review. I would welcome the      opportunity to discuss our position with you further. In the      meantime, please feel free to contact Marc Dunkelman,      Assistant Director of the Communitarian Network, with any      questions. Thank you for your consideration.           Sincerely,     Amitai Etzioni.                                  ____                                                     May 13, 2002.     Chairman Patrick J. Leahy,     U.S. Senate Judiciary Committee     Washington, D.C.       Dear Chairman Leahy: We write to express our grave concern      with the legislation recently proposed by the Department of      Justice in response to the Supreme Court's decision in      Ashcroft, et al. v. The Free Speech Coalition, et al., No.      00-795 (Apr. 16, 2002). In particular, the proposed      legislation purports to ban speech that is neither obscene      nor unprotected child pornography (indeed, the bill expressly      targets images that do not involve real human being at all).      Accordingly, in our view, it suffers from the same      infirmities that led the Court to invalidate the statute at      issue in Ashcroft.       We emphasize that we share the revulsion all Americans feel      toward those who harm children, and fully support legitimate      efforts to eradicate child pornography. As the Court in      Ashcroft emphasized, however, in doing so Congress must act      within the limits of the First Amendment. In our view, the      bill proposed by the Department of Justice fails to do so.           Respectfully submitted,       Jodie L. Kelley, Partner, Jenner & Block, LLC; Washington,      DC.

Re S. 2520.     Hon. Patrick Leahy,     U.S. Senate, Committee on the Judiciary, Washington, DC.       Dear Senator Leahy: Following up on my written statement      and on my oral testimony before the Committee on Wednesday,      October 2, 2002, the staff of the Committee has asked me to      comment on the constitutional implications of changing the      current version of S. 2520 to change the word ``material'' in      section 2 of the bill (page 2, lines 17 and 19) to      ``purported material.''       In my opinion the change would push well over the      constitutional edge a provision that is now right up against      that edge, but probably barely on the constitutional side of      it.       As I explained in my statement and orally, the Supreme      Court has from the Ginzburg decision in 1966 to the Hamling      decision in 1973 to the Free Speech Coalition decision in      2002 consistently refused to accept that ``pandering'' may be      an independent offense, as opposed to being evidence of the      offense of obscenity (and, by implication, child      pornography). The basic premise of the pandering prohibition      in S. 2520 is thus in some tension with more than thirty-five      years of Supreme Court doctrine. What may save the provision,      however, is the fact that pandering may also be seen as      commercial advertisement, and the commercial advertisement of      an unlawful product or service is not protected by the      Supreme Court's commercial speech doctrine, as the Court made      clear in both Virginia Pharmacy and also in Pittsburgh Press      v. Human Relations Commission 413 U.S. 376 (1973). It is      important to recognize, however, that this feature of      commercial speech doctrine does not apply to non-commercial      speech, where the description or advocacy of illegal acts is      fully protected unless under the narrow circumstances, not      applicable here, of immediate incitement.       The implication of this is that moving away from      communication that could be described as an actual commercial      advertisement decreases the availability of this approach to      defending Section 2 of S. 2520. Although it may appear as if      advertising ``material'' that does not exist at all      (``purported material'') makes little difference, there is a      substantial risk that the change moves the entire section      away from the straight commercial speech category into more      general description, conversation, and perhaps even advocacy.      Because the existing arguments for the constitutionality of      this provision are already difficult ones after Free Speech      Coalition, anything that makes this provision less like a      straight offer to engage in a commercial transaction      increases the degree of constitutional jeopardy. By including      ``purported'' in the relevant section, the pandering looks      less commercial, and thus less like commercial speech, and      thus less open to the constitutional defense I outlined in my      written statement and oral testimony.       I hope that this is helpful.           Yours sincerely,                                            Frederick Schauer,                                    Frank Stanton Professor of the     First Amendment.                                  ____                                     The Media Coalition Inc.,                                 New York, NY, September 23, 2002.     Re S. 2520 and H.R. 4623.     Sentor Patrick J. Leahy,     Chairman, Committee on the Judiciary, Washington, DC     Sen. Orrin G. Hatch,     Ranking Republican Member, Committee on the Judiciary,          Washington, DC       Dear Senators Leahy and Hatch: I am General Counsel of The      Media Coalition, a trade association whose members represent      most of the publishers, booksellers, librarians, periodical      wholesalers and distributors, movie, recording and video game      manufacturers, and recording and video retailers in the      United States. While Media Coalition and its members      unanimously deplore child pornography and support prosecution      of offenders, they are also concerned that the dictates of      the First Amendment remain inviolate, even as to material      that one finds to be offensive.       The Media Coalition and its members believe that the      various attempts to respond to the decision in Ashcroft v.      Free Speech Coalition, 122 S.Ct. 1389 (2002), are      unconstitutional and problematic in a number of respects, as      described below.                                S. 2520       1. As to proposed Sec. 2252A(a)(3)(B)--the ``pandering''      provision--it seems to criminalize commercial fraud as child      pornography. Ginzburg v. U.S., 383 U.S. 463 (1966), held only      that pandering could convert borderline non-obscene material      into obscenity. (``Where the purveyor's sole emphasis is on      the sexually provocative aspects of his publications, that      fact may be decisive in the determination of obscenity.'')      This goes must further. It applies without regard to the      nature or quality of the material ``pandered''.       2. Proposed Sec. 2252A(c) adds an affirmative defense that,      for computer-generated images, each pictured person was an      adult and, for virtual child pornography, it was not produced      using any actual minor. With respect to non-virtual child      pornography, this results in a reversal of the usual burden      of proof. IN a prosecution for traditional child pornography      (e.g., as defined in Sec. 2256(8)(A)), one of the elements of      the crime that the government must prove is that the      production of the material involved the use of a minor.      Further, under United States v. X-Citement Video, Inc.,      513U.S. 64 (1994), in the case of a librarian, retailer or      distributor, the government must prove that he or she knew      that the material was of an actual minor. This proposal      impermissibly and unconstitutionally shifts this burden.       With respect to virtual child pornography, there are      similar constitutional problems. The Supreme Court in Free      Speech Coalition found that the evil in child pornography,      and the basis for excluding it from First Amendment      protection, is the unlawful conduct vis-a-vis an actual      child. Thus, the Court held that, unless an actual child is      used and thus abused in the creation of the material, there      can be no crime as to otherwise First Amendment-protected      material. The government must provide this necessary factual      predicate. To shift the burden of proof as to this      necessary element of the crime to the defendant is      unconstitutional, even putting aside the often impossible      task of proving the negative--that no child was used.       3. S. 2520 also amends the record-keeping provisions, which      themselves have had a checkered constitutional history,      having     been held unconstitutional (ALA v. Thornburgh, 713 F. Supp.      469 (D.D.C. 1989)), revised in 1990, again held      unconstitutional by the District Court (ALA v. Barr, 794 F.      Supp. 412 (D.D.C. 1992)), held constitutional, although      certain regulations were invalidated (ALA v. Reno. 33 F. 3d      78 (D.C. Cir. 1994)), and subsequently the Tenth Circuit has      held a regulation more central to the regulatory scheme      unconstitional (Sundance Assocs. Inc. v. Reno, 139 F. 3d 804      (10th Cir. 1998)). Throughout, however, the records kept have      been barred from use in prosecutions other than for the      failure to keep the records.       S. 2520 would permit the use of the recordkeeping records      in a child pornography prosecution. However, requiring      producers to maintain records at the risk of criminal      liability for not doing so, which records can be used against      them in a child pornography prosecution, violates the      constitutional prohibition against mandatory self-     incrimination.       4. Finally, there is a provision in Section 9 creating a      new Sec. 2252A(f), which is particularly pernicious. It      permits a person aggrieved by reason of child pornography to      commence a civil action for injunction relief and      compensatory and punitive damages. First, it is vague, since      both the grievance and the person aggrieved are apparently in      unlimited, undefined categories; and the potential civil      defendant is in another unlimited, undefined category.      Moreover, apparently a defendant is liable whether or not he      or she knows of the minority of the child. And, since it      applies to both the pandering and ``appears to be'' prongs of      the statute, there may be civil liability even when no child      is involved.       Most important, it opens a Pandora's Box. Under state law,      a person using a minor to create child pornography is not      only criminally liable, but is also liable to the child whom      he or she has used. But to open the protected class to      parents, spouses, etc. and the defendant class to      distributors, retailers, etc. is inappropriate and ultimately      harmful to legitimate First Amendment interests. It raises      the specter of the Pornography Victims Compensation Act,      which raised such an outcry that it failed to pass Congress.                               h.r. 4623       A. Section 3(a) of the Bill criminalizes as child      pornography computer images as long as they are, or are      indistinguishable from, actual child pornography. The      majority in Free Speech Coalition clearly held that unless      material either meets the Ferber test, which protects      children exploited in the production process, or is obscene      under, Miller v. California, it is protected by the First      Amendment. Like the material covered by the unconstitutional      CPPA, the material described in the ``indistinguishable      from'' portion of section 3(a) does not involve or harm any      children in the production process. Thus, section 3(a) is      unconstitutional under Free Speech Coalition.       B. Section 3(c) of the Bill provides an affirmative defense      to a child pornography prosecution that no actual child was      involved in the creation of the material. Thus, despite      section 3(a) discussed above, the Bill actually permits      computer-generated sexually explicit depictions of minors      (other than pre-pubescent minors and computer morphing which      appears as an identifiable minor), if the defendant meets the      burden of proving the affirmative defense. (Curiously, the      provision limiting the defense excludes material defined in      Sec. 2256(8)(A), i.e., that which used an actual minor in its      production. Read plainly, that suggests that in a non-     computer child pornography case, one cannot escape liability      by proving that only adults were photographed. It is unlikely      that this is what was intended.)       As Justice Kennedy, writing for the Court, says in Free      Speech Coalition (122 S.Ct. at 1404), shifting the burden of      proof on an element of the crime raises serious      constitutional issues. In fact, in the First Amendment      context, we believe that shift is unconstitutional; among      other things, it violates Smith v. California, 361 U.S. 147,      153 (1959) in that it eliminates the requirement that the      government prove knowledge of minority by shifting the burden      of proof to the defendant. Thus, defendant must prove a      negative--that no children were used--a difficult chore,      particularly if the computer programmer-designer is not      available or known to the defendant. Finally, under United      States vs. X-Citement Video, Inc., 513 U.S. 64 (1994), in the      case of a librarian, retailer or distributor, the government      must prove that he or she knew that the material was of an      actual minor This proposal impermissibly and      unconstitutionally shifts this burden.       C. Section 4 creates a crime of pandering child      pornography, defined as the sale or offer of material      intending to cause the purchaser or offeree to believe that      the material is child pornography, whether it is or not.      Similarly, one who accepts or attempts to receive or purchase      material, believing it to be child pornography (whether or      not it is such), is also guilty of this new crime. This, in      effect, transforms consumer fraud into a felony. Once could      be selling copies of Mary Poppins or the Bible, but if one      intends to cause the buyer to believe that the book contains      a visual depiction of a minor engaging in sexual conduct, it      is a felony. In fact, the Bill goes one step further and      provides that the crime can be committed even though no      person actually provides, sells, receives, purchases,      possesses or produces any visual depiction (e.g., selling an      empty box). In effect, it criminalizes the intent to market      or to procure child pornography if some action is taken to      effectuate that desire, even if the material actually is not      child pornography. As discussed above, this seems to go      significantly further than Ginzburg v. U.S. permits and is      therefore likely unconstitutional.       D. The first portion of section 5 of the Bill (new 18 USC      Sec. 1466A) provides that computer images of persons      indistinguishable from pre-pubescent children in sexually      explicit conduct are punishable as child pornography. (A pre-     pubescent child is defined as a child whose ``physical      development indicates'' the child is 12 or younger, or who      ``does not exhibit significant pubescent physical or sexual      maturation.'' ``Indistinguishable'' is defined as ``virtually      indistinguishable, in that . . . an ordinary person . . .      would conclude that the depiction is of an actual minor''      engaging in sexual acts. Drawings, cartoons, sculptures and      paintings are excluded.) This is based on Justice O'Connor's      distinction between virtual youthful-adult and virtual-child      pornography. However, there appears to be no requirement      under 1466A that minors were involved in the creation of the      depiction. Thus, it falls under Free Speech Coalition.       E. The second part of Sec. 5 of the Bill is new Sec. 1466B,      which appears to be similar to Sec. 1466A except it does not      have the ``indistinguishable'' concept and it does apply to      drawings, cartoons, sculptures and paintings. Thus it seems      directly contrary to the Free Speech Coalition holding,      differing only in its limited application only to depictions      of younger children (i.e., 12 and under). Further, it appears      that material covered by Sec. 1466A is a subset of that      covered by Sec. 1466B, and would be covered by both.       Media Coalition and its members urge you and the other      members of the Judiciary Committee not to approve either of      these bills. Not only are they clearly unconstitutional, but      passage of either bill would result in constitutional      challenges that could be exploited by person charged with      possession of actual child pornography.           Sincerely yours,                                             Michael A. Bamberger,     General Counsel.                          ____________________
