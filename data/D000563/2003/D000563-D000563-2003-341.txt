President, in the remaining few seconds I have under the unanimous consent agreement, I urge my colleagues on both sides of the aisle to help us. We heard from the President the other night. We need to rally as a nation to put up our resources where we made our commitment in Iraq. We made a commitment, as well, through the President and through the Senate, to deal with the global AIDS crisis.  Frankly, I think it would be difficult for us to explain how we can find $87 billion in Iraq and not find the $3 billion that the President promised to the world, and we in the Senate stood behind him by a vote of 78 in favor to support. This will be our chance to do it.  When we do it, we will be able to look back at this moment as not only doing the right thing, but doing something very important for generations to come.  I yield the floor.
