 President, this week, the Senate will bid a fond farewell to the director of its Employee Assistance Program, Christy Prietsch.  Christy is retiring after more than a decade of dedicated service in the Senate. She has made quite an impression since coming here in 2004. Senate employees know Christy as a warm and inviting person they can go to whenever they need someone to talk to. She is experienced in helping others overcome obstacles both personal and professional, and it is clear that her care and concern for the Senate community is as genuine as it is deep.  But for Christy, we also know that such a fulsome commitment to serving the Senate has meant spending less time with her husband and her son than she would like. So we hope this decision to retire will give Christy theopportunity to see more of her family. We also hope that, after helping so many others for so many years--not only in the Senate, but before that in agencies such as the Secret Service and Department of Justice--Christy will have a little more time to pursue her own passions too.  So the Senate sends its thanks to this dedicated professional who has touched the lives of many, Christy Prietsch, and we wish her well in retirement.                          ____________________
