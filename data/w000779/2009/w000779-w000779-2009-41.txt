President, let me pick up on the point made by the Senator from North Dakota because he is very accurate in his assessment.  One of the reasons they like so much this idea of trying to set up a model as we have in the Congress, with our exchanges, is because, for example, somebody who is working for the Forest Service in the State of Oregon has essentially the same kinds of choices I have for the Wyden family.  I think Senator Dorgan's point about trying to make clear to the American people that these choices Members of Congress have, somebody, for example, who works for the Forest Service in Oregon, has essentially the same choices, which involve basic health care--what we think of as preventive care, primary care, being able to go see a doctor, being able to get hospital coverage, and a reasonable catastrophic benefit. That is what Members of Congress can essentially choose from, and that is what somebody has an opportunity to get if they work at the Forest Service.  I think Senator Dorgan's point is very valid.
