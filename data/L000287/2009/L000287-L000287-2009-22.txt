Mr. Speaker, I rise to thank Chairman Oberstar and members of the Transportation and Infrastructure Committee for moving with all deliberate speed to bring this resolution to the floor today.  As many of you know, for the past week it has been raining all over the State of Georgia. In some parts of the State, the rain has been devastating. I offer this resolution with my colleagues from the State of Georgia to express my sincerest sympathies to the families of those who have lost their loved ones in the floods. This is a terrible tragedy for the people of the State of Georgia. Some families have lost their homes; they have lost everything.  I am deeply concerned about the damage this flooding has caused to homes and businesses, to roads and bridges. Some schools in the State remain closed, and at least one school has been destroyed. The Governor is estimating that the damage will rise into the hundreds of millions of dollars, and that is based on what can be seen. Many areas are still underwater, and we hear that the rain is not yet over.  I appeal to the citizens of Georgia to be careful as you move around. It is impossible to know how deep the waters are or how fast they are moving.  Finally, I want to thank all of the emergency personnel for all of their hard work in protecting people from the dangers of the floodwaters.  I know that my colleagues join me in my commitment to working with the State, city and county officials, as well as FEMA and the Federal Government, to ensure that the State of Georgia has everything it needs to protect human life and to help our citizens rebuild and recover from these unbelievable waters, this unbelievable flood.  Mr. Speaker, I urge all Members of this body to support this resolution.
