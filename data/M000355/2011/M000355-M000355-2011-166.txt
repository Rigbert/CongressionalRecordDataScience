 President, let me say to my good friend, I am prepared to vote on the President's proposal today. If the majority leader wants to vote on it some other day, we can talk about that, about how to move forward with it. But the President has been repeatedly asking us to take it up and vote on it now, and I am prepared to do that. With regard to taking it up some other time and voting on it some other day, we will be happy to talk about that off the floor, as we do frequently on every issue we deal with.
