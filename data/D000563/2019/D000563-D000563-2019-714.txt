SHORT TITLE.       This Act may be cited as the ``Forcing Limits on Abusive      and Tumultuous Prices'' or the ``FLAT Prices Act''.     SEC. 2. REDUCED MARKET EXCLUSIVITY.       (a) Penalty.--If the manufacturer of a prescription drug      approved under section 505 of the Federal Food, Drug, and      Cosmetic Act (21 U.S.C. 355) or licensed under section 351 of      the Public Health Service Act (42 U.S.C. 262) increases the      price of such drug as described in subsection (b), any      remaining period of market exclusivity with respect to such      drug shall be reduced as follows:       (1) With respect to any price increase described in      subsection (b), such market exclusivity shall be reduced by      180 days.       (2) For every 5 percent price increase over the 10 percent,      18 percent, or 25 percent, respectively, threshold price      increases described in subsection (b), such market      exclusivity shall be reduced for an additional 30-days.       (b) Price Increase.--A price increase described in this      subsection is an increase in the wholesale acquisition cost      (as defined in section 1847A(c)(6)(B) of the Social Security      Act (42 U.S.C. 1395w-3a(c)(6)(B))) of a prescription drug of      more than 10 percent over a 1-year period, more than 18      percent over a 2-year period, or more than 25 percent over a      3-year period.       (c) Report on Price Increase.--       (1) In general.--A drug manufacturer that increases the      price of a prescription drug as described in subsection (b)      shall report such increase to the Secretary of Health and      Human Services (referred to in this section as the      ``Secretary'') within 30 days of meeting the criteria for a      price increase under such subsection.       (2) Failure to submit report.--In the case of a drug      manufacturer that does not submit a report required under      paragraph (1) within the 30-day period described in such      paragraph, in addition to the penalty under subsection (a),      the period of market exclusivity with respect to such drug      shall be reduced by 30 days for each day after the due date      of the report until the report is submitted.       (d) Waiver.--The Secretary may waive, or decrease, the      reduction in the period of market exclusivity that would      otherwise apply under subsection (a) with respect to a      prescription drug if--       (1) the manufacturer of such drug submits--       (A) a report under subsection (c)(1); and       (B) an application for such a waiver, at such time, in such      manner, and containing such information as the Secretary may      require; and       (2) based upon the information in such application, the      Secretary determines that--       (A) the price increase is necessary to enable production of      the drug, does not unduly restrict patient access to the drug      , and does not negatively impact public health; and       (B) such waiver or decrease constitutes a deviation from      the reduction in market exclusivity that would otherwise      apply under subsection (a) only to the extent necessary to      achieve drug production objectives.       (e) Period of Market Exclusivity.--For purposes of this      section, the term ``period of market exclusivity'' means any      period of market exclusivity granted with respect to a      prescription drug under clause (ii), (iii), or (iv) of      section 505(c)(3)(E) of the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic      Act (21 U.S.C. 355(c)(3)(E)), section 505(j)(5)(B)(iv) of      such Act, clause (ii), (iii), or (iv) of section 505(j)(5)(F)      of such Act, or paragraphs (6) or (7) of section 351(k) of      the Public Health Service Act (42 U.S.C. 262(k)).                          ____________________
