President, I ask unanimous consent that the following bill, the Eliminate Colorectal Cancer Act, be printed in the Record.  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the Record, as follows:                                S. 2265       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of      the United States of America in Congress assembled,     SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE; FINDINGS.       (a) Short Title.--This Act may be cited as the ``Eliminate      Colorectal Cancer Act of 2004''.       (b) Findings.--The Congress finds the following:       (1) Colorectal cancer is the second leading cause of cancer      deaths in the United States for men and women combined.       (2) It is estimated that in 2004, 146,940 new cases of      colorectal cancer will be diagnosed in men and women in the      United States.       (3) Colorectal cancer is expected to kill 56,730      individuals in the United States in 2004.       (4) When colorectal cancer is diagnosed early, at a      localized stage, more than 90 percent of patients survive for      5 years or more. Once the disease has metastasized, 92      percent of patients die within 5 years. Yet, only 37 percent      of colorectal cancer cases are diagnosed while the disease is      still in the localized stage.       (5) If all men and women age 50 and over practiced regular      colorectal cancer screening, without any new scientific      discoveries, the United States could see up to a 50 to 90      percent reduction in deaths from this disease.       (6) Currently, many private insurance health plans are not      providing coverage for the full range of colorectal cancer      screening tests. Lack of insurance coverage can act as a      barrier to care.       (7) Assuring coverage for the full range of colorectal      cancer tests is an important step in increasing screening      rates for these life saving tests.     SEC. 2.
