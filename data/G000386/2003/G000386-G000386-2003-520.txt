 President, as I said yesterday, we are willing to extend current unemployment benefits. We are willing to do it before the end of the week. In fact, yesterday I offered a unanimous consent request to accomplish this, and it was rejected on the other side.  We have Senator Murkowski standing by ready to offer a unanimous consent request to extend unemployment benefits. This amendment is overreaching. This amendment would go way beyond anything we have done on unemployment at a level of 6 percent right now. In fact, this makes it as high as when unemployment was at 8 percent. We are asked to deal with an amendment that goes way too far to score political points. That is why it should be rejected.  I raise the point on this amendment that the language is not germane to the measure before the Senate.
