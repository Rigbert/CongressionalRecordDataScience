It points out that it is a sad reality for Federal authorities that they cannot cut off pornographers without forcing the middleman--the on-line services of the United States--to do the work of censorship.

The article notes a listing for ``Femmes, Femmes, Femmes'', a French word for women. If you call up the listing, it is a catalog to the Louvre in Paris. Somebody has a sense of humor. But it gives everyone an idea. Is this person suddenly going to be under investigation because of his or her sense of humor?

There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in the Record, as follows:                       Supporters of Leahy Study       Association of American Publishers (AAP).
