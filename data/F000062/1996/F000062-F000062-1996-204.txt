 It would--  First, prohibit health insurers from conditioning the sale or terms of health insurance on genetic information of the insured or applicant for insurances; and  Second, prohibit health insurers from requiring an applicant for insurance or an individual or family member presently covered to take a genetic test or to be subjected to questions relating to genetic history.  Under this bill, an insurer could not engage in the following actions on the basis of any genetic information of an individual or family member or on the basis of an individual's or family member's request for or receipt of genetic services:  Terminate, restrict, limit, or otherwise apply conditions to coverage of an individual or family member;  Cancel or refuse to renew the coverage of an individual or family member;  Deny coverage or exclude an individual or family member from coverage;  Impose a rider that excludes coverage for certain benefits and services under the plan;  Establish differentials in premium rates or cost sharing for coverage under the plan; or otherwise discriminate against an individual or family member in the provision of health care.  Last fall, as cochairs of the Senate Cancer Coalition, Senator Mack and I held a hearing on the status and use of genetic tests. Witnesses testified about the great promise of genetic testing in predicting and managing a range of diseases. A considerable portion of illness derives from defects in one or more genes or the interplay of environmental and genetic factors.  For example, approximately 3 percent of all children are born with a severe condition that is primarily genetic in origin. By age 24, genetic disease strikes 5 percent of Americans. Genetic disorders account for one-fifth of adult hospital occupancy, two-thirds of childhood hospital occupancy, one-third of pregnancy loss, and one-third of mental retardation.  About 15 million people are affected by one or more of the over 4,000 currently identified genetic disorders. An even larger number are carriers of genetic disease. J. Rennie in the June 1994 Scientific American estimated that every person has between 5 and 10 defective genes though they often are not manifested. Indeed, we are all carrying around between 50,000 and 100,000 genes scattered on 23 pairs of chromosomes.  In the past 5 years, there has been a virtual explosion of knowledge about genes. Scientists, including those at the Federal Human Genome Project, are decoding the basic units of heredity. We know that certain diseases have genetic links, including cancer, Alzheimer's disease, Huntington's disease, cystic fibrosis, neurofibromatosis, and Lou Gehrig's disease. Altered genes play a part in heart disease, diabetes, and many other more common disease.  While these important understandings hold great potential, they also present some serious problems. Witness after witness at our hearing discussed the potential and the reality of health insurance discrimination. They told us about insurers denying coverage, refusing to renew coverage, or denying coverage of a particular condition.  In a 1992 study, the Office of Technology Assessment found that 17 of 29 insurers would not sell insurance to individuals when presymptomatic testing revealed the likelihood of a serious, chronic future disease. Fifteen of 37 commercial insurers that cover groups said they would decline the applicant. Underwriters at 11 of 25 Blue Cross-Blue Shield plans said they would turn down an applicant if presymptomatic testing revealed the likelihood of disease. The study also found that insurers price plans higher--or even out of reach--based on genetic information. Another study conducted by Dr. Paul Billings at the California Pacific Medical Center, reached similar conclusions.  Here are a few examples, real-life cases:  An individual with hereditary hemochromatosis (excessive iron), who runs 10K races regularly, but who had no symptoms of the disease, could not get insurance because of the disease.  An 8-year-old girl was diagnosed at 14 days of age with PKU (phenylketonuria), a rare inherited disease, which if left untreated, leads to retardation. Most States require testing for this disease at birth. Her growth and development proceeded normally and she was healthy. She was insured on her father's employment-based policy, but when he changed jobs, the insurer at the new job told him that his daughter was considered to be a high risk patient and uninsurable.  The mother of an elementary school student had her son tested for a learning disability. The tests revealed that the son had fragile X syndrome, an inherited form of mental retardation. Her insurer dropped her son's coverage. After searching unsuccessfully for a company that would be willing to insure her son, the mother quit her job so she could impoverish herself and become eligible for Medicaid as insurance for her son.  Another man worked as a financial officer for a large national company. His son had a genetic condition which left him severely disabled. The father was tested and found to be an asymptomatic carrier of the gene which caused his son's illness. His wife and other sons were healthy. His insurer initially disputed claims filed for the son's care, then paid them, but then refused to renew the employer's group coverage. The company then offered two plans. All employees except this father were offered a choice of the two. He was allowed only the managed care plan.  A woman was denied health insurance because her nephew had been diagnosed as having cystic fibrosis and she inquired whether she should be tested to see if she was a carrier. After she was found to carry the gene that causes the disease, the insurer told her that neither she nor any children she might have would be covered unless her husband was determined not to carry the CF gene. She went for several months without health insurance because she sought genetic information about herself.  These practices deny people health insurance. In the United States, 40 million people or 15 percent have no health insurance. In California, it is 23 percent, translating to between 6 and 7 million people. If people with genetic conditions or predispositions cannot buy health insurance on the private market, they usually have nowhere to turn. To qualify for Medicaid, the primary public health insurance program for the nonelderly, families have to spend down or impoverish themselves. Having more uninsured people means that we all pay more, both for the public programs and for uninsured people arriving in hospital emergency rooms at the last minute with exacerbated conditions.  Not only do these denials deprive Americans of health insurance, the fear of discrimination can have adverse health effects. For example, if people fear retaliation by their insurer, they may be less likely to provide their physician with full information. They may be reluctant to be tested. This reluctance means that physicians might not have all the information they need to make a solid diagnosis or decide a course of treatment.  I hope Congress will begin to address this unfair insurance practice. After all, we are all just a bundle of genes. We are all at risk of disease and illness. This bill can help make health insurance available to many who need it and who want to buy it. I hope my colleagues will join me today in enacting this bill.                                  ______      By
