President, today I pay tribute to an exceptional U.S. Sailor, HM2 Jacob Emmott, known as ``Doc Emmott'' to the marines with whom he serves. ``Doc'' was awarded the Silver Star medal on July 14, 2011, for his extraordinary bravery and service.  Petty Officer Emmott, a resident of Wakefield, RI, served as a platoon corpsman with Company C, 1st Battalion, 2nd Marines in Helmand Province, Afghanistan. On April 20, 2010, Petty Officer Emmott was on patrol with his fellow marines when they began receiving heavy fire from multiple enemy positions. One of the marines sustained multiple gunshot wounds and, with complete disregard for his own personal safety, Petty Officer Emmott rushed through enemy fire to aid the fallen marine. While tending to yet another fallen comrade, Petty Officer Emmott sustained a gunshot wound directly to his face, rendering him unconscious. After Petty Officer Emmott regained consciousness, he refused morphine in order to supervise the care of the other wounded marines. His courage and dedication to duty rallied the spirits of his squad mates as they were evacuated from the battlefield.  The Silver Star Medal is the third-highest military decoration that can be awarded to a member of the U.S. Armed Forces for valor while engaged in an action against an enemy. Petty Officer Emmott is clearly deserving of the Silver Star medal for his actions to aid his fellow marines at his own personal risk.  I join all Rhode Islanders in expressing deep appreciation and gratitude for Petty Officer Emmott's extraordinary commitment and service to our Nation. We also thank his family for their support and sacrifice. Congratulations and best wishes.
