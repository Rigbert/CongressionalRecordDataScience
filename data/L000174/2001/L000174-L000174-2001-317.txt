I would like to thank Senator Hatch for his co-sponsorship of this measure. This effort builds on other legislation that Senator Hatch and I have worked on together to improve the criminal justice system, including, in this Congress alone, the Drug Abuse Education, Prevention and Treatment Act, S. 304, and the Children's Confinement Conditions Improvement Act, S. 1174.  This bill would improve the criminal code and safeguard the integrity of the judicial system. It would protect witnesses who come forward to provide information on criminal activity to law enforcement officials; eliminate a loophole in the criminal contempt statute that allows some defendants to avoid serving prison sentences imposed by the Court; eliminate a loophole in the statute of limitations that makes some defendants immune from further prosecution if they get their plea agreements vacated; grant the government the clear right to appeal the dismissal of a part of a count of an indictment, such as a predicate act in a RICO count; insure that courts may impose appropriate terms of supervised release in drug cases; give the District Courts greater flexibility in fashioning appropriate conditions of release for certain elderly prisoners; and clarify the District Court's authority to revoke or modify a term of supervised release when the defendant willfully violates the obligation to pay restitution to the victims of the defendant's crime.  Section two of the bill would amend title 18, United States Code, Section 1512, which prohibits attempts to tamper with witnesses, victims and informants. The statute currently provides that, if the offense involves murder or attempted murder, the maximum sentence is 20 years. If the defendant uses intimidation, physical force, threats or corrupt persuasion, the maximum is 10 years. The bill would increase the statutory maximum sentence for offenses involving the use or attempted use of physical force to 20 years. This change recognizes that the use or attempted use of physical force to tamper with a witness is closely related to attempted murder and that this fact should be reflected in the applicable penalty. For example, if the defendant severely beats the witness, causing serious bodily injury, the offense is arguably as serious as attempted murder, even if the government cannot prove that the defendant intended to kill the witness. It is therefore appropriate that the defendant face a potential 20-year sentence. The bill would also add a conspiracy provision that would make the maximum penalty for conspiring to tamper with a witness in violation of section 1512 or to retaliate against a witness in violation of title 18, United States Code, Section 1513 the same as that for the underlying substantive offense that was the object of the conspiracy. A similar provision was part of the Hatch-Leahy Juvenile Justice legislation, S. 254, which passed the Senate in 1999 but did not emerge from Conference.  The third section of the bill would close a loophole in title 18, United States Code, section 401, which contains penalties for criminal contempt of court. This statute provides that a court may punish contempt by a fine ``or'' imprisonment. Courts have held that this language permits the imposition of either a fine or a term of imprisonment, but not both. This limitation on sentencing is highly unusual, since virtually all criminal statutes permit both a fine and imprisonment. More importantly, it creates the potential for an enormous, unjust windfall for defendants in cases where the court fails to notice the peculiar language of the statute and mistakenly imposes both a fine and imprisonment. In such cases, the defendant can simply pay the fine and then appeal the prison sentence as illegal. Surprisingly, courts have held that, once the fine is paid, the case can no longer be remanded to the district court to have the sentence corrected because the defendant has served the sentence. Thus, the only option is to vacate the prison term and set defendant free. See In re Bradley, 318 U.S. 50 (1943). Courts have continued to follow this rule even after the passage of title 18, United States Code, section 3551(b) as part of the Sentencing Reform Act, which generally permits a court to impose a fine in addition to any other sentence. See United States v. Versaglio, 85 F.3d 943, 946-47 (2d Cir. 1996); United States v. Holloway, 991 F.2d 370, 373 (7th Cir. 1993).  It is time for Congress to correct this recurring problem. It is unjust to permit a defendant to go free without anyserving time in prison simply because the judge made an obvious and easily-correctable mistake in imposing sentence. Moreover, there is no good reason to limit courts to only one sentencing option in criminal contempt cases. Allowing the imposition of both a fine and imprisonment should not result in harsher sentences; if anything, defendants may benefit because courts may choose to impose a fine and a shorter prison sentence instead of a longer prison sentence. The second section of our bill would therefore amend section 401 to allow the court to impose both a fine and imprisonment for criminal contempt. It would make similar changes on a handful of other statutes that contain language similar to section 401: sections 1705, 1916, 2234, and 2235, of title 18 and in section 636 of title 28 of the United States Code.  The fourth section of the bill would add a new provision extending the statute of limitations for counts that are dismissed pursuant to a plea bargain. This would also close a loophole that exists under current law, which is illustrated by United States v. Podde, 105 F.3d 813 (2d Cir. 1995). In that case, a defendant who was charged with fraud pled guilty to a lesser offense pursuant to a plea agreement, and the fraud charges were dismissed. Later, however, the defendant was able to get his guilty plea set aside based upon a new Supreme Court decision. The district court then granted the government's motion to reinstate the original fraud charges, and the defendant went to trial and was convicted. On appeal, however, the court of appeals vacated the defendant's conviction based upon the statute of limitations. The court ruled that the fraud indictment could not be reinstated because the statute of limitations for the fraud charges had expired before the defendant's guilty plea was vacated. The Third Circuit reached the same result on similar facts in United States v. Midgley, 142 F.3d 174, 178-80 (3d Cir. 1998). Under these decisions, the defendants could no longer be prosecuted for any offense, even though the government had brought the case within the limitations period and pursued it diligently. Our provision would prevent such unjust results in the future by allowing the government 60 days to move to reinstate the dismissed counts after the order vacating the defendant's guilty plea becomes final. This approach is similar to that of 18 U.S.C. Sec.  3288, which gives the government a grace period to obtain a new indictment where counts are dismissed after the statute of limitations has expired.  The fifth section of the bill would amend title 18, United States Code, section 3731, which permits the United States to appeal certain orders of the District Court to the appropriate Court of Appeals. It would clarify that the government is allowed to appeal the dismissal of a part of a count, such as an overt act in a conspiracy count or a predicate act in a RICO count. This approach is consistent with the Supreme Court's observation that section 3731 permits ``an appeal from an order dismissing only a portion of a count.'' Sanabria v. United States, 437 U.S. 54, 69 n.23 (1978). The majority of Federal circuits already interpret section 3731 to permit this where the portion of the count that is dismissed could itself constitute a ``discrete basis of liability.'' See United States v. Mobley, 193 F.3d 492, 495, 7th Cir. 1999; United States v. Levasseur, 846 F.2d 786, 1st Cir. 1988. However, one federal circuit has held that section 3731 does not permit any government appeal from the dismissal of only part of a count. See United States v. Louisiana Pacific Corporation, 106 F.3d 345, 10th Cir. 1997. In other cases, appellate review of orders dismissing predicate acts or overt acts has been denied where the dismissed acts could not themselves have been charged in separate counts. See United States v. Terry, 5 F.3d 874, 5th Cir. 1993; United States v. Tom, 787 F.2d 65, 2d Cir. 1986. It is time to resolve these conflicting results definitively. The reach of section 3731 should clearly be extended to orders dismissing portions of counts. In some cases, the dismissal of an overt act or a predicate act may significantly impair the government's ability to prove its case. Defendants, of course, may get appellate review of the denial of a motion to dismiss part of a count after the trial if they are convicted. The government should also be able to appeal when such motions are granted, and it has no way of doing so other than through section 3731.  Section six of the bill would resolve a conflict in the circuits as to the permissible length of supervised release in controlled substances cases. Under 18 U.S.C. 3583(b), ``[e]xcept as otherwise provided,'' the maximum authorized terms of supervised release are 5 years for Class A and B felonies, 3 years for Class C and D felonies, and 1 year for Class E felonies and certain misdemeanors. The drug trafficking offenses in 21 U.S.C. Sec. Sec.  841 and 960 prescribe special supervised release terms, however, that are longer than those applicable generally under section 3583(b). Those longer terms, which may include lifetime supervised release, were enacted in 1986 in the same Act that inserted the introductory phrase ``Except as otherwise provided'' in section 3583(b). Because of this clear legislative history and intent, three courts of appeals have held that section 3583(b) does not limit the length of supervised release that may be imposed for a violation of 21 U.S.C. Sec. Sec.  841 or 960 when a greater term is there provided. United States v. LeMay, 952 F.2d 995, 998 (8th Cir. 1991); United States v. Eng, 14 F.3d 165, 172-3 (2d Cir. 1994); United States v. Garcia, 112 F.3d 395 (9th Cir. 1997). Two courts of appeals, however, have reached the opposite result, holding that the length of a supervised release term that can be imposed for controlled substance cases is limited by 18 U.S.C. 3583(b). United States v. Gracia, 983 F.2d 625, 630 (5th Cir. 1993); United States v. Kelly, 974 F.2d 22, 24-5 (5th Cir. 1992); United States v. Good, 25 F.3d 218 (4th Cir. 1994). Although the issue has not arisen with frequency, the conflict is entrenched and should be dealt with definitively. Accordingly, the amendment would add the words ``Notwithstanding section 3583 of title 18'' to the title 21 controlled substance offenses in the parts of those statutes dealing with supervised release to make clear that the longer terms there prescribed control over the general provision in section 3583.  Section seven of the bill would confer express authority on District Courts under 18 U.S.C. Sec.  3582(c)(1)(A), when exercising the power to reduce a term of imprisonment for extraordinary and compelling reasons, to impose a sentence of probation or supervised release with or without conditions. Such added flexibility is consistent with the purposes for which this statute was designed and will likely facilitate its use in appropriate cases. Under section 3582(c)(l)(A), a court is authorized, on motion of the Bureau of Prisons and consistent with the purposes of sentencing in 18 U.S.C. Sec.  3553, to ``reduce the term of imprisonment'' upon a finding that ``extraordinary and compelling reasons'' warrant such a reduction. This limited authority has been generally utilized when a defendant sentenced to imprisonment becomes terminally ill or develops a permanently incapacitating illness not present at the time of sentencing. In such circumstances, the situation of a prisoner (e.g., one suffering from a contagious debilitating disease), may make a court reluctant simply to release the prisoner back into society unless another sentencing option such as home confinement as a condition of supervised release or probation can be imposed. Presently, however, it is doubtful whether a court can order such a sentence since section 3582(c)(1)(A) speaks only in terms of reducing ``the term of imprisonment,'' not imposing in its stead a lesser type of sentence. Compare Fed. R. Crim. P 35(b), which gives a court the power to ``reduce a sentence'' to reflect substantial assistance.  Finally, section eight would remedy a statutory ambiguity relating to restitution as a condition of supervised release. Under 18 U.S.C. Sec.  3583(c) and (e), the court is authorized to consider various sentencing factors set forth in 18 U.S.C. Sec.  3553 as a basis for imposing restitution as a condition of supervised release or for revoking or modifying the conditions of supervised release. Supervised release is among the purposes of sentencing enumerated in section 3553, in paragraph (a)(7), but is not among the factors enumerated in section 3583(c) and (e). However, 18 U.S.C. Sec.  3583(c) also authorizes the court to impose any condition of supervised release that is an authorized condition of probation under 18 U.S.C. Sec.  3563(b), and making restitution is among those conditions (see section 3564(b)(2)). Thus, itappears clear that a court has authority to impose a restitution condition upon a term of supervised release. See, e.g., United States v. Payan, 992 F.2d 1387, 1395-96 (5th Cir. 1993). But the absence of a reference to section 3553(a)(7) in the revocation subsection of section 3583 raises a question whether, even though it is an authorized condition of supervised release, a court has authority to revoke or modify the term for the willful failure to make restitution. This amendment would provide a reference to section 3553(a)(7) in the supervised release statute and remove any ambiguity in this regard. Of course, even under the amended statute, a court could not revoke or modify the defendant's supervised release for failure to pay restitution unless the defendant had the resources to pay and willfully refused to do so. See Bearden v. Georgia, 461 U.S. 660 (1983); Payan, 992 F.2d at 1396-97.  For all of these reasons, I am pleased to introduce this legislation along with Senator Hatch, and I urge its swift enactment into law.                                 ______                                       By
