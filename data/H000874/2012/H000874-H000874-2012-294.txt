What I believe is that it ought to be a consistent policy, as it relates to keeping taxes down on hardworking Americans, that we apply to the wealthiest in America. Now whether they're temporary or permanent, it makes an economic difference to the people in question. And hardworking Americans--160 million of them--are hoping that their taxes will not go up on March 1. The only way they're going to not go up on March 1 is if we pass--as we had a great struggle doing in December--if we pass a conference report that will be reported out of the conference committee headed up by Mr. Camp which in fact makes sure that those taxes don't increase.  You say you don't want them to increase. I say we don't want them to increase. We seem to have an agreement on that rhetorically, although I have quoted a number of your leaders who say they think it's a bad idea.  But having said that, my question to you is: is your position consistent with both the 2001 and 2003 tax cuts and these tax cuts? That's all I'm asking.                              {time}  1100
