 I want to thank the capable chairman of the committee, Mr. Shuster, and the chairman and the ranking member of the full committee, Mr. DeFazio, for bringing this important Passenger Rail Reform and Investment Act before us.  Mr. Chairman, as the Representative of the busiest Amtrak station in Ohio at Toledo and the Amtrak stations in Sandusky and Elyria-Lorain, I rise to urge the passage of this important bill to continue and advance passenger rail service across our Nation.  When I was born, the population of the United States was 146 million people. Today, it surpasses 320 million. By 2020, our Nation's population is projected to reach over half a billion people--over 500 million. As time moves forward, the necessity for passenger rail will become clearer with each passing day.  Many of our major urban centers are clogged with traffic jams daily, and the railroads across my region of our continent have severe freight rail and passenger rail conflicts because they are forced to use the same tracks. Imagine that we are living in the 21st century, and we are still tethered to 19th century rail pathways.  Passenger rail travel in Ohio is booming despite these constraints--up from 108,000 passengers in 2007 to 160,000 passengers in 2013. A trend in my district has grown as well, with Toledo passengers on the northwest Ohio corridor increasing from 53,000 to 77,000 over the same time. Imagine the traffic jams if all of these individuals traveled by car instead of rail.  It is not just the northeastern part of our Nation that needs added attention to passenger rail service, as important as that is. It should also include the Great Lakes Region. The corridor that stretches the length of my district and connects our industrial heartland corridor from Pittsburgh to Cleveland to Sandusky to Toledo to Gary to Chicago needs special attention, too.  During an extended stretch last year, between July and September, the Capitol Limited, which runs from Washington, D.C., to Chicago and includes my northern Ohio stretch, completed only 2.7 percent of its trips on time--2.7 percent out of 100 percent on time. The dramatic increase of freight rail consistently bumps passenger service. We need both, but what we have are these lengthy delays to passenger service across our vast region.  I have two articles I would like to insert into the Record detailing these troubles.                            [From the Blade]      Amtrak Trains Often Trickle Into Toledo After Rash of Delays                            (By David Patch)       Christine Smith boarded Amtrak's Lake Shore Limited in      Chicago on Tuesday night to visit a friend in Toledo.       The train left Chicago two hours late and made it only      about 15 miles to Indiana's northwest corner, where it sat      for about three hours, Ms. Smith recalled. By the time it got      to Toledo, it was six hours behind schedule.       It was only the latest of a series of late Amtrak trains      the Melbourne, Australia, resident said she had encountered      since arriving in Los Angeles last month and riding from      there to San Francisco, Portland, Ore., Spokane, and Chicago.       Late trains are nothing new for Amtrak, particularly for      the overnight, long-distance trains such as those that serve      Toledo--the Lake Shore Limited and Capitol Limited. Trains      running more than three hours late have become the norm      recently, and they have often lost that much or more just on      the Chicago-Toledo portion of trips. The Capitol Limited was      12 hours behind schedule on Sunday.       While there have been exceptions, by far the biggest      obstacle to Amtrak's time-keeping across northern Indiana and      northern Ohio has been tracks blocked by freight trains      belonging to Norfolk Southern, which owns and operates the      line Amtrak uses between Chicago and Cleveland.       ``It's absolutely unbelievable what they're doing to the      American people. It's a fraud,'' Ms. Smith said. ``Every      train I've been on     has been late leaving and late arriving, and freight trains      are given as the reason.''       During the 12 months that ended in August, Capitol Limited      trains arrived at their end stations in Chicago or Washington      within 30 minutes of schedule only 22.5 percent of the time,      while the Lake Shore reached Chicago or New York on time 30.8      percent of the time, according to Amtrak.       But August itself was significantly worse, and September      data, when available, is unlikely to show improvement. In      August, the best performer was the eastbound Lake Shore,      which reached New York within 30 minutes of schedule 6.5      percent of the time--two trips. The westbound was late into      Chicago every day of the month, and the Capitol Limiteds      arrived on time once in each direction.       Late westbound arrivals in Chicago also translate to late      eastbound departures, because Amtrak lacks spare equipment in      Chicago to make up replacement trains when equipment arrives      late, and it also does not have enough engineers and      conductors to always have an extra train crew ready to      replace one that has worked the maximum 12-hour shift set by      federal regulation.       Marc Magliari, an Amtrak spokesman in Chicago, laid even      the late departures from Chicago at Norfolk Southern's feet.       ``If the train is late getting to Chicago, it's most likely      going to be late eastbound while we're servicing equipment      and getting proper rest for our crews,'' Mr. Magliari said.      ``The result is to drive up our costs, dissatisfy our      passengers, and create `never again' riders.''       While its ridership pales in comparison to major stations      like New York and Chicago, Toledo historically has been      Amtrak's busiest Ohio stop, and its ridership has declined of      late.       After peaking at more than 90,000 riders in 2010 and 2011,      Toledo's Amtrak ridership dropped to 87,073 in 2012 and      86,252 last year, according to statistics provided to the      Toledo-Lucas County Port Authority, which owns the Toledo      station.       During the first seven months of 2014, Amtrak's Toledo      ridership has fallen by another 7 percent, those statistics      show.       David Pidgeon, a Norfolk Southern spokesman, said the      freight-train backlog is a product of ``more trains and      capacity challenges in the corridor between Chicago and      Cleveland'' because the freight traffic exceeds what the      company handled before the 2008 recession.       ``We generally have a cooperative relationship with Amtrak      because we are each other's landlords,'' Mr. Pidgeon said.      ``We run on their network and they run on ours, so there's      plenty of business and personal incentive to keep the      cooperation going.       ``We want to keep freight and passenger trains moving,      period.''       One of the busiest pieces of railroad in the entire United      States, Norfolk Southern's double-track main has become, to      varying degrees, an obstacle course of stopped and slow-     moving freight trains.       A particular growth area has been oil shipments from the      Bakken oilfields of North Dakota to terminals on the East      Coast, rail traffic that simply didn't exist before 2009 but      now accounts for dozens of trains through Toledo each week.                             Rail expansion       Norfolk Southern is building a third main track between      Chesterton and Gary, Ind., a 30-mile section that is the      busiest stretch of the region's busiest freight railroad. It      includes several major junctions and runs through the heart      of one of America's most heavily industrialized areas, the      steel mills and a major oil refinery along Lake Michigan's      southern shore. Until that third track is ready for use, its      construction is impairing train traffic.       When only one track is open for trains, traffic only goes      one way while opposing trains wait. The spot where Ms.      Smith's train stopped is near the west end of the Chesterton-     Gary construction zone. LaPorte, Ind.--where the Chicago-     bound Amtrak trains from Toledo have often sat for hours in      recent weeks--is near the east end.       And not only have passenger trains to and from Toledo been      affected by that problem, so too have Amtrak's five daily      round-trip trains between Chicago and Detroit, Grand Rapids,      and Port Huron, Mich., which use the same rails west of      Chesterton.       The third track in northwest Indiana is one of several      capacity-improvement projects under way on Norfolk Southern      in the region.       Most prominent among the others is a $160 million expansion      of the Bellevue, Ohio, yard, which will double in size when      the project is done later this year, easing congestion at      other yards, Mr. Pidgeon said.       That ``will ease the demand for space in Elkhart and      hopefully significantly reduce transit times for our freight      trains, keeping us moving and the network fluid,'' he said.       Norfolk Southern has 50 new locomotives soon to be      delivered and also has bought several hundred used ones in      the past year or two to address shortages.       It also is hiring close to 100 new train conductors in the      Toledo area and has transferred 120 more from other parts of      its system to the Cleveland-Chicago corridor to alleviate      crew shortages, Mr. Pidgeon said.       The Ohio Association of Railroad Passengers, an advocacy      group, cites another factor in the freight-train delays: An      automated dispatching system Norfolk Southern has been      introducing on portions of its rail network during the past      two years.       The system, called the Auto-Router, is designed to mimic a      job human train dispatchers have done for years--deciding      which trains run on which tracks at what time. The automated      system could supplement that work, allowing the human      dispatchers to work larger territories, or eventually it      could replace them.       Train dispatching is a job with a lot of variables because      freight trains don't all travel at the same speed. Some are      long, heavy, and slow; others are short and, ideally, fast.       Hills, track repairs, and certain trains' need to stop at      yards along the way to pick up or drop off cars also can      factor into how trains are dispatched.       Critics of the system including OARP--also known as All      Aboard Ohio--and Norfolk Southern sources who spoke on      condition of anonymity because they're not authorized to talk      to reporters said the Auto-Router system's flaws are      contributing to the railroad's congestion.                          Passenger complaints       While Amtrak riders interviewed by The Blade said they      understand how the passenger trains are at the freight      railroads' mercy, some said the passenger-train operator      could handle the situation better, too.       Jean McGraw of Port Clinton, who boarded the Boston-bound      Lake Shore in Sandusky in late September to visit a sister in      New Hampshire, said she and her travel companion got two      emails ``in the middle of the night'' about train delays but      got no updates after that.       And when the bus Ms. McGraw and other Boston-bound      passengers rode from Albany got to Boston at 4 a.m. the next      day, the station there was locked. The passengers cajoled the      bus driver into letting them take shelter in a neighboring      bus garage, she said.       ``That was it--it was ridiculous,'' Ms. McGraw said.       As compensation, Amtrak offered vouchers good toward future      train travel. Ms. McGraw said she hopes to use hers once the      current problems are resolved, but her companion swore off      train travel because of the experience.       Untested is whether Norfolk Southern's handling of Amtrak      violates a 1973 federal law directing the freight railroads      to give the passenger trains preferential handling.       A more recent federal law, passed in 2008, directed the      Federal Railroad Administration and Amtrak to develop      performance standards for Amtrak trains.       However, a later appellate court ruling stalled this.      According to the rail passengers association, Amtrak's      overall on-time performance has plummeted since that 2013      ruling, which is the subject of a pending Supreme Court      appeal.       Dan McMackin, a United Parcel Service spokesman, said his      company has recently changed the train routes it uses to move      packages in response to train delays, though he did not      confirm that the company specifically removed its cargo from      the Norfolk Southern route.       ``We have seen some recent lower reliability in several      lanes and are adjusting accordingly, with guidance from our      rail service partners as to appropriate network      corrections,'' Mr. McMackin said. ``While there have been      lanes affected over the last several months, we expect long-     term reliability to return and most of our adjustments are      seen as temporary.''       But while UPS may be ready to send packages back to the      Cleveland-Toledo-Chicago corridor once Norfolk Southern's      problems are resolved, Amtrak could have a harder time      winning back Tanya Miller, of Taylor, Mich., one of the      riders who boarded the New York-bound train in Toledo on      Wednesday morning.       ``This is my first time and my very last time taking      Amtrak,'' she said. ``I'm not recommending Amtrak to      anyone.''                                  ____                        [From The Plain Dealer] Solutions Sought for Chronic Amtrak, Freight Train Delays in Northern                                   Ohio                           (By Alison Grant)       Cleveland, OH.--Passengers sitting on the tracks one recent      morning near an idled Lake Shore Limited train in Cleveland      had a lot of time to kill.       Their eastbound train was late getting out of Chicago Union      Station and pulled into Cleveland about 3\1/2\ hours after      its scheduled arrival of 5:35 a.m.       Then a switch problem or a downed power line on the CSX      tracks between downtown Cleveland and Collinwood--reports      varied--meant another delay of five hours before the Amtrak      train pulled out of town.       Ed and Rosemary Sobala, heading home to Buffalo after a      train trip to the canyon-lands of Arizona, Utah and Nevada,      weren't too surprised.       Not one of the Amtraks on their two-week journey was on      time, they said. In fact, not one was less than 5\1/2\ hours      late. When the Lake Shore Limited was stalled in Cleveland,      they were headed home to Buffalo--four hours away by car.       ``A number of us riders jokingly referred to an Amtrak      schedule as a wish list more than a schedule,'' Ed Sobala      said.       Delays like this--and they're chronic nationwide, including      along northern Ohio's east-west corridor, for both Amtrak      passenger trains and freight trains--have prompted three of      this region's metropolitan planning organizations to set up a      rail alliance to work on improving what is the fastest-     growing U.S. transportation mode in the 21st century.       ``Passenger rail ridership has increased dramatically, but      specifically on that corridor,'' said Grace Gallucci,      executive director of the Northeast Ohio Areawide      Coordinating Agency, which joined with the Toledo      Metropolitan Area Council of Governments and the Erie County      Regional Planning Commission to form the Northern Ohio Rail      Alliance.       ``And the freight railroads are aggressively pursuing      increasing their capacity.''       Gallucci attributes the increase in passenger rail traffic      to economics and demographics--high gas prices, expensive air      fares, Millennials more interested in public transportation      than their parents.       Four daily passenger trains carry enough passengers to fill      a dozen Boeing 737s each day along the tracks in northern      Ohio, according to the advocacy group All Aboard Ohio, and 70      daily freight trains carry about 20,000 truckload equivalents      of cargo.       Amtrak's Lake Shore Limited service, from Chicago through      Ohio to New York City and Boston, averages 1,100 passengers a      day.       One of the rail alliance's first goals is to persuade the      Ohio Department of Transportation to release $938,000 that      Congresswoman Marcy Kaptur secured in 2010 for rail planning.       The money was earmarked for ODOT to study high-speed rail,      but that project was scrubbed by Gov. John Kasich when he      took office. Kasich said high-speed rail was a ``money pit''      because it would cost the state about $17 million a year to      maintain and operate, with no guarantee enough tickets could      be sold to cover the expenses.       The train money has been sitting in ODOT's accounts since.       ``The study area has changed many times,'' agency spokesman      Steve Faulkner explained.       ``Most recently, folks in northern Ohio changed (it) to      include a review of the Cleveland to Toledo route. That's      new. For that reason, all interested parties...must again      meet in person to discuss and agree on details of the study      plan.''       ODOT last week set up a meeting for Oct. 28 to discuss the      funding, Gallucci said.       The Northern Ohio Rail Alliance and All Aboard Ohio say      redesigning the Amtrak stations in northern Ohio would do a      lot to improve rail service. Trains stopping at Cleveland,      Elyria and Sandusky can process passengers from only one      track of the two-track railway.       That requires trains to ``slalom'' between tracks, and      during the crossover, both tracks at the station are      occupied. Opposing rail traffic must stop. The result: At      least 80 minutes of delay to the four passenger trains that      arrive nightly at each station, and as much or more delay to      freight traffic.       The station in Toledo can process passengers from both      tracks but only at ground-level walkways not platforms.       Gallucci said rail projects should qualify for money      overseen by ODOT's Transportation Review Advisory Council--     which typically deals with projects that add capacity to Ohio      roads. She said rail station work also should be eligible for      money the state is raising for ODOT projects by letting the      Ohio Turnpike issue bonds that will be paid off with toll      increases.       ``We have to get away from this idea that every      transportation mode competes against the others,'' Gallucci      said.       Record high oil shipments from the Bakken Fields in the      Dakotas to East Coast refineries have added to freight      delays, including in Cleveland.       Of the 60 to 90 freight trains that rumble daily through      Northeast Ohio on the tracks owned and operated by Norfolk      Southern, nine are oil trains. And that's due to grow by      another 18 trains in coming months, said Ken Prendergast, All      Aboard Ohio executive director.       In September, officials representing agricultural, auto and      chemical industries told a Senate committee that widespread      delays in freight shipments were affecting an array of      industries and forcing some out of business. The Associated      Press reported that lawmakers displayed a photo of a giant      mound of wheat languishing in North Dakota because farmers      couldn't get a railroad company to ship it.       Jonathan Fields and Jacquie Mon, traveling on the Empire      Builder from Portland, Oregon to Albany, New York, were      delayed five hours in Minot, North Dakota, when their train      was put on a siding track while oil trains moved past.       ``We thought Amtrak trains had priority to the freight-     owned rails if they were within a certain window of time,''      Mon wrote in an email. ``I spent some time Googling the      subject and learned about the oil trains, the judge who ruled      that it wasn't legal to require the freight trains to give      Amtrak priority and that his decision was being appealed.''       Then came the hang-up in Cleveland, a stone's throw from      FirstEnergy Stadium.       ``If there had been a game, we would have had enough time      for a leisurely tailgate party, time to settle into our seats      and watch the teams warmup, enjoy--more or less--the game,      and time for drinks and play-call second guessing after the      game,'' Fields said.       Sobala said he concluded that Amtrak isn't reliable for      travelers on firm schedules.       ``One couple departed the sleeper car with their luggage      during the delay in Cleveland,'' he said. ``They decided to      fly to New York because they had an appointment they couldn't      miss. I last saw them get in a cab headed for the Cleveland      airport.''
