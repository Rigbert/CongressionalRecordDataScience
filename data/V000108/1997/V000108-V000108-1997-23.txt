Chairman, I move to strike the requisite number of words.  Mr. Chairman, I rise in strong support of the amendment offered by my colleagues, the gentleman from New Jersey [Mr. Pallone] and the gentleman from Michigan [Mr. Knollenberg].  For years, Armenia and Azerbaijan have engaged in a tragic conflict over the status of the Nagorno-Karabagh region. While a cease-fire has been in place since 1994, there are still thousands of refugees and civilians who are desperately in need of our help.  I was disappointed that the committee rejected an amendment to the original foreign aid bill that would have encouraged U.S. humanitarian assistance to the Nagorno-Karabagh area. This amendment would have provided much needed assistance to the refugees and any civilians living in the area.  The Pallone-Knollenberg amendment does not address the issue of U.S. aid nor does it take sides in the conflict between Armenia or Azerbaijan. Instead, the amendment simply expresses the sense of the Congress that the United States Government should take a leadership role in bringing a resolution to the conflict.  The amendment also reaffirms the current neutral stance of the United States and encourages direct negotiations between the parties to the conflict. I support this amendment because there can be no better way to assist the war torn victims of this longstanding conflict than to help bring about a lasting peace in the region.  There is nothing wrong with the U.S. remaining neutral. It is wrong for us to stand on the sidelines doing nothing to bring about a permanent resolution to this war. The Clinton administration has taken the initiative in similar conflicts around the world, and there is no good reason why we should not do the same in Nagorno-Karabagh.  Mr. Chairman, the people of this region are in need of our help. The best thing that we can do for them right now is to vote for the Pallone-Knollenberg amendment. I strongly urge my colleagues to support it.
