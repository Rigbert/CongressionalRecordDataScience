 There is zero for school construction. What kind of message is that for our young kids, who are sitting in public schools, to show that we care about them, and that we are paying attention to them, and that we believe their education is important.  It is hard to pass that message along when you are sitting in classrooms with a leaky roof, with no new desks, with materials that are inappropriate, that are not good for education. A child goes home and says: The adults in my world don't care about me.  We all know the results of that. There is not a dime in this bill for school construction.
