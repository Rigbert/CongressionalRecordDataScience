President, I commend the Senate for agreeing to this resolution to honor the men and women who serve in law enforcement and to officially recognize May 15 as National Peace Officers Memorial Day.  Despite the progress that has been made in improving officer safety, there is much work to be done. The year 2011 was an especially tragic one for the law enforcement community. Last year, 163 State and Federal law enforcement officers lost their lives in the line of duty. This is an increase from 2010 and a grim reminder of the sacrifices far too many individuals make serving their communities and fellow citizens. The Senate should continue to do all it can to support officer safety.  To recognize these sacrifices, as they do every year, law enforcement officers and their families from across the United States will come to Washington to pay tribute and honor the men and women who have lost their lives. And as I do each year, I will stand with them.  In 1962, President Kennedy designated May 15 as National Peace Officers Memorial Day. Once again I am proud to have introduced a resolution officially recognizing that designation and honoring these men and women, and all of those that came before them. I am glad we passed this official recognition today.  The safety of law enforcement officers across the United States should be something on which we can all agree. I hope the quick passage of this resolution will foreshadow future bipartisan work on behalf of the men and women who work day after day to protect all of us.
