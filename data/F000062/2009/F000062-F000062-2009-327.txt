 President, I rise today to introduce a resolution to establish the fourth annual EndangeredSpecies Day on May 15, 2009. I am introducing this legislation with Senators Collins, Boxer, Brown, Cantwell, Feingold, Kerry, Levin, Sanders, Whitehouse, and Akaka whose cosponsorship and support of this resolution I appreciate very much.  The designation of Endangered Species Day will provide many wonderful opportunities for Americans to familiarize themselves with the status and recovery efforts of endangered species in our own country and around the world, including such magnificent species as the polar bear.  Last year, more than 100 events were held across the country to highlight endangered species success stories, and even more are slated for this year. Educational activities were held at zoos, aquariums, libraries, and schools across the country, including Disney's Animal Kingdom in Florida, the San Diego Zoo in California, the Port Defiance Zoo and Aquarium in Tacoma, Washington, and the Bronx Zoo in New York City.  Based on the success of last year, I am confident that this year's Endangered Species Day will continue to foster increased awareness about endangered species by encouraging educational activities such as school field trips to the zoo or attending an art fair at a local library.  Endangered species recovery programs in California are great examples of the conservation and management efforts that have helped to significantly restore populations of the California condor and the California gray whale. Over 300 species classified as either endangered or threatened live in California, and efforts to protect them will ensure that they continue to do so.  Despite these success stories, we must consider what more can be done. There are over 5,000 threatened species that receive protection in the United States and abroad. An important step to preventing further threats to and endangerment of wildlife is to increase awareness about the seriousness of the problem and educating our youth on what we can do.  I would also like to commend the Interior Secretary Ken Salazar and Commerce Secretary Gary Locke, who recently lifted the Bush administration's last-minute consultation rule. This will allow the United States to take immediate action to ensure that independent wildlife experts are consulted on the impacts on endangered and threatened species.  I am introducing this bill with the hope that Endangered Species Day can spark the interest in our youth to continue the conservation efforts that we have begun, but are still far from finishing.                          ____________________
