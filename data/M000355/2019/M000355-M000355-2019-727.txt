 September 11 is a day of mourning, a date stained by the terrorist murderers of so many innocent people in New York, Arlington, and Pennsylvania. With each passing day, the reality is still shocking, and the wounds are still painful.  Each year we remember the innocent men, women, and children who lost their lives: workers rushing to meetings, vacationers headed home, emergency personnel whose quick response immortalized them as heroes. Each year we honor the memories of the heroes who sacrificed their lives to bring the perpetrators of this evil to justice and to prevent similar attacks.  Our way of life was changed by 9/11. It changed our approach to security. It awakened us to determined new enemies.  The dangers of radical Islamic terrorists remain real. Al-Qaida, its enablers, and its allies still plot against America from Afghanistan and Pakistan to Yemen, Somalia, Libya, Mali, and beyond. ISIS persists in Iraq and Syria through an underground network of terrorists who have not yet given up the fight. We cannot walk away from these dangers. We must not leave our work undone.  Many nations have a stake in defeating the terrorists. NATO allies have been with the United States since the early hours of this fight. Eighteen years ago, this critical alliance invoked article V for the first time.Since then, many NATO partners have fought side by side with us in Afghanistan, in Iraq, and in Syria.  We are not--and need not be--the world's policeman. Winning this long war, like the Cold War, will require sustained efforts and contributions not only from the United States but from our allies and especially from local partners. For example, in Afghanistan the vast majority of the fighting is done by local security forces, but we must always remember the global coalition to defeat the terrorists will not lead itself.  So, today, as we remember the tragedies of the past, we must renew our commitment to leading the fight for a better future. Today, may the memory of the nearly 3,000 victims who lost their lives on this day in 2001 serve as a lasting reminder of what is at stake in the fight against terrorism and steel our resolve to continue the hard, necessary work of defending our homeland. May we always keep foremost in our thoughts all the U.S. servicemembers, intelligence officers, diplomats, and first responders who have given their lives in pursuit of our Nation's security.                          ____________________
