President, to answer the distinguished leader, as I always assume the Republican leader to do because this has been the practice, certainly as long as he has been in the Senate--perhaps he has forgotten--is that the chairman of these committees sets a time for a vote, and it is almost always, as a matter of courtesy, at least, discussed with the ranking minority member. I realize the hour is late and the Republican leader may have forgotten that. But it has been my practice to always discuss the time of the vote with the ranking member, as he did with me when he was chairman.  To answer the majority leader's question, of course I will be happy to talk with the distinguished ranking member of the committee and find time when they might be scheduled. I might point out, each one of those was expedited.  I would ask two brief questions--and then I will leave--of the distinguished majority leader. Was he aware that, when talking statistics, I committed not to follow the precedent of the Republicans when President Clinton was the President, their precedent of pocket filibustering over 60 of President Clinton's nominees? Was the distinguished majority leader aware that I will not follow that precedent and we will not pocket filibuster 60 or anywhere near that?
