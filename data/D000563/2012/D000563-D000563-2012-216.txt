President, today I wish to honor former Congressman Paul Findley--a great American who served his country in war and in the hallowed halls of Congress, a son of Illinois, a prolific writer and Lincoln scholar, a former political adversary, and my now friend.  Paul Findley was born in Jacksonville, Illinois, on June 23, 1921. And at 91 years of age, today Paul is as active and involved as he has ever been. Paul earned a bachelor's degree from his beloved Illinois College in his hometown in 1943, where he was inducted into the prestigious Phi Beta Kappa society. After college, Paul served as a lieutenant in the Navy in the Pacific Theater from 1943 to 1946. His honorable service and that of the dwindling number of living Americans who served during World War II--one of the most difficult periods in our country's history is something we should all take time to reflect on and thank them for.  After the war, Paul became president of Pike Press, Inc., in Pittsfield. He spent several years as editor of this small town weekly newspaper. In 1952, Findley lost a bid for the Republican nomination for State senator--something he and I have in common, having lost our first campaigns for public office--but it didn't stop either of us.  In 1960 Paul Findley was elected to the U.S. House of Representatives representing the 20th Congressional District of Illinois. He served in the House honorably for more than 20 years, until in 1982 a young lawyer from Springfield and a long shot to win surprised a lot of people, including many of his supporters, by unseating the incumbent Findley. Though Paul Findley and I were opponents in that campaign, I always respected him and his public service. Notwithstanding what is often a bitter and rancorous climate of partisan politics, I am proud to call Paul Findley my friend.  One of Paul Findley's greatest accomplishments during his long and distinguished congressional career was his dogged, ultimately successful effort to preserve a great American treasure--the Springfield home of our beloved son of Illinois, Abraham Lincoln. Strolling today through this historic neighborhood at the heart of Springfield, as thousands of visitors do each year, it would be almost inconceivable that preserving Lincoln's home was ever a matter of debate. But it oncewas. Back in the 1950s, the site visitors see today looked very different.  Where now-restored historic homes line a gravel street in a stately and peaceful neighborhood, then stood souvenir shops surrounded by a neighborhood that Paul Findley would later recall was, ``rundown and decaying in all directions.'' The Lincoln home itself--what Lincoln's own private secretary once called ``the precious heirloom of the republic''--was then the property of the State of Illinois.  For years, developers had tried to encroach on the historic site with the goal of exploiting the area for commercial opportunities. Some wanted a theme park. Others tried to build wax museums or hotels or buffet restaurants in close proximity. Still others had been trying unsuccessfully to ensure the home's restoration and the preservation of the historical integrity of the surrounding area. In Congressman Paul Findley, those who wanted to honor this piece of history found their champion.  Findley traces his own interest in this project back to a presentation at a meeting of the Pittsfield Chamber of Commerce in 1955 well before he held elected office. At the meeting, a Springfield resident presented a case for preserving the Lincoln Home and developing the site commercially. While the plan for development never got off the ground, the presenter did make a point that Findley never forgot--that the Lincoln Home had largely been neglected compared to other Presidential homes. This, Findley regarded as ``shameful, awful, scandalous.'' It was in 1967, as the congressman representing the district that encompassed the Lincoln site that Findley became directly involved and took up the mantle of this effort. After years of lining up local, state, and national support, Congressman Findley announced in 1969 at a Springfield dinner that he would introduce legislation in Congress to make the site part of the National Park System. At that dinner was New York Governor Nelson Rockefeller, whom Findley had successfully enlisted in the effort,   The late Senators Charles Percy and Everett Dirksen introduced companion legislation in the Senate. The bills had the support of every member of the Illinois congressional delegation. But even with all this support, as those of us who have been around here long enough know, the fight wasn't over. Money, as always, was an issue. People began trying to raise private funds. Congressman Findley worked tirelessly to get the attention of the relevant committee and subcommittee chairs--Democrats held the majorities in both Chambers at the time. Among other things, he invited key members to Springfield to tour the site after which they usually agreed to support his efforts.  I have no doubt that the commitments of these members to support his bill had as much to do with Findley's tenacity, passion, and determination as it did the power of seeing the Lincoln Home in person.  Then the Nixon administration threw its support behind Findley, and even asked that the bill be amended to fully authorize the appropriation required for the site--so the private fundraising was unnecessary. The House passed the bill first, and it enjoyed, as Findley says, ``swift approval'' in the Senate we can't say that about too many matters around here anymore. On August 18, 1971, years of efforts culminated in a ceremony in the Old State Capitol in Springfield, just blocks away from the Lincoln Home. With Congressman Findley looking on, President Richard Nixon signed the Findley bill authorizing the establishment of the Lincoln Home National Historic Site.  Think about it, this was an effort championed by a Republican Congressman, passed by a Congress controlled by Democrats, and signed by a Republican President. It was a different time. One year after the signing ceremony, then-President of the Illinois State Senate, Paul Simon, signed legislation transferring the title for the Lincoln home to the National Park Service.  Thanks to the leadership of Congressman Paul Findley and the many local supporters of his efforts--including then-Springfield Mayor Nelson Howarth, the first superintendent of the Lincoln Home National Historic Site Albert Banton, the architect of the Lincoln Home Visitor Center and early supporter of preservation efforts Wally Henderson, and countless others--visitors to the site today can stroll the street Lincoln once strolled and take in the neighborhood in much the same way it would have looked to him more than 150 years ago.  The experience of visiting the Abraham Lincoln National Historic Site will undoubtedly inspire generations of young Americans to serve their country, just as Paul Findley has and as Abraham Lincoln did.  This is Paul Findley's legacy.  It is a legacy that forever will be intertwined with President Lincoln--an honor that Paul richly deserves.  Throughout his 91 years on this Earth, my friend and this great American, Paul Findley, has made an indelible mark on our State of Illinois and our country--and he has not done yet.                          ____________________
