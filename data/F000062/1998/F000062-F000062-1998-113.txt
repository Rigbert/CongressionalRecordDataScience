 President, I rise today to pay tribute to Alan Bersin, a valued colleague and extraordinary public servant. During his four and half years as United States Attorney for the Southern District of California, the office became one of the premier prosecutorial offices in the country. Under Alan Bersin's leadership the caseload was transformed from one dominated by misdemeanor prosecutions to the largest number of felony prosecutions in the nation.  As the chief law enforcement officer along the most populous sector of the Southwest Border with Mexico, Alan Bersin has made border enforcement his highest priority, and is perhaps best known for his work as the Attorney General's Special Representative for Southwest Border Issues. He was appointed to the position in October 1995 at a time when the government was seeking new leadership and energy to deal with the proliferation of illegal activity along the southwest border which had become the principal corridor for smuggling of aliens and drugs into the country. Alan Bersin targeted for prosecution the large drug distributors and cartels on both sides of the border, and the repeat border crossers with felony records. He also coordinated resources in a manner never before attempted. Largely as a result of these strategic approaches, crime in the Southern District of California decreased 40 percent during Alan Bersin's tenure.  Shortly after taking office in 1994, Alan Bersin reached an historic accord with the San Diego District Attorney whereby the county, for the first time in San Diego history, prosecuted drug smuggling case which had a San Diego nexus. This has resulted in a dramatic increase in border drug smuggling prosecutions that is unprecedented, and has allowed the federal government to use its unique resources such as wire tap authority, to focus on the more serious violators. Alan Bersin also helped create a Specialized Drug Enforcement Operation in Imperial Valley which served as a prime trafficking route of the Mexican drug cartels. The special enforcement unit involves 17 federal, state and local drug-related law enforcement agencies, the California National Guard and the Department of Defense. Alan Bersin's ability to bring together enforcement agencies at all levels to cooperate in a number of successful enforcement initiatives has been praised by local, state and federal law enforcement leaders. Also, his ability to coordinate with our neighbor to the South has been most extraordinary. He worked tirelessly to bridge the cultural and political divide in a way that enabled both countries to see that it was in their best interests to find areas of mutual concern and work together to the maximum extent feasible, even though there are other areas on which we will continue to disagree.  As the patterns of illegal migration changed in response to increased law enforcement personnel and resources, criminal activity moved to new areas along the border. Under Alan Bersin's leadership both countries implemented collaborative programs to prevent criminal activity and to apprehend criminals who oftentimes preyed upon undocumented aliens. Alan Bersin also oversaw the creation of a civil rights working group comprised of federal law enforcement, immigrant rights' advocacy groups from San Diego and Tijuana, the Mexican Consulate in San Diego, the U.S. Consulate in Tijuana and the United States Attorney's Office to bring to the table all those affected by or involved in the enforcement of civil rights laws. The group provides assistance to investigators in locating evidence on both sides of the border to prove allegations of abuse. Other innovative programs launched during Alan Bersin's tenure include helping to establish a Binational Environmental Laboratory to facilitate the investigation and prosecution of environmental cases in Mexico and the U.S.  Mexico is not the only sovereignty with whom Alan Bersin negotiated well and successfully. At a time when Indian gaming was becoming an enormously difficult and controversial issue in California, and aspects of the issue were being litigated in both state and federal courts, Alan Bersin managed to maintain a level playing field on a government to government basis between the State of California and the Native American tribes of San Diego County.  Finally, in addition to the official law enforcement achievements during the last four years, Alan Bersin has added a new dimension to public service. By example and by encouragement, he has increased enormously the involvement of his staff in community projects, ranging from training programs to mentoring and public outreach. His commitment to the community will continue as he begins a new career as Superintendent of Schools for the San Diego Unified School District. I am confident he will bring to that position the same vision, inspiring leadership and commitment which made him such an outstanding United States Attorney. He has brought great credit to his office, to the Justice Department and to the nation. Congratulations Alan, and best wishes for every success as Superintendent of the San Diego Unified School District.                          ____________________
