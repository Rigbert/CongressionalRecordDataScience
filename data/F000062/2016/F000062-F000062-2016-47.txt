 President, I rise to introduce the Extending Justice for Sex Crime Victims Act, which is a bill to extend the time for child sexual abuse victims to seek justice against their perpetrators.  I would like to thank Senator Cornyn for working closely with me on this important issue.  Tragically, all over the country, victims of sexual abuse are coming forward to tell their stories of abuse and exploitation at the height of their innocence when they were children.  Several from California, for example, have contacted my office, and described with great courage their pain and anguish.  Each of these individual stories represents an untold amount of pain and suffering. When you look at the numbers, you cannot help but feel devastated.  Indeed, the numbers reveal that no one is too far removed from being affected by deplorable crimes committed against children.  Studies indicate that at least one in four girls and about one in five boys is sexually abused.  It has been estimated that 90 percent of child victims never go to the authorities concerning their abuse.  For many of these children, coming to grips with the trauma is extraordinarily difficult.  Several research studies have described in painstaking detail the long-term effects that affect the physical, emotional, cognitive, and social development of abuse victims and sex trafficking victims.  Those who are victimized when they are children typically do not come forward with their abuse--if at all--until many years later, after the victims reach adulthood.  Simply put, the bill extends the civil statute of limitations in two ways for minor victims of Federal sex crimes--because these victims often need more time to realize the harm they have suffered and to seek redress.  First, the bill extends the statute of limitations until the age of 28--from age 21--for minor victims of particular offenses, such as sexual abuse and child pornography.  This brings the statute of limitations in line with a similar law that provides a civil remedy for victims of sex trafficking. The two laws are sections 2255 and 1595 of Title 18.  This provision was recently included, at my request, in the Adam Walsh Reauthorization Act of 2016, which the Judiciary Committee approved unanimously weeks ago.  Second, for the laws that provide civil remedies for sex abuse and sex trafficking victims, the bill clarifies when the statute of limitations begins to run.  The bill would clarify that, for both laws providing civil remedies for these victims, the time for a victim to bring a claim against the perpetrator would not begin to run until after the victim actually discovers the injury or the violation.  This is significant because victims of sex crimes are sometimes abused even before they can remember the abuse--some as young as 3-years old.  The bill therefore clarifies that the time for a victim to sue her perpetrator does not begin to run when the violation occurs, but rather when the victim first discovers the injury or the violation.  This is also important because victims of child pornography--who are also sexually abused--may not even ``discover'' that their illegal, pornographic images are being distributed over the internet and elsewhere until later in life.  The bill therefore ensures that minor victims have an extended period to seek justice against their perpetrators after discovering their injury or violation.  Under current law, it is unclear from court opinions when victims must bring their claims, and Congress must make clear it has always intended these victims to have an opportunity to come forward and seek redress.  I want to thank Senator Cornyn again for working so closely with me on this issue.  I also want to acknowledge the support for this bill from the National Center for Missing and Exploited Children, the National Center for Victims of Crime, and the Survivors Network of those Abused by Priests.                          ____________________
