 President, I rise to join my colleagues supporting this amendment. There is one thing I would like to point out. I have serious concerns about the visa waiver program. I have concerns about its wisdom in the first place.  When you have 23 million people coming in without visas, from 29 different countries, it becomes so easy for passports to be misplaced and for people who are threats to get into this program. I think we have to watch it very carefully. We have to depend on the fact that the strictures in this bill are meant to be carried out.  I, for one, would not have a problem with doing away with the program if we find any more irregularities in it. We have actual instances where terrorists have used this visa waiver program. We know 100,000 passports were missing. We know they were not reported in a timely way. This bill requires, first of all, the thefts of passports, or that passports are missing, be reported immediately. Then the INS, within 72 hours, would have to enter them into an interoperable database, assuming we get to that interoperable database. Until that system is established, the INS would enter the information into an existing data system.  I, for one, am going to ask my staff to watch very carefully as to how these passport numbers get entered, and I will try to do my level best to see it is carried out. If it is not, I think we will have to go back and assess the wisdom of this entire program.  I yield the floor.
