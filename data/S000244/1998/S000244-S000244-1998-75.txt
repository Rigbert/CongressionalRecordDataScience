Speaker, I think it is important to clear up the record as a result of what the gentleman from Michigan (Mr. Conyers) had to say about access to executive session materials.  Just so that all of the Members are clear, when the House passed House Resolution 525 in September, immediately after the receipt of the independent counsel's report, only members of the Committee on the Judiciary had access to the executive session material. Section 4 of that resolution was effective during the review of the referral from Independent Counsel Starr.  Pursuant to section 1 of H. Res. 525, rules relating to review by the committee was effective until there was a further order of the House. Then in October, when we passed our inquiry resolution, that superseded the previous resolution's provisions relative to access to executive session material.  House Resolution 581, the inquiry resolution passed in October, had standard executive session rules of the House obtained; and that meant that all Members of the House of Representatives had access to those executive session materials.  That has been what the rule is since October 8, and any Member has had the legal right to go over to the Ford Building and examine the executive session materials.
