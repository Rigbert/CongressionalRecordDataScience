President, I thank my colleague from Connecticut and my colleague from Arizona, Senator McCain, for working with me to address concerns that have been raised by the National Governors Association regarding the provisions in the McCain-Lieberman amendment that dealt with the standardization of State drivers' licenses. I believe the change which has been made, which will require an assessment of the cost benefits of any new requirements, is an important one.  I ask unanimous consent that two letters from the National Governors Association be printed in the Record.  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in the Record, as follows:                                                National Governors                                                  Association,                                  Washington, DC, October 1, 2004.     Hon. Susan Collins,     U.S. Senate,     Washington, DC.       Dear Senator Collins: On behalf of the nation's Governors I      am writing to thank you for your efforts in negotiating a      compromise on amendment language regarding minimum standards      for state driver's licenses. I know that you share Governors'      concerns regarding the security and integrity of state      driver's license and identification processes and appreciate      the difficulties that federal mandates, particularly unfunded      mandates, placed on states.       Due in large part to your concern regarding the mandates in      the McCain/Lieberman driver's license amendment, NGA was able      to make suggestions to improve the measure. We understand      that a provision has been added to require that the      negotiated rulemaking committee perform an assessment of the      benefits and costs of its recommendations. This change is      essential to help ensure that the federal government provides      adequate funding to states to implement the required      mandates.       Governors are committed to working cooperatively with the      federal government to develop and implement realistic,      achievable standards that will enhance efforts to prevent      document fraud and other illegal activity related to the      issuance of driver's licenses and identification documents.      We appreciate your willingness to work with states to address      our concerns. With all the changes included in the amendment,      it will provide a reasonable compromise for addressing this      issue.       Thank you again for your consideration and assistance. We      look forward to working with you during conference.           Sincerely,                                             Raymond C. Scheppach,     Executive Director.                                  ____                                                National Governors                                                  Association,                                  Washington, DC, October 1, 2004.     Hon. John McCain,     U.S. Senate,     Washington, DC.     Hon. Joseph I. Lieberman,     U.S. Senate,     Washington, DC.       Dear Senator McCain and Senator Lieberman: Governors share      your concerns regarding the security and integrity of state      driver's license and identification processes. While NGA      opposes federal mandates on states, particularly unfunded      mandates, we appreciate your willingness to work with states      to improve your amendment regarding minimum requirements for      state driver's licenses. As you know, NGA strongly opposes      the more proscriptive driver's license mandate provisions      under consideration in the House.       It is my understanding that your original amendment has      been modified to include two important changes: (1)      clarification that the standards that will be set in the      rulemaking process will initially apply only to newly-issued      and reissued driver's licenses; and (2) a requirement that      state elected officials, including Governors, serve on the      negotiated rulemaking committee. In addition, we request that      a provision be added to require that the negotiated      rulemaking committee perform an assessment of the annual      benefits and costs of its recommendations.       The first two changes are vital to ensuring that the      minimum requirements established under the amendment are      workable, do not unnecessarily interfere with existing state      laws and improvements, and benefit from the expertise and      knowledge of state officials. Likewise, the last change is      essential to help ensure that the federal government provides      adequate funding to states to implement the required      mandates.       Governors are committed to working cooperatively with the      federal government to develop and implement realistic,      achievable standards that will enhance efforts to prevent      document fraud and other illegal activity related to the      issuance of driver's licenses and identification documents.      We appreciate your willingness to work with states to address      our concerns. If all three changes are included in the      amendment it will provide a reasonable compromise for      addressing this issue.       Thank you again for your consideration and assistance.           Sincerely,                                             Raymond C. Scheppach,                                               Executive Director.
