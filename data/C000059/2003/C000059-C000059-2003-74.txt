Speaker, I rise today to honor and pay tribute to an individual whose dedication and contributions to the community of Corona are exceptional. Corona has been fortunate to have dynamic and dedicated community leaders who willingly and unselfishly give their time and talent and make their communities a better place to live and work. Mary Ybarra is one of these individuals. On March 22, 2003, Mary will be honored at the annual YMCA Ira D ``Cal'' Calvert Distinguished Service Awards Dinner.  Mary was born in Yuma, Arizona but has resided in Corona for many years. She began service to the community at a very young age and as a teenager Mary was constantly busy organizing food drives for the needy in her local community. This drive and special gift ofhelping others would stay with her into adulthood. When her children began elementary school she quickly became involved in her local PTA. This involvement paved the way for her never-ending community interest and desire to serve. Many city events and organizations have greatly benefited from her presence.  Some of the organizations that Mary has worked with include: ARC Angels, El Protector, Relay for Life, Day of the Young Child, A Day for Nicole, Little League Baseball, and Corona High Football Boosters. Mary has also chaired or co-chaired the following city events: the Health and Safety Fair, the Community Red Ribbon Week Celebration, the Community Blood Drive, and the fundraiser for Corona Regional Medical Center, ``An Evening to Remember''. Mary has also served as a YMCA Board Member, a member of several school site councils and has been involved in various school district committees.  Throughout her years of involvement Mary has been instrumental in organizing numerous community events to help the needy and the underprivileged. Mary's crowing achievement was using her connections and undeniable powers of persuasion to organize two critical blood and marrow drives. Community participation in these events was overwhelming. Mary's experience, positive attitude, humor, wisdom, and determination led to the perfect bone marrow match for two wonderful and well deserving children of our community.  Mary's tireless passion for community service has contributed immensely to the betterment of the community of Corona, California. She has been the heart and soul of many community organizations and events and I am proud to call her a fellow community member, American and friend. I know that many community members are grateful for her service and salute her as she receives the ``Ira D. Calvert Distinguished Service Award''.                          ____________________
