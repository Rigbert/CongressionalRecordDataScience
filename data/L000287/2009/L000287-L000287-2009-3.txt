Mr. Speaker, I yield myself as much time as I may consume.  H.R. 4217, the Fiscal Year 2010 FAA Extension Act, Part II, extends the financing and spending authority for the Airport and Airway Trust Fund. The trust fund taxes and spending authority are scheduled to expire on December 31, 2009, a few days from now. This bill simply extends these taxes for 3 months.  Earlier this year, the House passed legislation allowing the trust fund to operate through 2012. Unfortunately, the Senate has not considered this important legislation. Today's bill simply keeps the Airport and Airway Trust Fund taxes and operations in place until a long-term measure can be signed into law.  Air travel plays a critical role in our economy and in our lives. The world's busiest passenger airport, Hartsfield-Jackson Atlanta International Airport, is located in my congressional district. This airport alone has a direct impact of $24 billion on our economy. Failure to act will prevent the FAA from spending funds that are already in the trust fund. As a result, important airport construction projects around the country would shut down.  This bill also extends a number of authorizing provisions that are under thejurisdiction of the Transportation and Infrastructure Committee, led by my good and close friend, Chairman Oberstar. All of those provisions were passed by this body in a similar bill that extended these expiring tax provisions. If we fail to act on this bill, Mr. Speaker, I will repeat, if we fail to act on this bill, the trust fund will lose the revenue that we need for airport construction and the air traffic control system.  I hope all of my colleagues will join me in supporting this good and necessary bill.  I reserve the balance of my time, Mr. Speaker.
