 President, I say to my friend from Nevada, I share his frustration. These are three nominations that are going to be approved, one of them probably unanimously. The assistant Democratic leader and I have wrestled around with this now for the last 2 days, and we find ourselves still not in a position to lock in a vote on Cook and Roberts.  So tomorrow is another day, and we will try again. But it is sort of an indication of where the Senate stands these days, that even in a situation where you have three judges we know are going to be confirmed, we have not been able to reach an agreement after 2 days' work to conclude the inevitable, which is confirmation of these three judges.  Hopefully tomorrow will bring better results.  I yield the floor.
