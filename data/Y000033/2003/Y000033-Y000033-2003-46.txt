Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.  Mr. Speaker, I will state that the gentleman from Minnesota (Mr. Oberstar) makes a great statement, and I am well aware of what he said about the time frame.  As we know, my druthers were 6 months. That probably would not have solved the problem. But it is my goal to have a bill before this session is closed down, introduced and vetted, and it is our hope that we can do our job as the Committee on Transportation and Infrastructure, and that this House will move a bill over to the other body before the deadline; and I believe we can do that.  Now, whether the other body can achieve its goals with five committees that handle this legislation is another story, let alone the conference. So it is going to be very difficult. But our job in this House, and I hope the gentleman agrees with me, is to do our job and to move the legislation, to move the ball forward, get it to the goal line, and then, hopefully, they will have the wisdom to drive it over and make a touchdown with the help of the other body. If not, unfortunately, we will probably be back here, but that is not my intent. My intent is to achieve that goal. But now we have to pass this, get it down to the President, have him sign it so our highways across this Nation can continue to be built, the jobs will still be in place, and the infrastructure can continue to grow as it needs to be.
