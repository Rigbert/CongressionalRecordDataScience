Mr. Speaker, I yield myself 2 minutes.  I want to take this moment, we do have a couple of speakers who are not here who hopefully will get here before we conclude the bill. Again, I would like to just note that Under Secretary of Veterans Affairs for Benefits, Joe Thompson, is retiring on January 3 of next year. I include in the Record a tribute to Joe Thompson's 26 outstanding years of service to veterans from myself.  Mr. Speaker, the text of that tribute is as follows:               Tribute to Under Secretary Joseph Thompson       Mr. Speaker, in my capacity as Chairman of the Committee on      Veterans' Affairs, I want to share with my colleagues that      Joe Thompson is retiring from the Department of Veterans      Affairs on January 3, 2002, and thank Joe for 26 years of      dedicated service to veterans.       I applaud Joe for the legacy that he leaves. An Air Force      Vietnam veteran, Joe rose from a VA entry-level position of      GS-7 to Under Secretary for Benefits at the Veterans Benefits      Administration (VBA), where he and his staff administered a      $24 billion program of benefits and services. Joe used, and      was a beneficiary of, VA's services, including in- and out-     patient health care, disability compensation, education, home      loans, life insurance and veterans preference programs when      he returned home following his Vietnam service.       I know of few individuals more conversant than Joe on the      genesis and evolution of our veterans benefits system, a      system began in 1776 when the Continental Congress passed a      Resolution promising pensions to Colonial soldiers and      officers who were disabled during the course of service. Joe      believes passionately in veterans benefits because indeed      they are earned and, for some veterans and their families,      earned at a high price. He understands that on the business      end of every claim for benefits is a real person who served      our country while wearing the military uniform.       Joe liked his work, and he has been good at it. He has had      the ability to look at the VBA from the outside in, and see      the VBA's work as the everyday customer did. Joe was one of      the first to convene town meetings with veterans. I think he      did the meetings because he wanted these individuals to be      treated the way he wanted to be treated, with respect. Not      surprisingly, in 1992 Joe and his co-workers at VA's New York      City Regional Office received Vice President Gore's first      ``Hammer Award'' under the auspices of National Performance      Review. Later, as Under Secretary, Joe and his management      team, headed by Deputy Under Secretaries Nora Egan and Rick      Nappi, reduced the percentage of busy signals on 13 million      VBA phone inquiries from 50 percent to 2 percent. They      increased vocational rehabilitation placements by 24 percent.      They consolidated home loan eligibility to nine regional      offices, which lead to increased efficiencies.       And VBA increased the number of veterans helped through      military separation outreach centers from 1,000 to 22,000 per      year, including disability compensation exams and awards      before leaving the military. Much of this Joe did while      nationwide staffing levels were decreasing.       Mr. Speaker, I suspect that Joe Thompson will not climb      onto that Harley Davidson motorcycle he's so fond of and ride      off into the proverbial sunset. It would not be his nature      nor the wish of many veterans. Greatest luck to a civil      servant who like so many in the VBA gave America great gift--     lifelong commitment, honor, energy, and ideas, Joe, thank      you!  Finally, I would like to thank a large number of people who worked on this legislation and our staffs did actually yeoman's work day in and day out on behalf of veterans in general, but on this particular legislation. I want to thank them for their work on the bill, H.R. 1291, as well as H.R. 2540 which we passed earlier. That would include Patrick Ryan, our chief counsel and chief of staff, Darryl Kehrer, Paige McManus, Devon Seibert, Summer Larson, Jeannie McNally, Kingston Smith; and on the minority staff, I would like to thank Michael Durishin, Beth Kilker, Debbie Smith, Mary Ellen McCarthy, and Todd Houchins for their fine work.  This has truly been a bipartisan effort. I want to thank them sincerely. This legislation will make powerful difference in the lives of our veterans.                             General Leave
