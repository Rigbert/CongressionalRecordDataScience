How will we ever explain to people who are struggling from day to day to feed their families while they look for a job why it took us 26, 27, 28 days to extend unemployment benefits in the Senate? Because, on the other side of the aisle there was objection because Senators had ideas of amendments they wanted to offer.  Well, there are plenty of bills for ideas. This was a bill that was providing necessities of life for a lot of people even in their own States. I am glad that it appears we are finally going to move to it tomorrow, 4 weeks after we started the extension of unemployment benefits.  I do not understand how you can be for family values and not stand up for these families when they are facing the toughest challenges in life.  I thank the Senator from Minnesota for her comments.  I ask unanimous consent that on Wednesday, November 4, following a period of morning business, the Senate resume consideration of H.R. 3548, and all postcloture time be considered expired, all amendments to the substitute and bill be withdrawn, no further amendments be in order, and the substitute amendment be agreed to, and the motion to reconsider be laid upon the table; that the Senate then have general debate until 12:15 p.m., with the time equally controlled between the leaders or their designees, the Senate proceed to vote on the motion to invoke cloture on H.R. 3548; and that if cloture is invoked, the postcloture time be considered to have begun running as if cloture had been invoked at 11:45 p.m., Tuesday, November 3.
