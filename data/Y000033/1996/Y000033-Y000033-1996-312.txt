Mr. Speaker, today I am introducing the updated United States-Puerto Rico Political Status Act, H.R. 4281, which contains provisions regarding the role oflanguage in Federal and local law as developed in consultation with the Republican Policy Committee during our deliberations on H.R. 3024 regarding English.  I want to thank Members of the House Leadership, including key chairmen from various committees, for contributing their time and energy at this hectic point of the Congress in forging a consensus regarding the need for the Congress to consider this important measure affecting the people of Puerto Rico. I particularly want to commend Mr. Christopher Cox, Chairman of that Committee, for bringing to bear his considerable expertise and providing intellectual leadership in seeking the kind of compromise that could and should have been reached.  It was just yesterday, on Friday, September 27, that I introduced H.R. 4228, a version of the United States-Puerto Rico Political Status Act with proposed revisions we had hoped would provide a basis for final agreement on this legislation. It was expected that we then would take the revised bill to the floor of the House for a vote in the form of an amended H.R. 3024: the original bill providing for resolution of Puerto Rico's status through a Congressionally prescribed process of self-determination.  Although overwhelming approval of H.R. 3024 by the House was at hand, key sponsors of H.R. 3024 were not willing to go to the floor and ask for its approval without making a one-word change that would have brought the proposed revisions within the boundaries of limited government, rule of law and constitutionality. I had agreed to include the amendments as proposed in H.R. 4228 in order to move the process forward and try to resolve differences about the bill, and I stood by that commitment. But it became clear that unless there was a correction of one word the bill would not meet the most minimal test of constitutionality, and many of the bill's strongest supporters felt that was an unacceptable way to proceed.  To be specific, Section 4(b)(C)(7) of the amendments as proposed would impose a requirement that English be the exclusive language of instruction in public schools in Puerto Rico should it become a state. Although the Congressional Research Service had provided a written legal opinion to the author of this provision on July 31, 1996, concluding on the basis of Coyle v. Smith (221 U.S. 559) that this provision would not withstand even the lowest standard of constitutional scrutiny, its inclusion was insisted upon.  The commitment of the 104th Congress to English as our national language could have been carried out in the context of self-determination for Puerto Rico by simply changing the word ``the'' in the last sentence of Section 4(a)(C)(7) to the word ``a,'' which would have been consistent with the use of the word ``an'' instead of ``the'' in the preceding sentence. This imprecision and inconsistency, coupled with the failure to address a valid constitutional question, led to inability of several Members to concur in the process that would have been required to bring the matter before the House.  The sponsors of this bill had wanted to see it approved by the House prior to the adjournment of the 104th Congress because we felt that we had a commitment to do all within our means to implement the principles set forth in a February 29, 1996, response to Legislature of Puerto Rico Resolution 62 of November 14, 1994, asking the 104th Congress to establish constitutionally valid political status definitions for Puerto Rico. However, the desire to get our work done in a timely way, out of respect for the elected legislature in Puerto Rico and commitment to resolution of the status of 3.7 million U.S. citizens, was not seen by key Members as sufficient cause to ignore a constitutional flaw in the language, especially one that so easily and reasonably could have been corrected.  I believe in limits on Federal power, and I believe in the 10th Amendment reservation of rights to the States and to the people. I took an oath of office to uphold the Constitution, to protect and defend it, and while I was willing to introduce H.R. 4228 as I agreed to do in order to move this bill forward through the process, it was not acceptable to the sponsors of the bill to knowingly ignore a constitutional infirmity.  I am as ready as anyone to vote for a law that I believe to be constitutional even though I know it will be tested and may be struck down as a result of judicial review. That is how our constitutional system works. But that is not what this problem was all about. Here we were faced with a proposal to impose of the U.S. citizens of Puerto Rico, should they choose and should Congress grant admission to the union, a requirement that Congress has never imposed on any other State.  Making clear the determination and commitment of Congress regarding English as the official language of the Federal government in Puerto Rico should it become a State, and regarding continuation of the current law in Puerto Rico making English an official language, is something we could have worked out as the legislation moved forward. Those provisions were acceptable at this stage and could have been refined. But the imposition of a Federal requirement that violates the 10th Amendment and would discriminate against U.S. citizens in a future State of Puerto Rico has an almost coercive or even punitive dimension that should not be part of a democratic self-determination process.  It is bad enough that U.S. citizens residing in Puerto Rico do not have equal rights under the current territorial clause status. To suggest that inequality would continue if Congress admits Puerto Rico as a State is something to which the sponsors of this legislation would not be a party. With statehood comes equal protection and due process rights which Congress cannot take away, and the proposal to deny a future State of those rights knowing that such denial is constitutionally impermissible can only have the effect of confusing rather than clarifying the choices before Congress and the voters in the territory.  Ironically, the provision imposing English language as the exclusive language of public instruction would be constitutionally plausible if it were imposed on the Commonwealth of Puerto Rico in an exercise of the territorial clause of Congress at the present time. Only as a State or a separate nation will Puerto Rico be constitutionally protected from the degree of Congressional discretion that exists under our Constitution with respect to unincorporated territories such as Puerto Rico. A constitutionally guaranteed status subject to the same limitations on Federal powers as other States enjoy, or a status governed by the law of nations and treaties between sovereign countries, are the options that would enable the people of Puerto Rico to protect and preserve their language and their culture.  Only the current status leaves the residents of Puerto Rico, with their current less than equal statutory citizenship rights and impermanent political status, vulnerable to the broad discretion of a future Congress, which will not be bound legally or politically by whatever status arrangement may exist today. These are the realities that need to be understood so that informed self-determination can take place.  Misinforming the people in Puerto Rico that, in the event of statehood, Congress could do something that we know it cannot do in a State would impede rather than advance the goal of free and informed self-determination. That is why one word, not even a noun or verb, was too important for the sponsors of this bill to ignore.  The bill I am introducing today, H.R. 4281, contains a new Section 3(b), a new Section (4)(a)(C)(7), and a new Section 4(b)(1)(C) that will be the referred to as we develop legislation to be introduced in the 105th Congress which will address the issue of English as an official language in a manner that supports rather than undermines the process for free and informed self-determination under the United States-Puerto Rico Political Status Act when it becomes law.                          ____________________
