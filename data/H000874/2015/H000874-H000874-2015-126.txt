Speaker, as someone who has not served here as long as Tim--but for a pretty long time--I have gotten to know him very well when I have wandered across that side of the aisle. He always receives me with a very gracious attitude and is always very, very helpful. He has been a wonderful fellow worker on the floor of this House with all of us on this side of the aisle as well.  I certainly join our Speaker in thanking him for the service that he has given to this House and to this country, and I wish him the very best in the future.                          ____________________
