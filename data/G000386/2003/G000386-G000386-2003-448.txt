 President, I wish to take an opportunity just before we close down tonight to express some disappointment on my part that none of the specific small business and agricultural provisions survived the final conference agreement.  I truly believe there are many provisions in the final agreement that will be generally good for small business, but there are several specialty areas that continue to need tax relief in a special way to address the particular concerns of some industries.  Many of the items included in the original Senate bill are important to the bipartisan membership of the Senate. It previously passed the Finance Committee as well as the Senate. Again, I stress bipartisanship.  I plan to continue to work on a bipartisan basis with Senator Baucus, the ranking member of the committee, to assure that we are able to address the tax needs of S corporations, cooperatives, particularly farm cooperatives, small business excise tax problems, livestock drought relief through the tax efforts, and historic rehabilitation, just to name a few areas of concern.  As we finalize this growth package for the Senate's final vote and the President's signature, we will review the upcoming Finance Committee schedule and move forward with these important small business and agricultural provisions, all of which have bipartisan support.
