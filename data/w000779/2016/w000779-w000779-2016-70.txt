President, today I am introducing the Southeastern Oregon Mineral Withdrawal and Economic Preservation and Development Act to provide a boost to the rural Oregon economy and to protect the world-renowned Southeastern Oregon landscape. I am pleased to introduce this bill with my colleague from Oregon, Senator Jeff Merkley.  In Southeastern Oregon, the high desert landscape is home to hundreds of millions of acres of public lands that have hosted cattle ranching and visitors and locals for generations. These lands are supported by Oregonians who grew up there and who rely on them as a long-time linchpin for their local economies. The equation is simple: Healthy public lands mean healthy economies in this part of Oregon. And outside threats to those lands place local economies in peril.  I understand that companies, including foreign companies, want to come into Southeastern Oregon to explore for minerals, including uranium. This is deeply troubling because these mining operations are dangerous--to the existing local economies as well as to the environment, over all. By potentially hamstringing the creation of jobs in agriculture and recreation, and stunting the growth of small businesses, blocking mining in these areas protects this local potential.  Senator Merkley and I are introducing this bill because the risks posed by mineral exploration to the communities and their way of life are far too great to roll the dice.  Not only does our bill protect more than 2 million acres from mineral exploration and extraction, it creates and expands programs to support Southeastern Oregon communities so they can grow their economies and build on their strengths. These programs include grants to develop modern and efficient water storage systems to keep livestock out of rivers and streams and reduce the need to transport water. They also include infrastructure grants to improve roads for farmers and agriculture-related businesses, as well as job training for veterans and young people get started in agriculture. Finally, our bill would address broader economic issues by establishing an Agriculture Center of Excellence to expand local agriculture research, providing additional assistance to local and rural firefighters, improving water and wastewater systems, and deploying broadband service and cellphone towers.  With these investments in Southeastern Oregon, communities can create jobs, train a new generation of workers, and modernize their economies. All those gains can be achieved while protecting Malheur County's natural landscape and ensuring that the historic uses of the land can continue without interruption from harmful mining operations.                          ____________________
