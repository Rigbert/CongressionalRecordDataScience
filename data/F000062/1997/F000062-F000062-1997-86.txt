 President, I would be happy to respond. I am reading from a letter dated July 18, signed by Procter Hug, Chief Judge, U.S. Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit. What he points out is--he is using what I believe is current caseload. I would be happy to share this with the Senator. I read this accurately:       The total caseload filings in California, Nevada, Guam and      the Northern Marianas would be 5,448. The filings in Alaska,      Arizona, Hawaii, Idaho, Montana, Oregon, and Washington would      be 3,012.  The point is, with 13 judges, the twelfth circuit would have 239 cases per judge. The ninth circuit would have 363 cases per judge. That is an unfair allocation of cases per judge.
