 The statement of the managers accompanying the fiscal year 2003 Omnibus Appropriations Act, H.J. Res. 2, recommends $500,000 for USTTI compared to $1,000,000 that was included in the Senate bill. However, this funding level is the result of a misunderstanding between my office, Senator McConnell's office, and Senator Inouye's office. The Foreign Operations Subcommittee was under the impression that Senator Inouye wanted $500,000 for USTTI, as had been the case in prior years. However, Senator Inouye is sure that he had informed the Subcommittee that he wanted $1,000,000 for this organization. Does the senior Senator from Hawaii agree with my recollection?
