 President, I ask my colleague, the ranking member of the Budget Committee, then am I to assume that function is now $11 billion in the hole? And we are hearing our colleagues on the other side say: Don't worry, be happy; simply take it out of the function where there is no money? I ask my colleague, the ranking member on the Budget Committee, is that real?
