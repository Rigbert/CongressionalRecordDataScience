Speaker, I am proud to support H. Con. Res. 289, the resolution introduced by Congressman Al Green to commend the National Association for the Advancement of Colored People, NAACP, on their 99th anniversary.  Few organizations have had such a wide-ranging and long-lasting impact on the United States as the NAACP. Since their founding on February 12, 1909, the NAACP has been a strong, consistent voice for minority Americans. In the face of hatred and opposition, the members of the NAACP have consistently stuck to their guiding principle of nonviolence, and worked instead through elections, thepress, and the legal system. As a result of their leadership and tireless efforts, we are significantly closer to achieving political, educational, social, and economic equality for all.  As the oldest and largest civil rights organization in the United States, I congratulate the NAACP on their 99th anniversary. Their work over the past 99 years has made us a better and more tolerant Nation. I wish them the best as they continue their efforts to eliminate discrimination from all corners of our society.                          ____________________
