 President, I have had a chance to sit with my friend from North Dakota as a member of the Senate Finance Committee where all this legislation on welfare reform comes from. I sense in him a true desire to work out compromises and solve some problems that he believes will result if we give too much leeway to the States.  I presume his legislation, where he gives the States a choice of continuing with a Federal program or adopting their own, is the ultimate of discretion. I do not know who can find any fault with that discretion; however, there are goals that we have on this side of the aisle other than just choice and discretion to the States.  One of those is the fact that we have a terribly bad budget problem from 30 years of irresponsible spending. Some of that irresponsible spending--not all of it, but some of it--is directly related to the fact that we have programs that we call entitlements. That means basically that whatever is going to be spent, if you qualify, it will be spent and there is not much congressional control over the amount of money to be spent.  So his program would continue that entitlement. The Republican bill would end the entitlement aspect.  Also, we on this side of the aisle with our bill save $70 billion. The Congressional Budget Office has put a cost on the Conrad amendment of $6.99 billion over the next 7 years.
