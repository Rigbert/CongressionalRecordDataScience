The reason big projects can't be done is due to the costs. But a study has been done by Gary Ridley, who is one of the foremost authorities nationwide on this subject, and in that study he came to the conclusion that it costs an additional 30 percent off the top to do short-term extensions.  If there is anyone who is a conservative and wants to take the conservative position on this issue, the conservative position is to vote for a long-term reauthorization bill, and that is what is before us now. The current funding has no growth--not even for inflation. The DRIVE Act provides growth in the highway and transit systems in each State. For those who are interested, we have all of this listed State by State. The current law gives States and local governments no certainty. However, the certainty is there in the DRIVE Act. So we have every reason to do this.  Project delivery. We are going to be able to deliver the projects. We can't even start the projects on short-term extensions.  Freight. We have a freight section. We have never had a freight section before for moving freight across the country.  Transparency. Everything is there so that everyone can see every nickel that is used. This is the most transparent of all of the reauthorizations we have had.  Lastly, innovation. The DRIVE Act prepares our transportation system for the future. That is why it is so important that we get to it today.  I compliment the leaders for moving us forward and making every effort to get this done before the House goes home.  This will give them a good start on what to do during the recess.  I yield the floor.
