President, Aviation safety, as much as all national security, must be of paramount importance. I am increasingly concerned with reports from across the country that Secure Identification Display Area, SIDA, badges have gone missing, either through loss or theft. These badges, which grant access to secure areas of airports, allow employees to bypass traditional security checkpoints and, in the wrong hands, can pose a considerable security threat.  An amendment considered and adopted earlier today by the Senate, Thune amendment No. 3512, is aimed at addressing this problem and would implement additional accountability and oversight methods to ensure that these SIDA badges do not fall into the wrong hands. It would provide for further employer accountability and allow for increased fines and enforcement actions against workers that fail to report the loss or theft of a badge. These are well-intentioned goals and ones that I support.  I opposed this amendment, however, because extraneous provisions included in the amendment directly contradict bipartisan efforts in this Congress to reform our criminal justice system, including by reducing unnecessary barriers to employment for people with criminal records. The amendment will require the TSA Administrator to propose increasing the lookback period from 10 years to 15 years for background checks of airport and airline workers who have or are seeking SIDA badges. Under current regulations, there are a number of offenses that disqualify a potential employee, if the individual was convicted of the offense during the 10-year lookback period.  The amendment would also require the TSA Administrator to consider adding more offenses to the list of disqualifying crimes. Disqualifying offenses already include a number of low-level offenses, such as felony drug possession. These provisions would exacerbate barriers to reentry. The scope of the changes will still exclude many potential employees and lead to the firing of a number of current employees.I ask unanimous consent to have printed in the Record at the conclusion of my remarks a letter from Transport Workers Union of America, the AFL-CIO, the Association of Flight Attendants, CWA--the Communication Workers of America, the International Association of Machinists and Aerospace Workers, the Transportation Trades Department--AFL-CIO, the Leadership Conference on Civil and Human Rights, and the National Employment Law Project in opposition to this amendment.  I am committed to working with Senator Thune to ensure greater accountability for Secure Identification Display Area badges. It must be a priority. I hope that he and others will work with me through the conference of this bill to eliminate these barriers to employment for individuals with certain criminal records.  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in the Record, as follows:                                                    April 6, 2016.Oppose the Airport Security Enhancement and Oversight Act (S. 2361) as          an Amendment to the FAA Reauthorization Act (H.R. 636)       Dear Senator: On behalf of the undersigned organizations,      we write to oppose any efforts to expand background checks on      aviation workers as proposed in the Airport Security      Enhancement and Oversight Act (S. 2361). In particular, we      are opposed to the inclusion of S. 2361 as an amendment to      H.R. 636, the FAA Reauthorization Act, which is currently      under consideration in the Senate. As drafted, S. 2361 would      undermine reforms around the nation that have reduced      barriers to employment of people with criminal records, thus      representing a serious setback for the bipartisan criminal      justice reform movement.       The Airport Security Enhancement and Oversight Act would      alter the requirements for airport workers to obtain Secure      Identification Display Area (SIDA) badges by instructing the      Transportation Security Administration (TSA) Administrator to      propose increasing the lookback period on many aviation      workers' employment background checks from 10 years to 15      years. This provision undermines the goal of promoting      rehabilitation, and it conflicts with the substantial      research documenting that criminal history lookback periods      should not extend back more than seven years.       The bill also instructs the TSA Administrator to consider      increasing disqualifying criminal offenses to include crimes      that do not appear to be related to transportation security.      These reforms would have far reaching impact and exacerbate      barriers to reentry. As many as one in three Americans have a      criminal record and nearly half of U.S. children have a      parent with a criminal record, creating life-long barriers to      opportunity, including employment, for entire families. This      change will also have an overwhelming discriminatory impact      on communities of color, who have been hardest hit by a      flawed criminal justice system. Moreover, this proposal does      not account for the compelling evidence documenting the      impact of gainful employment on those who have previously      been convicted of a crime. Full integration into society is      essential to successful anti-terror programs and efforts to      lower recidivism rates. By requiring the dismissal of many      current employees who have worked in a position for years,      the legislation ignores these widely accepted principles.       We do support some elements of this legislation. The bill      would create a waiver process for those who are denied      credentials. This would ensure the consideration of      circumstances from which it may be concluded that an      individual does not pose a risk of terrorism or to security.      The waiver process would consider the circumstances      surrounding an offense, restitution, mitigation remedies, and      other factors. This provision is modeled on a very successful      program in the Transportation Worker Identification      Credential (TWIC), a credential that is similar to a SIDA,      which is used at secure areas of port facilities.       We strongly encourage you oppose the inclusion of any      amendment providing blanket categorical exclusions that would      increase background checks on aviation workers and act as      additional barriers to the employment of people with criminal      records. Thank you for your consideration.
