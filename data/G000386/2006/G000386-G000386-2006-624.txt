 President, I always anticipate the picture show that we are going to have now from the Senator from North Dakota. Anyway, I hope he will be tolerant. I have always wanted to engage him in some debate on these issues because I think he always tells half the story. I don't think he ever says anything that is wrong, but the whole story could give a different impression to the public.  I yield the floor.
