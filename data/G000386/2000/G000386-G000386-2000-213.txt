 President, for the leader, I will announce today's business.  The Senate will resume debate on the conference report to accompany the African Growth and Opportunity Act. By previous consent, at 10 a.m. the Senate will proceed to a cloture vote on the conference report. If cloture is invoked, debate will resume with the anticipation of an early afternoon vote on final passage of the trade bill. Senators will be notified as further votes are scheduled.  Following the disposition of this important legislation, it is hoped the Senate can begin consideration of the military construction appropriations bill.  The leader thanks colleagues for their attention and cooperation.                          ____________________
