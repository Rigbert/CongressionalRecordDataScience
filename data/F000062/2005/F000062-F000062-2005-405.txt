 President, I thank the Senator from New York. He serves as the ranking member of the Subcommittee on Administrative Oversight and the Courts of the Judiciary Committee, and he more or less heads all of the hearings with respect to these judges. He has done an excellent job. He is thorough. As everybody knows, he is a smart and intelligent man. He has made a very eloquent statement. So I thank him.  Last week I came to the floor and discussed the nuclear option. I recognize today that we are now faced with going down this path. I am concerned that once begun, it is going to be hard, if not impossible, to reverse it.  I find it ironic in his statement the majority leader said:       All Members are encouraged to ensure that rhetoric in this      debate follows the rules and best traditions of the Senate.  That is exactly what this side of the aisle is fighting for--the rules and the traditions of the Senate. We are standing up to those in the other party who want to break the rules and precedent of the Senate. So in reality, it is those of us on this side of the aisle who are asking the majority leader to follow all the rules and precedents of the Senate, not just the one he supports or any other group of Members might support.  Some have argued this debate is too inside baseball or, more appropriately perhaps, too inside the beltway and that Americans don't care about it. However, I believe that is wrong. To date, I have received about 16,000 phone calls, and they are running three to one in favor of opposing the nuclear option. The reason is, people are beginning to understand this debate is built on the very foundation of why we are here, why our democracy has been successful over 200 years, and why our Constitution is looked at as a model across the world in emergent democracies.  Let me try to explain, once again, why Senators take their role of advise and consent so seriously and what this nuclear option will mean, not only for the Senate and the judiciary but for our Constitution and our country.  First, Federal judges' decisions impact laws that affect our everyday lives--privacy protection, intellectual property, laws of commerce, civil rights, environmental regulations, highway safety, product liability, the environment, retirement security. And those are just a few examples. Who we confirm is important because their ability to interpret basic law, based on the Constitution of the United States, is critical to our functioning. Their independence to do that is critical.  Secondly, Federal judges enjoy lifetime appointments. They don't come and go with administrations, as do Cabinet Secretaries. They cannot be removed from the bench, except in extremely rare circumstances. In fact, in our Government's over 200-year history, only 11 Federal judges have been impeached and, of those, only 2 since 1936.  Thirdly, Federal judges are meant to be independent. The Founding Fathers intentionally embedded language in the U.S. Constitution to provide checks and balances. Inherent in our Government is conflict and compromise, and that is the fundamental principle in the structure of our Government. The judiciary is meant to be an independent, nonpartisan third branch.  I think John Adams, in 1776, made it very clear on the point of checks and balances and an independent judiciary, when he said:       The dignity and stability of government in all its      branches, the morals of the people and every blessing of      society, depends so much upon on upright and skillful      administration of justice, that the judicial power ought to      be distinct from both the legislative and executive, and      independent upon both, that so it may be a check upon both,      as both should be checked upon that . . . [The judges'] minds      should not be distracted with jarring interests; they should      not be dependent upon any man or body of men.  Now, that is the clearest statement of intent from our Founding Fathers, that the judiciary should be and must be independent. That is what is beingeroded with the partisanship and with the nuclear option. The Senate was meant to play an active role in the selection process. The judiciary was not solely to be determined by the executive branch. Last week, I described how, in the Constitutional Convention, the first effort put forward was actually to have the Senate nominate and appoint judges. Then it was later on, with the consideration of others, changed to allow the President to nominate. But the explanation in the Federalist Papers is all centered around the Senate having the real power to confirm, and that power is not a rubberstamp.  Because of these fundamental concerns, for centuries there have been heated and important debates surrounding judicial nominations. Today, rather than utilizing and preserving the natural tension and conflict our Constitution created, some in the Republican Party want to eviscerate and destroy that foundation. Blinded by political passion, some are willing to unravel our Government's fundamental principle of checks and balances to break the rules and discard Senate precedent.  The nuclear option, if successful, will turn the Senate into a body that could have its rules broken at any time by a majority of Senators unhappy with any position taken by the minority. It begins with judicial nominations. Next will be executive appointments, and then legislation.  A pocket card being passed around in support of the nuclear option states this:       The majority continues to support the legislative      filibuster.  Yes, they do today, but what happens when they no longer support it tomorrow or the next day? If the nuclear option goes forward and they break Senate rules and throw out Senate precedent, then any time the majority decides the minority should not have the right to filibuster, the majority can simply break the rules again. Fifty-one votes are not too hard to get. Get the Vice President, have a close Senate, and you get it. That will be new precedent again in the Senate. So once done, it is very hard to undo. That is why precedent plays such a big part in everything we do because we recognize that once you change it, you open that door for all time. It can never be shut again. If this is allowed to happen--if the Republican leadership insists on enforcing the nuclear option, the Senate becomes ipso facto the House of Representatives, where the majority rules supreme and the party in power can dominate and control the agenda with absolute power.  The Senate is meant to be different. In my talks, I often quote George Washington and point out how the Senate and House are often referred to as a cup of coffee and a saucer. The House is a cup of coffee. You drink your coffee out of the cup. If it is too hot, you pour it into the saucer--the Senate--and you cool it. The Senate is really formed on the basis that no legislation is better than bad legislation and that the debates and disagreements over judicial nominations ensures that the Senate confirms the best qualified candidates.  So the Senate is meant to be a deliberative body, and the rights of the minority, characterized by the filibuster, are purposely designed to be strong. Others describe the Senate as a giant bicycle wheel with 100 spokes. If one Senator--one spoke--gets out of line, the wheel stops and, in fact, that is true. In our rules, any Senator can put a hold on a piece of legislation and essentially force the majority to go to a cloture vote--essentially, force a 60-vote necessity for any matter to be brought to the floor. This distinguishes us from the House. Because we know it is such a strong right, we are very reluctant and very reserved in the use of that right. This is what has produced comity in this House, the collegiality. Everybody knows if you put a hold on something too often, you are going to jeopardize things you want. So what goes around comes around and comity, such as it may be, exists.  Now, when one party rules all three branches, that party rules supreme. But now one party is saying that supreme rule is not enough, that they must also completely eliminate the ability of the minority to have any voice, any influence, any input.  This is not the Senate envisioned by our Founding Fathers. It is not the Senate in which I have been proud to serve for the last 12 years. And it is not the Senate in which great men and women of both parties have served with distinction for over 200 years. We often refer to the longest filibuster in history, which was conducted by Senator Strom Thurmond and lasted for more than 24 hours. That was an actual filibuster, standing on the floor and orating, or asking the clerk to read the bill, or reading the telephone directory, and doing it hour after hour after hour, sending the message that you are stopping debate, that on the great wheel of comity one spoke is sticking out and stopping it. People listen because, unlike the House, debate and discussion has been important. It has been fundamental in our being, and our ability to stand up on the floor of the Senate and discuss issues of import before the world on television, for the Congressional Record, for all of the people who watch on closed circuit television, becomes a signal, I think, on Capitol Hill.  When Democrats were in the White House--I will talk for a moment on Senate procedure--Republicans used the filibuster and other procedural delays to deny judicial nominees an up-or-down vote. So denying a judicial nominee an up-or-down vote is nothing new. It has been done over and over and over again. I speak as a member of the Judiciary Committee for 12 years, and I have seen it done over and over and over again. So why suddenly is an up-or-down vote now the be all and end all?  Last administration, Republicans used the practice of blue slips or an anonymous hold, which I have just described, to allow a single Senator--not 41 Senators, but 1--to prevent a nomination from receiving a vote in the Judiciary Committee, a 60-vote cloture vote on the floor, or an up-or-down vote on the floor of the Senate. This was a filibuster of one, and it can still take place within the Judiciary Committee.  The fact is, more than 60 judicial nominees suffered this fate during the last administration. In other words, over 60 Clinton judges were filibustered successfully by one Senator, often anonymous, often in secret, no debate as to why. It was an effective blackball.  This is not tit-for-tat policy, but it is important to recall that Senate rules have been used throughout our history by both parties to implement a strong Senate role and minority rights, even the right of one Senator to block a nomination.  Republicans have argued that the nominations they blocked are different because in the end, some, such as Richard Paez and Marsha Berzon, were confirmed. This ignores that it took over 4 years to confirm both of them because of blue slips and holds.  In addition, if a party attempts to filibuster a nomination and a nominee is eventually confirmed, that does not mean it is not a filibuster. Failure does not undo the effort. I pointed out earlier where, in 1881, President Hayes nominated a gentleman to the Supreme Court. That was successfully filibustered throughout President Hayes' term. When President Garfield then came into office, he renominated the individual, and the Senate then confirmed that individual. But that does not negate the filibuster. It was the first recorded act of a filibuster of a judicial nominee, and it, in fact, took place and was successful for the length of President Hayes' term.  More importantly, while some of Clinton's nominations eventually broke through the Republican pocket filibuster, 61 of President Clinton's judicial nominations were not confirmed because of Republican opposition. Not only were they not confirmed, they were not given a committee vote in Judiciary. They were not given a cloture vote here or an up-or-down vote on the floor. So these are really crocodile tears.  Republicans have also argued that the reason the nuclear option is needed now is because the Clinton nominees were not defeated by a cloture vote. In essence, because different procedural rules were used to defeat a nominee, it does not count.  On its face, this argument is absurd. To the nominee, whatever rule was used, their confirmation failed and the result is the same: They did not get avote, and they are not sitting on the Federal bench.  As I said, 61 Clinton nominees, in the time I have sat on the Senate Judiciary Committee--so I have seen this firsthand--were pocket filibustered by as little as one Senator in secret and, therefore, provided no information about why their nomination was blocked. There was no opportunity to address any concern or criticism about their record and qualifications.  Just to straighten out the record because I debated a Senator yesterday: 23 of these were circuit court nominees and 38 were district court nominees. In addition, unlike what some have argued, this practice was implemented throughout the Clinton administration when Republicans controlled the Senate, not just in the last year or final months of the tenure of the President.  The reason I mention this is because there is sort of an informal practice in the Judiciary Committee--it is called the Thurmond rule--that when a nominee is nominated in the fall of year of a Presidential election, that nominee does not generally get heard. But I am not only talking about nominees at the tail end; I am talking about nominees who were nominated in each of the 6 years of the Clinton Administration in which the Republican party controlled the Senate.  The following is a list of President Clinton's judicial nominees who were blocked:------------------------------------------------------------------------                                                         Date nomination             Nominees               Court nominated to   first submitted                                                            to Senate------------------------------------------------------------------------                              Circuit Court------------------------------------------------------------------------Charles R.
