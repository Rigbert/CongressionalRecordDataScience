Speaker, I rise today to recognize The Summit School of Edgewater, Maryland on being named a 1998-1999 Blue Ribbon School by the United States Department of Education.  This is a special honor because The Summit School is a special institution. They strive for excellence and they have achieved that goal. The non-profit private school was created ten years ago to promote literacy among children ages 6 to 15 with unique educational needs. They opened their doors in 1989 with 25 students and now have 104 students representing six Maryland counties and the District of Columbia.  The Summit School's mission is to leave no room for failure. The teachers foster an environment where success is an attainable personal goal for each and every student. The School houses a media center, an extensive collection of books, films, tapes and computers with Internet access. In addition to their classrooms, the school has transformed a barn into intimate reading rooms. Their record of achievement thus far is reflective of their dedication to the needs of their students; since The Summit School's creation, seventy percent of the students increased their reading scores by three or more grade levels in 4 years or less. Seventy-five percent of all eighth grade graduates go on to attend public and private schools with only limited support but great success.  Mr. Speaker, The Summit School is one of those great success stories which are often overlooked. the hard working teachers and students of The Summit School have earned the right to be called ``A Blue Ribbon School.'' The Blue Ribbon Award is given to schools which display qualities of excellence, high quality teaching and up-to-date curriculum. The Summit school embodies all of these qualities and more.  The school motto, ``Teachers of Excellence'' guides the educators in this institution as they work hard to bring out the best in their students. Teachers conduct lengthy staff meetings on a regular basis to address individual student's needs. They also undergo year-round training to constantly enhance their teaching skills.  Mr. Speaker, I am proud to have The Summit School in my Congressional District. I ask my colleagues to join me in congratulating the teachers, parents, students and community members who have made this school an institution that should serve as a model for schools around the state and throughout the country.                          ____________________
