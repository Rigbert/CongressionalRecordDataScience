 Mr. Speaker, I would open my remarks by stating that as a Member of this House for the last 18 years, I never remember being so tired, tired of doing nothing, tired of not passing an agricultural appropriation bill, tired of not passing a foreign assistance bill in this House, tired of not passing an energy and water bill in this House.  The gentleman from Ohio in his remarks stated before that a number of points as far as corporate compensation needing shareholder approval was not before the body. He was absolutely right, because the gentleman from California (Mr. Matsui) wanted to make those important questions part of the real debate today and we were prohibited by the leadership under the rule that provided consideration of this resolution from doing it. What did the gentleman from California want to do as far as making sure real American citizens who owned stock can either approve or disapprove outrageous corporate perks?  Let us talk about corporate housing that is provided to executives. In the First Congressional District, I have had thousands of steelworkers lose their jobs. They have had to sell their house. Nobody is providing them any house and voting on it. We have talked about corporate jets and no one being able to vote on that as far as shareholders are concerned. When my steelworkers come out to Washington, D.C., they take a bus. When we talk about shareholders having an opportunity to vote on reimbursement for living expenses, the people I represent have lost their job and they do not have any money to live on. The only thing I do not have a concern about is sporting events, because they have all the time in the world to go to their children's soccer games and Little League games and basketball games because they have lost their job. They have lost their job. And we were not allowed today to vote on that issue and that is wrong.
