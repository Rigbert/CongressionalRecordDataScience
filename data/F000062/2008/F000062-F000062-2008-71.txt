 President, today I am introducing a private relief bill on behalf of Ruben Mkoian, his wife, Asmik Karapetian and their son, Arthur Mkoyan. The Mkoian family are Armenian nationals who have been living and working in Fresno, California for over a decade.  The story of the Mkoian family is compelling and I believe they merit Congress' special consideration for such an extraordinary form of relief as a private bill.  Let me first start with how the Mkoian family arrived in the United States. While in Armenia, Mr. Mkoian worked as a police sergeant at in a division dealing with vehicle licensing. As a result of his position, he was offered a bribe to register 20 stolen vehicles.  He refused the bribe and reported the incident to the police chief. He later learned that his co-worker had registered the vehicles at the request of the chief.  After he reported the offense, Mr. Mkoian's supervisor informed him that the department was to undergo an inspection. Mr. Mkoian was instructed to take a vacation during this time period. Mr. Mkoian believed that the inspection was a result of the complaint that he had filed with the higher authorities.  During the inspection, however, Mr. Mkoian worked at a store that he owned rather than taking a vacation. During that time, individuals kept entering his store and attempted to damage it and break merchandise. When he threatened to call the police, he received threatening phone calls telling him to ``shut up'' or else he would ``regret it.'' Mr. Mkoian believed that these threats were related to the illegal vehicle registrations occurring in his department because he had nothing else to be silent about.  Later that same month, three men grabbed his wife and attempted to kidnap his child, Arthur, on the street. Mrs. Mkoian was told that her husband should ``shut up.'' No one suffered any injuries from the incident. In October 1991, a bottle of gasoline was thrown into the Mkoian's residence and their house was burned down. The final incident occurred on April 1, 1992, when four or five men assaulted Mr. Mkoian in his store. He was beaten and hospitalized for 22 days.  Following that experience, Mr. Mkoian left Armenia for Russia, and then came to the United States on a visitor's visa in search of a better life. Two years later he brought his wife Asmik and his then 3-year old son Arthur to the United States, also on visitor's visas. The family applied for political asylum, but the 9th Circuit Court of Appeals denied their request in January 2008. Thus, the family has no further legal recourse by which to remain in the country other than this bill.  Since arriving in the United States, the family has thrived. Arthur is now 17 years old and the family has expanded to include Arsen, who is a U.S. citizen.  Both Arthur and Arsen are very special children. What is noteworthy about Arthur, is that out of the 562 students graduating from Bullard High School he is one of three valedictorians for the Class of 2008. Today is his graduation day. He has long dreamed of attending the University of California, Davis. He was accepted this past Spring and plans to complete a degree in chemistry. In addition to maintaining a 4.0 grade point average and taking a rigorous academic course load, Arthur also finds the time to volunteer at the St. Agnes Medical Center emergency room.  Arsen is following in his older brother's footsteps. At age 12, he stands out among his peers at Kratt Elementary School and has been invited to apply to the magnet Computech Middle School next year.  In addition to raising two outstanding children, Mr. and Mrs. Mkoian have maintained steady jobs and have devoted time and energy to the community and their church. Mr. Mkoian has been employed for years at G.A.C. Trucking in Glendale, California. According to his supervisor, he is one of their best employees, having earned a reputation for trustworthiness and skill.  His wife, Asmik, has also been working part-time for 4 years at Gottshalks department store. In addition, she has taken classes at Fresno Community College and has completed their Medical Assistant Program.  The family are active members of the St. Paul Armenian Church, and Mr. Mkoian is a member of the PTA of the St. Paul Armenian Saturday School.  There has been an outpouring of support for this family from their church, the schools their children attend, and the community at large.  To date, we have received over 200 letters of support for the family in addition to numerous telephone calls. I also note that I have letters from both Congressman George Radanovich and Jim Costa, requesting that I offer this bill for the Mkoian family.  I truly believe that this case warrants our compassion and our extraordinary consideration.  I ask my colleagues to support this private bill.  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill and letters of support be printed in the Record.  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in the Record, as follows:                                S. 3110       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of      the United States of America in Congress assembled,     SECTION 1. PERMANENT RESIDENT STATUS FOR RUBEN MKOIAN, ASMIK                    KARAPETIAN, AND ARTHUR MKOYAN.       (a) In General.--Notwithstanding subsections (a) and (b) of      section 201 of the Immigration and Nationality Act (8 U.S.C.      1151), Ruben Mkoian, Asmik Karapetian, and Arthur Mkoyan      shall each be eligible for the issuance of an immigrant visa      or for adjustment of status to that of an alien lawfully      admitted for permanent residence upon filing an application      for issuance of an immigrant visa under section 204 of such      Act or for adjustment of status to lawful permanent resident.       (b) Adjustment of Status.--If Ruben Mkoian, Asmik      Karapetian, and Arthur Mkoyan enters the United States before      the filing deadline specified in subsection (c), Ruben      Mkoian, Asmik Karapetian, and Arthur Mkoyan shall be      considered to have entered and remained lawfully in the      United States and shall be eligible for adjustment of status      under section 245 of the Immigration and Nationality Act (8      U.S.C. 1255) as of the date of the enactment of this Act.       (c) Deadline for Application and Payment of Fees.--     Subsections (a) and (b) shall apply only if the application      for the issuance of an immigrant visa or the application for      adjustment of status is filed, with appropriate fees, not      later than 2 years after the date of the enactment of this      Act.       (d) Reduction of Immigrant Visa Numbers.--Upon granting an      immigrant visa or permanent residence to Ruben Mkoian, Asmik      Karapetian, and Arthur Mkoyan, the Secretary of State shall      instruct the proper officer to reduce by 3, during the      current or next following fiscal year, the total number of      immigrant visas that are made available to natives of the      country of birth of Ruben Mkoian, Asmik Karapetian, and      Arthur Mkoyan under section 203(a) of the Immigration and      Nationality Act or, if applicable, the total number of      immigrant visas that are made available to natives of the      country of birth of Ruben Mkoian, Asmik Karapetian, and      Arthur Mkoyan under section 202(e) of such Act.                                  ____                                     House of Representatives,                                     Washington, DC, June 5, 2008.     Hon. Dianne Feinstein,     U.S. Senate, Senate Hart Building, Washington, DC.       Dear Senator Feinstein: It was a pleasure speaking with you      today regarding the pending June 20 deportation of Arthur      Mkoyan and his family. I appreciate you taking the time to      discuss this issue with me.       From the limited details I have been provided, it appears      there is no feasible judicial remedy that would allow Mr.      Mkoyan to remain in the United States. Therefore, from what      my office has determined, the only immediate solution      requires Senate introduced private immigration legislation.      As you know, doing so can result in a stay of deportation for      the subject of the legislation.       Based on the information my office is currently privy to,      Mr. Mkoyan's case appears to be one that would merit      introduction of this type of legislation. Although this is      very unlikely to be effective in the House, previous      legislation of this nature has been successful in the Senate.       I am aware that you have been willing in the past to      sponsor bills for this purpose. To that end, I stand ready to      lend my support if after a thorough review of Mr. Mkoyan's      previous case history, you find such legislation appropriate.       I will continue to review the situation as it progresses      and look forward to working with you in our efforts to help      Mr. Mkoyan and his family. Thank you for your prompt      attention to this matter.           Sincerely,                                                George Radanovich,     Member of Congress.                                  ____                                    Congress of the United States,                                     House of Representatives,                                     Washington, DC, June 6, 2008.     Hon. Dianne Feinstein,     Hart Senate Office Building,     Washington, DC.       Dear Senator Feinstein: As you are well aware, Mr. Arthur      Mkoyan and his family are facing pending deportation back to      Armenia. From the limited details I have been provided, it      appears that there is no existing judicial remedy which would      allow Mr. Mkoyan to remain in the United States. Unless any      further steps are taken, Mr. Mkoyan and his mother will be      deported to Armenia.       Please know as this issue moves forward I am ready to      support you where I can, and work with you to assist Mr.      Mkoyan and his family.       Thank you for your attention to this important matter.           Sincerely,                                                        Jim Costa,     Member of Congress.                                  ____                                              G.A.C. Trucking,                                       Glendale, CA, June 2, 2008.       I, Ashot Gharibyan, the owner of GAC Trucking do hereby      certify that Ruben Mkoian was one of my best employees. After      his leave my business slowed down because I could not find      any other driver as trustworthy and knowledgeable in his work      as Ruben Mkoian. He knows his job and has never given me any      problems. I still need him to improve my business without him      it will be impossible to put my business back to normal.       Your attention to this matter is greatly appreciated.                                                  Ashot Gharibyan,     President.                                  ____       Dear Senator Feinstein: On behalf of my son Arthur Mkoyan,      2008 Valedictorian of Fresno's magnet Bullard High School, I      write to explain why our family should be allowed to stay in      the United States. Time is of the essence as our deportation      is imminent, and Arthur has been accepted to begin UC Davis      this fall.       My husband Ruben Mkoian came to the United States in 1992      and applied for political asylum. After two years I came with      Arthur, and we became part of Ruben's case. After seven years      Ruben was granted an interview with an immigration officer,      but was denied. As the law allows, we appealed our case in an      immigration court. Our case was denied again, but believing      in our situation, we appealed to the Ninth Circuit.      Unfortunately, this effort failed last March.       We entered this country legally, and worked hard from the      first day. None of us have any criminal record. We respect      the laws, pay taxes, and admire America deeply. It is in this      context of civic respect that our sons were raised, and in      which we appeal to you for support. Each of the four of us is      valuable to the United States. In addition to his academic      achievements, my son Arthur serves as an emergency room      volunteer at Saint Agnes Medical Center in Fresno. My younger      son Arsen, who was born in America, is a standout performer      at Kratt Elementary School, earning an invitation to apply to      the magnet Computech Middle School. I am proud to have put      myself through Fresno City Community College, completing the      Medical Assisting program. And my husband Ruben was so      valuable at his place of employment that the owner, suffering      a revenue loss due to Ruben's detention, writes in the      attached letter that Ruben's return is economically      necessary.       I implore you to introduce into the United States Senate a      Private Bill that would halt our deportation. Our Immigration      and Customs Enforcement case number is A70-783-979. As a      mother, wife, and woman, I beg you to enable our sons to      fulfill their gift of intellect in the California they love,      and to enable our family to meaningfully contribute to the      America to which we so sincerely yearn to belong.           Yours most truly,     Asmik Karapetian,       Mother.     Arthur Mkoyan,       age 17.     Arsen Mkoian,       age 12.                                  ____                                          Bullard High School,                                         Fresno, CA, May 27, 2008.     Senator Dianne Feinstein,     Tulare,     Fresno, CA.       Dear Senator Feinstein: Artur Mkoyan has asked me to write      a letter of reference, related to a problem with his and his      family's immigration status.       Artur has been my student at Bullard High School for two      years, last year in Honors Chemistry and this year in      Advanced Placement Chemistry. He is a fine student, achieving      A and B grades in my classes and maintaining a 3.50 GPA      overall, including five Advanced Placement classes. I have      found him to be a consistent and reliable student, willingly      attending the weekly evening lab sessions and conscientious      about getting all of his work done. I have complete      confidence in his integrity.       I think he found it difficult to ask me for this letter,      because he and his family seem very proud and self-     sufficient. I know he will be successful at college next year      and will be an asset to the community when he finishes his      education. If I can supply any further information, please do      not hesitate to contact me. I am including both my school and      home contact information, as the school year is drawing to a      close.           Sincerely,                                                Christine Lindley,     Science Department.                                  ____                                          Bullard High School,                                         Fresno, CA, May 29, 2008.     Senator Dianne Feinstein,     Tulare St.,     Tulare, CA.       Dear Senator Feinstein: I am writing this letter for Artur      Mkoyan--who has been my student for two years. He is a bright      young man with potential for an incredible future.       Artur was in my sophomore GATE English class, performing      well and contributing the learning environment. As an      Advanced Placement student, he continued to work hard and      excel. It was always interesting to read his writing and to      watch his literary performances. He continues to visit me      during this--his senior year. I know that he has high hopes      for a college education--the American Dream--In the United      States.       I know that Artie was an immigrant--however, I did not know      of his family's troubles until recently. Apparently, they      have lived and worked In the San Joaquin valley for fourteen      years. He told me that their citizenship application was      denied, and that the entire family may be deported.       I was asked to write this letter to see if you could      intervene. I have the utmost respect for you as a politician,      as I have been an avid Democrat and a liberal and liberated      woman for many years. I hope that you can help this family in      their time of need. Thank you for your time and for your      consideration.           Most sincerely,                                                  Myrl W. Johnson,     English.                                  ____                                                 Armenian-American                                             Citizens' League,                                         Fresno, CA, June 6, 2008.     Senator Dianne Feinstein,     One Post Street,     San Francisco, CA.       Dear Senator Feinstein, Last evening, 5 June, the Fresno      Chapter of the Armenian-American Citizens' League held its      monthly meeting. During the course of business, the Arthur      Mkoyan situation was brought up.       By unanimous decision, the members wished to contact you      and to request your attention to this situation.       However, when I returned home and turned on the late news,      the report was that you have already intervened in this      situation.       I am certain that our members who have also heard this news      by now are very grateful and relieved.       The purpose of this letter now is changing from request to      intervene to appreciative thanks for your action.       Our League was established in the 1930's to help immigrant      Armenians. Even though our goal is still that and we have      come a long way, we still remain vigilant.       Thank you for your action. We will be eagerly awaiting the      final disposition--hopefully, a positive one.       Please contact us if there is anything else that we can do      to help the cause.           Verily,                                               Ms. Penny Mirigian,     Secretary.                                  ____                                             Holy Trinity Armenian                                             Apostolic Church,                                         Fresno, CA, June 5, 2008.     Senator Dianne Feinstein,     Hart Building,     Washington, DC.       Dear Senator Feinstein: I am writing on behalf of Mr.      Arthur Mkoyan. As you know Mr. Mkoyan and his family have a      deportation judgment which is due end of June 2008. Arthur      Mkoyan was two years old when his family came to this great      country seeking freedom and justice and they have worked hard      to achieve the American Dream.       Arthur will be graduating on Tuesday June 10 from Bullard      High as a Valedictorian. He is hard working, honest and we      should be proud of him because he is a great asset to our      country. Arthur has already been accepted to begin his      College education at UC Davis next Fall with Chemistry as his      major.       Dear Senator Feinstein I urge you to intervene and      introduce the Private Bill this week so that our country      doesn't loose a brilliant future scientist.       Thank you for your consideration may God bless you for your      services to our Nation. GOD BLESS AMERICA.           Prayerfully,                                              Fr. Vahan Gosdanian,     Pastor.                                  ____                                     St. Paul Armenian Church,                                         Fresno, CA, May 29, 2008.       To Whom It May Concern: I am writing in support of Ruben      Gabriel Mkoyan. Mr. Mkoyan was born in Yerevan, Armenia on      December 14, 1961 and resettled in Fresno, CA in 1992 with      his family: his wife Asmik (nee Karapetian), and children      Arthur (b. October 17, 1990 in Yerevan, Armenia) and Arsen      (B. March 13, 1996 in Fresno, CA). The Mkoyan Family is very      active in the Armenian community of Fresno, and valuable      members of the St. Paul parish. They are much loved and      respected by everyone in the community.       Mr. Mkoyan has worked very hard to provide for his family      and is a model citizen with his work ethic and active      participation in the life of the community. He has served on      the PTA of St. Paul Armenian Saturday School and has      contributed his time and means in the service of others.       I am saddened to hear that after all these years his status      in the United States is in jeopardy. As his pastor and as a      person who knows the family I stand in support of Mr. Ruben      Mkoyan and his family to establish legal permanent residency      in the United States.           Sincerely,     (The Rev. Fr.) Arshen Aivazian.                                  ____                               Fresno Unified School District,                                          Fresno, CA, May 5, 2008.     Dianne Feinstein,     U.S. Senator,     One Post Street, San Francisco, CA.       Dear Senator Feinstein, This letter is written on behalf of      Arsen Mkoian, a gifted sixth grade student at Kratt      elementary School in Fresno, California. Arsen and his family      are scheduled to be deported in approximately three weeks      from the United States unless a private bill is introduced in      the Senate to stop deportation. The Immigration and Customs      Enforcement case number is I A70-7S3-979. Arsen is a model      student and citizen.       Arsen has consistently been a role model for student      behavior since he began attending Kratt in kindergarten.      Attendance and parent support have been excellent. Arsen      maintains a 3.8 grade point average in his sixth grade class      this year, a 4.0 in kindergarten, first, second, third and      fifth grades, and a 3.8 in fourth grade. In addition, he will      receive Kratt's hightest honor, the ``President's Education      Award'' which is signed by President Bush and accompanied      with a commendation letter from President Bush. This rare      Kratt honor is based on stringent academic and behavior      standards students must meet for three continuous years in      fourth, fifth and sixth grades.       Socially, Arsen is well liked and respected. He receives      our monthly ``Bulldog Award'' every year which recognizes him      as a model citizen in his classroom. In fact, Arsen was      chosen to support a fellow student in need by teaming up with      him as a ``buddy'' this year in his sixth grade classroom.       Kratt's top leaders are chosen to participate in our      Traffic Patrol Club. Arsen is not only a member but was also      elected as captain of the Traffic Club this year, a tribute      to his strong character. Arsen's name also shows up on the      Math Club list almost every semester, an honor difficult to      achieve. He has been invited to apply to the magnet Computech      Middle School in Fresno because he is a standout student,       Arsen and his family have set high standards and worked      hard in our educational setting to achieve them. Senator      Feinstein, please recognize Arsen's outstanding effort and      achievement by your timely intervention of introducing the      Private Bill this week so we can keep an intellectually      gifted young person and his family in our state. We      appreciate your considering this important matter.           Sincerely,     Terri Bricker,       Kratt Elementary School Principal.     Randy Brown,       Kratt Elementary School Sixth Grade Teacher.                                  ____       I was acquainted with Asmik Karapetian in 1995. I met her      at the Armenian Saint Paul church, where we were teaching      children Armenian. We instantly became good friends mainly      because we both had similar purposes in life for our children      to raise well educated and responsible citizens for this      country.       Later I met her husband Ruben Mkoian, also a very noble      man. I remember when my husband and I visited them the first      time to entertain us Ruben played guitar while singing along      beautifully.       I will not forget how one day Asmik called me and gave me      the good news of their second son's arrival. She was thrilled      and so were we. I know their boys, Arthur and Arsen, both      very humble and nice boys. We admired Arthur's achievements      in school. He is graduating this year with an excellent GPA.       Recently Asmik called me in tears telling me her family      received a letter that they were to be deported. My family      and I were in utter shock. Why? Asmik and Ruben are two very      hard-working people with two wonderful children whose future      is very promising. It's tragic that after residing here for      more than ten years this would happen now.       I am humbly asking you to look the circumstances over and      allow Asmik and her family to live in this country. I have      faith that you will help this family to reach their American      dreams.           Sincerely,     Anahit Bagdasarian.                                  ____       Dear Diane Feinstein, The family of Ruben Mkoian is very      dear to me. I have known them for over 10 years and I'd like      for you to get to know them a little as well. Their entire      family, including each and every member, is very kind and      treats all with respect and always keeps their dignity. I am      proud to have had a chance to get to know them and I have      come to be very fond of how this family coped with what has      been thrown to them. My son, who grew up and attended school      with their eldest, Arthur, always stated how he admired his      qualities and good behavior. Arthur, a very intelligent young      boy, had plans preceding his acceptance, to attend the      University of California, Davis, his dream school. He worked      very hard since grade school and his acceptance alone is      proof enough that Arthur meets any standards imposed upon      him. Arthur and I would like to say every individual of their      family is outgoing, loving, kind, hardworking, and fit      amongst the most intelligent. They do not get into the bad      habits that most amongst us keep hidden. We need people like      the Mkoians in our society. They keep peace and quiet and yet      have firmly established themselves into our working field,      schools, and have the most positive influence over our      friends and family. It would be a shame to lose such people      if they were leaving on their own, and nonetheless were      kicking them out. I wish you could know them the way I have.      They have truly grown into the most admirable U.S.      inhabitants.       Thank you for your time and consideration. We hope with all      our hearts that you make the right decision.     Karin Antikyan.                                  ____       Dear U.S. Senator Dianne Feinstein, Our family is a great      family friend of the Mkoian Family. We have known them since      1993. They are a very friendly family. Our children grew up      with their children. Their children are amazing in school by      the grades they get Ruben and Hasmik are excellent parents.     They have been next to us on our good and bad days. We think      that they deserve to stay in the United States of America for      their children and the future of their lives. We can't      imagine how hard it will be not seeing, them, not only for us      but everyone else. In the future we will need this wonderful      family for a better community. Please keep all this in mind      because they are a great family and we wouldn't like to see      them out of our sight. We hope that you will do everything so      that they will not be deported and they will stay in the      United States of America. Thank you for your time.           Sincerely,     Ani Idzhyan.
