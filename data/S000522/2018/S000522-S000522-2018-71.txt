Mr. Speaker, October 10, 2018 marks the 107th National Day of the Republic of China, or ``Double Ten Day,'' as it is known in Chinese. On this auspicious day we not only have an opportunity to reflect on the bond between the American and Taiwanese people--our shared democratic values and historical partnership--but also look forward to strengthened ties of friendship and collaboration.  Founded by Dr. Sun Yat-sen on October 10, 1911, the Republic of China stands as a beacon of freedom and democracy on the island of Taiwan, and as a positive counterexample to mainland China which, under Xi Jinping, has turned to greater repression and contempt for human rights.  Let us not forget that the Republic of China, which had to endure many challenges and social upheavals during its tenure of rule in mainland China from 1911 to 1949, was the first allied country to be attacked in World War II. Our two countries locked arms and resisted the Imperial Japanese Army, with the first American aviators volunteering with Major General Claire Chennault and the fabled Flying Tigers to resist the Japanese from the air in 1941. Eventually, Japan and the Axis powers were defeated decisively, and the Republic of China became one of the founding members of the United Nations and attained a seat on the Security Council.  Despite some hesitant steps on our part, we again stood together against the Communists led by Mao Zedong, both before and after the Republic established itself on Taiwan, from where it offered support to our forces resisting Communist tyranny on the Korean peninsula. In the ensuing decades, the Republic of China on Taiwan emerged from authoritarian rule to become the first authentically democratic nation in Chinese history.  Taiwan has since become a beacon of hope and optimism in the Asia-Pacific region. Its people enjoy all basic freedoms, including freedom of the press, assembly, and religion. Through the Taiwan Relations Act and the Six Assurances, the American people have strengthened our bond with the people of Taiwan. Recent Congressional endeavors, such as the Taiwan Travel Act--which I proudly cosponsored--undoubtedly will lead to further cooperation and friendship.  It is perhaps because of Taiwan's democratic culture that China feels so threatened by it. Mainland China has launched a multi-dimensional campaign against Taiwan that includes many aggressive and provocative actions, such as the dispatching of warships, bombers, and fighter jets to encircle the island, as well as conducting live-fire military exercises near Taiwan's waters. Furthermore, in the diplomatic arena, China has worked assiduously to cut off Taiwan's diplomatic partners and block Taiwan from participating in international organizations. Taiwan has a comparative advantage in areas such as global health, and it is a travesty that for no other reason than to assuage China, Taiwan is prohibited from participating in critical fora such as the World Health Assembly. Now more than ever, Taiwan needs our support.  Mr. Speaker, the moral and geopolitical case for Taiwan is strong and consistent with the Administration's commitment to build a free and open Indo-Pacific. Taiwan is a model of democracy, prosperity, rights protections, and the rule of law. Citizens of the Republic of China on Taiwan should know on its 107th anniversary that that the American people, and the Congress, stand with them.                          ____________________
