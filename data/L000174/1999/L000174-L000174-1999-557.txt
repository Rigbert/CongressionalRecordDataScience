President, the reason the Governors of these States, all of them, wrote to the Democratic and Republican leaders in opposition to this is it would knock out the juvenile accountability block grant in the bill to 48 of the States--48 of the States. The only two that would get anything would be Kentucky and Mississippi. It would tell the other 48 States that their legislatures are irrelevant, their laws are irrelevant. We know better. That is true even in some States that have tougher laws than this would propose.  Because of that, I agree with the Governors, Republican and Democrat; we should not override our States this way. I oppose it.
