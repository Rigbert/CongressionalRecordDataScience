If the gentleman will yield one more moment, I said before that the only energy policy the administration has had is a set of knee pads so they can beg. The inappropriate conduct of trying not to allow us to produce energy, all forms of energy, in the last 8 years, has brought us to this point.  We have to wake up. The gentleman's bill does it. I am proud to be a sponsor of it. I hope everybody that is listening, and I know I am not supposed to say this, but all my colleagues who are listening, I hope they understand we had better approach this with the positive side of production.  We cannot, as we listen to Al Gore, conserve our way into self-sufficiency. That is impossible. Everybody knows it. As long as we are growing, and we are growing, our economy is growing, we have to have energy. That means all the forms of energy that we know, mankind is realizing today. To say no is wrong.  By the way, if I may, gas, natural gas, $2.15 last year, $5.40 today, it is going to $6 because demand is so great. Many of the great fields that would have been drilled, should have been drilled, have been put off limits by this President and this Vice President.  Let us have a policy of energy development and deliveries to our people so we do not have to go back. Instead of issuing knee pads to every American so they can beg for energy, let us have the ability to say, I am American and we have our own power.
