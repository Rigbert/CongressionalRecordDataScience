I note that he indicates that we probably will not be able to accomplish the omnibus by the end of next week and, therefore, a CR may be required.  I know that all of us feel that that needs to be accomplished as quickly as possible. I would point out to the gentleman in conversations that he says it is going to be on suspension. I will support it on suspension, urge my colleagues to support it on suspension.  Can the gentleman tell me, however, how long that CR will go that will affect us somewhat?
