I wish to speak to the amendment that has been offered by Senator McConnell, as well as the pending legislation.  It is a grim reality in America that each day, 17,000 Americans are losing their jobs. Each day, 9,000 Americans are facing new mortgage foreclosure notices. Madam President, 17,000 lost jobs and 9,000 have lost homes. In the process, some 11,000 Americans are losing their health insurance every single day. So the issue that was before us when we created the Children's Health Insurance Program has become gravely worse, and we are finding more and more Americans who are being squeezed out of health insurance coverage--46 million uninsured Americans today, including 9 million children.  We decided to make children a priority in terms of providing health insurance. What the Federal Government said to the States was: We will come up with a program, but we will give you more than the normal Medicaid share; we are going to give you a share that is enhanced so that you will consider covering these uninsured children. In that situation, many States took advantage of it.  I might just say, Madam President, that I understand Senator Grassley is in the Chamber and has a 10:30 a.m. Finance Committee meeting and I have a 10:30 a.m. Appropriations Committee meeting. Let me do my best to share the time so I can leave him with the remaining 10 minutes or so. Is that fair? I want to make sure Senator Grassley has a chance because we have to go to important meetings.
