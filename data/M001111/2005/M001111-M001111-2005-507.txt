 President, I rise tonight to talk about the budget that is now before the Senate. We have to remember that a budget is really a statement of priorities. It talks about how we choose to allocate our resources, and it says a lot about the kind of country we want to be and whether we want communities where opportunities are available to a few or communities where opportunities are available for everyone.  When I was growing up, my father was a World War II veteran. When I was in my teens, he was diagnosed with multiple sclerosis. Pretty soon he was no longer able to work, and my mother had to go to work to support seven kids. Fortunately, with some help from our Government, she got the help she needed to get a good job to take care of us and to take care of my dad. Without that kind of help, I would not be sitting here tonight as a Senator.  My family is not alone. Our country has a proud tradition of helping those who fall on hard times and helping them to reach their full potential. That tradition comes from fundamental American values, and one of those values is a belief in the importance of community.
