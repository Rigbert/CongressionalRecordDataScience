 President, I don't know of a single person who wants to see reimbursements cut to doctors who treat Medicare patients, but if Congress is going to step in and prevent it, we shouldn't do it by racking up more debt on the government's credit card.  On Friday, the Treasury Department announced that the government ran a deficit of $1.4 trillion in the fiscal year that ended just a few weeks ago--a deficit about three times the size of the previous alltime high. This should have been a wake-up call but, instead, within days of the sobering proof of Congress's chronic inability to live within its means, Democrats in Congress want to borrow another $\1/4\ trillion to keep doctors from getting a pay cut. Republicans want to fix this problem as well, but there are ways to pay for it. When this matter comes before the Senate, Republicans will offer ways to pay for it without asking taxpayers to take on another $\1/4\ trillion in debt.  It is perfectly obvious why Democrats want to resolve this issue outside the larger debate over health care.
