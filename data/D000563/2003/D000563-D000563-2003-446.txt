 I rise for a brief moment in tribute to my colleague from West Virginia. Over the last 6, 8, or 10 months, the United States has been making critical and historic foreign policy decisions which have reversed values and traditions that have guided this country for decades. One Senator has come to this floor time and time again to turn that bright, glaring light on America that is our responsibility to do, and the Senator from West Virginia has done it again today. I thank him for being that voice time and again in the Senate, and I hope that many of us will join in this chorus to accept our congressional responsibility to the people we represent, to stand up and ask the hard questions that Congress must ask of every President, regardless of party, particularly at a moment in time when over 100,000 of our best and brightest in service to this country are risking their lives. My tribute and thanks to the Senator from West Virginia.
