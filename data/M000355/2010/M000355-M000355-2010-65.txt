 President, I rise today to honor the life and legacy of Mrs. Jan Crase, who passed away on September 28, 2010, in Lexington, KY. As a resident of Somerset, KY, Jan was a prime example of a woman who gave back to her community. She valued education, faith and family, and was one of the hardest workers I have ever had the privilege of knowing. She attended Berea College for 3 years, and then transferred to the University of Louisville where she graduated with a degree in home economics. Even after leaving Berea College, she stayed connected to the college community throughout the years, serving on the Berea College Board of Trustees and the College President's Club. Jan was a caring friend who wanted college students to have the same positive experience she did in higher education. She helped raise millions of dollars for student scholarships, study-abroad programs, and computer funding at Berea College. As a member of Somerset's First Presbyterian Church, she saw a need to educate children not yet old enough to attend grade school, so she helped start the first preschool in Pulaski County in 1970. Since then, many families have benefited not only from the preschool but also from the youth groups and 4-H programs that Jan helped establish.  Starting youth programs and bringing the community together to raise money for a great cause were not the only things Jan excelled in; she was a determined entrepreneur and businesswoman. She had her hand in a variety of different careers, as a real-estate broker, an insurance agency owner, a home agent for Kentucky 4-H programs, as well as a dietician at Baptist Hospital in Louisville. Jan inspired everyone she came into contact with because of her positive outlook and determination in everything that she did. She was truly an upstanding woman, who spent much of her life giving her time and talents to better her community and our Commonwealth. There is no doubt the Commonwealth is poorer for her loss. My thoughts go out to her husband, James; her son, Karl' her two daughters Kim and Katherine; and her four grandchildren. The Commonwealth Journal recently published an article about Jan and the legacy she left behind. I ask unanimous consent that the full article be printed in the Record.  There being no objection the material was ordered to be printed in the Record as follows:       Somerset.--Jan Crase, 72, of Somerset, Ky., passed away      Tuesday, Sept. 28, 2010 in Lexington, Ky.
