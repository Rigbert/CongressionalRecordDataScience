The law requires that the Secretary of the Army make certain certifications concerning the missiles and the program prior to the conduct of the actual test. The required certifications must be made at the appropriate time, which is just prior to the actual live-firings. I understand that the requirement for these certifications has caused some confusion about what efforts the Army can take during Fiscal Year 1999. I believe the law is clear with respect to what the Army should be doing. The Army was directed to commence its efforts in Fiscal Year 1999. We believe that such efforts should include, at a minimum, development of a test plan and the letting of contracts, using the $15 million provided by the Appropriations Committee, to begin the systems integration work. Is this the Chairman's understanding also?
