President, reserving the right to object, and I do not intend to object, I just want to clarify one matter. My understanding is, and it is printed in the calendar, that there is already an order of speakers that has been established. I want to make clear that that will be recognized as we go forward today. I certainly will not object to the request of the distinguished minority leader. I just want to be clear that that will be the order of the speakers.
