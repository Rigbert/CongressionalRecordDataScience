In responding to the Senator from Georgia, we had a committee meeting on this with the GAO and we looked at how much that has cost so far. That has been 2 years ago. And still, almost the same number are there.  Now, there are other problems that come in, as the junior Senator from Utah brought up yesterday, that we are having a flight of expertise out of these areas, getting into other occupations, and if we do not do something quickly we are not going to be able to ever solve this problem.  I think for that reason we need to address this, address it in this bill. But again, to protect the bill so that we would have an authorization bill, I, personally, was willing, as you were willing, to take that out so we could come to the floor and take it up and work in a different work form--it may be the same form or a different form--but take it up as a floor amendment or in conference.
