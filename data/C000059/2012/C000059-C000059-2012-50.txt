Speaker, I rise today to honor and pay tribute to an individual whose dedication and contributions to the community of Corona, California are exceptional. Corona has been fortunate to have dynamic and dedicated community leaders who willingly and unselfishly give their time and talent and make their communities a better place to live and work. Mike Zeller is one of these individuals. On January 21, 2012, Mike will receive a prestigious honor when the Greater Corona Valley Chamber of Commerce names him the 2011 Citizen of the Year at the organization's annual awards and installation gala at the Eagle Glen Golf Club.  Mike began his career as an educator but 30 years ago he decided to make a change and open a life insurance business through Primerica. Mike's business offers clients options to purchase insurance, from term to life, and anything in between. Another component unique to his business is the marketing and structure of Primerica. Mike has been honored by Primerica often, and was again on January 15 as he celebrates 30 years of providing service to his clients.  In addition to his business acumen, Mike has also lived a compassionate and giving life. Twenty years ago, his son Chad was fatally injured on a bicycle ride. Both he and his wife Nancee refused to let this tragedy define their lives and in honor of Chad they formed a foundation, called the Chad Zeller Memorial. The foundation has held annual consecutive walks/runs to ensure public safety--giving thousands of helmets to children of all ages.  Throughout the many years that Mike has been a member of the Greater Corona Valley Chamber, Mike has been involved and supported the Chamber financially in sponsorships and door prizes. Every year, he is quick to recognize the Chamber for its involvement with the Chad Zeller Memorial Walk/Run events.  In addition to the Greater Corona Valley Chamber of Commerce, Mike is involved with service clubs and multitude of other charities. Mike has a philosophy to help as many people as possible and lives his life in service to others, regardless of their status in life.  In light of all Mike has done for the community of Corona, the Greater Corona Valley Chamber of Commerce named Mike their Citizen of the Year. Mike's tireless passion for community service has contributed immensely to the betterment of the community of Corona, California. He has been the heart and soul of many community organizations and events and I am proud to call him a fellow community member, American and friend. I know that many community members are grateful for his service and I join them in saluting him as he receives this prestigious award.                          ____________________
