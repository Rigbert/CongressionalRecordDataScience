President, I strongly agree with the Senator from Georgia. I truly believe our depots are a national asset and we should address the basic question of ``core'' requirements. Currently, there is no acceptable definition of ``inherently governmental'' functions or ``core'' which can guide the administration and the Department of Defense as they decide which functions should be competed for outsourcing. As we have seen in both Iraq and Afghanistan, the United States does not have the luxury of time in addressing the threats of tomorrow. Before we start making short-term decisions, we need to look at the long-term effects and requirements in support of national defense.
