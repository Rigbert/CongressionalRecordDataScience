Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from Pennsylvania [Mr. McHale], one of the original cosponsors of this legislation that passed last year.  Mr. McHALE. Mr. Speaker, I rise in strong support of H.R. 1, the Congressional Accountability Act, a piece of legislation which I suspect will soon become one of the most important internal reforms enacted by the Congress during the past 50 years.  In Roman times it was said that the people become more subservient to justice when they see the author of the law obeying it himself. That, in fact, was the very principle cited by the gentleman from Massachusetts [Mr. Torkildsen] a few moments ago in Federalist 57 as drafted by James Madison, the father of our Bill of Rights.  Although I suspect a vote on this matter will be bipartisan and overwhelming, that should not cloud the recognition that but for the tremendous courage and tenacity of our colleague, the gentleman from Connecticut [Mr. Shays], and the leadership of our former colleague, Dick Swett, this matter would not be brought before the House this evening.  Mr. Speaker, I believe very strongly that in our system of justice we cannot have two tiers. All members of our society, be they private citizens or Members of the Congress, are governed by the rule of law, the same rule of law.  I urge an affirmative vote on H.R. 1.
