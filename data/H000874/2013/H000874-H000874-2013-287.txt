At the local level, it is a bipartisan solution that we know works because these bonds were used effectively in 2009 and 2010 before they expired.  When it comes to making investments in our Nation's infrastructure, we should be able to support local governments that want to attract manufacturing and invest in making their communities safer, cleaner, and more secure.  By the way, if we create these jobs, the probability is these people who get these jobs will have health insurance and will be served, as the doctor would like, as I would like--hopefully.  But let us not continue to waste time on a bill that we know has a deeply divided Republican Party--as we're going to see on this vote, I'm sure--and will not get through the Senate and will not be signed by the President. We're just wasting our time here--political messages.  By the way, you've garbled your message pretty badly, as I understand from Club for Growth and Heritage Foundation and FreedomWorks.  So vote against the previous question. Vote for building America and growing jobs.
