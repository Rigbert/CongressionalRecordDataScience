Speaker, I am not going to read the remarks in their entirety, but I do want to highlight one thing Matt had to say, which I thought was so profound.  He concluded his remarks by saying: `` . . . their right to own an assault rifle does not outweigh our right to live.''  His right to live is guaranteed by the Constitution as well.  There were many others like Matt, Mr. Speaker, other student leaders from our area, who stood up and spoke out and roused their peers to be engaged.  Along with Matt, I want to recognize Brenna Levitan; Eri Shay; Emily Dohler Rodas; Michael Solomon; Nate Tinbite; Christian Crawford; and a student from American University, who helped them organize, Aaron Thorp.  These student leaders, and their many peers who marched with them last week, deserve to be heard in the Halls of Congress.  Mr. Speaker, we must not fail them.  Like the young leaders of generations ago, of centuries ago, a millennia ago, these young leaders are calling to our conscience to take action, and we must not fail them.  We must not fail the students and teachers and parents of Great Mills High School in St. Mary's County; or Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School in Parkland, Florida; or Marshall County High School in Kentucky; or Umpqua Community College in Roseburg, Oregon; or Sandy Hook Elementary School in Newtown, Connecticut; or Virginia Tech; or Columbine; or any other school that has witnessed the carnage of a school shooting.  Mr. Speaker, we must take real action--action to make our schools and our communities safer from gun violence.  I am proud to stand with the young Americans who walked out--and I thank them for their passion and their advocacy--and who say they do not want to go to school and be afraid.  One young woman said the first thing she does when she goes to school now is to look for a place to hide.  Mr. Speaker, we must do better than that. I will continue to work closely with the community in Great Mills in the days and weeks ahead, as we try to heal and move forward.  But, Mr. Speaker, in order to do that, this body, the people's body, who raise our hand and swear an oath to the Constitution and the laws of our country, designed to create a more perfect Union, a Union in which the right to life, liberty, and the pursuit of happiness is protected by the people's House, Mr. Speaker, let us act.                          ____________________
