Mr. Speaker, I rise today in order to voice my strong opposition to the conference report for the Terrorism Prevention Act. I did not support the House bill as my voting record indicates and I did not intend to cast my support for the conference report. I strongly feel this legislation is a knee-jerk reaction to a most heinous crime. This body has passed enough legislation in previous years to catch and punish criminals who commit these atrocious acts against humanity. Unfortunately, I cannot change my vote but I do wish to make it clear that I opposed the conference report for the Terrorism Prevention Act.                          ____________________
