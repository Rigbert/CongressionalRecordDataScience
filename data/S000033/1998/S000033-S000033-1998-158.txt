 Speaker, I would like to have printed in the Record this statement by a high school student from my home state of Vermont, who was speaking at my recent town meeting on issues facing young people today. I insert this statement in the Congressional Record as I believe that the views of this young person will benefit my colleagues: Statement by Erik Kenyon, Megan Willey, Kelly Cook and Justin Sturges                     Regarding Gay-Straight Alliance       Erik Kenyon: Thank you.       United Nations here from the Bellows Free Academy Gay-     Straight Alliance. You have already heard about gay-straight      alliances, so we are just going to tell you a bit today about      the way our school works.       Like most places in Vermont, St. Albans--over that way--is      fairly isolated. For the first two years of high school, I      just didn't date anyone. It was something I had no real urge      to do. I never thought, well, maybe I'm gay, because the word      never came up at all, until I went off to the Vermont Youth      Orchestra--which is really cool--I have to get a plug in      here; we have a concert tomorrow by the way--which is where I      met my first gay person, and that United Nations. ``That      makes sense. Why didn't I think of that?'' This is how      isolated St. Albans really is. And St. Albans is actually a      big progressive for the State of Vermont, if that tells you      anything.       And so, at the beginning of the year, some students got      together, and we wanted to start something, and the gay-     straight alliance is what we decided on, and here is Justin      to tell you about that.       Justin Sturges: When we began, it was a new thing, you      know, no one had even thought about GSAs, and so we were met      with a certain degree of resistance. There is a story that      goes along with this. When we first went into our      headmaster's office, there were three of us, Erik, myself and      another guy, who couldn't be here. He asked us, Well, how      many of you people are there? And that, right there, set the      mood. He has gotten better, and I think that we are the      reason, to an extent. It was this sense of newness, this      sense of an unchartered area that no one had been to yet, and      we broke that.       And we have been met with certain degree of resistance from      several people, from people in the school, from outside      influences, from adults, from the teachers.       Here is Kelly. Kelly is going to talk about an experience      of her's.       Kelly Cook: Hi.       Yeah. I joined GSA about three weeks ago, I think. One      time, I was walking up to a coffee house which we put on      quite often. And a     lot of people don't accept different people, like they call      me a freak at my school. I'm like: Okay, whatever. I am just      walking out with a whole bunch of people and suddenly these      people come by with a truck and throw stones at me. That is      the kind of stuff you have to get rid of.       And a lot of people just don't accept gay, bi, or different      people at all, and I will hand it over to Erik.       Erik Kenyon: But we have been making success this year, and      when we were starting out, there were some people all for us      and supportive, and some people that were really against us.      But most of the people were just sort of indifferent, and we      won over most of them. And we have been working on the rest      of them.       And a lot of the time this sort of change--well, the bills      and all the policies help a great deal, but a lot of the      times, it is that little things. Like an experience I had      just last week, just in the cafeteria, and just bringing my      tray up and dumping my garbage and all that, and behind me I      could hear a chant of, ``Queer, queer, queer,'' getting      louder and louder. It started as a stage whisper, which is      hard with microphones. But it was just--it is kind of      commonplace.       So I just did my thing, put all my stuff away, and then      walked over to the table where it was coming from--it was      quite obvious--and just stood there and stared at them. And      they were just like: Hi. What? They got really uncomfortable,      you know.       So I didn't say a thing, just walked away out in the hall,      did something or other. And I was really surprised, the boy      at the table that was doing it, came that and apologized to      me. He said, you know: ``I'm sorry, I didn't mean it,'' and      all that. And I was like: Okay, thanks. And he said, ``No,      really, I'm sorry. I was just trying to show off. It was      stupid.'' And he shook my hand. That was just, like: Oh, wow.      That was change, and this is how a lot of these changes      happen.       And a lot of other things have come up through the course      of the day, about things that people would like to get put      into place. And we can speak for some of those, like the      harassment policy, which doesn't get exercised enough. It      doesn't get exercised, because it is really difficult to      exercise, but through our group, we had have had, I think      three people so far who have gone through the process and      done the paperwork to file the complaint, and the      harassment has stopped.       We also put on a number of coffee houses, just to read      poetry and stuff. It is a nice, relaxed atmosphere. It was      odd at the first one, we had 100 people, out of a student      body of 1,000, so you get that kind of one in ten, ten      percent, and that was kind of neat.       We also have a Web page, put together for the GSA in the      state, to try to help us network. It is a start, but we could      use a lot more.       And, Justin?       Justin Sturges: What we see needs to happen--we are      obviously here for a purpose--we see, for the advancement of      such things as we have been doing, we find it necessary for      teachers to be trained. That is the one thing that has been      left out. You know, we have done what we can for the student      population, and will continue to try to educate them, to get      them to be more open to our organization and anyone who is      different from what they may see.       We find it necessary for the teachers to be trained,      because they are the source, to an extent, because they are      there in the classroom with all the students, because they      come into contact with every student in that school. And,      sometimes, they let things slip that, perhaps, they      shouldn't.       Outright Vermont, right here in Burlington, does do a      program, and we have talked to them about it, but there were      restrictions in our school because of the amount of      assemblies we have had and the amount of inservice time that      we have had, and we couldn't get anything off the ground. But      support for that is the one thing we are rallying for      currently, the one thing we see that needs to happen.       Congressman Sanders: Thank you very much                                  ____            Statement by Christie Nold regarding Child Labor       Christie Nold: My name is Christie Nold. I am an eighth      grade student at Shelburne Community School.       For the past several weeks, I have been researching the      topic of child labor in the U.S. and throughout the world.      This is a brief summary of my findings.       The problem: Around the world, there are 250 million      underaged children in the work force. There are nearly      300,000 underaged workers in the United States. Working      conditions include: Wages as low as $1.50 per day; sexual      abuse; physical punishment; exposure to dangerous chemicals;      and children chained to their machines.       Companies that utilize child labor include: GAP, Nike, J.C.      Penny, Esprit, Disney and many others. For example, workers      are paid 6 cents to produce a 101 Dalmations outfit that is      sold in the U.S. for $20.       Progress in the fight against child labor: As awareness of      this problem that has grown, there has been progress in the      fight to end child labor. My research has uncovered that our      own congressman, Congressman Sanders, has been the leading      spokesman in the U.S. Congress against child labor, and      specifically against Nike. His efforts are producing results.      As recently as Tuesday May 12, Phillip Knight, the CEO of      Nike, announced the following changes in his companies      practices: They will raise the minimum age of its workers to      16 at its clothing factor, and 18 at its shoe factories; they      will adopt U.S. standards or fresh air inside their      factories; they will ask individual foundations and rights      groups to monitor Nike plants worldwide; they will begin      having on-site education programs at their factories.       Congratulations, Congressman Sanders. Your efforts are      paying off.       There is still much work to be done, as the ultimate goal      is to bring jobs back to the U.S. and pay American workers a      living wage. The Foul Ball Campaign is another area where      progress has been made. For years, the vast majority of      soccer balls were made and stitched in Pakistan using child      labor. FIFA, the governing body of soccer, has determined      that it will not put its stamps on soccer balls made by child      labor.       The Rugmark campaign has also made progress. Hand-made      oriental rugs are commonly made by children who are chained      to their machines and guarded by men with guns. The Rugmark      label was created in 1997 to indicate rugs that were made      without child labor. Now, when you purchase an Oriental rug,      you can look for this label.       In conclusion, child labor continues to be one of the worst      social and economical problems in the world today. The goal      of our generation is to help eliminate this problem by:      Becoming aware of companies that utilize child labor and take      our business elsewhere; let the leaders of these companies      know that we have a lot of consumer power, and will not      purchase their products; support those who are leading the      fight against child labor.       Thank you.       Congressman Sanders: That was an excellently written and      presented paper. That was really good.                                  ____  statement by Amanda Bean, Rebecca West, Noel Baker, Jessica Dailey, Sarah McDonough, Nikki Erno, Louise Martinek, Stacey Zak, Jody Jernigan        and Celina Coglan Regarding Teen Pregnancy/Welfare Reform       Jessica Dailey. Jessica.       I would like to speak about teens and the resources that we      seem to be lacking. We found that there are very few      resources for teens either who are pregnant, or who aren't      but need help. There is the Lund Family Center, which is      pretty much the only one of its kind in the area. And we need      more help. There is really nowhere for us to go.       There is also a problem with people who aren't pregnant.      They have no really good teen pregnancy prevention programs      out there for people at high risk, and we feel there needs to      be put more of an emphasis on prevention and giving education      for that.       Congressman Sanders. Other thoughts? We would like to hear      from as many folks as possible. Please don't be shy. Who      else? Just pass the mike along.       Jessica Dailey. Nikki wanted me to say something for her.       Congressman Sanders. Sure.       Jessica Dailey. Also, the program called Spectrum for      people who have had children who are in SRS custody who are      over the age of 16. However, there are no programs like that      for people under 16, and a lot of people are falling through      the cracks. There needs to be programs out there for people      who are under 16 who are in SRS custody towed.       Amanda Bean. I know I am in SRS custody, and I have a      daughter. I am not 16, and therefore I can't go into the      Spectrum program because of that fact, and I have been living      at the Lund Family Center for a very long time. And there are      no programs for me except Lund, which, to me, feels like I am      staying there a long time, when other girls could be coming      into my spot, which could be helping them, when I have      already been helped, but, yet, I am not old enough to go into      that program that they have.       Noel Baker. I think that the schools really need to support      our decision. In my case, school told me to get my GED or my      adult diploma, and I am not old enough to do that. And I      really wanted to get my education and everything, and Lund is      the only resource out there that I could go to get my      schooling and to parent my son. I really do think that the      support of school would really help us right now.       Jody Jernigan. My name is Jody, and I'm 14. And I just      wanted to say, make the point really clear that there is not      much out there for teens, and pregnant teens. Lund has been      really helpful, but we need more out there. We need things      for teens to do so they are not getting pregnant, and also      things for teens to do that are pregnant or that do have      children, because there is nothing out there.       Louise Martinek. I just wanted to say that I think day      cares need to be given more money. Day care workers are like      making nothing and our day care has no money to do anything.       Jessica Dailey. About day care, I am unable to have my      child in the day care center at Lund because there aren't      enough spots open. It was unreal trying to find a day care      that would take subsidy. And even when they did, I am still      having to pay extra, and it is very, very difficult. And a      lot of the day cares that will accept full subsidy, workers      are being paid so low that you are not really getting quality      with your child care.       I think that something needs to be done about that,      because, I mean, it is pretty bad when you walk into a day      care and you have a bunch of kids, hardly any day care      workers, and they are not paying attention to     them. I have run into them a couple of times.       Congressman Sanders. Other comments?       Amanda Bean. I was wondering about longer hours of day      care, like not longer days, but being open longer. Most day      cares are 5:00 or 6:00, and what about people who work until      9:00 or 10:00 at night and have to pay someone extra, and      weekend day cares. I work on the weekends, and I have to pay      somebody unreal amounts of money to babysit my kid, and there      goes most of my money.       Congressman Sanders. The issue that we are talking about      obviously is a very personal and difficult issue. I very much      applaud you all for coming up, and I thank you for doing      that.                               ____________________
