President, I concur with what the majority leader said about being on the floor for the vote. I concur. I think it is an extremely important one. Also, under our unanimous-consent agreement, I will be controlling the time for the Democratic side. A number of Senators on our side have asked for specific carve-outs of time other than what has been set in the unanimous consent. I urge Senators who wish to speak to come to the floor and be prepared to speak.  I see my distinguished friend from Utah, who will be handling that side. We have all been able to work things out as traffic cops on this, but I hope everyone who wishes to speak will have the opportunity.  I yield the floor.                          ____________________
