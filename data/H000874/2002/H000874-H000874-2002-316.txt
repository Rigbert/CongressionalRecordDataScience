Speaker, the United Nations commemorates the beginning of the Space Age by celebrating World Space Week this October 4th through the 10th. Celebrated in nearly fifty nations, this week is designated to recognize the progress of technology, anticipate new economic opportunities and find new means for transforming life in space and on Earth to improve the lives of people around the world. The theme for Space Week 2002 is ``Space and Daily Life''.  The benefits of community participation in World Space Week are far reaching. It is a proactive way to demonstrate public support for space programs, encourage youth to learn about space and the possibilities of the future, promote institutions around the world that are involved in space and to foster international cooperation in space outreach and education.  I am proud to say that the 5th District of Maryland has a variety of dynamic activities that will allow community members to participate in Space Week.  The initiatives taken by NASA's Goddard Space Flight Center, the Office of Space Science Sun-Earth Connection Education Forum, the Living with Star Initiative, Prince George's County Economic Development Corporation and Maryland Space Business Roundtable have made it possible for every public high school and middle school in Maryland to receive information on World Space Week.  In today's increasingly technological world, it is vital to the future advancement of our country to encourage our youth to take an active learning interest in academic fields and career paths such as space, science and math.  Eleanor Roosevelt High School in Greenbelt, which is a school in Maryland's Fifth Congressional District that I represent, has responded to this need by organizing a panel discussion about space in conjunction with Goddard Space Center. This event is a testament to their dedication to academic excellence. Roosevelt High School has even been honored as a 2002 National School of Character, which recognizes their outstanding efforts to encourage the social, ethical and academic development of students through character education.  I would also like to commend the NASA Goddard Space Flight Center in Greenbelt, Maryland for its contributions to the exploration and peaceful use of outer space. The cutting-edge technologies they have developed have played a large role in attracting scientists, engineers and technicians who create next-generation spacecraft, sensor and instrument technologies which are used to benefit Maryland, our society and the international community.  Goddard is the lead center for the Living with a Star Initiative, a multi-year program that will eventually produce new systems, spacecraft and technology to study the effects of the sun on the Earth. In fiscal year 2002 I worked to help secure $25 million for the program and I will continue to work to obtain such resources to help ensure the success of such projects in the future.  World Space Week 2002 serves as a positive voice in recognizing past and future accomplishments and innovations in exploration, development and use of space and space education for the benefit of all humankind and I am proud of the role that Maryland's Fifth Congressional District plays in promoting this week each year.                          ____________________
