The bill would provide a new tool for law enforcement to deal with the problem of serious hoaxes and malicious false reports relating to the use of weapons of mass destruction, or biological, chemical, or nuclear weapons. These so-called ``hoaxes'' inflict both mental and economic damage on victims. They drain away scarce law enforcement resources from the investigation of real terrorist activity. They interrupt vital communication facilities. Finally, they feed a public fear that the vast majority of law abiding Americans are working hard to dispel.  Federal, State, and local law enforcement already have statutes which they have been using aggressively to prosecute those who have taken advantage of these times to perpetrate hoaxes about anthrax contamination. Existing statutes create serious penalties for threats to use biological, chemical, or nuclear weapons, for sending any threatening communication through the mail, or for making a willful false statement to federal authorities.  For example 18 U.S.C. Sec. Sec. 175, 229, 2332a, and 831 all have their own threat provisions punishable by up to life imprisonment. In addition, 18 U.S.C. Sec. 876 makes it a five year felony to mail a threatening communication of any type; and 18 U.S.C. Sec. 1001 makes it a five year felony to willfully make any false statement, or even willfully omit a material fact in a matter under the jurisdiction of a federal agency.  In a recent Subcommittee hearing of the Judiciary Committee, James T. Caruso, the Deputy Assistant Director of the FBI's Counter-terrorism Division, stated that there are at least 11 Federal hoax cases which have actually been charged under existing statutes since September 11, 2001. Just last week a Federal conviction was obtained in Oakland, California under 18 U.S.C. Sec. 175, which carries a statutory maximum penalty of life imprisonment, for an anthrax hoax which occurred back in January of 1999. Thus, existing Federal statutes are already being employed to prosecute these cases when Federal prosecution is appropriate. In addition, numerous State provisions are available and are being used to prosecute these cases at the State and local level.  Indeed, current Federal threat laws do not require that the defendant have either the intent or present ability to carry out a threat, which enables prosecutors to use such laws to prosecute these serious hoaxes. At the same terrorism hearing, Deputy Assistant Director Caruso made it clear that authorities are able to prosecute even ``non-credible'' threats under current Federal laws. However, while they carry high penalties, including a maximum of life imprisonment, at the same hearing James Reynolds, from the Department of Justice's Section on Terrorism and Violent Crime, indicated that these statutes can sometimes be awkward when applied in the hoax context.  What this bill provides, is a well tailored statute that deals specifically with the problem of biological, chemical, mass destruction, and nuclear ``hoaxes'', that is, actions taken with the malicious intent to deceive the victim. For instance, it gives prosecutors a means to distinguished between a person who is actually threatening to use anthrax on a victim on one hand, and a person who never intends to use it, but truly wants the victim or the police to think they have done so, on the other. In the later case the statute creates a new five year felony.  The bill requires that the defendant act ``knowingly and maliciously,'' so that we do not federalize juvenile pranks or the misguided though innocent spreading of rumors. For instance, a local prosecutor in Chicago recently placed an envelope containing sugar on a colleague's desk. He was administratively punished by being forced to resign from his job. In Utah, a disabled miner was charged locally because he put sugar and Nesquik into a junk mail envelope. In Anne Arundel County, MD, two juveniles were arrested after they placed powder in an envelope and did not even mail it, but it was found by someone else and reported, engendering an unintended emergency response. In Ohio, a security guard ``super-glued'' a telephone in a county welfare building, and when the glue left a powdery residue it caused a anthrax scare. In Williamsport, PA a firefighter is being prosecuted locally on a felony charge for claiming that he received a letter containing white powder at his home. These types of incidents do not merit a lengthy term in Federal prison. As the examples I have listed above demonstrate, we have appropriately serious ways to deal with cases when Federal criminal prosecution is not needed.  Indeed, law enforcement agencies or private companies of the conduct ``readiness testing'' so that they will be able to deal with serious chemical or biological weapon threats. For instance, three weeks ago a Kentucky sheriff conducted such a readiness drill by leaving an envelope filled with crushed aspirin on a desk at a county courthouse in order to test the response. Requiring a malicious mens rea will ensure also that we do not criminalize or chill this type of admirable proactive effort. In sum, malicious acts deserve Federal felony prosecution; innocent bad judgment and juvenile behavior do not, and neither do laudable efforts by police and private actors to preserve readiness for biological or chemical attack.  Another provision in the bill would provide for mandatory restitution to any victim of these crimes, including the costs of any and all government response to the hoax. An earlier Administration proposal, offered during the debate over the terrorism bill, would have limited such restitution to only the federal government. As we know all too well from recent events, however,it is state and local authorities, along with private victims, who are often the first responders and primary victims when these incidents occur. This bill would provide a mechanism so that they too can be reimbursed for their expenses.  For all of these reasons, I am pleased to introduce this legislation and I urge its swift enactment into law.  I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be printed in the Record.  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the Record, as follows:                                S. 1666       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of      the United States of America in Congress assembled,     SECTION 1.
