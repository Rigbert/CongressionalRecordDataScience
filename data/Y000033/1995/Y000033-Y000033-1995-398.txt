Mr. Chairman, I can understand the statements of the gentleman from California, but I would hope that they should have been directed at legislation down the road, because we have to remember that Anaktuvuk Pass is a small, small village that was put inside of a park, with certain understandings that they could do certain things, and then told by the Park Service they could not do those things.  This is a village that is high in the mountains above the Arctic Circle, with living conditions there which a lot of people do not recognize. What we tried to do in this exchange was work out between these people and the parks themselves to have a true exchange. If we went through the process of EIS statements and appraisal value, this would never have happened. This is the way that we have worked individually with a unique situation.  As I mentioned, Mr. Chairman, this bill passed the last time. There is no money in this bill. In fact, if we really want an appraisal, I think Anaktuvuk Pass got shortchanged. I hope the gentleman refers to this later on down the road.  Mr. Chairman, this is a good piece of legislation.  It should be passed and it should become law today. Mr. Chairman, I thank the gentleman for yielding to me.
