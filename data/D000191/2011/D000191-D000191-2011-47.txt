 You are either for States' rights or you're not. It seems on the other side of the aisle, when it is convenient to their agenda, they are for States' rights. But when it is not convenient to their agenda or their generous campaign contributors, the oil and gas industry, they are not for States' rights.  My State voted, the legislature, just last year for a 10-year moratorium on their lands as an expression of interest not only to ban the leasing of the lands within the coastal waters, but beyond that. We are serious about protecting our fisheries, we are serious about our very profitable tourism industry, and, yes, we are serious about wind and wave development. The gentleman made no sense. He said somehow this would preclude wind and wave development. Not at all. You don't need a clean air permit for something that doesn't potentially pollute the air.  So at this point I would just suggest that let's be consistent. If the State of Alaska wishes to push ahead, the gentleman from Alaska has the bill before us. The Republican Party controls the House. Great. He also had a rule that people from local districts and local States, the gentleman from Alaska, get to have their prerogative. This is our prerogative, representing the people of the State of Oregon.
