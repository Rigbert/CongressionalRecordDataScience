 Biden, Mr. Dorgan, Mr. Johnson, and Mr. Dodd) submitted the following resolution; which was referred to the Committee on the Judiciary:                              S. Res. 292       Whereas the American School Counselor Association has      declared the week beginning February 2, 2004, as ``National      School Counseling Week'';       Whereas the Senate has recognized the importance of school      counseling through the inclusion of elementary and secondary      school counseling programs in the reauthorization of the      Elementary and Secondary Education Act of 1965;       Whereas school counselors have long advocated that the      American education system must leave no child behind and must      provide opportunities for every student;       Whereas personal and social growth results in increased      academic achievement;       Whereas school counselors help develop well-rounded      students by guiding them through their academic, personal,      social, and career development;       Whereas school counselors were instrumental in helping      students, teachers, and parents deal with the trauma of      terrorism inflicted on the United States on September 11,      2001, and its aftermath;       Whereas students face myriad challenges every day,      including peer pressure, depression, and school violence;       Whereas school counselors are usually the only      professionals in a school building that are trained in both      education and mental health;       Whereas the roles and responsibilities of school counselors      are often misunderstood, and the school counselor position is      often among the first to be eliminated in order to meet      budgetary constraints;       Whereas the national average ratio of students to school      counselors of 485 to 1 is more than double the 250 to 1 ratio      recommended by the American School Counselor Association, the      American Counseling Association, the American Medical      Association, the American Psychological Association, and      other organizations; and       Whereas the celebration of ``National School Counseling      Week'' would increase awareness of the important and      necessary role school counselors play in the lives of the      Nation's students: Now, therefore, be it       Resolved,     SECTION 1. DESIGNATION OF NATIONAL SCHOOL COUNSELING WEEK.
