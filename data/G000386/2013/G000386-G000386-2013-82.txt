  I want to give an update, not only to Senator Landrieu, but for all the Senators. First of all, 10 days ago we started out with 27 amendments that were noncontroversial--or supposedly noncontroversial. Obviously, they were not all noncontroversial. That grew to 44 or 45, and I think we are back at 35 now on that list.  Remember, about 14 of those were included in the Hoeven-Corker amendment. They were included in that for sweetener--to buy people off to get their votes on final passage. So there are 14 that will probably be passed when we vote on final passage.  Last night my staff cleared 12 amendments, and that does not count several Republican amendments that were added to the list. We are making progress. Some are noncontroversial, but others are not. The one that the Senator from Louisiana mentioned that appeared to her to be noncontroversial, we suggested some technical changes to make it more definitive. If that is done, we can probably accept that.  Also, everyone has to remember that there are amendments on this list which are under the jurisdiction of other committees and not under the jurisdiction of the Judiciary Committee. Some of the amendments were rejected for that reason. Some of the amendments are technical, but some are more complicated.  I give my assurance to all of my colleagues that we will continue to work on this list.  I yield the floor and reserve the remainder of whatever time is left when Senator Cornyn is done.
