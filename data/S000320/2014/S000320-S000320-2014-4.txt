 President, I wish to honor the life and legacy of my friend John Key McKinley, a Tuscaloosa native, who passed away on June 12. John was a dedicated philanthropist and skilled businessman who will be forever remembered as a dear friend to the State of Alabama and to the University of Alabama.  Born in Tuscaloosa in 1920, John graduated from Tuscaloosa High School. He went to earn a bachelor's degree in chemical engineering and a master's degree in organic chemistry from the University of Alabama. He was inducted into Tau Beta Pi and the Scabbard and Blade Society at the University and was a member of the Capstone Engineering Society. While in college, John was also a cadet in the ROTC and rose to the rank of cadet colonel and brigade commander. However, John's contributions go on well beyond his days as a student--he was a generous benefactor and steadfast supporter of the university throughout his life.  After graduating from Alabama in 1941, John began his career at Texaco. He left Texaco in August 1941 to join the Army and serve in Newfoundland and Europe during World War II. In August 1944 shortly after D-day, John landed on Utah Beach and took part in battles across France, Belgium, and Germany--including the Battle of the Bulge as the Allied troops moved through Western Europe and onto Berlin. As a result of his unwavering bravery during the battle for the Roer River, he received the prestigious Bronze Star. He also rose to the rank of major during his service in the Army.  Following the war, John returned to Texaco, where he held numerous positions within the company. He excelled in research and development--holding over a dozen patents from petroleum additives and grease components--and also continued his education. In 1962, he graduated from Harvard University's Advanced Management Program. Less than 10 years later, John was named the company's president, and in 1980 he became Texaco's president, chief executive, and chairman until his retirement in 1986.  In addition to his work at Texaco, John served on the board of directors for several companies, including Texaco, Inc., Federated Department Stores, Burlington Industries, Martin Marietta Corporation, Merck & Co., Inc., Manufacturers Hanover Trust Company, Manufacturers Hanover Corporation, and Apollo Computer, Inc. He also served on the board of directors of the Metropolitan Opera, the Peregrine Fund, the Americas Society, Business Council for Effective Literacy, and Memorial Sloan-Kettering Cancer Center. John also took an active role in many civic and professional organizations, such as the Brookings Council, the Business Council--Washington DC, and President's Commission on Executive Exchange.  John's contributions did not go unnoticed. He was awarded the George Washington Honor Medal by the Freedom Foundation, the Gold Medal by the National Institute of Social Sciences, the American Eagle Award by the Invest-In-America National Council, and the Wallace Award by the American-Scottish Foundation. He was inducted into the Alabama Business Hall of Fame in 1982 and was installed in the Alabama Academy of Honor in 1983. Additionally, the Belgian Government presented John with the Commandeur de L'Ordre de la Courrone in 1984, which is the highest decoration given to a corporate leader in recognition of significant contributions to Belgium's economic sector.  I had the honor of knowing John and his wife Helen, who preceded him in death, as well as their two sons, John Jr. and Mark. I offer my deepest condolences to them and to all of their loved ones as they celebrate his many life accomplishments and mourn this great loss.                          ____________________
