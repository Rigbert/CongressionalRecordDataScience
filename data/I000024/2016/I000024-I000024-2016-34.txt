President, this is a very significant piece of legislation. What we just now moved forward on is the managers' amendment. Senator Boxer and I are the managers. I want to, first of all, compliment her for working very hard with us and our staff. I mean, they really did drill on this thing. So it is a major bill. We are supposed to have a WRDA bill, or the Water Resources Development Act, every 2 years. We went through a 7-year period from 2007 to 2014. Now we are back on schedule. I am happy to say that we are on schedule now to get this passed tomorrow.  We are going to stay on a 2-year schedule. Senator Boxer did a great job. It was great teamwork. We have moved a long way.  I yield the floor.
