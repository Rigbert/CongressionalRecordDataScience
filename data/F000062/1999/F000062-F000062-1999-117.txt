 President, today I want to call my colleagues attention to a new effort in California, the International Museum of Women. Elizabeth Colton, the president of the Board of Directors of the International Museum of Women is building broad support among community leaders and public officials. The museum will be built in San Francisco, since this city has roots which reach virtually every corner of the globe. The museum will start construction in 2003, and the total cost of the museum is $50 million.  Women have made important contributions and this museum can help us to better explore the role of women in history. This museum will seek to not simply bring recognition to women and their contributions, but it will re-examine history to more accurately incorporate the effects and implications of women's actions and ideas. The museum's educational programs can play a significant role in shaping how society views women and girls.  In addition, International Museum of Women can provide role models for women and girls, furnish a new context for historical interpretations, and portray the importance and existence of the historic, ongoing fight for equal rights. This museum can open the doors to endless possibilities and limitless opportunities for females.  I call on my colleagues to join me in saluting the International Museum ofWomen, as one way to eradicate inequality and open doors to opportunity.                          ____________________
