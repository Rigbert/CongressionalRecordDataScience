Speaker, by the middle of the next millennium, the world's population is expected to reach 8 to 12 billion people. Right now we are adding about 86 million people annually. All of us must find common ground on the issues of land and resource use and sustainable communities.  Recently, a groundbreaking took place in North Toledo to provide 49 families with new homes in the North River neighborhood. That event gave me great hope that, as a community--a multitude of jurisdictions in one of the most bountiful regions of the world--people in northwest Ohio are improving the quality of life in existing neighborhoods and making it attractive for commercial investment on reusable land--precious land.  As an Urban Planner myself, I hope that gone are the days that we neglect and abandon what has been developed for another site at the expense of the original location.  To promote a livable community, cooperation between public and private institutions is essential. Cooperation between neighboring communities, cities, suburbs and rural areas will be the key to meeting the needs of the 21st century--greater populations, more traffic, sprawl, and pollution.  We must have as our goal, a community that works together for our common good, not just individual special interests.  Together, individuals, families, businesses and civic organizations must become involved in local planning, to ensure that every voice is heard and all concerns are represented at the table.  By planning more wisely for more livable communities, we will be able to preserve our precious open spaces for generations to come. Such a conscious vision will enable families to enjoy our country's natural beauty. And we'll be able to preserve our precious farms and prime farmland which America has been losing at alarming record rates.  U.S. Census figures show that from 1982 to 1992 Ohio lost 1.2 million acres of irreplaceable farmland to development. But unfortunately, this isn't native only to Ohio. Across the nation, prime farmland with the highest productivity is being lost. Globally, these sources of food, fiber and vegetable production cannot be reinvented.  I'm pleased that the state of Ohio has stepped up to the plate and passed a farmland preservation bill. As a co-author of national legislation to preserve for agricultural production, I am gratified that our state will now join dozens of other in adopting a policy for land reuse and for the voluntary set-aside of land for agricultural production in perpetuity.  Preserving our farmlands means revitalizing the core of our cities, townships and villages. The Mayor of Fostoria, Ohio had it right recently when he said, ``the best thing I can do to protect farmland is make my city worth investing in.''  For America's first two centuries, our communities have grown without more constraints. We could easily cast away old city neighborhoods for the suburbs and treat prime productive land as though it were no different from asphalt. Those choices won't be the same for those who live in the 21st century as the world's population reaches eight to twelve billion people.  I'm reminded of the words of Daniel Webster:  Let us develop the resources of our land, call forth its powers, build up its institutions, promote all its great interests, and see whether we also, in our day and generation, may not perform something worthy to be remembered.  We must put people and vision back at the center of our planning efforts. We must be conscious of our region and the earth as an ecosystem that needs tending. A common vision for an American future that is sustainable must be our objective.                          ____________________
