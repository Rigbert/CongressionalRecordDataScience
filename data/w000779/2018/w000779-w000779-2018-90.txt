President, on February 2, Portland lost a dedicated man of faith, Rev. W.G. Hardy, Jr. As our community mourns the loss of this great spiritual leader, we also pause to celebrate all he did for our community.  During the 22 years that Pastor Hardy served as senior pastor of the Highland Christian Center in northeast Portland, he committed himself heart and soul to helping every person who walked through the doors of his church, as well as those who did not.  Preaching wasn't just a duty for Pastor Hardy; it was a calling that helped Portland be a better place to live. Many will remember Pastor Hardy inviting any and all to come to his church. Often you would see him on the weekends supporting the church's many activities and events. He spent endless hours advocating for those who are homeless, working with nonprofits and local governments to find solutions on mental illness, and developing programs to prevent young people from falling through the cracks.  Pastor Hardy was justifiably proud that Highland Christian Center hosted the annual ``Keep Alive the Dream'' events, which earned official designation from the National Martin Luther King Jr. Federal Holiday Commission. Over the years, I had the fortune of attending this unique program, recognized as the largest tribute to Dr. King in the State of Oregon.  As a third-generation preacher, Pastor Hardy understood and valued the power of faith. He was steadfast in his advocacy and had the ear and phone numbers of countless city, county, and State leaders. His passion and energy for this work showed in his powerful and poignant sermons. Every time I would see Pastor Hardy, whether after one of his many inspiring services or during a visit to Washington, DC, he always had a smile on his face and an important issue to discuss.  Through his beloved wife, Ali Hardy, his children, grandchildren, and a host of other loving relatives, Pastor Hardy's life and legacy will last forever throughout Portland. His good work will continue through the leaders he helped lift up and create. While this is a loss for many, the gains he made will be felt by many for years to come.                          ____________________
