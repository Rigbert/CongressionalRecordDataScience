 President, I wish to express my support for the Defend Trade Secrets Act and to explain some of the changes that were made in the Judiciary Committee to ensure the bill does not adversely impact California.  First, let me congratulate Senators Hatch and Coons on their work on this bill.  This bill will help protect vital trade secrets of American companies by providing a Federal cause of action for the theft of trade secrets. It will ensure there is access to Federal courts in these cases. During consideration of the bill in the Judiciary Committee, some members, including me, voiced concern that the injunctive relief authorized under the bill could override State law limitations that safeguard the ability of an employee to move from one job to another. This is known as employee mobility. Some States, including California, have strong public policies or laws in favor of employee mobility. These are reflected in some State court precedent or in laws that are on the books.  When this bill came before the Judiciary Committee, there was a serious concern that a Federal law without similar limits would override the law in those States and create impairments on employees' ability to move from job to job. If that were to happen, it could be a major limitation on employee mobility that does not exist today. To prevent this, the bill now includes language to preserve the law in California and elsewhere. Specifically, the bill bars an injunction ``to prevent a person from entering into an employment relationship,'' period. In other words, relief under this bill cannot include an injunction barring a person from starting a new job. As I understand it, thisreflects the practice under current law in California.  Secondly, any injunction that is issued cannot be based ``merely on the information the person knows.'' This language makes clear that any injunctive relief must be based on real evidence of a threat to the trade secrets, not simply on the employee's knowledge.  Third, the bill also includes language to ensure that any injunction issued under the bill does not ``otherwise conflict with an applicable State law prohibiting restraints on the practice of a lawful profession, trade, or business.''  This language will ensure that States are able to protect against the use of this bill to create unlawful restraints on business practices within their States. In fact, California's strong public policy in favor of employee mobility stems from such a law, which is located at section 16600 in the State's business and professions code. This law states: ``Except as provided in this chapter, every contract by which anyone is restrained from engaging in a lawful profession, trade, or business of any kind is to that extent void.''  As I said in the markup of this bill in the Judiciary Committee and as is noted in the Judiciary Committee's report, if a State's trade secrets law authorizes additional remedies beyond what this bill authorizes, those State law remedies will still be available.  I felt it was important to protect California, which has a vibrant and dynamic economy of almost 40 million people in so many sectors.  I am very grateful that Senators Hatch and Coons were willing to accommodate my concerns, and I am pleased to support this bill and to cosponsor it.  Thank you very much.                          ____________________
