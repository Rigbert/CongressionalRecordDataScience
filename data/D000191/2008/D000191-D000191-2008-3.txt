  Mr. DeFAZIO. The legislation the House will take up tomorrow that was jammed through the Senate last night will do nothing for the weakening fundamentals in the United States. It isn't going to help with declining housing prices, foreclosures, job loss, income disparity, or lack of health care. None of those things will be addressed. It doesn't address the crumbling infrastructure. It is not aimed at the real economy. It is aimed at the fraud, the speculative activity and the bad bets made by Wall Street executives.  Now they purport this is necessary to free up credit, and some are going to say I am voting for the bill because it lifts the FDIC limit. The administration can do that without spending $700 billion. They are going to say I'm doing it because it changed the mark-to-market rules. Those two things are critical to my banks at home in Oregon, but you can do that without spending $700 billion with a stroke of the pen.  It leaves out one other critical measure, the certificate's net worth that it would use for the savings and loan. That would take legislation, and that is not in here.  We are going to spend $700 billion to solve a problem that could perhaps be resolved for no cost to the American taxpayer. If we are going to borrow money, borrow it to invest in America's Main Street, not Wall Street.                          ____________________
