REID. Yes. I say to my friend, I talked about the $175 million. I did not talk today about the $255 million for Afghan refugees. I say to my friend from Illinois, all one has to do is turn on the news by mistake and in an instant one will find out the problems of these refugees. They are trying to escape the Taliban. They are trying to get out of that country. They want to get anyplace they can to escape the Taliban. They are starving. Their families are spread out all over. Sometimes they are together; sometimes they are not. Some have walked over the passes, such as the Khyber pass and other passes that are almost impassible. They have done it.  The Senator from Illinois is right, that money is being held up.
