Speaker, I thank the gentleman for yielding time to me.  Mr. Speaker, the previous speaker in my opinion is absolutely 180 degrees wrong. A vote for the previous question, if we could get 21 Republicans to join Bob Dole, who seeks, of course, to lead all the Republicans and our country, just 21 voting against the previous question, we will offer a clean continuing resolution, yes, to open the Government.  Why do we want to open the Government? So that we will not continue to pursue a morally indefensible policy, the gentleman from Georgia, Newt Gingrich, January, this year, of continuing to use Federal employees as the pawn, as the hostage, as the bludgeon to force the President to do something. That is not what our democracy is about. Our democracy is about pursuing constitutional ways and means to pass legislation and make policy.  Mr. Speaker, let us join together, extricate the Federal employees from this fight, which as the Speaker says is morally indefensible, and go on with doing what I think we need to do, a balanced budget, but with good personnel policies.
