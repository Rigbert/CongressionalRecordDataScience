President, when Justice Kagan was up for nomination, I was chairman of the Senate Judiciary Committee. I, along with then Ranking Member Jeff Sessions, sent a letter saying that we needed all of her White House records. We received 99 percent of those records.  Now for Judge Kavanaugh's nomination we are told, after being carefully selected, that we can only have 3 percent of his records. It is an interesting standard. Republicans want all of it when there is a Democratic President, for a woman who was nominated by a Democrat. Now, when the Republicans nominate this man, they say: We will selectively give you 3 percent. It is an interesting double standard. It makes me wonder what there is to hide in there. Why not take the time to see it all?  If I am going to vote on a lifetime appointment--I voted for a lot of Republican nominees for the Supreme Court and other courts--I want to see the whole record. I don't want, a month after I voted, more to come out in the record and to think: Whoops, who knew about that? We had this happen with one judge already after they were confirmed to a lifetime appointment. The final records came out, and we found out what they did with issues of torture and other things. It was bad.                Amendment No. 3993 to Amendment No. 3699  Mr. President, I have an amendment at the desk, and I ask unanimous consent that it be reported by number.
