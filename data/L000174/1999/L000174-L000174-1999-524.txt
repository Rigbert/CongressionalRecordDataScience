President, the problem with this, of course, is that nobody, when they start out on a movie, knows exactly what form their movie is going to be in in the end. Basically what you are saying is somebody in the Department of Agriculture--for example, if you want to do something on the eastern forest or have eastern forest in the background--some bureaucrat in the Department of Agriculture has to determine, before you even start filming the movie, what the final edited copy of the movie will look like at the end before the decision can be made. That person at the Department of Agriculture might do dairy price supports one day and Block Buster Steven Spielberg movies the next day.  I understand what my friend from Kentucky wants to do. But the best way to censor violence in movies is don't go to violent movies. But don't ask somebody at the Department of the Interior who does fishing permits, for example, to determine whether a national forest can be used as a background somewhere in a movie that has not yet been made.
