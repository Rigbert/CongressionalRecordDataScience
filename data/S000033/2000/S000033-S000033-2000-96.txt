 Chairman, reclaiming my time, I would simply say that, while we all want energy efficiency, providing corporate welfare to some of the largest and most profitable corporations in this country is not the way to go.  In a few moments, perhaps, I will be introducing legislation which increases funds for weatherization. Making homes of low-income and working people's homes more energy efficient is a lot better way.
