President, as you know, I believe that the Senate custom of placing holds on legislation should be practiced in public. In that spirit, I rise today to remove the hold I placed on H.R. 2610, a bill to reauthorize the Office of National Drug Control Policy. I do not object to Senate consideration of this legislation.                          ____________________
