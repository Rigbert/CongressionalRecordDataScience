Mr. Speaker, today we honor a truly great Alaskan: Mrs. Maxine Whitney. Mrs. Whitney is a long time Fairbanks, Alaska resident who, with her husband, Jesse, and their construction companies, helped develop and build the infrastructure of modern day Alaska. While pursuing a very active business life, Mrs. Whitney collected what was reportedly the world's largest private collection of Native Alaskan art and artifacts. As with many, her avocation became a vocation and she purchased a small private museum. Mrs. Whitney successfully ran the Eskimo Museum in Fairbanks for almost 20 years, from 1969 until the late 1980's. Throughout her 50 plus years in Alaska, Mrs. Whitney traveled extensively in rural Alaska gaining a deep understanding and appreciation of Native peoples and cultures. Her museum and collection shows intimate knowledge of Native Alaskan prehistory, history, and the importance of the Native contribution to Alaskan society.  Mrs. Whitney has provided a legacy for all Alaskans and for all Americans. Maxine Whitney recently donated this world-renowned collection to Prince William Sound Community College in Valdez, Alaska, part of the University of Alaska system. The collection is known as the Jesse & Maxine Whitney Collection and is the nucleus of the Prince William Sound Community College--Alaska Cultural Center. This multi-million dollar donation will provide opportunities for people to learn about past and present Native Alaskan cultures and the natural history of Alaska. In donating the Whitney Collection, Mrs. Whitney has provided an educational gem for all who visit and view the collection.  This gift should be celebrated and Mrs. Whitney commended for her extreme generosity to the State of Alaska and the USA. Her legacy will enhance the knowledge and appreciation of Native cultures across the country. It is people like Maxine Whitney, patrons of the arts and education, philanthropists, who enrich our lives with their precious gifts. Mrs. Whitney, thank you.                          ____________________
