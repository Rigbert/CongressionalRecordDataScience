 This particular show was one of the major news shows, and I sat there and I listened, and I thought, ``No wonder we cannot get our story on out on why NAFTA had flaws, and who is going to actually end up holding the bag on this peso bailout of Mexico.''  Archer-Daniels-Midland was one of the biggest promoters of NAFTA, without the side agreements that we wanted in there. They are a sponsor of the show. Why would a sponsor want anyone to say anything that did not agree with their own private interests? This is all a matter of news record.                              {time}  1820  Right after NAFTA was passed, the Prime Minister of Canada, who was one of the biggest proponents of NAFTA, Mr. Mulroney, was appointed to the board of ADM. This is amazing. It would be like the President of our country being appointed to a major corporate board that was supporting this kind of an agreement, and to get a seat on that board you are paid between $37,000 and $100,000 a year. I was really--I thought, in terms of the ethics that I agree with, there should be a cooling-off period. The chair was still warm. The ink on the agreement was not even dry, and I just used that as an example because that happens to be a very powerful corporation in our country with very definite interests, including that you hear the news in a certain way. I really--I never realized how significant it was, but it absolutely does color public opinion.  Last week we sent a--I wanted to mention to the gentleman also in talking about the power interests in the Northwest, ``When I watched our Government get all worked up over the past couple of weeks and, with lightning speed, come up with this loan guarantee to Mexico, I thought about all of the problems in my district.'' The gentleman said he wanted to become parochial.  I cannot get a loan guarantee to clean up the Ottawa River in Toledo, OH. It is a multi-billion-dollar cleanup problem that we have with all the toxic sites along that river, and we are told by our Government, ``Sorry, Congresswoman, we can't take care of your district because frankly we don't have the money.'' They will not give me a loan guarantee so that our mayor, and our local officials and our county officials can clean up that toxic river that flows into Lake Erie.  We are trying to get a radio control tower built out at our airport. We have had some pretty close calls, and we are told we are not high enough up on the priority list, so our pilots and our passengers, our private pilots and so forth, have to keep coming into that airport. I cannot get them a loan guarantee to guarantee the construction of that tower.  We have a railroad station we have been trying to fix up with dribs and drabs of Federal money plus a lot of local support from our port authority back home. We want to build a parking garage, a secure parking garage, next to this railroad station so that people can park their cars there if they go on a 3-day weekend to Chicago, or Toronto, or wherever they go, and feel secure. I cannot get a loan guarantee from Washington to help my people back home.  So, part of the reason I ran for office is I want to help people. I want to help my people, the people who sent me here, and decisions like this do not go down very well when you cannot do as much for your people back home as certain very powerful interests can do in this city for people who do not even live here, for interests in Mexico, for people who have absolutely no interests in my district, and if I were to give Mexico one gift, first it would be the gift of democracy, to use the relationship with this country, be it political, be it business, be it cultural, to help the people there finally gain a voice, because I believe you can only have free trade when you have freedom first, and that politics does matter, and that it has to be a precondition for any kind of economic assistance or trade. We could never get that in the NAFTA accord as it was originally signed.  So, as we stand here tonight, a lot of the people call my office and say, ``Why are you standing down there on the floor talking when legislative business is largely complete for the day?''  I guess the answer is ``Because it's the only way we can really reach the public.''
