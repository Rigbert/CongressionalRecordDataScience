 President, let me just say with regard to the immigration bill, the only chance to get a bill is on a bipartisan basis. I agree with the decision of the majority leader to accept the recommendation of those who have been involved in that discussion, to give us the maximum opportunity to piece back together the bipartisan agreement that we thought we almost had a week or so ago on this most important legislation.                          ____________________
