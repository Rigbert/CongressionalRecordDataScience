 President, my amendment will provide the Pacific coastal tribes of Washington, Oregon, and California with salmon recovery funding.  I would like to start by expressing my deep appreciation to Subcommittee Chairman Gregg and subcommittee ranking member, Senator Holllings, for including in the Commerce, Justice, State appropriations bill, $80 million for the Pacific coastal salmon recovery account. Given the fiscal constraints I am pleased the money was made available.  The Pacific coastal salmon initiative was proposed by the Administration to help address the rash of endangered species listings of salmon along the coast. The Administration's initiative called for the funding of $100 million with up to 10% of that money going to the Pacific coastal tribes. Another portion of the initiative called for increased personnel for the National Marine Fisheries Service in order to handle a higher workload brought about by new ESA listings around the nation. The NMFS received some funding in the bill to undertake this initial work.  The only party to this initiative that did not receive funding was the tribes. I do not know why this decision was made, but I believe it sends the wrong message and we must remedy the situation. My amendment directs funds to Pacific coastal tribes to participate in the salmon recovery process. We need them to make this process work.  I would like to recognize that my amendment to ensure tribal participation is cosponsored by Senators Inouye, Boxer, Feinstein, and Wyden. I would also like to recognize the support of Governor Gary Locke of Washington and Governor John Kitzhaber of Oregon. Lastly, I appreciate the support of King County Executive Ron Sims, Pierce County Executive Doug Sutherland, and Snohomish County Executive Bob Drewel.  The reason all these people are supporting this amendment is that they know the tribes are a vital partner in the coordinated effort to recover salmon. Successful recovery is going to require all parties working as a team. Leaving the tribes out of the equation is not a way to build the team.  Some may suggest that my amendment is unnecessary because the tribes can apply to the states for a portion of the money being provided to the states. However, tribes should not have to receive these funds through a state grant process or via any other mechanism that might diminish their roles as sovereign governments. It is Congress that can do the right thing at this stage to respect the rights of the Tribes to be self-governing and join their counterpart governments in this vital partnership.  I appreciate the cooperation of the Chairman and my colleagues in agreeing to the adoption of my amendment to make the Pacific coastal tribes true partners in our effort to recover threatened and endangered salmon runs.                                  ____                           AMENDMENT NO. 1330    (Purpose: To improve the process for deporting criminal aliens)       On page 45, between lines 9 and 10, insert the following:       Sec.  .
