 President, I rise today in honor of a man who has always been ready and willing to answer the call of distress in his hometown of London, KY, in Laurel County: Mr. Ruben Curtis Walker, better known by what everyone typically calls him, ``R.C.'' He has served as a member of numerous first-response teams for the local people of his community for almost 60 years.  A life-long passion for service in the rescue field began for R.C. in 1952, when he joined the London Fire Department. He has maintained some kind of position there, whether volunteer or paid, ever since. R.C. has a deep desire to extend a helping hand to those in need. He enjoyed his job and he enjoyed the work he was doing for his community so much, in fact, that in 1962 Fire Chief Gilmore Phelps noticed his display of passion and asked him to start the first-ever Laurel County fire department. R.C. took on the challenge and met it with flying colors. He went on to run an excellent fire department for 18\1/2\ years before finally stepping down as chief.  Having always been active in his community and anxious to help out, R.C. didn't just devote his time to the new County Fire Department; he was involved across the board in the service arena. He was deputy coroner, then eventually coroner in 1966, the same year that he ran for county sheriff. He opened the Bowling-Walker funeral home in 1965. He has also been deputy sheriff in Laurel County, and the county jailer from 1989 to 1993.  However diverse the life of R.C. Walker was, he did not stray far from the fire department. His first love was fire and rescue, and that is where he is most at home. Although he does not fight fires with the department today, he does still participate in other activities with the firemen, many of whom refer to him as `Pap.'  Mr. Walker is not only a devoted public servant, but also a beloved family man. Aside from firefighter, he holds a few other titles--like husband, father, and grandfather. He and his wife of 25 years, Marie, have four children, Eddie, Steven, Stewart, and Deborah Greenwall. R.C. is dearly cherished by all who know him. I can say with certainty that his family, the boys at the fire department, and the local citizens of Laurel County feel safe knowing a man as honest and caring as Ruben Curtis Walker is watching out for them.  I ask my colleagues in the United States Senate to join me in commemorating Mr. Ruben Curtis Walker for the great many contributions he has to his local community.  There was recently an article printed in the Sentinel-Echo: Silver Edition, a Laurel County, KY local newspaper magazine, which highlighted the countless accomplishments of R.C. Walker throughout his colorful life. I ask unanimous consent the article be printed in the Record.  There being no objection, the article was ordered to appear in the Record as follows:        [From the Sentinel-Echo: Silver Edition, November 2011]                            He's Done It All                            (By Carol Mills)       He has been a first responder in many ways--firefighter,      rescue worker, sheriff's deputy, coroner, and jailer.       Ruben Curtis ``R.C.'' Walker joined the London Fire      Department in 1952, and has been a volunteer fireman for the      city or county most of his life.       He has also been with the London-Laurel County Rescue Squad      most of the time.       ``I've really enjoyed being a firefighter. I've always been      helpful on the rescue squad whether I was with the city or      county. I remember rescuing this fellow out of an electric      line. When they were clearing the bottom out to put the new      sanitation system in, I got a call from the funeral home they      found somebody they thought was dead down there. He was      putting a new blade on a bulldozer and he swung his boom      around and he got it into 6,900 volts of electricity. I      jumped in the truck and pulled it away from the electric      line. The door was open on the truck, so I took a running go      and jumped in. He was passing in and out, but he wasn't      dead.''       Back then, the funeral homes transported patients to the      hospital because the ambulance service was established on      Jan. 1, 1977.       ``It's just wonderful that I could be of help to somebody.      I've been through a lot of situations. I devoted the biggest      majority of my life to fire and rescue. My son, Steven, is a      sergeant in the state police and my son, Stewart, is chief of      the city police.       ``Gilmore Phelps was chief in 1952, and he talked me into      joining the fire department with them,'' Walker recalled. ``I      was working around a florist and a grocery store here in      town, Acton's Grocery, here on Main Street. I was with the      city in '54 when I starting working at House Funeral Home on      East Fourth Street.''       In 1958, Walker left House Funeral Home, but he was still      with the city fire department. He started working with Laurel      Funeral Home on South Main Street where the Laurel Judicial      Center is now.       ``There used to be a big home there and we used it,'' he      recalled. ``And I sold cars for a while. In the meantime,      while I was at Laurel Funeral Home, they talked me into      starting the county fire department.''       Walker was appointed the first Laurel County fire chief      when the department was organized in 1962, a position now      held by Tommy Johnston. Walker was chief for 18-and-a-half      years before stepping down after getting injured.       In the meantime in 1965, he opened the Bowling-Walker      Funeral Home on Dixie Street where the London-Laurel County      Farmers Market is now. He sold out his part in the funeral      business after he had back surgery.       While at Bowling-Walker, he was a deputy coroner and, when      he ran for sheriff in 1966, he was the coroner. He has been a      deputy with the Laurel County Sheriff's Office, too.       ``That's why my boys picked up the police business.''       He then ran for Laurel County Sheriff in 1970.       ``I won the nominee on the Republican (ticket) out of 14      and then the Democrats beat me in the fall,'' Walker      recalled. ``I then went back to House Funeral Home in 1973      and worked until '80. In 1982, I went to work for Laurel      Funeral Home, which had moved to (Ky.) 192 on the hill behind      the school, Laurel County High.''       Walker was Laurel County jailer from 1989 until 1993. When      he was elected, he came back to the London Fire Department      and has been there ever since.       Walker has been married to his wife, Marie, for 25 years      and he has another son, Eddie, who lives in Texas, and a      daughter, Deborah Greenwall, an attorney in Louisville.       ``I've got a good relationship with the children and      grandbabies,'' Marie Walker said.       Now at 77, Walker does not actively fight fires, but      continues to participate in any of the department's other      activities.       ``I don't do much. They kind of take care of me. Some of      them call me `Pap.'''                          ____________________
