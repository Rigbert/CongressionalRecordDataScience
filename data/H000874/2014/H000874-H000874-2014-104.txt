Speaker, this is the last colloquy that I think I will be having with the gentleman from Virginia (Mr. Cantor), which is why I spent the time to recognize him, because the American public, I am sure, thinks that we are all at one another's throats all the time, and that is very discouraging and very depressing for them.                              {time}  1245  Frankly, it is a problem for us here in the House because we don't like that atmosphere, either.  But I wanted him to know that there is respect on each side, I think, for the other in many--in most instances. I hope that is the case. But I do have respect and appreciation to Mr. Cantor for his service.  But because it is the last colloquy, not for the purposes of necessarily debate or discussion, but simply I want to articulate some of those things that I know we need to address and I hope we address in the coming weeks before the August break. We clearly need to fund the highway trust fund with a sustainable funding source. Running out of money--I think every Member of the House does not want that to happen, does not want to have Governors around this country shutting down the letting of contracts for needed infrastructure improvement.  We need to reauthorize the Export-Import Bank. We still believe very strongly that we need to pass comprehensive immigration reform, which we think will be a positive for our economy and the morally right thing to do. We are still very concerned, Mr. Speaker, with unemployment insurance and the minimum wage. The Senate has passed an Employment Non-Discrimination Act that we would like and hope would be considered on this floor. The terrorism risk insurance willexpire in the not-too-distant future. We think both for our economy and for the private sector's growth we need to pass that. And, of course, we want to complete the appropriations bills before the end of the fiscal year.  Lastly, let me say, Mr. Speaker, we will celebrate next week the 50th anniversary of the signing of the Civil Rights Act of 1964. And we will celebrate this summer with that which is being called Freedom Summer to celebrate that move towards a freer and more just nation. We are very hopeful that we can pass in the not-too-distant-future the Voting Rights Amendment Act, which will deal with ensuring that all people in our country not only have the right to vote but have access to voting and are facilitated in casting their vote.  Again, we don't need to debate those issues, but I did want to set them forth, Mr. Speaker, because this is our last colloquy before our July Fourth break.  Again, I want to close, unless the gentleman wants to say something, with thanks to Mr. Cantor for his service and for his working together when we saw that as possible, and when we disagreed to disagree as coworkers on behalf of this country.  Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.                          ____________________
