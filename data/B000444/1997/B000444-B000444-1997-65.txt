 President, I am pleased that the Senate has passed my amendment to make a modest change in current law. A modest change, but one which will make an enormous difference in the lives of some very special Americans--the families of public safety officers--police officers and firefighters--who have given their lives in the line of duty.  This amendment would forgive Federal tax liability on the annuities received by the families of these fallen heroes. The cost is modest--about $25 million over the next 10 years.  I would also add that this tax treatment would be the same as that for the families of fallen soldiers. In other words, my amendment gives to those who fight and die in domestic battles to keep us safe the same treatment we give to those who fight and die in keeping us safe from foreign battles.  Mr. President, again, I welcome my colleagues support for my amendment--we have stood with the cops, stood with the firefighters, and stood with the paramedics who have given their lives in service to all of us.
