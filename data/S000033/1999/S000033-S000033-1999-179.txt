 Speaker, I would like to talk about an issue which is of great importance to my State of Vermont and to I believe virtually every State in the country, and that is the crisis that is currently occurring with regards to home health care.  As you know, Mr. Speaker, in 1997 the Congress, against my vote, without my vote, passed the so-called Balanced Budget Act which cut $115 billion from Medicare, including $16 billion from home health care. Of course, those savings were used to provide tax breaks, most of which went to the very wealthiest people in this country. So we cut Medicare, we cut home health care, and we gave tax breaks to the rich and to the very rich.  The result of that is that since 1997, cuts in home health care agencies have forced about 20 percent of those agencies to close, and agencies that are still open such as the 13 efficient nonprofit agencies in the State of Vermont are now struggling to meet the home health needs of their constituents with fewer resources.  Last year, we put a band-aid on the problem and passed limited home health relief. We took a small step forward, but clearly nowhere near enough. Right now we have got to stop the upcoming 15 percent across-the-board cut in home health care. We need to increase home health care per visit cost limits, we need to reform per beneficiary limits so that the sickest patients who need many home health visits have access to them. I am hopeful that Congress this year will do the right thing and pass comprehensive home health reforms this year that will truly help our agencies and equally as important Medicare beneficiaries who need home health care.  There is one particular aspect of the debate about home health care that concerns me very, very much, and, that is, that the Medicare commission is proposing a 10 percent copayment for home health care which would result in out-of-pocket payments for the average senior of $470 a year. Now, some people may say, ``Well, $470 is not a lot of money.'' Well, it is a heck of a lot of money if you are an elderly person, if you are frail, and if you have an income of $8,000 or $9,000 or $10,000 a year. That is 4 percent or 5 percent of your total income. At a time when many of our seniors cannot afford the prescription drugs that they need, when their out-of-pocket health care costs are soaring, it would be an absolute outrage to ask the elderly, sick, poor people to be paying $470 a year more for a program which they now receive for nothing and which they should continue to receive without cost.  It is beyond my comprehension, Mr. Speaker, that at this moment at the same exact time that people are talking about imposing an horrendous copayment on low-income, sick senior citizens, these same people are talking about tax breaks for millionaires and billionaires. In other words, in all essence you raise taxes for the poor, the sick and the elderly, those people who are too frail to leave their homes, and you take that money and you give tax breaks to millionaires and billionaires. That is unconscionable and it is beyond my comprehension that any Member of the United States Congress would support such a regressive and reactionary approach. What kind of country are we if we would do that?  I would hope, Mr. Speaker, that we will not go that route. I am proud to say that I will be sending a letter to the Medicare commission which contains the names of 69 Members of the House who are going to say to that commission, ``Don't impose a copayment on the elderly and the sick and the frail.''  Let us support home health care, let us understand that home health care is an integral part of long-term care, that it is something that is vitally needed, that it is something that is cost effective. If people do not receive the home health care that they need, they are going to end up in the hospital at far greater expense to Medicare.  I would hope, Mr. Speaker, that this body will go on record as saying no to any copayments and let us protect some of the most fragile people in our country, and, that is, those people who cannot leave their home, who are old, who are sick and who are poor.                          ____________________
