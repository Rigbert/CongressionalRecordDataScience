Madam Chairman, I thank the gentleman for his outstanding leadership on this issue.  Madam Chairman, nine out of ten hospitals in the United States adamantly refuse to abort unborn children, and the trend is for hospitals to divest themselves of abortion.  It is outrageous that, as hospitals in our country repudiate abortion, the Sanchez amendment seeks to turn our overseas military hospitals into abortion mills. With all due respect to the gentlewoman from California (Ms. Loretta Sanchez), the amendment she offers will result in babies being brutally killed by abortion and will force pro-life Americans to facilitate and to subsidize the slaughter of innocent children.  We do not want any part of that carnage, and when President Clinton in the previous administration sought to impose this kind of activity upon our military not a single military doctor in our overseas hospitals wanted to be a part of it. They had to look outside the system because they were pro-life, and they wanted to nurture and care for, provide maternal health care, prenatal health care, not the killing of those babies.  Madam Chairman, let us be clear. Abortion is violence against children. Some abortion methods dismember and rip apart the fragile bodies of children. Other methods chemically poison children. Abortionists turn children's bodies into burned corpses, a direct result of the caustic effect of salt poisoning and other methods of chemical abortions.  I would say to my colleagues, there is absolutely nothing benign or curing or nurturing about abortion. It is violence. It is gruesome. And yet the apologists sanitize the awful deed with soothing, misleading rhetoric. Abortion methods are particularly ugly because, under the guise of choice, they turn baby girls and baby boys into dead baby girls and dead baby boys.  We have had enough loss of innocent life. Reject the Sanchez amendment.
