 President, at the close of Tuesday's first budget meeting with White House officials, I expressed to Chief of Staff Leon Panetta and Treasury Secretary Rubin my disappointment with their inflexible posture.  I told Mr. Panetta, and these are my exact words:       Don't assume the President isn't going to change his      position. He's changed his mind before.  Mr. Panetta did not respond and just walked off.  It was suggested to me that this may have been taken as a slap at or insult to the President.  Let me assure you that I meant no malice, nor did I intend it as a partisan swipe at the President.  I was simply making a statement of fact.  And the fact is, the President changes his mind quite frequently.  And if the President refuses to negotiate in person with congressional leaders, then those he sends must fully appreciate the fact that the President changes his mind a lot and that they as White House negotiators must be more flexible and open-minded.
