You will not get there with pretense. You will not get there with irresponsibility and kick the can down the road.  I understand what you have done. You've taken your most controversial leverage point and put it at the end, rather than at the beginning of the process. But you still have the CR, and you still have the sequester, and we'll have to debate those.  What we ought to be doing is extending this debt limit for 1, 2, 4, or 6 years, or eliminating it all together. When you spend money, it has nothing to do with the debt limit and everything to do with the actions of this Congress.
