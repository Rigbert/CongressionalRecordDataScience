President, as we wind down this session, certainly this body and the other body have much on their mind regarding the actions of the House Judiciary Committee and the whole area of an impeachment inquiry. Every Member will have to speak for himself or herself in both bodies in deciding what they believe is or is not an impeachable offense.  Many times we speak about what is an impeachable offense without discussing what it is not. I ask unanimous consent to have printed in the Record an excellent article written in Sunday's Washington Post by Professor Sunstein, entitled ``Impeachment?'' I feel it will be helpful, as his writings usually are, on this issue.  There being no objection, the article was ordered to be printed in the Record, as follows:                [From the Washington Post, Oct. 4, 1998]                        Impeachment? The Framers                           (By Cass Sunstein)       We all now know that, under the Constitution, the president      can be impeached for ``Treason, Bribery, or other high Crimes      and Misdemeanors.'' But what did the framers intend us to      understand with these words? Evidence of the phrase's      evolution is extensive--and it strongly suggests that, if we      could solicit the views of the Constitution's authors, the      current allegations against President Clinton would not be      impeachable offenses.       When the framers met in Philadelphia during the stifling      summer of 1787, they were seeking not only to design a new      form of government, but to outline the responsibilities of      the president who would head the new nation. They shared a      commitment to disciplining public officials through a system      of checks and balances. But they disagreed about the precise      extent of presidential power and, in particular, about how,      if at all, the president might be removed from office. If we      judge by James Madison's characteristically detailed accounts      of the debates, this question troubled and divided the      members of the Constitutional Convention.       The initial draft of the Constitution took the form of      resolutions presented before the 30-odd members on June 13.      One read that the president could be impeached for      ``malpractice, or neglect of duty,'' and, on July 20, this      provision provoked extensive debate. The notes of Madison,      who was representing Virginia, show that three distinct      positions dominated the day's discussion. One extreme view,      represented by Roger Sherman of Connecticut, was that ``the      National Legislature should have the power to remove the      Executive at pleasure.'' Charles Pinckney of South Carolina,      Rufus King of Massachusetts and Gouvernor Morris of      Pennsylvania opposed, with Pinckney arguing that the      president ``ought not to be impeachable whilst in office.''      The third position, which ultimately carried the day, was      that the president should be impeachable, but only for a      narrow category of abuses of the public trust.       It was George Mason of Virginia who took a lead role in      promoting this more moderate course. He argued that it would      be necessary to counter the risk that the president might      obtain his office by corrupting his electors. ``Shall that      man be above'' justice, he asked, ``who can commit the most      extensive injustice?'' The possibility of the new president      becoming a near-monarch led the key votes--above all,      Morris--to agree that impeachment might be permitted for (in      Morris's words) ``corruption & some few other offences.''      Madison concurred, and Edmund Randolph of Virginia captured      the emerging consensus, favoring impeachment on the grounds      that the executive ``will have great opportunitys of abusing      his power; particularly in time of war when the military      force, and in some respects the public money, will be in his      hands.'' The clear trend of the discussion was toward      allowing a narrow impeachment power by which the president      could be removed only for gross abuses of public authority.       To Pinckney's continued protest that the separation of      powers should be paramount, Morris argued that ``no one would      say that we ought to expose ourselves to the danger of seeing      the first-Magistrate in foreign pay without being able to      guard against it by displacing him.'' At the same time,      Morris insisted, ``we should take care to provide some mode      that will not make him dependent on the Legislature.'' Thus,      led by Morris, the framers moved toward a position that would      maintain the separation between president and Congress, but      permit the president to be removed in extreme situations.       A fresh draft of the Constitution's impeachment clause,      which emerged two weeks later on Aug. 6, permitted the      president to be impeached, but only for treason, bribery and      corruption (exemplified by the president's securing his      office by unlawful means). With little additional debate,      this provision was narrowed on Sept. 4 to ``treason and      bribery.'' But a short time later, the delegates took up the      impeachment clause anew. Mason complained that the provision      was too narrow, that ``maladministration'' should be added,      so as to include ``attempts to subvert the Constitution''      that would not count as treason or bribery.       But Madison, the convention's most careful lawyer, insisted      that the term ``maladministration'' was ``so vague'' that it      would ``be equivalent to a tenure during pleasure of the      Senate,'' which is exactly what the framers were attempting      to avoid. Hence, Mason withdrew ``maladministration'' and      added the new terms ``other high Crimes and Misdemeanors      against the State''--later unanimously changed to, according      to Madison, ``against the United States'' to ``remove      ambiguity.'' The phrase itself was taken from English law,      where it referred to a category of distinctly political      offenses against the state.       There is a further wrinkle in the clause's history. On      Sept. 10, the entire Constitution was referred to the      Committee on Style and Arrangement. When that committee's      version appeared two days later, the words ``against the      United States'' had been dropped, probably on the theory that      they were redundant, although we have no direct evidence. It      would be astonishing if this change were intended to have a      substantive effect, for the committee had no authority to     change the meaning of any provision, let alone the      impeachment clause on which the framers had converged. The      Constitution as a whole, including the impeachment provision,      was signed by the delegates and offered to the nation on      Sept. 17.       These debates support a narrow understanding of ``high      Crimes and Misdemeanors,'' founded on the central notions of      bribery and treason. The early history tends in the same      direction. The Virginia and Delaware constitutions, providing      a background for the founders' work, generally allowed      impeachment for acts ``by which the safety of the State may      be endangered.'' And considered the words of the highly      respected (and later Supreme Court Justice) James Iredell,      speaking in the North Carolina ratifying convention: ``I      suppose the only instances, in which the President would be      liable to impeachment, would be where he had received a      bribe, or had acted from some corrupt motive or other.'' By      way of explanation, Iredell referred to a situation in which      ``the President had received a bribe . . . from a foreign      power, and under the influence of that bribe, had address      enough with the Senate, by artifices and misrepresentations,      to seduce their consent of pernicious treaty.''       James Wilson, a convention delegate from Pennsylvania,      wrote similarly in his 1791 ``Lectures on Law'': ``In the      United States and in Pennsylvania, impeachments are confined      to political characters, to political crimes and      misdemeanors, and to political punishments.'' Another early      commentator went so far as to say that ``the legitimate      causes of impeachment . . . can have referenced only to      public character, and official duty . . . In general, those      offenses, which may be committed equally by a private person,      as a public officer, are not the subjects of impeachment.''       This history casts new light on the famous 1970 statement      by Gerald Ford, then a representative from Michigan, that a      high crime and misdemeanor ``is whatever a majority of the      House of Representatives considers it to be.'' In a practical      sense, of course, Ford was right; no court would review a      decision to impeach. But in a constitutional sense, he was      quite wrong, the framers were careful to circumscribe the      power of the House of Representatives by sharply limiting the      category of legitimately impeachable offenses.       The Constitution is not always read to mean what the      founders intended it to mean, and Madison's notes hardly      answer every question. But under any reasonable theory of      constitutional interpretation, the current allegations      against Clinton fall far short of the permissible grounds for      removing a president from office. Of course, perjury and      obstruction of justice could be impeachable offenses if they      involved, for example, lies about unlawful manipulation of      elections. It might even be possible to count as impeachable      ``corruption'' the extraction of sexual favors in return for      public benefits of some kind. But nothing of this kind has      been alleged thus far. A decision to impeach President      Clinton would not and should not be subject to judicial      review. But for those who care about the Constitution's      words, and the judgment of its authors, there is a good      argument that it would nonetheless be unconstitutional.
