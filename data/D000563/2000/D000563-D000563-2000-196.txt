Having been involved in teaching in Minnesota and higher education in his professional career before his election, he understands, if not better than most of us, what higher education is about, what it offers, and also what it costs.  The Senator from Minnesota raises another point. We offered an alternative to this estate tax break which comes down to $23,000 a year for the wealthiest Americans. We said we are going to help for the very first time in America working middle-income families. We are going to allow them to deduct the cost of college education expenses from their income taxes. It is not a major deduction, but it helps. It said, for example, up to $12,000 a year could be deducted, and it would be treated in the 28-percent rate, which means a little over $3,000 a year.  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Thomas). The time for the minority has expired.
