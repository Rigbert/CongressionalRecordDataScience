 Rockefeller, Mrs. Gillibrand, Mr. Carper, Ms. Mikulski, Mr. Lieberman, Ms. Collins, Mr. Reid, Mr. Levin, Mr. Bennett, Ms. Snowe, Ms. Landrieu, Mr. Hatch, Mr. Bayh, and Mr. Voinovich) submitted the following resolution; which was referred to the Committee on Commerce, Science, and Transportation:                              S. Res. 285       Whereas the use of the Internet in the United States, to      communicate, conduct business, or generate commerce that      benefits the overall United States economy, is ubiquitous;       Whereas many people use the Internet in the United States      to communicate with family and friends, manage finances and      pay bills, access educational opportunities, shop at home,      participate in online entertainment and games, and stay      informed of news and current events;       Whereas United States small businesses, which employ a      significant fraction of the private workforce, increasingly      rely on the Internet to manage their businesses, expand their      customer reach, and enhance the management of their supply      chain;       Whereas nearly all public schools in the United States have      Internet access to enhance children's education, with a      significant percentage of instructional rooms connected to      the Internet to enhance children's education by providing      access to educational online content and encouraging self-     initiative to discover research resources;       Whereas the number of children who connect to the Internet      continues to rise, and teaching children of all ages to      become good cyber-citizens through safe, secure, and ethical      online behaviors and practices is essential to protect their      computer systems and potentially their physical safety;       Whereas the growth and popularity of social networking      websites has attracted millions of teenagers, providing      access to a range of valuable services, making it all the      more important to teach young users how to avoid potential      threats like cyber bullies, predators, and identity thieves      they may come across while using such services;       Whereas cybersecurity is a critical part of the United      States national security and economic security;       Whereas the United States critical infrastructures and      economy rely on the secure and reliable operation of      information networks to support the United States military,      civilian government, energy, telecommunications, financial      services, transportation, health care, and emergency response      systems;       Whereas Internet users and information infrastructure      owners and operators face an increasing threat of malicious      crime and fraud attacks through viruses, worms, Trojans, and      unwanted programs such as spyware, adware, hacking tools, and      password stealers, that are frequent and fast in propagation,      are costly to repair, and may disable entire systems;       Whereas millions of records containing personally      identifiable information have     been lost, stolen, or breached, threatening the security and      financial well-being of United States citizens;       Whereas consumers face significant financial and personal      privacy losses due to personally identifiable information      being more exposed to theft and fraud than ever before;       Whereas national organizations, policymakers, government      agencies, private sector companies, nonprofit institutions,      schools, academic organizations, consumers, and the media      recognize the need to increase awareness of cybersecurity and      the need for enhanced cybersecurity in the United States;       Whereas coordination between the numerous Federal agencies      involved in cybersecurity efforts is essential to securing      the cyber infrastructure of the United States;       Whereas the National Strategy to Secure Cyberspace,      published in February 2003, recommends a comprehensive      national awareness program to empower all people in the      United States, including businesses, the general workforce,      and the general population, to secure their own parts of      cyberspace;       Whereas the White House's Cyberspace Policy Review,      published in May 2009, recommends that the government      initiate a national public awareness and education campaign      to promote cybersecurity; and       Whereas the National Cyber Security Alliance, the Multi-     State Information Sharing and Analysis Center, the Department      of Homeland Security, and other organizations working to      improve cybersecurity in the United States have designated      October 2009 as the sixth annual National Cybersecurity      Awareness Month which serves to educate the people of the      United States about the importance of cybersecurity: Now,      therefore, be it       Resolved, That the Senate--       (1) supports the goals and ideals of National Cybersecurity      Awareness Month, as designated by the National Cyber Security      Alliance, the Multi-State Information Sharing and Analysis      Center, the Department of Homeland Security, and other      organizations working to improve cybersecurity in the United      States;       (2) continues to work with Federal agencies, businesses,      educational institutions, and other organizations to enhance      the state of cybersecurity in the United States; and       (3) congratulates the National Cyber Security Alliance, the      Multi-State Information Sharing and Analysis Center, the      Department of Homeland Security, and other organizations      working to improve cybersecurity in the United States on the      sixth anniversary of the National Cybersecurity Month during      October 2009.
