 President, I am pleased to introduce, along with Senators Kyl, Reid, Durbin, McConnell, Bingaman, Ensign, Schumer, Inhofe, McCaskill, Kerry, Bayh, Alexander, Grassley, Nelson of Florida, Johnson, and Cantwell the Combat Methamphetamine Enhancement Act of 2009.  This Act is designed to address problems that the Drug Enforcement Administration, DEA, has identified in the implementation of the Combat Methamphetamine Epidemic Act of 2005. I was pleased to join former Senator Talent in drafting, introducing, and securing the passage of the original bill. I am pleased to introduce this legislation today to ensure that it operates as Congress intended.  The bill that I introduce today would clarify that all retailers, including mail order retailers, who sell products that contain chemicals often used to make methamphetamine--like ephedrine, pseudoepedrine and phenylpropanolamine--must self-certify that they have trained their personnel and will comply with the Combat Meth Act's requirements; require distributors to sell these products only to retailers who have certified that they will comply with the law; require the DEA to publish the list of all retailers who have filed self-certifications, on the DEA's website; and clarify that any retailer who negligently fails to file self-certification as required, may be subject to civil fines and penalties.  The Combat Methamphetamine Epidemic Act that we passed in 2006 has been a resounding success. The number of methamphetamine labs in the United States has declined dramatically now that the ingredients used to make methamphetamine are harder to get.  The Combat Meth Act that became effective in September 2006 included important new provisions for retailer self-certification, employee training, requiring products to be placed behind counters, packaging requirements, required sales logbooks, and limits on the amounts that a person can purchase in a given day and over a 30-day period.  Now, because of that law's implementation, the number of methamphetamine labs decreased from about 12,000 labs to about 7,300 labs a 41 percent decrease in just 1 year. Once the bill was enacted into law, the number of meth ``super labs'' in my home State of California declined from 30 in 2005 to only 17 in 2006.  Fewer meth labs means more than just less illegal drug production. According to the Fresno Bee, the DEA has noted that in 2003, 3,663 children were reported exposed to toxic meth labs nationwide but that number had been reduced to 319 in 2006.  So things are moving in the right direction, and that is good news. But with more thousands of methamphetamine labs still operating in the U.S., and children still being exposed to their toxins, it is also clear that there is still work to be done.  After the Combat Meth Act became law, DEA examined how the retailer self-certification process was working. On May 16, 2007, DEA sent letters to the 1,600 distributors who they believed were selling products that contained ephedrine or pseudoephedrine, asking them to turn over lists of the retail stores that they sell to, so that DEA could check to see how many of those retailers had self-certified as that law requires.  Rather than actively assisting the DEA in its efforts, about \3/4\ of the distributors failed or declined to provide any information about the retail stores.  The distributors who did cooperate provided DEA with the names of 12,375 retail customers. When DEA checked those out, it found that about 8,300 of those retail stores had never self-certified as the law requires.  Based on these findings, the DEA estimates that nationwide, as many as 30,000 additional retail sellers of products are not complying with the law.  In short, retailers' non-compliance with the self-certification requirement appears to be widespread, and undercuts the effectiveness of the Combat Meth Act.  Unfortunately, there is no effective way for law enforcement to determine the universe of who is, and who is not, obeying the law. Currently, there is no requirement that retailers notify the DEA before they start selling products with these listed chemicals.  Retailers can likely avoid negative consequences if they are ever confronted with their failure to self-certify. Currently, the law imposes sanctions only for willful and reckless refusals to self-certify. There is no punishment available if a retailer negligently fails to self-certify as required. Not even civil sanctions are available.  In short, without distributors restricting the supply of these products to retailers who have self-certified, retailers may simply take their chances, rather than self-certifying as the law intended, figuring that they'll never get caught, or if they do get caught, that they will never be punished.  It is unacceptable that, over two years after the Combat Meth Act imposed this requirement and became fully effective, tens of thousands of retailers still are not following the law. It is unacceptable that distributors of these products can continue to profit off of their sales to retailers who are not complying, or are even refusing to comply with the law.  So this bill is designed to make the Combat Meth Act more effective, by putting in place a process that will ensure that every retailer who orders these products that can be used to make methamphetamine must comply with the law before they can get and resell the products.  First, it will require that all retail sellers of products with these listed chemicals must file self-certifications, closing a loophole that now exists for mail-order retailers.  Second, the DEA will be required to post all self-certified retailers on itswebsite, so that advocacy groups and others who are concerned about methamphetamine in their communities can identify retailers who are selling these products without complying with the law, and can notify the authorities.  Third, distributors of these products will only be allowed to sell to retailers who have self-certified, which they will be able to verify by checking the DEA's public website. Once recalcitrant retailers are faced with the real and immediate economic consequence of a possible cut-off of their desire to purchase these products, I am confident that most will file self-certifications as the law requires.  Finally, the bill clarifies that even a negligent failure to self-certify, if proven, can give rise to civil sanctions.  This is a common-sense bill, designed to strengthen the implementation of the Combat Methamphetamine Epidemic Act. This bill would create incentives to ensure that the self-certification process of the law is made both effective and enforceable.  I urge my colleagues to support this legislation.  Mr. Presdient, I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be printed in the Record.  There being no objection, the text of the bill was ordered to be printed in the Record, as follows:                                 S. 256       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of      the United States of America in Congress assembled,     SECTION 1.
