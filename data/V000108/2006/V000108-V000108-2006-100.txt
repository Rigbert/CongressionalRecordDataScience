Speaker, it is with great honor and pleasure that I stand before you today to recognize the many accomplishments of Mrs. Bonnie Reese. I can truly say that Bonnie is a dedicated, distinguished, and honorable citizen. I have known Bonnie for many years, and she is one of the most involved citizens I have ever known, especially when it comes to her service to the community. Bonnie has served her community of Jasper County in some political capacity for 35 years, and her overall service to the community is immeasurable. For many years, Bonnie has been a constant fixture in the Jasper County Democratic Party. For her efforts, she will be honored at an event hosted by the Jasper County Democrats on Friday, September 8, 2006, at the American Legion Post #406 in Wheatfield, Indiana.  Bonnie Reese began her career with the Jasper County Democratic Party in 1971, at which time she served as the Party's Secretary. After serving 4 years in that position with unwavering professionalism and dedication, Bonnie was named to the position of Vice Chair. For over 30 years, Bonnie has maintained this post, and she has done so with complete loyalty to the Democratic Party and to the people of her community. When called upon to address the needs of the community, Bonnie has always been a willing servant. Because of her commitment and care for the citizens of Jasper County, Bonnie was also elected First District Vice Chair in 2004. In addition, she has the distinction of being the first female elected to the Jasper County Council. However, not only was Bonnie the only woman on the Council, but also the sole Democrat. Bonnie's knowledge of the government and her willingness to serve have made her very successful in all of the positions she has held.  Indisputably, Bonnie Reese has been extremely successful throughout her career in public office. However, her efforts to support and contribute to her community have extended beyond her political service. Aside from her public service, Bonnie is also known for her skills as an organist. Many people in the community know her from her service to her church, the Tefft United Methodist Church, where she serves not only as the church's organist, but also as its choir director.  When not engaged within the community, Bonnie spends her spare time with those closest to her, her family. A loving wife, mother, grandmother, and great-grandmother, Bonnie's commitment to her community is surpassed only by her love for her family. Bonnie has been married to her husband, Roy, for 48 years. She and Roy, a retiree of U.S. Steel after 40 years of service, have four sons: Daniel, Michael, Richard, and Douglas. Roy and Bonnie are proud grandparents of 14, and they also have one great-grandchild.  Mr. Speaker, Bonnie Reese has given her time and efforts selflessly to the people of Jasper County throughout her years of service. At this time, I ask that you and all of my distinguished colleagues join me in commending her for her lifetime of service and dedication.                          ____________________[Extensions of Remarks][Pages E1643-E1644]From the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]                      TRIBUTE TO MRS.
