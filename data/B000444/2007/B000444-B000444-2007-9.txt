 President, today, I rise to introduce a bipartisan bill to promote the restoration of civilian, democratic rule to the troubled state of Burma. The goal of the Burma Democracy Promotion Act is to help create the right conditions for the peaceful, negotiated transfer of power fromthe generals who have ruled Burma for almost 2 decades to a newly-constituted civilian, democratic government.  In order to do this, we need to bring pressure to bear on the Burmese generals directly responsible for the bloody crackdown on peaceful protestors last month. This bill imposes new financial sanctions and travel restrictions on the leaders of the junta and their associates and tightens the economic sanctions imposed by the Congress in 2003 by outlawing the importation of Burmese gems and timber to the U.S. Carefully targeted sanctions can support our diplomacy. In this case, the sanctions are designed to provide leverage on the generals, who seem largely indifferent to the suffering of ordinary people. Until now, the generals have managed largely to avoid the bite of existing economic sanctions, enjoying their shopping trips abroad and stashing their riches outside of Burma. We hope to change that.  But unilateral pressure alone will not get the job done. We need a diplomatic offensive. Importantly, this bill creates a new position of Special Representative and Policy Coordinator for Burma. The Special Representative will work with Burma's neighbors and other interested countries, including the members of the EU and the Association of Southeast Asian Nations, to develop a comprehensive approach to the problem, including sanctions, dialogue, and support for non-governmental organizations providing humanitarian relief to the Burmese people. We need China, India, and Thailand, among others, to join with us to convince the generals that it is time for change.  While we work for a negotiated solution to the current crisis, we must not forget the Burmese people. This bill authorizes new assistance for the hundreds of thousands of Burmese who have been forced from their homes and are now refugees or who continue to suffer inside the country because of the mismanagement and brutality of the military regime.  It is time for Burma to begin a new day in which all of the people, including Burma's many minority groups, work together to rebuild what nearly 20 years of disastrous military rule have destroyed. With the support of the international community, a new government can build a more prosperous and democratic state, one that is at peace with its neighbors and that respects the human rights of all of its people. The Burmese Army should be, and can be, a part of this new Burma. The sanctions called for in this measure will be lifted provided only that the generals release all of their political prisoners, engage in a substantive dialogue with the advocates of democracy in Burma, and afford non-governmental organizations access to address the humanitarian needs of the Burmese people. These are reasonable, modest, objectives, and if met, would brighten the prospects for Burma's future.  Mr. President, others in this body have a long record of leadership on Burma policy, including the Minority Leader, Senator McConnell, who I am proud to have as a cosponsor on this bill, and Senator McCain. This bill was drafted in consultation with the staff of Senator McCain, and includes some portions of a bill he introduced earlier this month. I want to thank Senator McCain for his initiative and commend him for his strong voice on this issue. I have also relied on the wisdom of my old friend Congressman Lantos, who has already introduced legislation on Burma in the House. Finally, I want to thank the Senator from California, Senator Boxer, for cosponsoring this legislation and for chairing an important Senate Foreign Relations Committee hearing on Burma that helped to shape this bill.  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be printed in the Record.  There being no ojection, the text of the bill was ordered to be printed in the Record, as follows:                                S. 2257       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of      the United States of America in Congress assembled,     SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.       This Act may be cited as the ``Burma Democracy Promotion      Act of 2007''.     SEC. 2. FINDINGS.       Congress makes the following findings:       (1) Beginning on August 19, 2007, hundreds of thousands of      citizens of Burma, including thousands of Buddhist monks and      students, participated in peaceful demonstrations against      rapidly deteriorating living conditions and the violent and      repressive policies of the State Peace and Development      Council, the ruling military regime in Burma--       (A) to demand the release of all political prisoners,      including 1991 Nobel Peace Prize winner Aung San Suu Kyi; and       (B) to urge the SPDC to engage in meaningful dialogue to      pursue national reconciliation.       (2) The SPDC violently confronted unarmed demonstrators,      killing, injuring, and imprisoning citizens, including      several thousand Buddhist monks, and continues to forcefully      restrict peaceful forms of public expression.       (3) The Department of State's 2006 Country Reports on Human      Rights Practices found that the SPDC--       (A) routinely restricts freedoms of speech, press,      assembly, association, religion, and movement;       (B) traffics in persons;       (C) discriminates against women and ethnic minorities;       (D) forcibly recruits child soldiers and child labor; and       (E) commits other serious violations of human rights,      including extrajudicial killings, custodial deaths,      disappearances, rape, torture, abuse of prisoners and      detainees, and the imprisonment of citizens arbitrarily for      political motives.       (4) Aung San Suu Kyi has been arbitrarily imprisoned or      held under house arrest for more than 12 years.       (5) On September 25, 2007, President Bush announced that      the United States would--       (A) tighten economic sanctions against Burma, and block      property and interests in property of--       (i) certain senior leaders of the SPDC;       (ii) individuals who provide financial backing for the      SPDC; and       (iii) individuals responsible for violations of human      rights and for impeding the transition to democracy in Burma;      and       (B) impose an expanded visa ban on individuals--       (i) responsible for violations of human rights; and       (ii) who aid, abet, or benefit from the efforts of the SPDC      to impede the efforts of the people of Burma to transition to      democracy and ensure respect for human dignity.       (6) The Burmese regime and its supporters finance their      ongoing violations of human rights, undemocratic policies,      and military activities through financial transactions,      travel, and trade involving the United States, including the      sale of gemstones and hardwoods.       (7) The SPDC seeks to evade the sanctions imposed in the      Burmese Freedom and Democracy Act of 2003. Millions of      dollars in gemstones that are exported from Burma ultimately      enter the United States, but the Burmese regime attempts to      conceal the origin of the gemstones in an effort to evade      sanctions. For example, over 90 percent of the world's ruby      supply originates in Burma but only 3 percent of the rubies      entering the United States are claimed to be of Burmese      origin. The value of Burmese gemstones is predominantly based      on their original quality and geological origin, rather than      the labor involved in cutting and polishing the gemstones.       (8) Burma is home to approximately 60 percent of the      world's native teak reserves. More than \1/4\ of the world's      internationally traded teak originates from Burma, and      hardwood sales, mainly of teak, represent more than 11      percent of Burma's official foreign exchange earnings.       (9) Burma officially exports tens of millions of dollars      worth of rubies, sapphires, pearls, jade, and other precious      stones each year and the SPDC owns a majority stake in all      mining operations within the borders of Burma.       (10) On October 11, 2007, the United Nations Security      Council, with the consent of the People's Republic of China,      issued a statement condemning the violence in Burma, urging      the release of all political prisoners, and calling on the      SPDC to enter into a United Nations-mediated dialogue with      its political opposition.       (11) The United Nations special envoy Ibrahim Gambari      traveled to Burma from September 29, 2007 through October 2,      2007, holding meetings with SPDC leader General Than Shwe and      democracy advocate Aung San Suu Kyi in an effort to promote      dialogue between the SPDC and democracy advocates.       (12) The leaders of the SPDC will have a greater incentive      to cooperate with diplomatic efforts by the United Nations,      the Association of Southeast Asian Nations, and the People's      Republic of China if they come under targeted economic      pressure that denies them access to personal wealth and      sources of revenue.
