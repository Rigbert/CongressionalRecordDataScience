Speaker, I rise this evening to commemorate and to recall an extraordinary weekend that I and many of my colleagues had the opportunity to spend with our colleague, one of the historic Members of this House. He is probably, I suppose, the most historic Member of this House, the gentleman from Georgia (Mr. Lewis).  The event that we participated in just a couple of weeks ago was under the aegis of the Faith & Politics Institute, headed up by the Reverend Doug Tanner. Reverend Tanner delivered the prayer, Mr. Speaker, at the opening of this session of the House, and he is here with us on the floor. It was an extraordinary opportunity for many of us to relive with the gentleman from Georgia (Mr. Lewis) and with others the courage and commitment shown by some Americans so that all Americans would have the right to avail themselves fully of their constitutionally guaranteed right to vote.  We went to Birmingham, Alabama, then to Montgomery, then to Selma, and back to Montgomery. Montgomery, Alabama, is, of course, the capital of Alabama. Birmingham, as I will say briefly, was the site of a confrontation between freedom and evil, between those who would deny other human beings basic rights because of the color of their skin. We see in today's world across the globe that happening too often, where nationalism and racism and other ethnic divisions drive people to commit heinous acts against others.  It is appropriate that we remember what has happened in the past so that we can hopefully avoid it happening in the future and sensitize ourselves to the pain of others when they are inadvertently shut out, even if we are not consciously setting them aside and denying their rights.                              {time}  2100  Mr. Speaker, as we stand at the dawn of a new century and join the strongest economy in 50 years, we sometimes overlook what brought us to this point. Two weeks ago, as I said, we were again reminded, reminded that the book of American history includes chapters that are both repugnant and, thankfully, triumphant.  We were reminded that the courage to confront injustice and inhumanity is an indelible part of our national character. And we were reminded, Mr. Speaker, in the words of abolitionist and journalist Frederick Douglass, if there is no struggle, there is no progress.  On Sunday, March 5, we witnessed dramatically this progress, and we honored the courageous and continuing struggle for social justice. Two Sundays ago, the gentleman from New York (Mr. Houghton), who is here with me on the floor, cochaired with the gentleman from Georgia (Mr. Lewis) this effort and the congressional participation in the Institute on Faith and Politics.  We were joined by nearly 20 other Members of Congress, by President Clinton, leaders of the civil rights movement and thousands of others in Selma, Alabama, to commemorate a seminal moment in American history, Bloody Sunday. That phrase entered the American lexicon on March 7, 1965, 35 years ago, when Alabama state troopers and the posse of sheriffs, so-called deputies, attacked 600 men, women and children who had marched peacefully across the Edmond Pettus Bridge in Selma, Alabama.  Those brave marchers who were lead by our colleague, the gentleman from Georgia (Mr. Lewis), and Reverend Josiah William had committed no crime or offense. In short, there was no reason that they would be attacked by those who were sworn to uphold the law, protect the citizens of Alabama, and honor the Constitution of this great Nation.  Those marchers had simply demanded the most basic of American rights, the most basic right in any democracy, the right of a citizen to express their opinion to participate in the decision-making process of their Nation, by voting. In Selma, in 1965 less than 1 percent of eligible black residents were registered to vote. Not, Mr. Speaker, because they did not desire to vote, not because they did not think that voting was important, but because they were being precluded by various devices. Literacy tests, poll taxes, intimidation were the weapons used to disenfranchise and discourage those from participating in their democracy.  The marchers sought to change that, but their rightful demand was met with nightsticks, bullwhips, tear gas, ignorance, and hatred. The gentleman from Georgia (Mr. Lewis) who has now joined us on the floor, was one of the first to fall, Mr. Speaker. The gentleman led this march through the courage of his convictions, not just for African Americans, but for all Americans, knowing full well that if justice was not accorded to African Americans, it would not be accorded to any American ultimately.  The gentleman from Georgia (Mr. Lewis) when ordered to do so by the state troopers stopped in his place as he crossed the Edmond Pettus Bridge. They told him to retreat. Rather than retreat, however, he bowed his head and began to pray; and the response of the Alabama state troopers on that March 7, 1965, was to assault the gentleman from Georgia (Mr. Lewis) and those with whom he marched.  They fractured his skull with a nightstick, injuring him seriously. That event was a dramatic historic event in the history of this country. A few days later, President Lyndon Johnson put these horrific events into context, declaring to a joint session ofCongress, and I quote, ``At times, history and fate meet at a single time in a single place to shape a turning point in man's unending search for freedom.'' ``So it was,'' he said, ``at Lexington and Concord, so it was a century ago at Appomatox, and so it was,'' Lyndon Johnson concluded, ``last week in Selma, Alabama.''  Tonight, Mr. Speaker, I want to especially thank the Faith and Politics Institute for organizing this recent pilgrimage to Alabama and for allowing me and so many of my colleagues to attend. As we walked by the statues of snarling dogs in Birmingham's Kelly Ingram Park and toured the 16th Street Baptist Church where four little innocent unknown beautiful girls who happened to be black died in a murderous explosion in 1963.  I was struck, Mr. Speaker, again, by the depth of the gentleman from Georgia's (Mr. Lewis) courage and commitment to justice for all and how that same courage and commitment was shared by so many men, women, and children that we will never know.  Mr. Speaker, we rise to commemorate their courage tonight and their perseverance too; for on this night, March 21, 1965, began the Selma to Montgomery march that successfully concluded on the steps of the Alabama State Capitol 4 days later.  The marchers who were brutalized on Bloody Sunday and the marchers who made it to Montgomery 2 weeks later reminded us that nightsticks are no match for reason; that bullwhips stand no chance against courage; and that ignorance and hatred have no place in the land of the free and the home of the brave.  A little more than a year later, a year after Bloody Sunday, Robert Kennedy summed it far more eloquently than I can hope to do; and I repeated those words as we met at the end of that incredible weekend. He was speaking in Capetown, South Africa, to a group of African students; and he said this, that ``each time a man stands up for an ideal or acts to improve the lot of others or speaks out against injustice, he sends forth a tiny ripple of hope and crossing each other from a million different centers of energy and daring, they build a tide that can sweep down the mightiest walls of oppression and resistance.''  There were 600 people who left the AME Church, the Brown AME Church in Selma, walked the few blocks to the Edmund Pettus Bridge, who were standing up for an ideal, were speaking out against injustice, were acting to improve the lot of others. And as the attack on them appeared on television that night, they, through their courage and commitment, built a tide that did, in fact, sweep down the mightiest walls of oppression and resistance.  What a debt of gratitude, Mr. Speaker, this Nation owes to those brave souls.  So it was in Selma in 1965. And what 1965 tells to us most clearly is that it is that way today. We have made much progress. But all of us know there is a far way to go.  There is a great song, Mr. Speaker, that ends with this refrain in the first verse, ``Facing the rising sun of our new day begun, let us march on til victory is won.''  History tells us that full victory is never won. There are victories in battles. But, unfortunately, man's inclination to discriminate against his fellow man always seems to crop its head above the surface.  And so, I say to the gentleman from Georgia (Mr. Lewis), he teaches us a lesson and all those with whom he marched; he honored us by allowing us to help commemorate that day with him and others who marched on that day. Let us all pray that, when the next time comes, we too will have the courage that he displayed to stand up, to speak out, to act against oppression, to, with him, knock down those mighty walls of oppression and resistance.  Mr. Speaker, I yield to my friend, the gentleman from Georgia (Mr. Lewis), as I said, a historic figure who has contributed beyond perhaps all of us collectively to the realization of what this great democracy means not just to the American people but to the peoples of this world.
