 Speaker, I thank the gentleman for yielding, and I congratulate the gentleman for touching on an issue of enormous consequence that does not get the attention that it deserves, that is, we have in this country the largest per capita rate of incarcerated people; and I think the evidence as the gentleman has just indicated is very clear that we do not do a good job of reintegrating those people into society. The result is an enormous amount of pain, human destruction, and a great deal of expense to the American taxpayer.  Mr. Speaker, what I want to touch on, and the gentleman from Illinois (Mr. Davis) might be interested in this issue, is another issue that does not get a great deal of attention, and that is the increasing concentration of media ownership in the United States today.  In my view we cannot be a vibrant democracy unless the people get information, unless the people know what the most important issues are that are facing them. I fear very much that in recent years what we have seen is fewer and fewer large, multinational corporations own and control the media of this country. We are seeing huge corporations like General Electric, like Disney, like Rupert Murdoch's News Incorporated control major television networks. We have seen fewer and fewer large companies control radio outlets so that increasingly it is difficult for people in various communities to get local news because their local radio stations have been bought up by large national organizations.                              {time}  1715  We see in terms of newspapers and in magazines fewer and fewer large corporations controlling those as well.  I think people are not aware of the degree of corporate ownership of the media in this country and the fact that recent court rulings will make that situation even worse and allow fewer and fewer large companies to own more and more of the media.  Some of the largest media conglomerates in this country are AT, AOL Time Warner, the Liberty Media Corporation, Viacom, Walt Disney Corporation, the News Corporation, General Electric, Vivendi, Bertelsmann and Sony. And if you add together what these 10 corporations own, one would be absolutely amazed to the degree that they own television, radio, newspapers, magazines, book publishing, movie companies and so forth.  A concern that I have is that, given this corporate control over the media, the American people get relatively little discussion about some of the most important issues facing this country. For example, Mr. Speaker, I am not aware that most Americans know that the United States of America today is the only industrialized nation on earth that does not have a national health care system guaranteeing health care to all people and yet we spend twice as much per capita on health care than any other nation. Some people may think national health care is a good idea. Some people may think it is a bad idea. But I wonder how much discussion there has been on corporately controlled media or on the radio stations pointing out that every other industrialized nation has a national health care system and we do not. That is an issue that should be discussed.
