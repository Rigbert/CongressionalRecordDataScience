Speaker, I rise today to recognize the life of William Ensign a respected and jovial Toledoan whose ethic of public service resulted in his being elected Mayor of Toledo in 1967, and then reelected again in 1971. We offer our condolences to his wife of 61 years, Joan, their children Maria, Kimberly, Madonna, Christopher, Joel and Thomas, as well as their families.  William J. Ensign was born in 1924. He grew up in Cleveland and went on to serve as a Marine in the Pacific Theatre in World War II. He earned his undergraduate and graduate degrees in sociology and criminology from the University of Notre Dame. He came to Toledo in 1951 to work in the legal system until he became the director of the county welfare agency in 1963, a position he held until he was elected Mayor of Toledo in 1967. He was re-elected by a landslide in 1969. He resigned in 1971 after then Ohio Governor JohnGilligan appointed him Director of the Ohio Youth Commission. He then served for a year with the Ohio Department of Administrative Services. Beginning in 1975, he was the Director of the Criminal Justice program at Ohio Dominican University.  Even as he raised his family and pursued his career, William Ensign developed his passion for music. He received his first drumsticks at age six, plated piano and was a drum major in the college band. He played with the Cleveland Philharmonic Orchestra and the Marine Corps band.  William Ensign's legacy is well-described by a former political foe, ``He was bright and engaging and never had a bad word about anybody.'' True testament to a life lived in service to others, his community and nation.                          ____________________
