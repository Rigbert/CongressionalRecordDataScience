President, I rise today to discuss with the distinguished chairman and ranking member of the Appropriations Subcommittee on Defense, a matter of great importance to our national security--our naval shipbuilding programs. As my colleagues are aware, both the House and Senate national Defense authorization bills for the current fiscal year contain provisions supporting continued production of the DDG-51 Arleigh Burke-class destroyers, the investment of research and development in a next generation destroyer or ``DD(X)'' program, and advanced procurement for the LPD 17 program. I am elated to see that the Senate version of the Defense Appropriations bill for FY2002 contain similar provisions, but troubled by the action that was taken in the house, particularly on the DD(X) program.  I appreciate the chairman and ranking Member's support for these shipbuilding programs and would like to take a few minutes to discuss the vital need for them. All of these programs are critical to sustaining a strong forward deployed naval presence, while addressing the anti-access challenges faced by our men and women who continue to protect our nation's assets, interests, and freedom.
