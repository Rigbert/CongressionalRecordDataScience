President, in 1855 in Warsaw, Poland, Blessed Angela founded the Congregation of the Sisters of St. Felix, an order dedicated to serving the poor, the sick, and the disabled. Today, thousands of Felician Sisters carry on a tradition of compassionate service around the world.  Today I wish to pay tribute to one of their number, a remarkable woman in Bangor, ME, the city where I live. Her name is Sister Mary Norberta Malinowski, but she is known and loved throughout Maine simply as Sister Norberta. She has dedicated her life to serving God by serving those in need.  Sister Norberta became a registered nurse in 1956 and began her career as one of the first pediatric nurse practitioners at Massachusetts General Hospital. After earning advanced degrees in public health and management, she received faculty appointments at Harvard Medical School and the Boston College Graduate School of Nursing.  In 1982, Sister Norberta became president and chief executive officer of St. Joseph Hospital in Bangor. As she prepares to step down after 29 years of service, her accomplishments are being celebrated by the Maine Legislature, the city of Bangor, the Honor Society of Nursing, the Maine chapter of Business and Professional Women, and many others.  There is much to celebrate. Under Sister Norberta's courageous and visionary leadership, St. Joseph has been transformed into the largest community hospital in Maine. She was instrumental in bringing many firsts to the region and to the State, from digital mammography and laparoscopic surgery to allowing fathers in the delivery room.  The Felician Sisters were founded with a particular focus on serving the Polish countryside. Sister Norberta continues that tradition by leading the effort to ensure primary care services for rural Maine and to organize small community hospitals under the Maine Health Alliance to create a statewide network of care.  Sister Norberta's contributions as a health care executive are only part of her inspiring story. She has given thousands of hours of her personal time to charity and has applied St. Joseph's facilities to such needs as providing laundry and food services to the area'shomeless shelters. Countless other quiet acts of kindness testify to her caring heart and deep humility.  The 16th century Capuchin friar canonized as St. Felix was known in his time as ``the saint of the streets of Rome'' for his daily journeys through the city dispensing food, medicine, and comfort to the poor, the sick, and the troubled. Sister Norberta has lived that legacy through the streets of Bangor and the country roads of Maine, and I join in thanking her for her blessed service.                          ____________________
