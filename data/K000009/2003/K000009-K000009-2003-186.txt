Speaker, I submit the following for the Record.                        For the Fallen Soldiers                          (By Amanda Escareno)     For the soldiers that fought the wars,     U.S. Army, Navy, Air force and the corps.     As you lie here deep beneath the ground,     there's not a single sound.     Now you lay here in a deep sleep,     While the others weep.     They know that when you died,     you were showered with pride.     You gave your happy lie,     with your kids and your wife.     Now we stand here above your grave,     and cherished all that you saved.     the tears cried is for the blood shed,     and the life that you led.     Let a salute be gave and the flight of a dove,     for America the land that you love.                          ____________________
