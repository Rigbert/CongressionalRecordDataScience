The Toledo Board of Realtors was founded in February of 1910 by a handful of Toledo real estate brokers. The association's first president was Irving B. Hiett, who eventually assumed the presidency of the National Association of Realtors.  Formed as the Toledo Real Estate Board, its first membership consisted of about 28 brokers. The Board was formed to ``Collect and circulate valuable and useful information pertaining to the real estate, manufacturing, industrial and mercantile interests of the city of Toledo and it's citizens; To oppose the enactment of laws detrimental to said interest; to encourage legislation for needed public improvements; to foster an equitable system of taxation and assessment and to secure the enactment and enforcement of laws and ordinances for the further protection, convenience and welfare of the real estate owners, leaseholders and brokers.''  In 1910 the Board developed a map of every manufacturing site in the city indicating whether the site was on the water, rail or inland. In 1912 Multiple Listing Service was established and it was mandatory that all members include their listings. The brokers gathered in the Board office each week and exchanged information about their listings.  The Toledo Realtor magazine was first published, semi-monthly in 1928.  Since its inception, the Toledo Board of Realtors continues its efforts to protect consumers in real estate transactions, to promote affordable housing and to expand ownership and protection of private property rights. Its members maintain the highest degree of professionalism while fostering an expertise in the field in order to ensure able representation of clients.  Today the Toledo Board represents approximately 1400 Realtor members. They continue a tradition of excellence over the course of a century. We celebrate their achievements and honor the efforts of those on whose shoulders they stand.                          ____________________
