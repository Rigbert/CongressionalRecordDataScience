Speaker, it gives me great pleasure to pay tribute to an outstanding citizen of Indiana's First Congressional District, Mr. Andrew Brennan. On Saturday, April 15, 2000, Mr. Brennan will be honored for his exemplary and dedicated service to our community. His praiseworthy efforts will be recognized at the Trade Winds Gala 2000 banquet at the Radisson Hotel at Star Plaza in Merrillville, Indiana.  A longtime resident of Northwest Indiana, Andrew Brennan has been an active member of the TradeWinds Board of Directors for more than 13 years. TradeWinds Rehabilitation Center, Inc. is a private, not-for-profit entity that provides services to children and adults with disabilities and functional limitations to enhance independence, productivity and community participation. In April of last year, the TradeWinds Executive Board asked Mr. Brennan to serve as its full-time Interm Executive Director while they searched for a permanent director. Mr. Brennan graciously accepted the position.  Prior to volunteering his time at TradeWinds as the Interim Executive Director, Mr. Brennan owned and operated Viking Engineering Company with two plants in Northwest Indiana and one in Chicago, Illinois. In July of 1998 he sold two of the plants, but continued to work for the new owner. Mr. Brennan's expertise in manufacturing and production as well as his exceptional management and aggressive motivational style has proven successful within the TradeWinds organization. During the past year, he has done a marvelous job in mending strained relationships, opening lines of communication, and organizing and running an efficient organization. To date, Mr. Brennan has dedicated over 1,000 volunteer hours and has provided continuity, leadership, diplomacy and encouragement to staff, clients and the community.  While Mr. Brennan has dedicated considerable time and energy to this work, he has always made an extra effort to give to the community. Throughout the years, Brennan has served in many different leadership positions and has been very involved in several organizations including: Hoosier Boys Town, St. Margaret Merch Hospital, Hammond Chamber of Commerce, the Northern Indiana Arts Association and the Boy Scouts.  Though Mr. Brennan is dedicated to his career and community, he has never limited his time and love for his family. He and his wife Sarah, have three children: Sally, Susan and Jeffrey, of whom they are immensely proud.  Mr. Speaker, I ask that you and my distinguished colleagues join me in congratulating Mr. Andrew Brennan for his outstanding devotion to Northwest Indiana. His dedicated service is commendable and admirable. Indiana's First Congressional District is proud to count such a committed and conscientious citizen, Andrew Brennan, among its residents.                          ____________________
