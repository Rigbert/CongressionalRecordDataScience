  As I finish my statement, and I know the Senator from Iowa also wants to speak, I think we have to ask ourselves are we going to let our kids go to school in overcrowded classrooms in crumbling school buildings with underpaid and inadequately prepared teachers or are we going to rise to the occasion and make the choices to invest in our children's futures?  We know what the needs are out there. We know what helps our kids succeed. We need Members of Congress to stand up and put the money where their mouths are.  Parents, teachers, students, and community leaders are saying do not just talk about the importance of education funding, make the tough choices to show the American public that education is truly a priority, and that means giving our local school districts the resources they need to provide a first-rate education to every student in this country by supporting this amendment.  I urge the millionaires in this country who are looking at a tax cut to let this Congress know that the education of the next generation, the possibility of creating future millionaires, is far more important than the tax cut they have been promised by this administration. I urge my colleagues to vote yes on this extremely important amendment that will benefit our children and grandchildren and their future.  I yield the floor.
