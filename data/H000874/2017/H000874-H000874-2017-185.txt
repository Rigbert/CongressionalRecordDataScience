Speaker, I presume, therefore, Members ought to be prepared for that bill to come forward, and what we hear, we don't know, is in a revised form.  Mr. Speaker, we hope, if it comes forward in a revised form, that it is accompanied with a Congressional Budget Office score so that Members on both sides of the aisle might know the ramifications of the changes in the bill.  Unless the gentleman wants to say anything further, I will yield back, but I hope that we can get as much notice and information as possible, Mr. Leader.  Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.                          ____________________
