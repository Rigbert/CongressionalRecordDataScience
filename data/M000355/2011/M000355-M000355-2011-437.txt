 President, I wish to recognize the people of Paducah, KY, for all of the efforts they have made to make their city one of our country's best places in which to work, visit or live. Now that hard work has paid off. Paducah has been recognized by the National Trust for Historic Preservation as one of their Dozen Distinctive Destinations in America in 2011.
