President, I assume the Banking Committee will talk about the amendment of the Senator from Nevada.  If I could have the attention of the Senator from Nevada, if his staff would allow me to have the attention of the Senator from Nevada for a moment, I realize we are merely constitutional impediments to the staff. I hate to interfere.  Again, this is one of a series of amendments that is not at all within the jurisdiction of the Judiciary Committee. I find it an interesting amendment, but it is within the jurisdiction of the Banking Committee. I was hoping, since there is going to be a banking bill next week, that some of these banking amendments would actually go on the Banking bill and have Judiciary amendments on the Judiciary bill. And I would assume that the discussion will be carried out by Senators Dodd and Shelby of the Banking Committee, in that there is no relationship at all to the Judiciary Committee bill.  I would add to that, of course, that the Senator from Nevada has an absolute right to bring up anything. Someone can bring up something on agriculture and price supports, I suppose. But I wish we could keep it to Judiciary matters.  Mr. President, am I correct we are now back on the Kyl amendment?
