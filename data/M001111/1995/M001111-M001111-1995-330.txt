 President, I want to say a few words about an important bill for Washington State. Today, I join my colleague, the senior Senator from Washington [Mr. Gorton] introducing legislation to authorize a land exchange between Boise Cascade Corp. and the Bureau of Reclamation.  Boise Cascade operates a sawmill adjacent to the Lake Roosevelt National Recreation Area near Kettle Falls, WA. The land located between the mill and the lake is owned by the Bureau of Reclamation. However, it is managed by the National Park Service under its authority over the Lake Roosevelt unit. Unfortunately, the proximity of the mill to the recreation area has led to concerns within the Park Service about potential effects of Boise operation on the public.  Mr. President, Boise Cascade has been a stellar corporate citizen in this area. The company has absolutely no desire to adversely affect the recreation area. In fact, given their druthers, they'd like to enhance the area. That's why this bill is so important.  If we enact this bill, we will ensure Boise's ability to continue its mill operation. In addition, we will add significant benefit to Lake Roosevelt. That's because this bill seeks to implement a land exchange that will add 132 acres to the national recreation area. Here's how it works: Boise Cascade owns 138 acres along the lake near the Colville River. This land provides excellent wildlife forage habitat. The Bureau owns 26 acres between the mill and the lake. In exchange for 6 of these acres, Boise will deed its 138 to the Government for incorporation into the recreation area.  Mr. President, this is a great deal for the taxpayers and the citizens of Kettle Falls: 138 acres for just 6. There are 350 jobs at the Boise mill. Needless to say, it's the major employer in that area. The terms of this exchange have been mutually agreed to by the agencies, the company, the local citizens, and conservation groups concerned with protecting the lake. It's good for the community, and it's good for the resource. I hope all my colleagues will recognize this, and support our efforts to move the bill toward passage.                                 ______      By
