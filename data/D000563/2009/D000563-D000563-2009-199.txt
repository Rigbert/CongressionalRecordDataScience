President, I thank the Senator from Tennessee. Although we disagree on this issue, I respect him very much. I am hoping--maybe it is a false hope--before the end of the day,he will join us and make this a truly bipartisan effort. We have tried, we have reached out to the other side of the aisle for almost one calendar year with lengthy hearings in the HELP Committee, in the Finance Committee, inviting Republican Senators to come join us.
