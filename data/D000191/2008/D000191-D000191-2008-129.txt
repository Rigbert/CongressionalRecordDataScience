The text of the resolution is as follows:                              H. Res. 772       Whereas in 1932, Alfred P. Sloan, Jr., then president of      General Motors Corporation, and other civic leaders had the      foresight to found the National Highway Users Conference for      the purpose of working ``for good, all-weather roads in every      state'';       Whereas in 1970, the National Highway Users Conference      merged with the Automotive Safety Foundation to form the      Highway Users Federation for Safety and Mobility, which in      1995 was renamed as the American Highway Users Alliance      (known as the ``Highway Users'');       Whereas since its founding, the Highway Users has been a      persistent and outspoken proponent for adequate funding of      the Nation's highway infrastructure and a consistent voice      for motorists who use the highways for leisure, family, and      business purposes and for those who depend on the Nation's      transportation infrastructure for commercial purposes;       Whereas the Highway Users has voiced the interests of      motorists and businesses on all major national highway and      traffic safety legislation over the past 75 years, including      the Federal-Aid Highway Act of 1956, which authorized the      Interstate Highway System and established the Highway Trust      Fund;       Whereas the Highway Users has been a consistent force for      protecting the integrity of the Highway Trust Fund and State      highway trust funds;       Whereas research conducted by the Highway Users has      documented the promise and potential of modern United States      highways in improving safety, facilitating emergency      evacuations, and growing the national economy; and       Whereas the Highway Users has been a strong advocate in      favor of strengthening the national highway network by      promoting a strong Federal role in mobility and safety and by      advocating policies that benefit highway users: Now,      therefore, be it       Resolved, That the House of Representatives--       (1) recognizes the American Highway Users Alliance on the      occasion of its 75th anniversary;       (2) commends the many achievements of the American Highway      Users Alliance; and       (3) encourages the American Highway Users Alliance to      continue its tradition of excellence in service to motorists      and the transportation industry.
