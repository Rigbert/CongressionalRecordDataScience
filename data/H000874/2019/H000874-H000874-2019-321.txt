 Of course, there was no budget last year until very, very late in the year.  What was done was what we will certainly make sure we do very early on, which is to try to establish the numbers, which, of course, a caps deal would do. And our objective will be to show our values in the appropriation bills as they come to the floor--hopefully, in a timely fashion--and our main objective would be not to shut down the government but to do our work on time.  I am confident that, working together, we can reach that objective.
