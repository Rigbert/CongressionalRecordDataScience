Speaker, since the development of audio-recording technology in the 19th Century, composers, musicians, and others have created thousands of sound recordings that have amused, entertained, and enriched us individually and as a Nation. Sadly, as the 21st Century dawns, many of America's most precious sound recordings, recorded on perishable media, may soon be lost unless we act to preserve them for the use and enjoyment of future generations.  Today I am delighted to join the gentleman from California (Mr. Thomas), chairman of the Committee on House Administration, in his introduction of legislation similar to the bipartisan bill that I introduced last year to help preserve this irreplaceable aspect of our cultural heritage. I hope all Members will support this effort.  In 1988, Congress wisely enacted the National Film Preservation Act, which established a program in the Library of Congress to support the work of actors, archivists and the motion-picture industry to preserve America's disappearing film heritage. The revised bill introduced today, the National Recording Preservation Act of 2000, follows the trail blazed by the Library's successful film program.  The measure would create a National Recording Registry at the Library to identify, maintain and preserve sound recordings of cultural, aesthetic, or historic significance. Each year the Librarian of Congress would select recordings for placement on the Registry, upon nominations made by the public, industry or archive representatives; recordings will be eligible for selection ten years after their creation.  A National Recording Preservation Board will assist the Librarian in implementing a comprehensive recording preservation program, working with artists, archivists, educators and historians, copyright owners, recording-industry representatives, and others. A National Recording Preservation Foundation, chartered by the bill, will encourage, accept and administer private contributions to promote preservation of recordings, and public accessibility to the Nation's recording heritage, held at the Library and at other archives throughout the United States.  The bill authorizes appropriations of up to $250,000 per year for seven years to fund the Library's preservation program, and amounts over the same period to match the non-federal funds raised by the Foundation for preservation purposes.  Mr. Speaker, by enacting this modest bill and working with the private sector to leverage the available resources, the Congress can spark creation of a comprehensive, sensible and effective program to preserve our Nation's sound-recording heritage for our children and grandchildren. I urge its quick enactment.                          ____________________
