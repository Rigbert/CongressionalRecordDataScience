I can recall in the time I havebeen in public service that the vocal supporters of Roe v. Wade and keeping abortion safe and legal used to contain in their ranks many women who remembered vividly from a personal experience or a family experience what it was like before Roe v. Wade, when women in desperate circumstances sought an abortion in an unhealthy, unsanitary, unclean surrounding, endangering their lives. I ask the Senator, does she believe the national debate is different today because we have had 25 or 30 years of legal opportunities to terminate a pregnancy and, thank goodness, there are fewer of those women whose lives were lost or damaged because of these illegal and unsafe abortions that preceded them?
