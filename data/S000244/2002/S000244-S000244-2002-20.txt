Speaker, I yield myself the balance of my time.  Mr. Speaker, I too would like to add my thanks to the gentlewoman from New York and the gentlewoman from Maryland for putting together this bill. I have been in the Congress for 24 years. This is the first bill on the subject of firearms that I can remember that is supported by both the NRA and most of the major gun control groups. That means we ought to seize this moment and pass this bill right away before this coalition unravels. I urge the Members to do that.
