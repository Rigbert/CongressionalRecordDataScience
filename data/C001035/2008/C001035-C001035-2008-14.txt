President. And I thank the Senator from New Jersey.                          Senator John Warner  Mr. President, throughout our Nation's history, the Commonwealth of Virginia has provided leaders of uncommon courage, dedication, and vision. The names that are revered in the Old Dominion are honored acrossAmerica: Washington, Jefferson, Monroe, Mason, and Henry, to name but a few.  Today, as the 110th Congress draws to a close, we say farewell to another great Virginian, a great patriot, public servant, and distinguished colleague whose name history will add to that honor roll: the name of our friend and colleague, Senator John Warner.  Senator Warner's career mirrors those of the Founding Fathers in many ways. During World War II, when freedom was under attack, he enlisted in the U.S. Navy at just 17 years of age.  Following the war, he rejoined civilian life, earned a college degree, and entered law school. At the outbreak of the Korean war, he suspended his studies to serve his Nation once again, this time as an officer in the U.S. Marine Corps.  After he returned from Korea, he completed his law degree but remained an officer in the Reserves, always ready to answer the call of his Nation. Senator John Warner truly exemplifies the American tradition of the citizen soldier.  As a civilian, John Warner continued to serve: as an assistant U.S. attorney, as Under Secretary of the Navy, and as Secretary of the Navy. During his 5 years in the Navy's Secretariat, he demonstrated another American tradition: a commitment to both military strength and diplomacy.  It is fitting that one so steeped in the best of America's traditions was chosen by the President, in 1976, to coordinate our Nation's bicentennial celebrations in all 50 States and in 22 foreign countries.  It was in 1978 that the wise citizens of Virginia sent John Warner to the U.S. Senate. For 30 years, the people of America have been grateful. The hallmark of Senator Warner's service in the Senate has been his absolute and unwavering commitment to a strong national defense. It has been my honor to serve with him on two committees that bear directly upon that commitment--the Senate Armed Services Committee and the Senate Homeland Security Committee.  As the chairman and ranking member of the Armed Services Committee, Senator Warner has consistently upheld the pledge he took to defend America when he enlisted in the Navy 63 years ago. His support for our men and women in uniform, for their families, and for our veterans is unwavering. He has been an effective and strong advocate for modernizing our military to meet the challenges of the 21st century.  Senator Warner also understands that America's future does not just depend upon defending our Nation against attack. I am proud to have worked with him on climate change legislation, and his leadership on the America's Climate Security Act with our friend, Senator Joe Lieberman, demonstrates his commitment to protecting our environment and to securing our energy future.  Senator Warner's career has been defined by his involvement in some of the most pressing issues of our time. But he has also worked hard on those seemingly smaller issues that make a big difference in people's lives. As just one example, he joined me in authoring the tax deduction for teachers who spend their own money on classroom supplies. Whether in uniform or in our classrooms, John Warner believes those who serve have earned our gratitude and our support.  Also, we remember John Warner's pivotal role at a time when our institution of the Senate was at a threshold of chaos and dysfunction. I refer to his leadership in the so-called Gang of 14, which worked out a compromise on judicial nominations that helped save this institution from what would have otherwise been a very bleak time.  Senator Warner has continued and enhanced the best traditions of this Nation and of the Commonwealth of Virginia in countless ways. One that must be mentioned, before I conclude my remarks, is his unfailing civility and courtesy toward his Senate colleagues. Regardless of the significance of the issue or the intensity of the debate or the strength of his colleagues' feelings, Senator Warner has always tempered staunch advocacy for his convictions with the utmost respect for the convictions of others.  On a personal note, he has been a wonderful friend and mentor to me, the Senator from Maine. I know all Americans join me today in thanking Senator John Warner for his dedicated decades of service to his country, whether in times of peace or war, and in wishing him all the best in the years to come.  Thank you, Mr. President.
