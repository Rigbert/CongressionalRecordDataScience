 President, I rise this morning on a very sad note for all of us who knew a very special, wonderful woman by the name of Governor Ann Richards. Last night she left this world, but she left behind a tremendous spirit that many of us will carry on. She was the kind of woman who could walk into a room and light it up, no matter where she was. She was a Governor of Texas, and I know that State knew and loved her well, but the rest of the country also loved her.  I was privileged to know this wonderful, compassionate human being. She made me laugh, she made me think, and she made me remember what I cared most about in this country. Her loss is a tragic one certainly for the State of Texas, certainly for the country, but absolutely for every one of us who knew her.  I know many people will be speaking throughout the next several days about the loss of Governor Richards, but I just wanted, on behalf of so many of us who cared for her so much, to express our condolences to all of her family, to her friends, to everyone who knew her, and to let them know that we will not forget and we will continue to carry her message of hope and passion as we continue in our lives.  Mr. President, I yield the floor.
