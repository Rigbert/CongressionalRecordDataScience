President, just to respond to the points made by the distinguished chair of the committee--and, by the way, I think the chair's reference to being willing in the next intelligence authorization bill to work with those of us--and Senator Merkley has made good points this afternoon to try to include language in the next intelligence authorization bill to deal with secret law--I think that would be very constructive. I appreciate the chair making that suggestion.  Colleagues may know that under the leadership of the chair of the committee and the distinguished Senator from Georgia, the vice chair of the committee, Mr. Chambliss, we were able, late last week, to work out the disagreements with respect to the intelligence authorization bill this year. I wish to thank the chair for those efforts. I think we have a good bill. I think all of us are against leaks. That is what was at issue. I think we have now dealt with the issue in a fashion so as to protect the first amendment and the public's right to know, and I appreciate the chair working with this Senator on it.  I think we have a good intelligence authorization bill now for this year. I think the chair's suggestion that we look at dealing with this issue of secret law--in addition, I hope, to adopting the Merkley amendment--that we deal with it in the next intelligence authorization bill is constructive. I do want to respond to one point on the merits with respect to comments made by the distinguished chair on this issue.
