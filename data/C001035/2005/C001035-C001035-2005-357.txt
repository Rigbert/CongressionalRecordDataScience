He is a thoughtful Member. I suspect he may at one time in his career have been an extraordinary trial lawyer.  However, we are not putting Judge Chertoff on trial. This is a confirmation hearing.

Judge Chertoff has already told us, under oath, that he was not aware of any practices at Guantanamo that ``even approach torture.''  So what does my good friend from Michigan want to ask these Justice Department officials?
