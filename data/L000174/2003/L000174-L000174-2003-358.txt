President, today I am introducing a bill to expand the boundaries of the Green Mountain National Forest. This will allow for the inclusion of lands that have already been purchased using Land and Water Conservation Fund dollars to be brought into the boundaries of the national forest providing them full statutory protection. The Forest Service supports this administrative action and has been extremely helpful in providing the information needed for this legislation.  It is with pride that I can say that since I came to Congress in 1975 and began to seek funding for land acquisition in 1977 we Vermonters have seen the Green Mountain National Forest expand from approximately 264,100 acres to over 387,500 acres in size. This 123,400 acre expansion will provide unmeasured opportunities for the American public.  While there is much debate over the future management of our Nation's national forests today, this should not diminish their importance. In Vermont, where approximately five percent of land base is in federal ownership, these lands are treasured for the opportunities they provide not only to Vermonters, but to all who enjoy the Green Mountain National Forest. This includes recreational activities from camping, hiking, mountain biking, and skiiing to job opportunities provided through timber management activities, the ski industry, and other support services, as well as for their intrinsic value by providing that certain lands are set aside for in their natural state through wilderness protection and other special designations.  I am concerned that some will argue that we need to reduce our land acquisition dollars and to better manage what we already have. I do not dispute the need for better management, but I wholeheartedly disagree with reducing our land acquisition efforts. At one time this Nation believed that our boundaries were limitless. Today we realize that land is a finite resource and as more is acquired for development less will available for the American public to acquire for Federal ownership. There will come a time when the only land one can freely access, thereby avoiding the ``No Trespassing'' signs, will be our Federal, State, and county lands. Visionaries see what tomorrow will bring and prepare for that today--those who are still building upon our public land base have that vision.  At the turn of the century, the 20th century that is, there existed that vision, between then Chief of the ForestService Gifford Pinchot and President Theodore Roosevelt who together expanded the boundaries of the national forests immensely. We continue to need that vision, as seen by the efforts by those on the Green Mountain National Forest, in continuing to fund land acquisition into the future.  This need, for providing the American public with unfettered access to open lands, is of significant importance to those who live east of the Mississippi; where more than 50 percent of the American public are within three hours of their national forests, but only have access to approximately one-quarter of the national forest land. I hope that my colleagues will join me in supporting this bill and continue to carry that vision on the future to build upon our national forest system as we start the 21st century.                                 ______                                       By Mr. McCAIN (by request):  S. 1501. A bill to amend title 49, United States code, to provide for stable, productive, and efficient passenger rail service in the United States, and for other purposes; to the Committee on Commerce, Science, and Transportation.  Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, today, by request, I am introducing the Passenger Rail Investment Reform Act, the Administration's long-awaited legislative proposal for restructuring Amtrak and the intercity passenger rail program. In doing so, I want to express my appreciation to Transportation Secretary Mineta and departing Deputy Secretary Michael Jackson for meeting their commitment to me in April to deliver the Administration's proposal before the August recess. I also want to credit the work of the Amtrak Reform Council, the basis for several elements of the Administration's plan.  Amtrak began operation in 1971 as a for-profit corporation and was to be free of all Federal support by 1973. Throughout its history, including between 1997 and 2001, Amtrak led Congress to believe that profitability, or at least operational self-sufficiency was achievable. But 32 years after its establishment, Amtrak is running annual deficits exceeding $1 billion; has run up a debt of nearly $5 billion; continues to operate trains that lose over $400 per passenger; and yet still has less than 1 percent of the intercity travel market. Clearly, reform is needed.  I hope the legislation I am introducing today will serve as the basis for developing a consensus about the future of Amtrak and intercity rail passenger service. Even Amtrak supporters should admit that without significant restructuring, the passenger rail program cannot be entrusted with billions of dollars of additional financial support from the taxpayers, as some are proposing, particularly financing outside of the annual appropriations process, which at least gives Congress the ability to adjust Amtrak's funding based on its performance and use of taxpayer dollars. Nor, in my view, should high-speed rail projects go forward until the Amtrak problem is solved.  My priority is to establish a network of train service that makes economic sense, minimizes subsidies at all levels of government, and provides fair and open competition for Amtrak. The Administration's proposal is a good start. Federal support for intercity passenger rail service would be modeled after the existing transit program and consist of capital funding matched by the States and managed through a ``full funding grant agreement'' process. States, rather than the Federal Government, would be responsible for funding operating losses after a transition period.  Following the recommendation of the Amtrak Reform Council, the legislation would divide Amtrak into an operating company which would operate train services, and an infrastructure company which would maintain the Northeast Corridor (NEC). After a transition period, the services provided by both companies would be subject to competition through competitive bidding. The NEC would be restored to a state of good repair, and leased to and managed by an interstate compact. Amtrak would not be privatized but would have to compete with companies in the private sector, ensuring a lower-cost solution for the taxpayers.  I intend to hold a hearing on the Administration's bill and the bill being introduced today by Senator Hutchison, the Chairman of the Subcommittee on Surface Transportation and Merchant Marine. If a consensus can be reached on a responsible proposal to fund and reform Amtrak and provide for an improved rail passenger program, the Committee will mark up legislation in the fall.  I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be printed in the Record.  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the Record, as follows:                                S. 1501       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of      the United States of America in Congress assembled,     SECTION 1.
