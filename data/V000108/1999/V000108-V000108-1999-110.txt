Speaker, it is my distinct honor to commend one of Northwest Indiana's most distinguished citizens, Ramon Sanchez, of Merrillville, Indiana. Mr. Sanchez will be honored by the Lake County Council for his exemplary and dedicated service to our community on September 14, 1999.  Born in Villalba, Puerto Rico, Mr. Sanchez is the eldest of four children born to the late Francisco and Candida Sanchez. Ramon, fondly referred to as ``Ray'' by his many friends, has been an active and visible leader in the Hispanic community since his arrival to the United States in 1951.  Mr. Sanchez began his career in the United States as a steelworker at Inland Steel, a job from which he retired in 1989 after 38 years of service. From 1972-1995, he served as Chief Bailiff with the Gary City Court. Most recently, Ramon Sanchez retired from the Merrillville Town Court after two years of service as Bailiff.  Outside of his professional career, Ramon Sanchez has devoted a large portion of his life to the betterment of Northwest Indiana. Mr. Sanchez is committed to improving the standard of living in Northwest Indiana, particularly in the Hispanic community. He has played an instrumental role in representing the needs of the community and has been an advocate of minority rights. Mr. Sanchez is a well recognized and respected figure in Northwest Indiana's political arena, having served the City of Gary in various capacities including a 20 year term as precinct committeeman. He has spearheaded various political campaigns and is affiliated with numerous civic organizations throughout Northwest Indiana.  While serving the community has always been an extremely important part of Mr. Sanchez's life, there can be no comparison to the dedication he has for his family. Ramon and his loving wife, Nancy, have raised four wonderful children, Amy, Ingrid, Mishelle, and Zayda. He is also a proud grandfather of nine grandchildren which provide an eternal source of joy and love for both he and his wife.  Mr. Speaker, I ask you and my other distinguished colleagues to join me in commending Ramon Sanchez for his dedication, service, and leadership to the people of Indiana's First Congressional District. Northwest Indiana's community has certainly been rewarded by the true service and uncompromising dedication displayed by Mr. Ramon Sanchez.                          ____________________
