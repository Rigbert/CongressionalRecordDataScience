President, the Assistant Attorney General for Civil Rights is the face of civil rights law enforcement in America. I will support Wan Kim's nomination for this important post.  For nearly 50 years, the Justice Department's Civil Rights Division has enforced Nation's civil rights laws and combated racism, discrimination, and other civil rights abuses. And during the past 50 years, our Nation has made important strides in the fight for civil rights.
