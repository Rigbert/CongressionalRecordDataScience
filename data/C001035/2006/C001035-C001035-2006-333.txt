President, I am delighted that our opening prayer this morning was so eloquently delivered by the Reverend Ken Dutille of Swans Island Atlantic Baptist Church in my home State of Maine. It is a great pleasure to welcome him to the Senate today. In fact, as he offered the invocation in this Chamber 11 years ago, on October 18, 1995, it is a pleasure to welcome him back to the Senate today.  Pastor Dutille's words give direction and purpose to our work. His actions also inspire us; they are a vivid reminder of the commitment and compassion that exists among people of faith throughout our Nation.  His ministry is truly unique. His church is joined with churches on three other islands to form the Maine Sea Coast Mission. This nondenominational organization was founded more than a century ago to provide spiritual guidance and educational opportunities to the remote seafaring communities of Downeast Maine. In its early years, the mission's boat, which was called Hope, would deliver a minister to isolated island communities where there were no churches and books where there were no libraries.  Today, the Sunbeam V not only continues that vital work, but it also serves as a mobile health clinic bringing medical services--including screenings, inoculations, and telemedicine--to four islands that otherwise would not have access to medical services.  Pastor Dutille is the founder of another outstanding mission project, the Bread of Life Food Pantry on Swans Island. The food pantry is often all that stands between the pangs of hunger and a healthy meal for some people in this disadvantaged area of my State. Although the demands upon the food pantry are always considerable, they increased exponentially this last July when the only grocery store on Swans Island was destroyed by fire. The pastor and the rest of the mission community immediately rose to the challenge with a major fundraising campaign. The power of God was evident in their strength of purpose as they responded to this crisis.  The pastor is a fisher of people and a person of many accomplishments. He is a graduate of the Baptist Bible College in Springfield, MO, as well as of the University of Maine. He holds a master's degree from the California Graduate School of Theology. He has served in churches throughout Maine and haspreached throughout New England. He is a published author, too, and a successful small business owner. He has also had experience that all of us can relate to. In a previous community, he served as a town selectman, so he has a keen understanding of the challenges of public service, as his opening prayer demonstrated today.  It is a great pleasure to have such a dedicated spiritual and civic leader with us today and giving the opening prayer. I am sure I speak for all of my colleagues in extending him a warm welcome and in giving thanks for his inspiring prayer.  Thank you, Mr. President.                          ____________________
