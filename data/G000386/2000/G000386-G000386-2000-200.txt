 President, I am pleased to join my colleagues Senator Bond and Senator Durbin, as an original cosponsor to the Clean Air and Water Preservation Act of 2000. I commend them for their leadership in resolving a very real problem--not a phony problem.  The real problem is that MTBE is contaminating our Nation's water supplies.  The phony problem is the proposition that the Clean Air Act's oxygenate standard caused the MTBE water contamination.  Unfortunately, powerful, influential forces are trying to sucker Congress and the American public into embracing the phony problem.  Some propagandists of the phony problem may be motivated by greed. After all, if the petroleum industry gets its way, its profits will balloon. If they can get Congress or the administration to grant waivers of the oxygenate standard, big oil will be able to squeeze out the 3 to 4 percent of the market currently supplied by alternatives.  The Department of Energy has determined that even a small amount of alternative fuels can save consumers billions of dollars each year by leveraging lower gasoline prices.  Petroleum companies also tell us that they can produce a gasoline just as clean for the air, but without oxygenates. Of course, they tell you that it will come at some extra cost.  Mr. President, I must ask my colleagues: Do we really need to give the petroleum industry both the ability and the excuse to jack up gasoline prices and further gouge American consumers?  Of course not. And the way to make certain this does not happen is by enacting the Clean Air and Water Preservation Act of 2000.  Other propagandists of the phony problem may be political opportunists seeking to engage in some self-serving election-year shenanigans.  The Clinton administration is facing a tough political dilemma. Chevron and other petroleum interests have convinced California's Governor that the only solution to the MTBE problem is to waive the oxygenate requirement.  California represents enormous political stakes for November's elections. Understandably, the Clinton administration does not want to say ``no'' to California.  But the Clinton administration does not want to say ``no'' to America's farmers. If the administration gives California and other states a waiver from the oxygenate standard, they will have single-handedly destroyed a $1 billion per year market for America's farmers.  So, what's the easy political solution? Simple. Throw the hot-potato into the laps of Congress. Hold a press conference laying out quote, end-quote, legislative principles for solving the MTBE problem.  By dumping this on Congress, the administration does not have to make the tough decisions, and will be in a position to second-guess and attack anything and everything Congress does do to try to work this out.  And the irony of all of this, is that had the Clinton administration followed Congressional intent about the Clean Air Act Reformulated Fuels Program, instead of listening to the oil companies and some misguided environmentalists, other oxygenates such as ethanol could have competed with MTBE, and we would have far less MTBE water contamination today.  The Clinton administration was warned loud and clear about the health and environmental problems of MTBE. I personally sent many letters and made a lengthy floor statement in 1993 warning then about MTBE and urging that they not give Big Oil a regulation guaranteeing them a market monopoly over the oxygenated problem.  Anyone who has ever smelled MTBE, knows that had consumers been given a choice, they would have overwhelmingly chose to buy reformulated fuel made with ethanol, not MTBE.  So the Clinton administration created this MTBE problem in the firstplace, and now they tell the world that the only way to correct it is for Congress to fix it.  That's just not true. But the truth sort of got lost during the administration's press conference by EPA's Carol Browner. She forgot to tell the American public the truth that each and every State has the authority to protect its water supplies from MTBE contamination. As long as the States pass laws designed to protect the water, as opposed to protecting the air, the Clean Air Act does not legally pre-empt the States from taking action on their own.  And I received assurances from EPA during a recent hearing that they would never attempt to stop a State from protecting water supplies from MTBE contamination.  Now, some would argue that the oil industry would try to challenge such efforts in court.  Mr. President, that proposition is ridiculous. The oil companies chose to use MTBE instead of ethanol. They are now liable for what could be billions of dollars of MTBE clean up costs. And these liability costs mount with every day that passes, that the oil companies refuse to replace MTBE with other oxygenates.  Therefore, who in their right mind could think that the oil companies are stupid enough to take court action to block a State from banning the use of MTBE?  So, why didn't EPA's Carol Browner announce to the world the States already have the authority to ban MTBE--the source of the real problem?  Well, if the administration admits the truth, and if they fail to convince Americans and Congress that only Congress can fix this problem, then the Clinton administration is stuck back at ``square one'' having to choose between California or America's farmers who have suffered the lowest prices in decades.  Mr. President, there are others pushing the phony problem who may simply be struggling to save face, hoping that they not suffer the embarrassment of being proven wrong--wrong in their efforts to help petroleum interests in securing a Clinton administration regulation guaranteeing that MTBE would monopolize the oxygenate market.  These environmentalists would like the public to believe that ethanol was never really a viable option--not then, not now. If they ever concede that point, then it will be clear to Americans that these environmentalists were key promoters of what has turned out to be one of the biggest environmental crises ever to face America.  Mr. President, there are some environmentalists who do not like ethanol, simply because it is something that can be made by farmers. They don't like farmers because sometimes they have to use fertilizers and chemicals. It is that simple-minded.  Mr. President, the real problem is MTBE, and the real solution to this problem is passing the bill introduced today by our colleagues Senator Bond and Senator Durbin.  I warn my colleagues, however, that if they buy into the phony problem, they will end up having to buy into phony solutions.  For instance, the Clinton administration suggested that Congress might want to only reduce the amount of MTBE used, as opposed to banning it altogether. Well, that's a phony solution.  No level of MTBE in gasoline can protect our water supply.  My State of Iowa is facing an MTBE water contamination disaster. First, understand, we sell no Clean Air Act reformulated gasoline in Iowa. Second, understand that for years now, no gasoline was supposed to be sold in Iowa that contained more than 1 percent MTBE unless warning labels were posted.  Nevertheless, the Iowa Department of Natural Resources recently found that 29 percent of Iowa's water supplies tested contained MTBE above the acceptable levels established by EPA.  So what does this mean? Simply this: MTBE is used in conventional fuel as an octane enhancer and will contaminate your water.  If a State is allowed to waive out of the oxygenate requirement, MTBE will still be used and will continue to contaminate our water supplies.  It is phony to argue the oxygenate requirement is the problem, and it is phony to argue waiving or eliminating the oxygenate requirement will protect our water supplies.  Mr. President, this is just one of many phony issues that we are being asked to embrace. I will be speaking further about this at a later time.  But in closing, I ask my colleagues to cosponsor our legislation. It provides real solutions to the real problem: MTBE water contamination.                                 ______                                       By
