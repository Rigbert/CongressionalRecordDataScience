President, today I am proud to introduce the National Guard Empowerment and State-National Defense Integration Act of 2011 along with my National Guard Caucus Co-Chair, Senator Lindsey Graham. Our bill builds upon earlier reforms proposed and enacted through the work of the Guard Caucus to give the Guard and Reserve a seat at the Pentagon's budget and policymaking tables and to update jurisdictional and operational lines of authority in Guard matters, recognizing that the Guard has evolved to become a front-line, 21st Century force that is still trapped in a 20th Century Pentagon bureaucracy. This bill represents a bipartisan effort to do the right thing by the men and women of our National Guard, and Senator Graham and I hope that it will receive speedy consideration and passage.  Ten years ago, the National Guard of the United States was very different than the Guard protecting our country today. A young private joining the National Guard on September 10, 2001, was joining a force designed to participate in an all-out, no-holds-barred war with the Soviet Union, even though the Soviet Union had ceased to exist a decade before. When that private showed up for drill, he or she found facilities in disrepair, a Guard demoralized by inattention from Pentagon leaders, and equipment that seemed to predate the Cold War. Of course, the life of that private, and of our entire nation, would change dramatically in the days to come.  September 11, 2001, woke us up to new realities. Yes, the United States still faced threats from overseas, and like the rest of us, the National Guard wanted to do its part. But as we began to call on the Guard to deploy, those of us who pay special attention to the Guard started to ask questions. Was the Pentagon actually going to send our Guard overseas to fight with its ancient and decrepit fleet of vehicles? What about training? Who would help get these units ready for the battlefield?  Senator Graham and I wish we could say that every necessary measure was taken to correct these problems before our National Guard deployed. But we are still correcting them, and that's what this piece of legislation is all about. Ever since 9/11, I worked with my friend Senator Bond to make sure that these equipment, staffing, training, and other issues that our National Guard faced would be fixed. Our efforts culminated just a few years ago in the first National Guard Empowerment Act, which accomplished things like getting the Chief of the National Guard Bureau a fourth star--and a louder voice in the Pentagon bureaucracy. Now Senator Graham and I are continuing that work. We will not rest until every soldier and airman in the Guard has the training, equipment, and leadership he or she needs to accomplish the mission.  I would like to highlight a few things the bill will do. It will make the Chief of the National Guard Bureau a statutory member of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, a change we have needed for a full decade to make sure Pentagon decision makers consider the unique nature of the Guard when making decisions. The bill authorizes appropriations for Guard domestic operations. It authorizes the State Partnership Program, which has had such great success in my home state of Vermont. The bill will also help our emergency response operations. During Hurricane Katrina, we saw military forces so confused by state and federal distinctions. This bill includes a section focused on a new unity of effort plan that the Pentagon and the Department of Homeland Security have been working on with the Council of Governors and others. The bill will also clarify the relationship between the National Guard Bureau and the U.S. Northern and Pacific Commands and increase the Guard representation in U.S. Northern Command.  Overall, this bill moves our Guard and our country forward. It makes our Guard more effective in accomplishing the missions assigned to it. We ask so much of our men and women in the Guard. Senator Graham and I are proud today to continue looking out for them and empowering them to get the job done when we call them away from civilian life to put on the uniform. We look forward to many of our colleagues joining us in this effort.  I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be printed in the Record.  There being no objection, the text of the bill was ordered to be printed in the Record, as follows:                                S. 1025       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of      the United States of America in Congress assembled,     SECTION 1.
