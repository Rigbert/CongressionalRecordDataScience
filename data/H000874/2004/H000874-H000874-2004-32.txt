 Mr. DeLAY. I think I addressed in my opening remarks the Defense authorization conference. We are hoping to get that out.  The highway bill I think has been debated or talked about a lot on this floor in the last couple of days. The House is ready to go. The House is ready to negotiate with the Senate, and the House has cleaned out a lot of the brush, but it seems that the Senate is going to have a very hard time getting their members in the conference committee to support a highway bill. So that is why we did the extension today on 8 months to give them more time to work.  The FSC/jobs bill, the conferees met on that bill last night. It was a very good conference. Democrats were certainly included, and we have scheduled another meeting for next Tuesday. I believe there is a good chance that a conference report could be ready for the House to vote on later at the end of next week.                              {time}  1800  The appropriations process, the gentleman being on the Committee on Appropriations, knows very well, as he stated, that we passed 12 of the 13 bills. The thirteenth bill has problems. We know there is going to be an omnibus bill, and we will solve those problems in an omnibus bill, but the problem is in the other body. They are passing as many bills as they can get done, and we will go to conference on every one of those bills to try to get them done before the end of next week. That would include Homeland Security appropriation, MilCon, Foreign Ops, the Legislative Branch, and D.C., which are the only ones I know of that the Senate has passed so far.  The rest, as the gentleman knows, we did a continuing resolution until November 20. We have instructed our committees, and the Senate leadership has instructed their committees to work on those as best they can so that, when we get back in November, the Members can vote on those bills up or down.  The higher education bill, right now, I am not advised where it is, so I cannot answer the gentleman on that one.
