 Speaker, I hope in a little while to be joined by some of my colleagues.  Mr. Speaker, as the only independent in the Congress, I think what disturbs me most about much of the dialog which takes place here is, in fact, that the most important issues facing the American people, the reality of life in our country today, is simply not talked about enough. Every day there are heated debates that take place here, and charges and countercharges, all kinds of issues are raised, but sometimes I think that the reality of American life as it exists today really is not adequately addressed.  And before we get into the issue of the budget, which I want to get into, and I hope some of my colleagues will be getting into with me as well, let us talk about reality in America today, a reality that we do not see too much discussed here. We do not see it on CBS too much, or NBC or the New York Times or our hometown papers.  Mr. Speaker, I would argue that the most important issue facing the American people is that for the middle class of this country, for the average working person of this country, for those tens and tens of millions of people who constitute the vast majority of our citizenry, for those people this country is becoming a poorer and poorer country.  Since 1973, when America reached its pinnacle, its high point in terms wages and benefits for ordinary working people, since 1973, 80 percent, four-fifths of the American working people have experienced either a decline in their real wages, in their standard of living, or stagnation. That means they have worked for over 20 years and they look back and they have gotten nowhere in a hurry. That is 80 percent of the American people.  Average weekly earnings from 1978 to 1990 declined, went down by 13\1/2\ percent.  In 1979, the average weekly wage in the United States was $387. 10 years later, in 1989, in terms of real inflation-accounted-for dollars, that wage had dropped to $335. People are working, but their standard of living is in decline.  What is perhaps most frightening is that for young workers, their real wages have declined even more.  There was a study done not so many months ago which indicated that for young male high school graduates going out into entry-level jobs, young men were earning 30 percent less than was the case for similar high school graduates just 15 years ago.  So, when parents look out and they are working hard and they are seeing their standard of living declining, what is even more painful for them is they look out and they are seeing their sons and their daughters going out into jobs which are paying even lower wages.  Mr. Speaker, between 1988 and 1993, worker productivity in the private sector increased by 5.9 percent. That is the good news.  The bad news is that during that same period, average hourly earnings declined by 4 percent. By 1993, the typical family had lost $1,400 of the buying power it had in 1991.  Mr. Speaker, one of the frustrations we talk about, why the American people are angry, why the American people are frustrated, a study done by Juliet Shaw was done at Harvard University which indicated that for American workers to maintain their standard of living, they had to be working now an extra 1 month a year, either in overtime or in second jobs, and in my State of Vermont it is not uncommon to see people working three jobs.                              {time}  1715  Mr. Speaker, 40 percent, and this is an important fact, we talk about welfare reform, so forth and so on. Forty percent of the families in America today who live in poverty have a full-time worker. This is not unemployed people, this is not people just sleeping out on the street, and one of the reasons that our low-income workers are doing worse today than they did 20 years ago is that the minimum wage today, at a disgracefully low $4.25 an hour, has a purchasing power which is 26 percent lower than it was 20 years ago.  Mr. Speaker, we look in the newspapers, and they tell us that unemployment is not such a serious problem. Maybe it is 5 percent, maybe 6 percent. Countries all over the world, in Europe or Scandinavia, they have higher rates of unemployment, but I would argue, Mr. Speaker, and I think many of our leading economists would argue, that in real fact unemployment in America is actually double than what the official statistics tell.  Why is that official statistics do not include discouraged workers? That means people are living in communities where there are just no jobs. They do not go out, so therefore they are not counted as part of the unofficial employment statistic, and perhaps even more importantly part-time workers who want to work full-time are also not included as part of the official unemployment statistic.  One of the very frightening aspects of the modern American economy is that when we look at the new jobs that are being created, are they good paying, 40-hour-a-week jobs? No, they are not, not in Vermont, not in the vast majority of the States in this country. Many of the new jobs that are being created are part-time jobs. You have people who want to work 40 hours a week, but they are getting 20 hours a week without benefits. Are they counted as unemployed? No, they are not.  So I would just conclude my initial remarks, Mr. Speaker, and welcome the gentleman from Oregon [Mr. DeFazio] here by just simply saying, ``Before we talk about the budget, before we can talk about why the American people are angry, the most important reality is America has the right to be angry. Our people are working longer hours for lower wages, for less vacation time, for fewer benefits than was the case 20 years ago.''  But on the other hand there is another reality which is going on. Are all the people in America seeing a decline in their standard of living? Are we all in this boat together? The answer is probably we are not.  A recent study in the New York Times: The richest 1 percent of the population now owns 40 percent of the wealth of America. We have the most uneven distribution of wealth in the entire industrialized world. The richest 1 percent owns more wealth than the bottom 90 percent. Upper income, 4 percent, earns more income than the bottom 51 percent, and, the gap between the rich and poor grows wider, the middle class continues to shrink. That is the reality of American life today for the middle class for the working class, for low-income people.  Having said that, I am delighted to welcome, to my mind, certainly one of the outstanding fighters for working people in this Congress, the gentleman from Oregon [Mr. DeFazio].  Mr. DeFAZIO. And I guess the follow-up point would be what caused these inequities and what can or should we do about it?  I would say in good part you can lay the blame for the extraordinary pauperization of the middle class of this country to two major areas of policy, probably three: The tax policy of this country, which has heaped more and more burden on middle-income [[Page H6037]] people and lightened the burden on those at the very top and the largest, most profitable corporations. In fact, the Republican budget, which passed the House here, would do away with the corporate alternative minimum tax. That means we go back to the days when a corporation like AT&T, as they did from 1981 to 1985, earned $1.3 billion in profits and not only not paid taxes--we all understand about loopholes and avoidance but--actually demanded and received a $200 million tax refund for taxes they did not pay. That is other Americans, people who work for wages, went to work every day, paid their taxes, and guess what? Part of their pay check went to give a $200 million tax giveaway to a corporation which had made $1.4 billion in the same years, and now we are being told that is what will take care of the problems of middle-income Americans. The Republican tax break bill repeals the corporate alternative minimum tax, and that will put Americans back to work at higher wages; give me a break.
