President, as we commemorate National Duchenne Awareness Week, I express my gratitude to my colleagues and to the Bush administration for their support late last year in passing H.R. 717, the Muscular Dystrophy Community Assistance Research and Education Act.  Sadly, at this time, there is no cure for DMD. Little boys with DMD are most often not diagnosed before the age of 2 or 3 years. Most boys with DMD walk by themselves later than average, and then in an unusual manner. They may fall frequently, have difficulty rising from the ground, or experience difficulty going up steps. Calf muscles typically look over-developed or excessively large, while other muscles are poorly developed. Use of a wheelchair may be occasional at age 9, but total dependence is usually established in the teen years. Most boys affected survive into their twenties, with relatively few surviving beyond 30 years of age.  I have heard from the parents and family of two little boys in Maine who have DMD. Their names are Matthew and Patrick Denger, and their family members are desperately hoping for a cure so they don't have to watch their sons suffer the long-term impacts of this debilitating disease. While we are far from finding a cure for DMD, I am hopeful that the MD CARE Act, signed into law by President Bush on December 18, 2001, will help Matthew and Patrick and the thousands of other young boys suffering from DMD. Specifically, the act authorizes the Secretary of Health and Human Services to expand and increase coordination of the activities by the National Institutes of Health with respect to research on muscular dystrophies, including DMD.  Efforts to improve the quality and length of life for thousands of children suffering from Duchenne muscular dystrophy are valuable beyond measure, and I commend all of my colleagues and all of the families who have worked so hard to raise awareness about this devastating disease.                          ____________________
