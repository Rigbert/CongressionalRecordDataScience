 On one night, I believe it was about a month ago, the Republican party raised in one night $11 million. On another occasion, Senator Gramm, who is a Republican candidate for their nomination for president, raised, I believe, over $3 million on one night. On another occasion, Speaker Gingrich held a fundraiser for his television network at $50,000 a plate.  Now, I find it interesting that the Contract With America, must have been just an oversight, I am sure, just by accident, they forgot to put in campaign finance reform. clearly an oversight, clearly has nothing to do with what you have just been talking about.  In other words, we all understand that this system is dominated by money and big money. When people contribute $11 million in one night, when the wealthiest people in America make those contributions, they are not  [[Page H3726]] doing it because they are nice guys. It is an investment. And the investment that they are making is precisely what Mr. Becerra was talking about a moment ago. Tax breaks for the rich.
