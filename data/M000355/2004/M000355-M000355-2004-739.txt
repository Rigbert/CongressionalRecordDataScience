R. 3108, the pension rate bill. While there will be no rollcall votes today, Senators will have an opportunity to offer and debate their amendments. It is the majority leader's intention to complete action on this legislation this week. Therefore, Members are encouraged to make themselves available during today's session to offer their amendments. Any votes ordered with respect to the pension bill will be stacked to occur on Tuesday.  Senators were on the floor on Thursday afternoon and Friday to offer and debate amendments to the pension bill. Although the unanimous consent agreement allows for additional amendments, it is uncertain at this time if those amendments will in fact be offered. If Senators desire to offer an amendment, they should notify their respective cloakrooms today so they can be scheduled for consideration. It may be possible, therefore, to finish the bill at a reasonable time on Tuesday. As always, Senators will be notified when the first vote is going to be scheduled.                          ____________________
