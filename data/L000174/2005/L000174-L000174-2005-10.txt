. custody at Guantanamo Bay, Cuba, to file habeas corpus petitions in federal court. That amendment was modified in conference to further erode these rights, and then identical text was added to the conference report on Defense appropriations to ensure that the language was enacted into law in one bill or the other.  Debates over the treatment of detainees have dominated our discussions of both the Defense authorization and appropriations bills. Senator McCain waged a battle with the White House and his own party to ensure that his amendment requiring the humane treatment of detainees was retained in the conference reports. I commend Senator McCain and the members of the Congress who have fought to address these issues. Despite calls from many of us over recent years, the legislative branch has not met its obligation of oversight and policymaking in this area. I am encouraged that more than 18 months after the revelation of atrocities at Abu Ghraib, we are finally willing to confront this issue.  The administration fought this provision for months, with the President vowing to veto any bill that contained it. But after months of threats and backdoor lobbying, the White House finally recognized that it could not win with a policy that granted itself the authority to use torture or cruel and inhumane treatment in interrogations.  Unfortunately, the positive steps we take today in adopting the McCain amendment are undercut by the modified Graham-Levin amendment in the conference report. As I just noted, I expressed concerns about the Graham-Levin text, and voted against it, when it passed the Senate. At that time, it reflected a modest improvement over an earlier version offered by Senator Graham. Now, it has come almost full circle, and is deeply troubling.  The Graham-Levin amendment as it passed the Senate would deny prisoners that the administration claims are unlawful combatants the right to challenge their detention in a petition for a writ of habeas corpus. At no time in the history of this Nation have habeas rights been permanently cut off from a group of prisoners. Even President Lincoln's suspension of habeas was temporary. The Supreme Court has held numerous times that enemy combatants can challenge their detention. The new version of this text, the text that was added to the conference report, goes even further. It prohibits any lawsuit against the United States brought by a Guantanamo detainee for any reason. This means that while the McCain Amendment requires humane treatment of detainees, the substituted text of the Graham-Levin Amendment provides no remedy whatsoever when detainees are mistreated. The result is that Guantanamo could become the legal black hole that the administration has long argued it should be. The Supreme Court rejected that argument in Rasul v. Bush in 2004.  I am also deeply troubled by other provisions added in conference. The conference report allows a combatant status review tribunal, an administrative review board, or a similar tribunal to consider statements obtained as a result of coercive interrogation, so long as the tribunal assesses the ``probative value'' of the statement. With the passage of the McCain amendment, I had hoped that the Congress was finally prepared to acknowledge that statements obtained by coercion have no value.  A prime example of how abusive interrogation techniques elicit bad intelligence was reported on December 9, 2005, in The New York Times. The article states that the ``administration based a crucial prewar assertion about ties between Iraq and al Qaida on detailed statements made by a prisoner while in Egyptian custody who later said he had fabricated them to escape harsh treatment.'' Just last week, at a speech in Philadelphia, a member of the audience asked the President why the administration continually seeks to link the 9/11 attacks with the invasion of Iraq in spite of the fact that Iraq was not involved in the events of 9/11.  It is beneath the values of this Nation to allow the use of coerced statements in the trials or review panels conducted on the status of detainees. It is also beneath us to strip detainees of habeas rights. Filing a petition for a writ of habeas corpus is often the detainee's only opportunity to openly challenge the basis for his detention. Providing detainees this right is not about coddling terrorists. It is about showing the world that we are a nation of laws and that that we uphold the principles that we urge other nations to follow. It is about honoring and respecting the values that are part of our heritage as Americans and that have shone as a beacon to the rest of the world. Allowing a detainee to file a habeas petition provides legitimacy to our detention system and quells speculation that we are holding innocent people in secret prisons without any right to due process.  Some members of the Senate have argued that these prisoners should be tried in the military justice system. I think that we could all agree on such a course if the administration had worked with Congress from the start and established with our approval procedures that are fair and consistent with our tradition of military justice. The Graham-Levin amendment does allow the Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia to review some of the military commission's final decisions. I am in favor of Federal court review, but Congress seems to have missed the critical step of authorizing the administration to use military commissions. I introduced a bill in the 107th Congress to do just that. So did Chairman Specter. If the administration wanted to use military commissions to try detainees, it should have sought and obtained the explicit authorization of Congress. It did not do so. The system that has been established by the administration to try individuals held at Guantanamo does not provide due process or independent review. It is not a system that reflects our tradition of justice.  Since the Graham-Levin amendment would not retroactively apply to pending cases, the Supreme Court will still have the opportunity to determine the legitimacy of the military commissions, as being litigated in case of Hamdan v. Rumsfeld. If the military commission process is rejected by the Court, I hope that the administration will work with Congress to establish a fair system for trying suspects who are captured in the war on terror. Working in this way, we can restore the reputation of our Nation for upholding the rule of law.  Everyone in Congress agrees that we must capture and detain terrorist suspects, but it can and should be done in accord with the laws of war and in a manner that upholds our commitment to the rule of law. The Judiciary Committee held a hearing on detainee issues in June. At that hearing, Senator Graham said that once enemy combatant status has been conferred upon someone, ``it is almost impossible not to envision that some form of prosecution would follow.'' He continued, ``We can do this and be a rule of law nation. We can prove to the world that even among the worst people in the world, the rule of law is not an inconsistent concept.'' I agree with Senator Graham, but I strongly believe that in order to uphold our commitment to the rule of law, we must allow detainees the right to challenge their detention in Federal court.  As Chairman Specter noted on the floor last month, there are existing procedures under habeas corpus that have been upheld by the Supreme Court that do not invite frivolous claims and that are appropriate. The Graham-Levin amendment would not only restrict habeas in a manner never done before in our Nation, but, as the chairman of the Judiciary Committee said last week, it would open a Pandora's box.  The chairman is right. We must not rush to change a legal right that predates our Constitution. Creating one exemption to the Great Writ only invites more. The Judiciary Committee has jurisdiction over habeas corpus, and it should have the first opportunity to review any proposed changes carefully and thoroughly. Although congressional action on the issue of foreign detainees is long overdue, we must not act hastily when the Great Writ--something that protects us all--is at stake.  I ask unanimous consent to place in the Record an article entitled, ``Qaeda-Iraq Link U.S. Cited Is Tied to Coercion Claim,'' from the December 9, 2005, New York Times.  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in the Record, as follows:                [From the New York Times, Dec. 9, 2005]          Qaeda-Iraq Link U.S. Cited Is Tied to Coercion Claim                           (By Douglas Jehl)       Washington.--The Bush administration based a crucial prewar      assertion about ties between Iraq and Al Qaeda on detailed      statements made by a prisoner while in Egyptian custody who      later said he had fabricated them to escape harsh treatment,      according to current and former government officials.       The officials said the captive, Ibn al-Shaykh al-Libi,      provided his most specific and elaborate accounts about ties      between Iraq and Al Qaeda only after he was secretly handed      over to Egypt by the United States in January 2002, in a      process known as rendition.       The new disclosure provides the first public evidence that      bad intelligence on Iraq may have resulted partly from the      administration's heavy reliance on third countries to carry      out interrogations of Qaeda members and others detained as      part of American counterterrorism efforts. The Bush      administration used Mr. Libi's accounts as the basis for its      prewar claims, now discredited, that ties between Iraq and Al      Qaeda included training in explosives and chemical weapons.       The fact that Mr. Libi recanted after the American invasion      of Iraq and that intelligence based on his remarks was      withdrawn by the C.I.A. in March 2004 has been public for      more than a year. But American officials had not previously      acknowledged either that Mr. Libi made the false statements      in foreign custody or that Mr. Libi contended that his      statements had been coerced.       A government official said that some intelligence provided      by Mr. Libi about Al Qaeda had been accurate, and that Mr.      Libi's claims that he had been treated harshly in Egyptian      custody had not been corroborated.       A classified Defense Intelligence Agency report issued in      February 2002 that expressed skepticism about Mr. Libi's      credibility on questions related to Iraq and Al Qaeda was      based in part on the knowledge that he was no longer in      American custody when he made the detailed statements, and      that he might have been subjected to harsh treatment, the      officials said. They said the C.I.A.'s decision to withdraw      the intelligence based on Mr. Libi's claims had been made      because of his later assertions, beginning in January 2004,      that he had fabricated them to obtain better treatment from      his captors.       At the time of his capture in Pakistan in late 2001, Mr.      Libi, a Libyan, was the highest-ranking Qaeda leader in      American custody. A Nov. 6 report in The New York Times,      citing the Defense Intelligence Agency document, said he had      made the assertions about ties between Iraq and Al Qaeda      involving illicit weapons while in American custody.       Mr. Libi was indeed initially held by the United States      military in Afghanistan, and was debriefed there by C.I.A.      officers, according to the new account provided by the      current and former government officials. But despite his high      rank, he was transferred to Egypt for further interrogation      in January 2002 because the White House had not yet provided      detailed authorization for the C.I.A. to hold him.       While he made some statements about Iraq and Al Qaeda when      in American custody, the officials said, it was not until      after he was handed over to Egypt that he made the most      specific assertions, which were later used by the Bush      administration as the foundation for its claims that Iraq      trained Qaeda members to use biological and chemical weapons.       Beginning in March 2002, with the capture of al Qaeda      operative named Abu Zubaydah, the C.I.A. adopted a practice      of maintaining custody itself of the highest-ranking      captives, a practice that became the main focus of recent      controversy related to detention of suspected terrorists.       The agency currently holds between two and three dozen      high-ranking terrorist suspects in secret prisons around the      world. Reports that the prisons have included locations in      Eastern Europe have stirred intense discomfort on the      continent and have dogged Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice      during her visit there this week.       Mr. Libi was returned to American custody in February 2003,      when he was transferred to the American detention center in      Guantanamo Bay, Cuba, according to the current and former      government officials. He withdrew his claims about ties      between Iraq and Al Qaeda in January 2004, and his current      location is not known. A C.I.A. spokesman refused Thursday to      comment on Mr. Libi's case. The current and former government      officials who agreed to discuss the case were granted      anonymity because most details surrounding Mr. Libi's case      remain classified.       During his time in Egyptian custody, Mr. Libi was among a      group of what American officials have described as about 150      prisoners sent by the United States from one foreign country      to another since the Sept. 11, 2001 attacks for the purposes      of interrogation. American officials including Ms. Rice have      defended the practice, saying it draws on language and      cultural expertise of American allies, particularly in the      Middle East, and provides an important tool for      interrogation. They have said that the United States carries      out the renditions only after obtaining explicit assurances      from the receiving countries that the prisoners will not be      tortured.       Nabil Fahmy, the Egyptian ambassador to the United States,      said in a telephone interview on Thursday that he had no      specific knowledge of Mr. Libi's case. Mr. Fahmy acknowledged      that some prisoners had been sent to Egypt by mutual      agreement between the United States and Egypt. ``We do      interrogations based on our understanding of the culture,''      Mr. Fahmy said. ``We're not in the business of torturing      anyone.''       In statements before the war, and without mentioning him by      name, President Bush, Vice President Dick Cheney, Colin L.      Powell, then the secretary of state, and other officials      repeatedly cited the information provided by Mr. Libi as      ``credible'' evidence that Iraq was training Qaeda members in      the use of explosives and illicit weapons. Among the first      and most prominent assertions was one by Mr. Bush, who said      in a major speech in Cincinnati in October 2002 that ``we've      learned that Iraq has trained Al Qaeda members in bomb making      and poisons and gases.''       The question of why the administration relied so heavily on      the statements by Mr. Libi has long been a subject of      contention. Senator Carl Levin of Michigan, the top Democrat      on the Senate Armed Services Committee, made public last      month unclassified passages from the February 2002 document,      which said it was probable that Mr. Libi ``was intentionally      misleading the debriefers.''       The document showed that the Defense Intelligence Agency      had identified Mr. Libi as a probable fabricator months      before the Bush administration began to use his statements as      the foundation for its claims about ties between Iraq and Al      Qaeda involving illicit weapons.       Mr. Levin has since asked the agency to declassify four      other intelligence reports, three of them from February 2002,      to see if they also expressed skepticism about Mr. Libi's      credibility. On Thursday, a spokesman for Mr. Levin said he      could not comment on the circumstances surrounding Mr. Libi's      detention because the matter was classified.
