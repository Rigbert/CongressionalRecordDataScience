Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.  First of all, Mr. Speaker, let me make a comment generally. There has been a lot of talk on this floor during the course of the consideration of the continuing resolution about keeping this Government going and balancing the budget.  I have observed that I am for doing that, and have voted for a constitutional amendment to require that and budgets which carried out that policy.  The fact of the matter is, though, that those of us on the Committee on Appropriations ought to honestly let all our colleagues know and ought to reiterate that, in general, the consideration of the appropriation bills is not about balancing the budget.  The reason for that is America has gone from, in 1953, spending 18 percent of its gross domestic product on discretionary spending--that is what we do in the Committee on Appropriations, we make decisions on where to spend money, in defense, and on the domestic side--to today when in America we spend less than 8 percent of our gross domestic product on discretionary spending. That is a significant reduction. We now spend less than half of what we used to spend on discretionary spending.  Therefore, when we bring appropriation bills to the floor, it is not necessarily about balancing the budget but making a determination as to where we apply that discretionary spending to most appropriately serve the American public.  The chairman of this committee is one of our most responsible Members. He is a person with whom I enjoy working. He and I do not always agree, but Americans would be pleased with the fact that he and I always respect one another's point of view and try to work so that we get a consensus.  I am going to talk about this bill because there are aspects of it that I oppose, and very frankly, if the question on the passage of this bill was simply do you like it or do you not like it, I probably would vote ``no.'' But that is not the question. We are at a time when we need to make a decision.  In a body that represents 435 different districts in America, there is no surprise that there are differences of opinion within the Republican Party and within the Democratic Party, as well as between the Democratic and Republican Parties, on the priorities. Notwithstanding that, however, there comes a time when you have to make decisions and you have to move forward, realizing that in a democracy compromise is absolutely essential if we are to move forward.  I think the American public expects us to do that. As the chairman has noted, this bill covers 193,000 Federal employees. The failure to pass this bill in a timely fashion, that is, by September 30, 1995, resulted yesterday in approximately 95,000 to 100,000 of those people being sent home.  We are going to pay them. The President has said that, the Speaker has said that, the majority leader has said that. The Democratic leaders in the Senate and the House have also said that. We are going to pay them. However, they are not working today on behalf of the American public. That is a result of our failure. Collectively and individually.  This bill moves us a step forward in doing our business, in passing appropriation bills to fund those services which this Congress has made a determination as the elected representatives of the American public are necessary and proper to serve the people of this country.  Mr. Speaker, the conference report being brought to us today is a mixed blessing. On one hand, if we act quickly and send this bill to the President almost 200,000 Government workers will be assured of continuation of their jobs--because signing of the bill will take the agency out of the continuing resolution fight.  On the other hand, this bill does not meet the need to responsibly operate the U.S. Government.  The bill before us provides $11.3 billion in discretionary funding for the Treasury Department, Postal operations, and other agencies. This funding is $187 million below the amount appropriated last year--about a 1-percent cut. The bill is $2 billion below the administration's request.  Mr. Speaker, the conference on this bill was essentially completed on September 13--63 days ago.  I think it is unfortunate that one issue has held up this bill for 2 months and has resulted in almost 100,000 employees being laid off during this Government shutdown.  The Istook-Ehrlich amendment restricting free speech for nonprofits has delayed this bill for 63 days despite the fact that it is legislative and does not belong on this bill.  This conference report includes no language on this subject but I want to point out that current law already prohibits the use of Federal funds for lobbying.  The conference was able to restore funds for a number of important programs, including the Council of Economic Advisers. The funding provided for tax systems modernization is adequate to meet the administration's objectives.  However, I remain quite concerned about cuts in the Internal Revenue Service which receives only $6.4 billion, far less than the $8.1 billion requested by the administration. I am especially concerned about the impact on tax compliance initiative that is actually a revenue raiser.  Funding for the GSA and OPM is also inadequate in this conference report and I am very disappointed that we could not, in a bipartisan fashion, approve the President's full request for the Executive Office of the President.  I am also concerned that the bill contains language restricting the ability of Government employees to decide on the type of health insurance coverage they wish to purchase.  Finally, I want to express my concern that the bill is silent on the issue of Federal pay and, actually repeals a provision we added last year to guarantee fair compensation to criminal investigators and others covered by the Fair Labor Standards Act.  If it were not for the necessity of providing for a full year appropriations for agencies included in this bill, I would not be supporting this bill.  However, I commend Chairman Lightfoot for doing the best he could with a very limited allocation and I urge adoption of the conference report.                              {time}  1345  Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.
