Chairman, I move to strike the requisite number of words.  Mr. Chairman, I rise in very strong support of the Tauzin amendment. I was also supportive of the amendment offered by my colleague, the gentlewoman from Maryland (Mrs. Morella).  I rise in support of this amendment because I believe that a contract should have the highest regard by this body. In fact, the Constitution prohibits us from abrogating contracts.  The fact of the matter is, as the gentleman from Michigan (Mr. Dingell) and as the gentleman from Louisiana (Mr. Tauzin) and others have pointed out, the judge found that there were alternatives. In other words, there were parties with whom the parties dealing with COMSAT could have dealt with alternatively.  The judge found that for economic reasons, obviously of their choosing, they did not do so. In fact, they made an independent judgment to enter into a contract. They may not like that contract now. This is not an unusual circumstance.  On the Subcommittee on Treasury, Postal Service, and General Government, for instance, on the telephone contract that the Federal Government had, we were constantly looked to to abrogate the contract and allow new competition prior to the term of the contract expiring. So this is not unusual. Parties to contracts often come to the Congress or to the legislatures and seek for a new deal or, as this amendment says, a ``fresh look.''  Well, ``fresh looks'' are nice. ``I liked the contract a year ago, but I do notlike it now. So how about a fresh look, troops? Let us look at it one more time, freshly.'' Well, the person that does not like the contract may think that is very nice, but the other person with whom the contract was made may think to themselves that is a jaundiced look, not a fresh look; it is a look that they have taken advantage of the contract for as long as they determined was advantageous to them, but now, ``Guess what? I want to change the deal.''  Mr. Chairman, I would hope my colleagues would support the Tauzin amendment. This ``fresh look'' provision that is contained in the bill is not fair. It is not fair because it says that the contracts that were entered into freely, as the judge said, do not need to be honored.  It is my understanding from the gentleman from Louisiana (Mr. Tauzin), and I do not purport to be an expert on the technical nuances of this particular piece of legislation, but I am informed that in fact these contracts have a term. They are not unlimited. These parties are not bound by these contracts in perpetuity.  In point of fact, the contracts have a term that will end; and at that time, under the contract, as is fair and every American understands, at that time the parties will have the opportunity to have a fresh look, not legislatively mandated but mandated by the agreement of these two parties in their contract.  The sanctity of contracts is critical to the free market system in which we flourish. The sanctity of contracts is one of the things, as a lawyer, we learn to honor from the very beginning, which is why it is so important to make sure that a contract was in fact entered into, because once entered into, it cannot be abrogated by either party without damages occurring.  Again, that is another reason, Mr. Chairman, we ought to adopt the Tauzin amendment and reject the provision of the bill. Why? Because these are private stockholders, who have invested their money, who are going to sustain a loss if these contracts are abrogated; and, if so, we may well subject the Government to over a billion dollars in damages I am informed. Think of that, over a billion dollars in damages. Why? Because this contract sought to give relief to parties who voluntarily entered into a contract and who now want a fresh look.                              {time}  1415  Mr. Chairman, we can change the policy, but we ought to change it prospectively. We ought to say we are going to change the rules and when the contract is over, you are going to play under these new set of rules. But the parties that entered into a contract under a set of rules will play under those rules for the term of the contract. That is elementary, my Dear Watson, if I can coin a phrase.  I would hope that this amendment would pass, that it would pass handily, and we would send a message to those who enter into contracts. As long as those contracts are entered into freely, they will be honored by this legislative body.
