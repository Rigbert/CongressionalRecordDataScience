 President, I say to the Senator, there are a number of amendments we expect to be called up shortly. For the information of all Senators, we are working through the order we have in front of us right now. Staff is working through a number of amendments we think will be agreed to. At that point, we can work through the final amendments, and we will talk with the Senator about offering his amendment.
