President, we know that the quality of teachers and principals are two of the most important in-school factors related to student achievement. Yet the pipeline into the profession is in disrepair. A report from the American Association of Colleges of Teacher Education showed that the number of education degrees awarded peaked at 200,000 per year in the 1970s and has dwindled to fewer than 100,000 today. This is at a time when all fifty States have reported experiencing statewide teacher shortages in at least one teaching area for the 2016-17 or 2017-18 school year. If we want to improve our schools, it is essential that we invest in the professional preparation of teachers, principals, and other educators. As such, today, I am reintroducing the Educator Preparation Reform Act with my colleagues Senators Casey and Coons to ensure that the Federal government continues to be a partner in addressing this critical national need.  The impact of educator shortages falls the hardest on our most vulnerable students in our highest need communities. Rhode Island is no exception, with Providence, the largest school district, facing an acute shortage of teachers certified to teach English language learners. My home State has also reported shortages in special education, science, math, world languages, and school nurses.  We cannot solve this problem without improving both teacher and principal preparation. We need to make sure that our educator preparation programs are worthy of the professionals entering the field and the students they will serve. The Educator Preparation Reform Act is a key part of the solution.  Our legislation builds on the successful Teacher Quality Partnership Program, which I helped author in the 1998 reauthorization of the Higher Education Act. It continues the partnership between high-need school districts, institutions of higher education, and educator preparation programs to reform pre-service programs based on the unique needs of the partners. Among the key changes are specific attention and emphasis on principals and the addition of a residency program for new principals. Improving instruction is a team effort, with principals at the helm. This bill better connects teacher preparation with principal preparation. The Educator Preparation Reform Act will also allow partnerships to develop preparation programs for other areas of instructional need, such as for school librarians, counselors, or other academic support professionals.  The bill streamlines the accountability and reporting requirements for teacher preparation programs to provide greater transparency on key quality measures such as admissions standards, requirements for clinical practice, placement of graduates, retention in the field of teaching, and teacher performance, including student-learning outcomes. All programs--whether traditional or alternative routes to certification--will report on the same measures.  Under our legislation, States will be required to identify at-risk and low-performing programs and provide them with technical assistance and a timeline for improvement. States would be encouraged to close programs that do not improve.  Our legislation also makes important improvements to the TEACH Grants. It focuses the grants on the later years of teacher preparation, reducing the potential of the grants being converted to loans if a student decides to change majors. Additionally, it allows prorating the amount of grants converted to loans, giving teachers credit for partially completing the service requirement. Finally, it requires the Department of Education to establish an appeals process for grants wrongly converted to loans and to report to Congress annually on the number of conversions and appeals.  We have been fortunate to work with many stakeholders on this legislation. Organizations that have endorsed the Educator Preparation Reform Act include: the American Association of Colleges for Teacher Education, American Federation of Teachers, Higher Education Consortium for Special Education, Hispanic Association of Colleges and Universities, National Association of Elementary School Principals, National Association of Secondary School Principals, National Association of State Directors of Special Education, National Education Association, Public Advocacy for Kids, and the Teacher Education Division of the Council for Exceptional Children.  I look forward to working to incorporate this legislation into the upcoming reauthorization of the Higher Education Act. I urge my colleagues to join us in this effort and support this legislation.                          ____________________
