Speaker, I am pretty sure of next week before a recess. But, again, just pointing to this week, votes were done by 2:30 on Tuesday. Clearly, the House could have gone in at 4 o'clock in the afternoon and been done by 6:30 on Tuesday and accommodated Members from the West Coast.  Then on Wednesday, we reversed the entire schedule and did not vote until after 3:00 because of a parade for people on the East Coast. I mean, some of us might have liked to go to Saint Patrick's Day parades on the West Coast, but the gentleman would have had to give us 2 days to do it. In any case, I do not see great sensitivity in last week's schedule. I hope, after we come back from the recess, they can do a little better by West Coast Members.
