Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.  Mr. Speaker, H.R. 4271 is the product of a 2-year effort by the Committee to examine the disappointing state of K-12 math and science education in the United States.  As we are all aware, too many American students are entering the workforce with an inadequate foundation in math and science. This bill is an effective start toward implementing math and science education so that we may break the cycle of low achievement in these important disciplines.  H.R. 4271, introduced by the gentleman from Michigan (Mr. Ehlers), vice chairman of the Committee on Science, addresses the problem by focusing on teachers. The bill would authorize several creative programs to provide teachers with the tools they need to excel in the classroom.  For example, the bill provides for technology training specifically for teachers. Unfortunately, it is currently the case that many teachers lack sufficient training in the use of technology in the classroom. Additionally, these teachers often lose when administrators are forced to choose to dedicate funds between teacher training and hardware and software for students.  The bill authorizes the program just for teachers so that they will have the opportunity to secure this training. In addition, the bill incorporates the input of many Members on both sides of the aisle.  I am pleased that the House is considering the bill today that brings together so many positive ideas that will help America's students.  I want to thank the gentleman from Michigan (Mr. Ehlers) for all his hard work in producing a bill that deserves strong bipartisan support.  Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.
