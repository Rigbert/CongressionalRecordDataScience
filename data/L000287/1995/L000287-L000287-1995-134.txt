Mr. Speaker, I rise today to commend two individuals who yesterday performed acts worthy of praise, one a Democrat, and one a Republican.  The first, Mr. Speaker, is President Clinton, who last night delivered a State of the Union Address in this Chamber that laid out a vision for our Nation. It is a vision in which lawmakers put aside their partisan differences and work together for the common good, for the well-being of the American people. It is a vision he calls the new covenant.  The second individual I want to commend, Mr. Speaker, is Congressman Gerald Solomon, the chairman of the Committee on Rules in this House. Yesterday, in the spirit of the new covenant, Mr. Solomon decided to remove from the wall of his committee room the portrait of Howard W. Smith, a portrait that many Members of this House felt was unworthy to hang in a place of such distinction.  I want to thank Chairman Solomon. He is a man of honor, integrity, and good will.  These two men, President Clinton and Gerald Solomon, deserve our thanks and our praise.                          ____________________
