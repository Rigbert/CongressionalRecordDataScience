Speaker, as our nation celebrated its liberty and independence last week, a champion of liberty has passed away in our home community of Toledo, Ohio. Judge Francis ``Buddy'' Restivo passed from this life at the age of 91 on July 2, 2013. We extend deepest sympathy, heartfelt prayers, and gratitude from our community to his family for sharing him with us these many years. Truly, he was a generous, kind, and wise ``buddy'' to all who knew him. His gleeful presence never failed to inspire anyone who met him. His smile was infectious, his humor ever-flowing.  Judge Restivo came from humble beginnings yet graduated from Toledo's Central Catholic High School and the University of Toledo, earning his law degree. The economic circumstances from which he arose in his early years were not easy and then he served during World War II, where he was a member of the Air Force 136th Radio Intelligence Squadron. He married his wife, Jane, with whom he celebrated 70 years of marriage. Together they built a strong family and raised four children.  Buddy Restivo dedicated his life to public service and to our community. He was an assistant Ohio attorney general and assistant Lucas County prosecutor. He served on Toledo City Council in 1957 to 1960, and then served as solicitor for Sylvania, Walbridge, and Northwood. In 1971 Ohio Governor John Gilligan appointed him to the Toledo municipal court. He was elected later that year, and reelected to six-year terms in 1973 and 1979. In 1980, he was elected to a vacancy on Lucas County Common Pleas Court and re-elected in 1982. He retired in 1986 and worked until 2000 as a visiting judge and as a hearing officer for mental health commitment cases for Lucas County Probate Court.  Judge Restivo was a fair and compassionate judge with a keen understanding of both people and the law. Lucas County Probate Court Jack Puffenberger said of Judge Restivo, he ``was considerate of everyone in his courtroom. He was an excellent judge. He had good legal knowledge and he knew people and he just knew how to be fair. He was a great mentor . . .'' Toledo lawyer Jerome Phillips perhaps expressed it best when he said, ``I would classify him as a people's judge. He had a wonderful understanding of people and how to try to deal with the problems they had.''  After retirement, though he kept in touch with the lives of colleagues and the law, his focused turned to fishing, family, and University of Toledo basketball. His son explained, ``He went on numerous fishing trips with family members. He was a big UT Rockets fan, especially basketball. He had season tickets probably 40 years.''  If the measure of a man can be counted by the lives he touched, then Judge Restivo was a great man indeed. He has shared his love of life, good heart, and generous spirit as husband, father, grandfather, and great grandfather for his wonderful family, as well as our community and country. He shall be missed by all who knew the pleasure of his company. How fortunate each of us is to have known him, been blessed by his happy spirit, love of life, respect for the ``common man,'' and his even-handed dispensing of the law. His good measure lifted us all. May his family and friends draw strength and comfort from his example of living life to its fullest as he helped countless others along life's way. His life made us all better as people and as a community.                          ____________________
