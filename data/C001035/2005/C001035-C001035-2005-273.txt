President, the amendment Senator Lieberman and I have offered would restore homeland security grant funding to last year's level for the first responder programs and for port security. It is a very modest amendment. Let us remember that when disaster strikes, our citizens do not dial the 202 Washington, DC, area code, they dial 911. It is our firefighters and police officers and our emergency medical personnel who are first on the scene. It is fully offset.
