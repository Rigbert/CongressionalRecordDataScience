Madam Speaker, I thank my good friend for yielding me this time, and I want to thank the gentleman from Illinois (Mr. Hyde), the chairman of the full committee for his exemplory leadership, as well as the ranking member (Mr. Lantos).  I, too, like many of my other colleagues, respect those who disagree with this resolution. I think this debate is enlightening and is being carried out in the highest way befitting this institution, and I want to thank my friends on the other side of the issue as well.  Madam Speaker, President Bush has made, I believe, an extraordinarily convincing case that the Iraqi dictatorship poses a significant, lethal threat to the people of the United States, our allies, and to the tens of millions of people living in the region of the Middle East. Saddam Hussein's dark obsession with acquiring, developing, stockpiling, and using weapons of mass destruction canno longer be ignored, wished away, or trivialized.  In the past, Hussein has used weapons of mass destruction, killing thousands of people, mostly Kurds, in the late 1980s. If not disarmed, pursuant to the terms and conditions that ended the Gulf War and all subsequent U.N. resolutions, he will likely use them again at the place and time of his choosing.  Madam Speaker, the loss of human life as a result of the hideous effects of these weapons cannot even be imagined. In like manner, the environmental and economic consequences would be staggering and possibly earth changing. The agony of death by mustard gas, VX, sarin or radiation sickness is absolutely numbing. The massive release of germs and microbes like anthrax, smallpox, and botulinum toxin would result in massive deaths and casualties and a regional or global epidemic that might not be stoppable.  And now, as we all know, Hussein is on an aggressive quest to develop nuclear warheads and the means of delivering them.  Madam Speaker, according to the U.S. and British intelligence services, Hussein's drive to develop nuclear weapons has been reconstituted, that is, if it ever went out of business in the first place. The British Joint Intelligence Committee assessment noted, and I quote, that Iraq had recalled its nuclear scientists to the program in 1998. Since 1998, Iraq has been trying to procure items that could be for use in the construction of centrifuges for the enrichment of uranium. The report notes that intelligence shows that the present Iraqi program is almost certainly seeking an indigenous ability to enrich uranium to the level needed for nuclear weapons.  Madam Speaker, last night, while brilliantly reiterating U.S. resolve to promote peace by disarming Hussein's brutal dictatorship, President Bush made it clear that war was not the only option, that war can be averted, but the burden rests squarely on the shoulders of Saddam Hussein.  The best outcome, of course, would be a successful redeployment of U.N. inspectors to Iraq, backed to the hilt by the international community, with a clear, nonambiguous mandate to inspect without condition, to have unfettered access to suspicious locations, and to compel Iraqi disarmament.  Madam Speaker, given Hussein's ugly, pathetic record on human rights abuse, widespread torture, systematic rape and mass murder, the only way to ensure that diplomacy and arms inspectors have a chance to succeed is by backing it up with the credible threat of overwhelming force. Standing up to the raving bully, especially when he is armed to the teeth with weapons of mass destruction, is the work of peacemakers.  No one, Madam Speaker, no one wants war. But if we fail to back the diplomacy with the credible threat of force, it seems probable to me that it is only a matter of time before Hussein and his allies in his network of terror use weapons of mass destruction again.                              {time}  1415  The question will not be a matter of if, the question will be when and where and how. Support the resolution.
