If I have time left, I will be happy to yield.  This year, so as not to disadvantage themselves, none--that means none--of the Republican primary candidates have signed up for Presidential Election Campaign Fund money. The Obama moneymaking machine is running all around the country. We see this in the newspapers. We hear it on television. And because the campaign fund would limit the amount of money that whoever the Republican nominee, if they took these funds, could use in order to spread his message on why Obama ought to be replaced by the voters, we ought to just get rid of this fund altogether. It was destroyed 3 years ago by then-Candidate Obama. We might as well not spend any more taxpayers' funds on it. May it rest in peace.
