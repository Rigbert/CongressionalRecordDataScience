I understand the gentlelady's concern and, with the observation that she is going to withdraw her amendment, have a number of points to make but will simply enter those into the Record.  Proceeding with construction of nuclear spent fuel recycling facilities at this time is premature.  Geologic capacity exists at Yucca Mountain to accommodate much more high level waste than currently permitted by legislation  Spent fuel recycling is not economically viable given affordable fresh supplies of uranium fuel  On-site storage of nuclear spent fuel is safe for 50 to 100 years, so there is no rush, but there could be cost savings from removing spent fuel from the nine decommissioned nuclear reactor sites.  Mr. Chairman, I yield back the balance of my time.
