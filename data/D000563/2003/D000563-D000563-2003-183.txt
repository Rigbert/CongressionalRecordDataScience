 Stepping aside from that for a moment, the Senator from Oklahoma is gifted in this area, understands it better than most and understands how little is being done today because there is no money in the Superfund to pay for the toxic cleanup. So as a consequence, this administration neither puts the revenue in the budget nor reinstates the tax on polluters and basically says we are going to turn a blind eye to toxic waste sites across America, which endanger the water supply of communities all across the board.  How can that be right for our children or the families who are unwittingly being exposed to this kind of pollution? That is the kind of policy which we need to oppose and, frankly, it is the kind of policy which I am afraid Governor Leavitt supports and that is why I cannot support his nomination.  I yield the floor.
