 President, if I could ask a parliamentary inquiry. A lot of our colleagues are looking to determine when the final vote will take place. It is my understanding that the Senator from Delaware has the option to move to strike three more conditions--one relating to intelligence verification, one relating to inspectors, and one relating to articles X and XI. On each of those motions of the Senator from Delaware, there is an hour reserved, equally divided, is that correct?
