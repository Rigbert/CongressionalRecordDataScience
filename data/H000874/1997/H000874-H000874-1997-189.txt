Chairman, I was in the Cloakroom and I heard the discussions of the gentleman from Indiana [Mr. McIntosh], and I wanted to tell him that I know I have been discussing, and many members of the committee have been discussing for many years, trying to enhance the ability of local providers of education who have the primary responsibility with greater opportunities to access Federal dollars without having to go through so many hoops.  Mr. Chairman, I have introduced a bill which is called the Family Services Improvement Act. The gentleman from Connecticut [Mr. Shays] is a cosponsor. Senator Hatfield had a bill in the last Congress which tried to simplify the way in which communities access dollars.  If I can make a very crude analogy, a funnel at the top where there are a lot of individual programs, but the child at the bottom of the funnel that we all want to serve, either for health reasons or social service or educational reasons, they have to figure out how to access all of these dollars.  What the bill essentially tries to do is to get the Feds to facilitate that service being performed in a funnel type where it comes in here, but it comes out in a spout at the end not exactly the way the gentleman from Indiana would want it, but in a form that does not put local education or social service agencies or other agencies to the unbelievable difficulty of trying to figure out how we help Mary Jane or Charlie Brown.  So, Mr. Chairman, although it is not directly on point, I wanted to call the gentleman's attention to that, because I think it would be something that perhaps in a bipartisan way we could work on to facilitate what I think both of us want done, although we may have different perspectives on exactly what the ways and means of doing it would be.  Mr. McINTOSH. Mr. Chairman, reclaiming my time, I appreciate the comments of the gentleman from Maryland [Mr. Hoyer] and would hope to be able to address them.
