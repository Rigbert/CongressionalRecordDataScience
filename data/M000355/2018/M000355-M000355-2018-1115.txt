 President, my colleagues and I on the Agriculture Committee will mark up the farm bill today. It is a landmark piece of legislation that will benefit farmers and communities throughout our country. I will have much more to say on the subject in the days and weeks ahead, particularly when it arrives here on the floor.  I am particularly excited that the legislation being considered today includes provisions from the Hemp Farming Act of 2018, of which the occupant of the Chair is an original cosponsor and which I introduced earlier this year. This provision will empower farmers in Kentucky and other States to fully realize the potential of industrial hemp.  For now, I just want to thank Chairman Roberts for his leadership and congratulate him and all of our colleagues on the committee for their bipartisan collaboration and the impressive bill it has produced.                          ____________________
