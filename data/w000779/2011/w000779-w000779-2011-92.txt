President, tomorrow, the Senate will vote on the confirmation of Michael Simon to serve as U.S. District Court Judge for the District of Oregon. Michael Simon is a good and decent man. In my home State where we have a judicial emergency by the standards of Chief Justice Roberts, it is vitally important that Michael Simon be confirmed. To begin, I wish to thank Chairman Leahy; ranking minority member Grassley; the majority leader, Senator Reid, and minority leader McConnell for bringing this nomination to the floor today.  Senator Merkley and I have been proud to put forward Mr. Simon's name for consideration by the President. We were enthused by his subsequent nomination, and we are now hopeful he will soon be able to continue his service to the people of Oregon in this new capacity.  Michael Simon is both a distinguished lawyer and a legal scholar with a diverse and impressive legal career. That career includes work as a public servant, as a litigator, a pro tempore judge, and as a professor. Michael Simon now is a partner at the firm of Perkins Coie in Portland, and he has worked there since 1986. After graduating summa cum laude from UCLA, Mr. Simon attended Harvard Law School where he again graduated with honors cum laude.  He began his legal career in the Department of Justice antitrust division where he served as a trial attorney for 5 years. During his time working in Washington, DC, Mr. Simon also volunteered for and served as special U.S. Attorney for the Eastern District of Virginia. It was through his work at the antitrust division that Mr. Simon made one of his most notable contributions, and that was a contribution to strengthening consumer protection law.
