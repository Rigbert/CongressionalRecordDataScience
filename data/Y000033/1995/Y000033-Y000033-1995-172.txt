Mr. Chairman, I rise in opposition to the amendment.  Mr. Chairman, I would like to briefly point out that the President of the United States, through the Nuclear Posture Review, endorsed the need for the Trident D-2 backfit. The D-5 missile has improved military effectiveness and reliability, greater range, and twice the design life of the older C-4 missile which it replaces.  Trident submarines are expected to last at least 30 years, and in today's world they might have to last twice that long. The C-4 missile will definitely not have that much of a shelf life. C-4 production actually terminated in 1987 and the C-4 will have to be replaced.  The most cost-effective approach is to continue procurement of the D-5 missile and use some of them to backfit the older Trident submarines.  However, the strongest argument I can make against this amendment is that there is no money in this bill for the D-5 submarine backfit and hopefully the gentlewoman would withdraw the amendment.
