Mr. Chairman, while I do not have any problems with the bill at this time, there is some concern that the bill may adversely affect the transportation projects, including those constructed under public and private partnerships.  There is also a concern that the bill may have unintentional effects on the Uniform Relocation Assistance and Real Property Acquisition Policy Act of 1970.  I would like to thank the gentleman for including the language changes that we have suggested in the manager's amendment to help fix these problems. These changes are meant to clarify that this bill does not have any adverse impacts on issues under the jurisdiction of the Transportation and Infrastructure Committee.  Mr. Chairman, I ask that if we discover any additional problems with this legislation for transportation projects, you will agree to work with me in conference on a mutually agreeable solution.
