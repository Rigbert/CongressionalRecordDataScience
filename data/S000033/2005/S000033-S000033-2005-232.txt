 Speaker, Vermont's great jazz saxophonist, Big Joe Burrell, died on February 2 at the age of 80. He was born and spent his early years in Port Huron Michigan. The story of his start in music is legendary. Here is how Brent Hallenbeck recounted it in the Burlington Free Press:  ``As a shy 10-year-old, he approached his mother's boss and asked to borrow $5 so he could buy a saxophone.  `Saxophone?' the man asked. `What are you going to do with a saxophone?'  `I'm going to play it,' little Joe Burrell told him.'' And he did, mastering his instrument in the next few years. After serving in the U.S. Army during World War II, his musical career took off. At an Akron dance he played the opening act for a B.B. King performance, and King thereafter asked Big Joe to play saxophone in his orchestra. He would go on to tour with King for almost two years before meeting up with another major figure in American music, Count Basie.  Basie invited Big Joe to play in his club in New York, and would become the major musical influence in Big Joe's life. ``Count Basie was the predominant influence on me until the day he died, and still is today,'' Burrell said in 2002.  Ten years of playing in Canada eventually brought him to Montreal, from where it was an easy journey to play a date in Burlington, Vermont. There he discovered his nephew, Leon Burrell, was a professor of education at the University of Vermont. The meeting was doubly fortuitous: Leon invited Big Joe to live with him, and he made Leon's home his own for many years. And Vermont gained its most well-known, most well-beloved jazz musician.  Big Joe jammed with fellow musician Paul Asbell, and out of their collaboration was formed an ensemble called The Unknown Blues Band. The core of The Unknown Blues Band included Asbell, Chuck Eller on keyboard, Tony Markellis on bass, and Russ Lawson on drums. And of course, Big Joe. Not only did they make music, but they shaped a whole new generation of musicians. Big Joe, who played with B.B. King and Count Basie, Etta James and Little Richard, was a formative influence on Trey Anastasio, the guitarist for Phish. In fact, Burrell played guest appearances with Anastastio's band in recent years.  Last year, the Unknown Blues Band celebrated its twenty-fifth anniversary. The band was a Burlington staple, playing at gigs everywhere, and most especially at a weekly performance at Halvorson's Upstreet Cafe in Burlington. Even as age seemed outwardly to slow him down, Big Joe kept performing at his customary high level. Cafe owner Tim Halvorson told the Free Press, ``He'd shuffle in with his walker or a cane, but, boy, as soon as the music started and he got a glass of Canadian Club and he grabbed his saxophone, he was 30 years younger.'' As his nephew Dr. Leon Burrell said, speaking of his last performance just a month ago, ``He went out doing what he did best. It's like a cowboy dying with his boots on.''  Big Joe was a big man--not only in physical stature, but big in heart. He loved music, he loved people, he loved playing in Vermont. And Vermont loved him back: He was an emblem of the amazing power of jazz, our nation's preeminent form of music. He showed all who lived in the Green Mountain State how jazz can speak to each of us, directly, deeply; he showed us that the music born in the South and in the big cities of the Mid-west has flowed, like a mighty river, all through our nation. He was an important tributary of that river, and all of us in Vermont who love music will remember Big Joe for that, and for the wonderful performances he gave us, time and again.                          ____________________
