President, when many Americans think of voting, they think of long lines, malfunctioning equipment, closed polls, or even worse, fraud. That's why so many Americans don't bother to vote. But in my home State of Oregon, folks vote by mail and these sorts of problems are a thing of the past.  So today I come to the floor to talk about the sorry state of the Nation's election system and discuss my bill, the Vote by Mail Act of 2006.
