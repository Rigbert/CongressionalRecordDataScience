301 a bill that the Senate can be proud of.  As Ranking Member of the Senate Committee on Banking, Housing and Urban Affairs, Senator Sarbanes has long been interested in the issue of consumer lending practices, and his efforts were invaluable in drawing the necessary connection between increased bankruptcy filings and the lending practices of credit card companies.  Due to the efforts of a number of Democratic Senators, including Senator Sarbanes, we were able to have inserted into the managers amendment to this bill a number of important provisions dealing with consumer credit information. These provisions require credit card companies to provide in their monthly statements and initial solicitation materials information that will help consumers manage their finances in a way that will, I believe, obviate the need for bankruptcy in many cases. The bill also now provides for studies regarding (1) the extension of credit to individuals with a high debt-to-income ratio and (2) the use of credit card security interests to coerce reaffirmations of debt in bankruptcy.  In short, we now have before us a bill that is balanced and that is not simply the wish list of the credit card companies. I thank Senator Sarbanes for helping to make this possible.
