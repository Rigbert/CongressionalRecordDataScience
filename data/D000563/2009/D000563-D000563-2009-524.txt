I want to back up the comments recently made by Senator Levin of Michigan, the chairman of the Armed Services Committee, and our majority leader.  How can we, in the midst of two wars, stop the Department of Defense authorization bill on the floor when our sons and daughters, husbands and wives, Americans across this country are risking their lives? We have this stall tactic on the floor, where they will not even allow us to bring this up for a vote for the Department of Defense authorization. A lot of people around here go back home for parades and wave the red, white, and blue and salute our troops and tell us how much they love them and then come to the floor and engage in stall tactics and filibusters to stop this.  I would say to the other side of the aisle: Don't go home and wave the flag of patriotism if you will not at least give us a chance to vote on the bill our men and women in uniform are counting on. Too many of them are doing just that. I might also tell you that when it comes to unemployment benefits, we know what is going on in America. Hundreds of thousands of people have lost their jobs. As of September of this year, the end of September, 400,000 Americans lost their unemployment benefits, another 200,000 will occur within this month and then 1.3 million total by the end of the year. We have asked the Republicans: Will you let us extend unemployment benefits for people who have no way to sustain their families? No. They want to filibuster this. They want to offer amendments that have nothing to do with this whatsoever. They want to drag it out. They have no sensitivity to these people who have lost their jobs and are struggling to keep their families together under the most difficult circumstances. The Homeland Security conference report is another one. That is going to pass soon, and we are having difficulty from the Republican side getting any kind of agreement getting this measure enacted. This is a measure about the safety and security of our country.  The Commerce-Justice bill, this is one Senator Mikulski brought to the floor. It includes the Federal Bureau of Investigation and law enforcement. We could not get a single Republican yesterday to agree with us to bring this bill to a vote after it sat on the floor for an entire week, waiting for amendments that were promised and never delivered.  Now we have the Energy and Water conference which could pass, an important bill to put people to work in America. We had a vote earlier today, it was 79 to 17--people thought it was a great bill. Now it is being stalled. It is being stopped.  The bottom line is we came here to do some work, not to dream up ways to stall and not do the people's work. Too many people are being disadvantaged by this tactic. It is the tactic of the minority. It is one they will pay for because the American people understand they have no proposal when it comes to health care reform--nothing. Now they have no agenda when it comes to these important items for our men and women in uniform, for the people who are unemployed across America to keep us safe through homeland security and basic bills for law enforcement and for Energy and Water appropriations. They want to stop them all, stall them all.  That may be a good tactic that some of their political consultants have given them but don't think the American people are going to accept it.
