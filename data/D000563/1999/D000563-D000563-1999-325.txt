President, I rise today to recognize a historic institution in the State of Illinois and the nation. On July 30, 1999, the Galena Post Office will celebrate its 140th anniversary making it the longest continuously owned and operated post office in America.  When the post office was founded, Galena was a thriving mining and port community in northwestern Illinois. The streets were bustling with miners, traders, dock workers, and trappers. Though a great deal has changed since then, many of the original buildings remain standing in Galena's historic downtown district. Among these structures is the post office.  The idea of the Galena Post Office was initiated by Congressman Elitu B. Washburne, a pre-Civil War era politician from Illinois. The funds for the facility were authorized and appropriated by Congress on August 18, 1856. Construction of the building began in 1857, when the first limestone shipments for the edifice arrived via tow-boat. Upon the completion of the building's structure on August 3, 1859, the Weekly Northwestern Gazette predicted, ``it will last 1,000 years with only two forces capable of destroying it, one being an earthquake and the other a mob.'' This newspaper was prophetic. The Galena Post Office has outlived every other United States post office. It continues to thrive today with a delivery area of more than 2800.  One hundred and forty years later, the Galena Post Office stands proudly in the center of town in the same condition as it was in 1859. Its 5947 square foot interior was the grand vision of architect Arni B. Young. The two-story building is highlighted by an impressive limestone exterior. Mr. Young's plans included a civic meeting place with a grand cast-iron stairwell, mahogany interior, and arched windows to complement the lobby area.  The Galena Post Office served as not only a post office and a social center but also as a vital part of the community. The Smithsonian National Postal Museum has bestowed Galena's post office with yet another honor, The Great American Post Office Award. This month the museum will host an exhibit commemorating Galena's Post Office for its outstanding architectural features, historical significance to the community, and outstanding record of service.  Mr. President, on Friday I will have the honor to share in the celebration of the 140th anniversary of the Galena Post Office. It is truly a remarkable accomplishment.                          ____________________
