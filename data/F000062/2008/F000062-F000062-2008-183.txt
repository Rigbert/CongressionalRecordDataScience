 President, today Senator Hutchison and I are introducing two bills that will significantly alleviate the burden of illegal immigration on State and local governments: the SCAAP Reimbursement Protection Act of 2008 and the Ensure Timely SCAAP Reimbursement Act. We are joined by Senators Boxer, Kyl, Schumer, Cornyn, Durbin, McCain, Bingaman, Craig, Cantwell, Domenici, and Crapo.  These bills will amend the State Criminal Alien Assistance Program, SCAAP, statute to ensure that states and localities receive more funding for costs associated with incarcerating criminal aliens, and that these reimbursements are given out in a timely manner.  The cost of incarcerating criminal aliens is high. In California alone, the State spent more than $900 million in 2007 to house over 20,000 criminal aliens.  Congress enacted SCAAP in 1994 to help reimburse States and localities for the cost of arrest, incarceration, and transportation of these aliens.  However, in 2003, the Department of Justice, DOJ, reinterpreted the statute. Now States are only reimbursed for what they spend incarcerating convicted criminal aliens and only when the arrest and conviction occur in the same fiscal year.  The DOJ reinterpretation has significantly cut the reimbursement local governments are eligible to receive for incarcerating and processing illegal aliens.  This reinterpretation is even more devastating because SCAAP is consistently under-funded. The President has zeroed out SCAAP funding in his budget proposal over the past 6 years. Through bi-partisan support, Congress was only able to partially fund the program.  As a result, SCAAP only reimburses States for a fraction of the costs of incarcerating criminal aliens. For example, in fiscal year 2007, SCAAP reimbursed only $109.5 million of the more than $912.5 million spent by the California Department of Corrections that year. That means the State paid $803 million of its own funds to house criminal aliens.  This cut has had a domino effect on public safety funding. Every dollar less that SCAAP reimburses States means a dollar less to spend on critical public safety services. For example, after the SCAAP funding cuts in 2003, the Los Angeles County Sheriff's Department implemented an ``early release'' policy for prisoners convicted of misdemeanors.  I believe it is the Federal Government's responsibility to control illegal immigration. The funding cuts imposed by this administration have let our local public safety services down, and have made our communities less safe.  The SCAAP Reimbursement Protection Act of 2008 would restore the original intent of SCAAP so that States are reimbursed for the costs of incarcerating aliens who are either charged with or convicted of a felony or two misdemeanors. States would also be reimbursed regardless of the fiscal year of the incarceration and conviction.  This bill has been endorsed by the National Sheriffs' Associate, California State Association of Counties, CSAC, the U.S./Mexico Border Counties Coalition, the Virginia Sheriffs' Association, the Los Angeles County Sheriff LeeBaca, and the Sheriffs' Association of Texas.  Our colleagues on the House Judiciary Committee unanimously passed a companion bill, H.R. 1512, and I urge you to do the same.  Another problem with SCAAP is the significant delay in reimbursement. Recently, State and county governments that foot the bill for holding criminal aliens between July 2004 and June 2005 had to wait until June 21, 2007, before they were reimbursed.  For example, Los Angeles County, San Bernardino County, and Riverside County waited 2 years to receive their reimbursement--totaling $85.9 million. While they were waiting, public safety offices had to cut back on critical services. This delay is worse when one considers that even when localities receive the federal funds, they are only reimbursed for pennies on every dollar spent.  Delays place unreasonable budgetary burdens on States, counties, and municipalities that already shoulder most of the costs of housing criminal aliens.  California is not alone. Every other State depends on these funds to perform what is ultimately a federal responsibility--to control illegal immigration and its effects in our communities. These delays affect every State.  The Ensure Timely SCARP Reimbursement Act would help ease this burden on States and localities by requiring the Justice Department to disburse funds within 6 months of the application deadline.  I ask my colleagues to join me in supporting these much needed amendments to the SCAAP statute. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the text of these two bills be printed in the Record.  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in the Record, as follows:                                S. 2587       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of      the United States of America in Congress assembled,     SECTION 1.
