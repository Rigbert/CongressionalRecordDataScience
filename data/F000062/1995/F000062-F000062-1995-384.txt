 President, yesterday I introduced and spoke on the Illegal Immigration Control and Enforcement Act of 1995.  As I indicated then, I look forward to working with all of my colleagues on the Immigration Subcommittee, Judiciary Committee and in the full Senate to craft comprehensive legislation in this session of Congress to stop illegal immigration. I believe that the widest possible dissemination of my bill, and of all other responsible proposals, will help us meet that goal.  I ask that the text of my legislation, S. 580, be printed in today's Record.  The bill follows:                                 S. 580       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of      the United States of America in Congress assembled,     SECTION 1.

(c) It is the sense of the Congress that, effective on the      date of enactment of this Act, no new treaty providing for      the transfer of aliens from Federal or State incarceration      facilities to a foreign incarceration facility should permit      the prisoner to refuse the transfer.
