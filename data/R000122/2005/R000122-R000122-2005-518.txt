President, I am pleased to be joined today by Senators Dodd, Kennedy, and Murray in once again introducing the Child Care Quality Incentive Act, which seeks to redouble our child care efforts and renew the child care partnership with the States by providing incentive funding to increase payment rates.  This legislation seeks to put high-quality child care within the reach of more working families. As things stand, States too often fund only a fraction of prevailing child care costs.  Under the Child Care and Development Block Grant (CCDBG), States are required to perform market rate surveys every two years. Yet many Statesdisregard them when it comes time to setting their payment rates, the level at which States reimburse child care providers who care for low-income children who receive a child care subsidy. As a result, States are unable to meet the law's promise to give eligible low-income families the same access to child care services as non-eligible families.  At stake are safe, supportive, and educationally enriching environments for children during the formative years that set the stage for future performance in school and beyond. When payment rates are set too low, child care centers that serve low-income children struggle to survive and may have to close. If they choose to stay afloat despite the limited ability of families to pay, the tradeoffs directly impact the quality of care. Such tradeoffs include smaller staffs, underpaid employees with few or no benefits, and limited employee training, educational materials, and community services like health screenings. Those centers that avoid this route may turn low-income children away or be forced out of business.  Under welfare reform we expect the neediest parents to hold jobs to sustain their families. We must also afford them responsible choices to protect their children while they pursue their economic future.  Our legislation creates a new mandatory funding pool under the Child Care and Development Block Grant to help States increase payment rates, while requiring States to set payment rates in line with updated market rate surveys. As such, it will allow more low-income families access to quality child care, and increase the availability of quality child care for all families.  Support for this legislation is strong among leading national organizations such as USA Child Care, the Children's Defense Fund, the YMCA of the USA, Catholic Charities of the USA, the Child Welfare League of America, and many more. A range of local and State organizations and providers have also offered endorsements.  This year, Congress is slated to reauthorize the Child Care and Development Block Grant. I urge my colleagues to join Senators Dodd, Kennedy, Murray, and me in this endeavor to improve the quality of child care by cosponsoring the Child Care Quality Incentive Act and working to include its provisions in the CCDBG reauthorization. The time to bring payment rates in line with market realities is now. Only then will the commitment to offer equal access to quality child care ring true.  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the text of this legislation be printed in the Record.  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the Record, as follows:                                 S. 526       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of      the United States of America in Congress assembled,     SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.       This Act may be cited as the ``Child Care Quality Incentive      Act of 2005''.     SEC. 2. FINDINGS AND PURPOSES.       (a) Findings.--Congress makes the following findings:       (1) Recent research on early brain development reveals that      much of a child's growth is determined by early learning and      nurturing care. Research also shows that quality early care      and education leads to increased cognitive abilities,      positive classroom learning behavior, increased likelihood of      long-term school success, and greater likelihood of long-term      economic and social self-sufficiency.       (2) Each day an estimated 13,000,000 children, including      6,000,000 infants and toddlers, spend some part of their day      in child care. However, a study in 4 States found that only 1      in 7 child care centers provide care that promotes healthy      development, while 1 in 8 child care centers provide care      that threatens the safety and health of children.       (3) Full-day child care can cost $4,000 to $12,000 per      year.       (4) Although Federal assistance is available for child      care, funding is severely limited. Even with Federal      subsidies, many families cannot afford child care. For      families with young children and a monthly income under      $1,200, the cost of child care typically consumes 25 percent      of their income.       (5) Payment (or reimbursement) rates, which determine the      maximum the State will reimburse a child care provider for      the care of a child who receives a subsidy, are too low to      ensure that quality care is accessible to all families.       (6) Low payment rates directly affect the kind of care      children get and whether families can find quality child care      in their communities. In many instances, low payment rates      force child care providers serving low-income children to cut      corners in ways that impact the quality of care for the      children, including reducing the number of staff, eliminating      professional development opportunities, and cutting enriching      educational activities and services.       (7) Children in low-quality child care are more likely to      have delayed reading and language skills, and display more      aggression toward other children and adults.       (8) Increased payment rates lead to higher quality child      care as child care providers are able to attract and retain      qualified staff, provide salary increases and professional      training, maintain a safe and healthy environment, and      purchase basic supplies, children's literature, and      developmentally appropriate educational materials.       (b) Purpose.--The purpose of this Act is to improve the      quality of, and access to, child care by increasing child      care payment rates.     SEC. 3. PAYMENT RATES.
