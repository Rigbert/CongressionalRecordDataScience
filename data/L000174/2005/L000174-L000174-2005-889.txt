President, I am pleased today to join Senators McCain and Cantwell in introducing important legislation to increase the number of frequencies available for low power radio stations in America. Low power stations serve their communities with broadcasting that reflects local needs and local preferences. In this way, low power FM offers a valuable counterpoint to nationwide media consolidation. As National Public Radio reported this morning, low power FM has a large following of listeners tired of hearing the same programming across the country. For this reason, I have been a strong supporter of low power FM for many years now. In fact, I recently urged FCC Chairman Powell to expedite licensing for new low power stations.  Unfortunately, for many years now the number of low power FM stations the FCC could license has been limited by unrealistic and unnecessary rules requiring these small stations to find available frequencies far from any full power broadcaster. Interference must be avoided if we are to make use of theairwaves. The current rules, however, go beyond what is necessary to protect full power stations from interference and, instead, protect them from competition. This bill will reduce the unnecessary restrictions on low power FM stations.  Of course, the need for low power FM radio must be balanced against other important uses of nearby frequencies. I have worked hard to protect reading services for the blind, and this bill protects those services by retaining the third-adjacent rule where such services would be affected. In addition, this bill protects commercial broadcasters of all sizes from actual interference by leaving intact the FCC's expedited interference claim review procedures.  I look forward to working with all the parties involved to strengthen local broadcasting.                                 ______                                       By
