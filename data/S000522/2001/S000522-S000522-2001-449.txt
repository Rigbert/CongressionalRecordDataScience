Mr. Speaker, I rise today to honor Our Lady of the Divine Shepherd Roman Catholic Church in Trenton, New Jersey, as they celebrate their 60th Anniversary.  In 1941, 60 years ago, in response to a petition by the African-American community, The Most Reverend William A. Griffin, Bishop of Trenton, established Our Lady of the Divine Shepherd Church to accommodate the spiritual needs of a local Trenton community who sought solace and guidance in their Roman Catholic Faith and black heritage.  This new Parish had its beginnings in the former Masonic Temple on Pennington Avenue, where it remains today. On June 14, 1941, Bishop Griffin blessed the new Church and officiated the first Mass. Since its beginning, the Society of the Divine Word has staffed Our Lady of the Divine Shepherd Church. The Society of the Divine Word has the great distinction of being the first congregation to create seminary opportunities for black men. At present, there are about 6,000 members in the Society of the Divine Word working in 62 countries around the world.  One of the hallmarks of this vigorous religious family is its international character and multi-cultural congregation. Teams of missionaries are made up of members from many different nations and cultures working together for the Kingdom of God as a concrete sign for our divided world that such cooperation is both possible and desirable.  Mr. Speaker, for 60 years, Our Lady of the Divine Shepherd has faithfully served its parishioners, ministering and providing services to the community. I ask all of my colleagues to join with me in congratulating Our Lady of the Divine Shepherd and to thank them for all of their contributions to the rich heritage and culture of Trenton, the Capital city of New Jersey.                          ____________________
