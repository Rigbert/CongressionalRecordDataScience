 In accordance with the agreements reached last night, there will be no rollcall votes during today's session. Following the 3 hours of debate this morning, there will then be a period for morning business, with Senator Coverdell in control of the time between 12:30 and 1:30 and Senator Daschle in control of the time between 1:30 and 2:30.  The Senate will then adjourn over until Monday, at which time the Senate will begin debate on the Defense authorization conference report. As a reminder, the vote on the adoption of that report is to occur on Tuesday. Therefore, there will be no rollcall votes during Monday's session of the Senate.  On Tuesday, prior to the policy conferences, the Senate will be debating the Defense of Marriage Act.  All Senators should be aware that at 2:15 on Tuesday, the Senate will begin several rollcall votes, the first vote being on the Defense authorization conference report, to be followed by a vote on the Defense of Marriage Act, and following 30 minutes of debate, a vote on Senator Kennedy's bill.  At the conclusion of those votes, the Senate will begin consideration of the Treasury-Postal appropriations bill. Senators can expect additional votes throughout Tuesday in an attempt to complete action on that bill.  I yield the floor.                          ____________________
