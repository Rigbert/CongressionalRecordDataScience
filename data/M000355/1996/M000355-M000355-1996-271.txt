 President, I rise today to pay tribute to a civic leader, decorated veteran, adventurer, and extraordinary Kentuckian. George P. Whittington, who passed away January 27, was all of these things, and more.  Mr. Whittington, born October 5, 1913, served his country in both World War II and the Korean war. A graduate of the New Mexico Military Institute, Whittington was awarded the Silver Star, Bronze Star, and Purple Heart for service in both the Army and the Marine Corps. During the D-day invasion on June 6, 1944, Whittington commanded Company B of the Fifth Ranger Battalion which landed on Omaha Beach. According to an account of the attack, Whittington led a detachment that punched through obstacles on the beach, scaled a 100-foot cliff and then crawled under machinegun fire to destroy an enemy position. For his leadership, Mr. Whittington was awarded the Distinguished Service Cross.  After the war, Whittington earned a bachelor's degree in journalism from the University of Missouri. He then returned to active duty to serve as a major and battalion commander in the Army during the Korean war. After military service, Whittington returned to Kentucky where he served for more than 25 years on the Henderson City-County Air Board and was a member of the Henderson Community College Foundation board. During the 1970's and 1980's Whittington owned a 1,000-acre cattle ranch in Costa Rica. He also hunted big game in Africa and was an avid private pilot.  Walt Dear, president of the Gleaner-Journal Publishing Co., said Whittington ``was an absolute original. George Whittington was the kind of guy you meet once in a lifetime. He was definitely interesting--a great conversationalist and a great reader.''  Survivors include his wife of 40 years, Agnes; two daughters, Janet and Elizabeth Whittington; two sons, Charles and Richard Whittington; and two grandsons. I would ask that my colleagues join me in honoring this heroic and extraordinary Kentuckian.                          ____________________
