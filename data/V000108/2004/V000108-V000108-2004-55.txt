Speaker, it is my distinct honor to commend one of Northwest Indiana's most distinguished citizens, Milan Opacich, of Schererville, Indiana. Milan is one of twelve exemplary master folk and traditional artists chosen to receive the 2004 National Heritage Fellowship by the National Endowment for the Arts. On Thursday, September 30, 2004, he will be honored by the United States Government for his artistic excellence and his contributions to the art field. Milan's praiseworthy contributions will be recognized in Washington, D.C., at an awards ceremony on Capitol Hill.  Since 1982, the Endowment has awarded more than 282 National Heritage Fellowships. Recipients include bluesman B.B. King, Irish step dancer Michael Flately, and acclaimed performers Shirley Caesar, Doc Watson, and Bill Monroe. Recipients are nominated, often by members of their own communities, and then judged by a panel on the basis of their continuing artistic accomplishments and contributions as practitioners or teachers. Milan was chosen for his expertise and commitment to passing on his skills and cultural traditions to a new generation. I can truly say that Milan is a dedicated, distinguished and committed citizen. I have known him for many years and consider him a close personal friend.  Milan was born and raised in Gary, Indiana by a Croatian mother and a Serbian father. He became interested in string music at the age of four, and at the age of fourteen he began playing country music. At the age of eighteen he took up tamburitza music. After high school, Milan became a journeyman tool and die maker, honing the skills he used to build the tamburitza, a stringed instrument resembling the mandolin. He built instruments for himself, family, and friends; he also played in one of several orchestras.  In 1958 Milan joined the Gary Fire Department. He set up a small workshop in the basement of the firehouse to continue making his instruments during down times. When he wasn't fighting fires, Milan was in the basement of the firehouse making instruments. He worked for the Gary Fire Department for 20 years, retiring 26 years ago. Milan now resides in Schererville, Indiana. He has converted his garage into a workshop similar to a museum of musical instruments. He has several pictures highlighting the different bands he has played with over the years, most recently the Drina Tamburitza Orchestra. Today he is recognized as this Nation's premiere tamburitza maker. His instruments have been exhibited at both the Renwick Gallery of the Smithsonian Institution and at the Roy Acuff Museum. In 2002, he was named to the Tamburitza Association of America Hall of Fame.  Mr. Speaker, I ask you and my other distinguished colleagues to join me in commending Milan Opacich for his outstanding contributions to the arts. His family and friends should be proud of his accomplishments. I ask you and my other distinguished colleagues to join me in commending Milan Opacich for his lifetime of remarkable accomplishments and enduring service.                          ____________________
