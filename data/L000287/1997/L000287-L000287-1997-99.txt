Mr. Speaker, I am dismayed that in our great country, there are children who do not have health insurance. There are 10 million children. That is not right. That is not fair. That does not make sense.  Our country is too rich, too powerful, too strong to have children without health insurance. We cannot call ourselves truly great when we do not provide for our most vulnerable and most precious, our children.  This is a problem that we can fix and we must fix. As a nation we made a commitment to educate our children. We do this because it is good for them and it is good for all of us. Now we must make another commitment. It is time to keep all of our children healthy. Each and every child, rich and poor, black and white, in the big cities to the suburbs of rural America. Each and every child should be able to see a doctor, to get medicine when they are sick, to have medical care when they need help. A sick child cannot go to school, cannot learn. A sick child cannot build for the future. A healthy child can study, work, and dream.  Mr. Speaker, there is no one right way to solve this problem, but we must solve it. We must focus our collective energy, the House, the Senate, and the White House, to solve this problem for the sake of all of our children. Let us come together and make a real commitment to find a solution. Let us put aside partisan differences, and let us join together to help each and every one of our children.  None of our children, not one, should be left out or left behind. We can, we must work together to provide health care for all of our children. The future of our children and the future of our Nation depends upon it.                          ____________________
