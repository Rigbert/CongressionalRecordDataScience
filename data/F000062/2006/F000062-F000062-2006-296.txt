 President, I would like to reserve the remainder of my time. But I would like to also thank the Senator from Iowa. I think he showed, particularly speaking from the heartland of our country--a much smaller State than California--how much a local economy depends on this workforce. I think that is really important to understand.  I remember speaking--and I would like the Senator to know this--with Doris Meissner. She was the head of the U.S. Immigration and Naturalization Service, and I think a very good commissioner. She said: Whatever you do, make it simple. Make it enforceable. That is the key where we go astray with this because you cannot enforce it, basically. Good luck finding all of these people subject to immediate deportation. It is impossible. You cannot deport 1.6 million people. And then to expect the other 2.8 million are going to go home and touchback within 3 years is an unrealistic expectation.  So I hope somehow people will actually read the bill and understand the devil is in details of the language as to whether it can be carried out. I think the Senator from Iowa said it very eloquently, and I thank him for that.  I reserve the remainder of my time.  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the time begin to run on the other side.
