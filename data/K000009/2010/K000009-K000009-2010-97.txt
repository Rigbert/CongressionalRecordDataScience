 I am privileged to share this announcement which has been made possible through thousands of hours of research and testing, investment in innovation and capital at the company's Toledo Mill. The tireless work of the Toledo Mill employees who make the quality whole grain flours that will be important ingredients in many of these products.  As the largest flour mill in east of the Mississippi and the largest soft wheat mill in North America, the Toledo Mill employs nearly 100 workers who labor tirelessly to produce 3.1 million pounds of flour daily.  Kraft Foods has spent four years and invested millions of dollars in its flour milling technology, recipe development and testing to find ways to add more, whole grain to its popular cracker brands which culminated in a multimillion dollar investment at the Toledo Mill.  The whole grain flours produced in Toledo will double the amount of whole grain in Original Wheat Thins from 11g to 22g per serving; more than triple the amount in Wheat Thins Toasted Chips from 5g to 17g per serving; and quadruple the amount in Honey Maid Original Graham Crackers from 5g to 20g per serving. Whole grain will also be added to Premium and Ritz crackers.  This week's announcement by Kraft highlights a commitment to ensure that by 2013, the company expects Nabisco crackers will contribute more than 9 billion servings of whole grain to American diets each year.  Kraft's commitment comes at a time when the American people and Congress are examining our diets and attempting to address an alarming increase in obesity rates.  The Institute of Medicine has recommended that at least half of the grains we consume should be rich in whole grains and, based on today's announcement, the Toledo mill will serve as a cornerstone in our regions effort to remain the center of a national network feeding our people.  The nutrition benefits of whole grains include fiber, B vitamins, and minerals. Eating whole grains at recommended levels as part of a healthy diet can also help reduce risk of heart disease, may help with weight maintenance and may lower risk for other chronic diseases. Today, most Americans only get about one serving (16g) of whole grain a day, compared with the recommended minimum three servings (at least 48g) per day.  Americans are increasingly conscious of the quality of their diet. They want and deserve healthful products that taste good and are good for them. The men and women who work at the Toledo Mill are proud of this important contribution to increasing the range of healthful products available to all of us.  I offer my heartiest congratulations to Kraft Foods, and my appreciation to Kraft's Toledo Mill employees.  Kraft Foods Announces Plans to Double the Amount of Whole Grain in                             Nabisco Crackers      9 Billion Servings of Whole Grain Expected Annually by 2013       Northfield, IL (July 26, 2010).--Kraft Foods announced      plans today to significantly increase the whole grain content      in its leading Nabisco cracker brands, more than doubling the      amount of whole grain currently used across the Nabisco      portfolio. Over the next three years, some of America's      favorite cracker brands, including Wheat Thins, Honey Maid,      Premium and Ritz will include more whole grain. By 2013, the      company expects Nabisco crackers will contribute more than 9      billion servings of whole grain to American diets each year.       ``Nine out of ten Americans eat less than the recommended      daily amount of whole grains,'' said Rhonda Jordan,      President, Global Health & Wellness, Kraft Foods. ``And a      growing number of consumers are trying to increase their      consumption of whole grains. By significantly increasing the      amount of whole grain in our crackers, we're giving them an      easy, delicious way to get the whole grain they need in the      foods they already enjoy.''       Kraft Foods began to transform its cracker portfolio in      August 2009 when it increased the whole grain content of      Original and Reduced-Fat Wheat Thins from 5g to 11g per 31g      serving. In continuing this effort, the company plans to      increase whole grain in more than 100 products over the next      three years, including:       Doubling the amount of whole grain in Original Wheat Thins      from llg to 22g per serving;       More than tripling the amount in Wheat Thins Toasted Chips      from 5g to 17g per serving;       Quadrupling the amount in Honey Maid Original Graham      Crackers from 5g to 20g per serving; and       Adding whole grain to Premium and Ritz crackers.       With these improvements, a number of products, including      Original Wheat Thins and Honey Maid Original Graham Crackers,      will be made with 100% whole grain.       Most Americans only get about one serving (16g) of whole      grain a day, compared with the recommended minimum three      servings (at least 48g) per day, which means they could be      missing the important nutrition benefits that whole grain      offers. Eating a variety of foods to reach the recommended      amount of three or more servings of whole grains can help      consumers get fiber, B vitamins, and minerals like iron and      magnesium.  Combining the Goodness of Whole Grain with the Taste Consumers Love       Kraft Foods has spent four years and invested significant      resources in its flour milling technology, recipe development      and testing to find ways to add more whole grain to its      popular cracker brands. The company will be using whole grain      wheat flour to increase the whole grain content of these      products. Whole grain wheat flour is milled using the entire      wheat kernel (bran, endosperm and germ) to offer the benefits      of whole grain.       ``It was critical for us to get the recipe right to deliver      the benefits of whole grain without sacrificing the taste      consumers expect from their favorite crackers,'' said Carlos      Abrams Rivera, Vice President for Nabisco crackers. ``Just      adding whole grain can change a product's flavor and, in the      case of crackers, can make them denser and grittier. But the      combination of the right recipe and ingredients can help us      maintain delicious taste and texture while adding significant      levels of whole grain.''                Accelerating Health and Wellness Efforts       Today's announcement is a continuing demonstration of Kraft      Foods' commitment to health and wellness. Earlier this year,      the company announced plans to reduce sodium by an average of      10% across its North American portfolio of products,      including crackers. And over the past five years, Kraft Foods      has reformulated about one in four products in the United      States to make them better for consumers.       ``We're accelerating our efforts in health and wellness      because it's good for consumers and good for business,'' said      Jordan. ``Whether it's adding more whole grain, reducing      sodium or removing calories from our products, we're making      the foods consumers love even better.''
