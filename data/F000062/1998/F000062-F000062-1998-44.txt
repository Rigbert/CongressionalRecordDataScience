 President, I rise today to recognize the golden anniversary of the Emmy Awards telecast from Los Angeles. For fifty years, hundreds of the nation's brightest and most popular personalities have attended this prestigious event to honor television excellence.  Beyond the captivating glow of the Hollywood spotlight, the yearly awards presentation is a celebration of California's thriving entertainment industry. Television arts and production contribute billions of dollars to the California economy, generating rapid job growth,higher income, and greater tax revenues. Entertainment's significant financial impact can be attributed to the rising television and commercial production within the state. Recent studies confirm that payrolls and payments for goods and services within the entertainment industry currently contribute over $27 billion to California's economy. The Emmy Awards confer annual awards of merit to creative arts people in the television industry, as incentive to continue supporting the economic growth in California.  Now celebrating its fiftieth anniversary, the Emmy Awards was not always so celebrated and grand. The first awards banquet in 1949 was held at the old Hollywood Athletic Club, with tickets costing a mere five dollars. With few stars in attendance, the program was not even televised nationally. The ceremony was broadcast on local station KTSL beginning at 9:30 p.m. Despite the American public's unfamiliarity with the obscure, new medium, Los Angeles Mayor Fletcher Brown declared the day of the first telecast TV Day on January 25, 1949.  Sponsor of the annual awards program, the National Academy of Television Arts and Sciences has a long and venerated history. Since its early days, membership to the National Academy of Television Arts and Sciences has flourished to more than 9,000, making it the single largest television professional association in the world. The Academy not only presents the Emmy Awards, but also hosts a program for college educators and has underwritten the Archive of American Television in an effort to preserve television's rich and detailed past.  As the Emmy's golden anniversary approaches, let us pay tribute to the award show's support of the entertainment industry and recognition of quality television programming. With 50 years of telecasts to its credit, the Emmy's have become a genuine part of American history.                          ____________________
