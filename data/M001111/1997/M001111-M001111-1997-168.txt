  Let me begin by thanking the veterans of my State for bringing this important issue to my attention. I particularly want to thank Mr. Fran Agnes, past national chairman, with the Former Prisoners of War veterans service organization. Fran is a champion for the veterans of my State and he never lets an opportunity pass to share with me the views of Washington State veterans.  My State is home to nearly 700,000 veterans, and one of the few States with a growing veterans population. Washington State vets are active; virtually every veterans service organization has chapters, posts, and members all across my State. At the State level, Washington veterans are also blessed with a team of dedicated veterans' advocates. For me, this means I have a statewide ``unofficial'' advisory team to provide me with regular information about the issues of importance to veterans. I hear from Washington vets in the classroom, in the grocery store, at VA facilities, on the street, in my office and through the mail. My service on the Veterans' Affairs Committee is a genuine partnership with the veterans of my State.  The bill I am introducing today is a direct result of this partnership. Simply stated, my bill proposes to allow the performance of honor guard functions by members of the National Guard at funerals for veterans.  It may shock my colleagues to know why this legislation is so important. Sadly, decorated U.S. veterans are being laid to rest all across this country without the appropriate military honors.  For years, military installations trained personnel to provide color guard services at the funerals of veterans. Oftentimes, as many as 10 active duty personnel were made available by local military installations to provide funeral services for a compatriot and his or her grieving family. These services were immensely important to the veterans community. It allowed veterans to see fellow veterans treated with the appropriate respect and admiration they deserved, and to know that they would also be afforded a dignified service.  As the military has downsized in recent years, many installations are no longer able to provide personnel to perform color guard services and aid the veteran's family. Some installations do provide limited assistance if the deceased served in that branch of the military. In my State, that means very little to the Navy family who loses a loved one near the Air Force or Army installations nearby. And we all know, when a family member passes away there is little time or emotional capacity to plan a funeral. Too often, the result for a veteran is a funeral servicewithout the requested and the deserved military honors. This must change.  Veterans' service organizations have stepped in and tried to provide the color guard services for fellow deceased veterans. By most accounts, they do a very good job. But VSO's cannot meet the need for color guard services. By their own admission, they often lack the crispness and the precision of trained military personnel. Our veterans population is getting older, and we cannot expect a group of older veterans to provide these services day in and day out for their military peers. We are simply asking too much of a generation that has already given so much.  My bill is an important first step toward ensuring that every veteran receives a funeral worthy of the valiant service he or she has given to our country. I believe every single Member of Congress believes our veterans deserve to be remembered with the appropriate military honors during a funeral service. By passing my legislation, the Congress can send a message to veterans that their service to us all will never be forgotten. I urge my colleagues to join me in this effort to pass this legislation at the earliest opportunity.  Mr. President, I also want to thank Senator and Korean war veteran Ben Nighthorse Campbell for joining me in this effort. Senator Campbell also serves on the Veterans' Affairs Committee and I know personally of his great commitment to the veterans of our country. And I'd also like to thank Congressman Paul Kanjorski, who has previously introduced this legislation on the House side. As I understand it, his constituents in Pennsylvania originally asked him to get involved in this effort. I look forward to working closely with both Senator Campbell and Congressman Kanjorski in support of this legislation.                                 ______                                       By
