Speaker, I thank the gentlewoman for yielding me time. I would ask my friend from Florida to read the administration's position on the bill where they say, and I unfortunately do not have the time to read, insufficient funding. We fear that we cannot fully carry out the administration's request. We believe that Pell grants are underfunded. We believe that five or six or seven or eight programs are underfunded.  That is the administration, that is not us, asking that more money be spent.  Mr. Speaker, today the Republican Party might as well admit when the television cameras are on and the press and American people are watching, it says one thing, but then as soon as the photo opportunities are over, it says another. This Labor-HHS-Education appropriations bill is an unmitigated betrayal of the bipartisan commitment to education in the No Child Left Behind Act. This bill falls $8 billion short of the funding authorized in that act signed by President Bush, congratulated by President Bush, and promised by President Bush to America and to the States, an increase that after inflation is tantamount to a funding freeze.  Just 2 months ago in the conference report on the Republican budget, this Republican majority promised a $3 billion increase for the Department of Education. That is not what we said we ought to spend. That is what you said you ought to spend. Today, it has underfunded that commitment by $700 million on the promise they made 90 days ago, the smallest percentage increase in 8 years. Just 2 months ago, this Republican majority promised to increase IDEA funding by $2.2 billion. Today it would provide less than half of that promise made less than 3 months ago.                              {time}  1630  This Republican majority promised to increase title I by $1 billion. Today, it would provide $334 million less than promised.  This bill abandons the commitments to the No Child Left Behind Act. It cuts low-income heating assistance, slashes unemployment programs, and breaks our commitment to face the nursing shortage.  The majority's refusal to allow the gentleman from Wisconsin (Mr. Obey) to offer two amendments tells us precisely where its priorities lie. It lies with America's millionaires, not the millions of children that will be left behind by the failure on this bill.  They would give a tax cut, the Obey amendment, hear me now, the Obey amendment would give a tax cut for people making more than $1 million a year of $44,000. That is more than over half of what Americans make in a year. That is what the Obey amendmentwould do, give them a $44,000 tax cut instead of $88,000.  Let us put our priorities where our hearts are said to be. Vote against this rule. Vote against this bill.
