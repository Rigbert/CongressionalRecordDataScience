 President, I think most of the items the majority leader mentioned we should be able to move to completion on. There remains a good deal of concern on this side about the way in which procedurally we are going to go forward on supplemental appropriations. But having said that, it certainly is an important piece of legislation. I am sure we will get to the end of the process at some point next week.                          ____________________
