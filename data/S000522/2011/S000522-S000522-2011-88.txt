Madam Speaker, I would like to share a perspective from an employer in my district. Visiting this small business, actually a few hundred employees but still considered a small business, we toured the plant. He shared with me the benefit plans for the employees. He went on to say that orders are coming in, but they are refraining from hiring new people because of the uncertainty of the cost of hiring a new employee. This shows that the health care bill, primarily, is causing uncertainty in the employment sector and causing employers to hold back on hiring new people. This is not good for our economy. It's not good for our deficit. Most importantly, it's not good for the American people. And that's why I'm extremely concerned with the $20 billion tax on medical device makers that will just increase the cost of cutting-edge medical technology for consumers and patients themselves.  Madam Speaker, we need a patient-centered health care plan, one that does not depend on new government programs, one that focuses more on patients, and one that will cause a lot of the problems to go away.
