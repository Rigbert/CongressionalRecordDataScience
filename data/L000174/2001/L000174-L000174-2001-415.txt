President, as I stated at the beginning of this debate, of course I respect the will of the Senate and the vote of every Senator.  I hope now that Mr. Olson has been confirmed as Solicitor General, he will listen very carefully to the debate and handle that position with the nonpartisanship and candor the office requires. I congratulate him on his confirmation and wish him and his family well.  I yield the floor.                          ____________________
