Mr. Speaker, both Common Cause and I insist that ``in order to carry out the responsibilities of an outside counsel effectively, it is necessary for the counsel's authority and independence to be clearly and publicly established.'' The special counsel must have the ``authority and independence necessary to conduct the inquiry in an effective and credible manner.'' The House of Representatives, as well as the American public, deserve an investigation which will uncover the truth. At this moment, I am afraid that the apparent restrictions placed on this special counsel will not allow the truth to be uncovered. ``The rules normally applied by the Ethics Committee to an investigation of a typical Member are insufficient in an investigation of the Speaker of the House. Clearly, this investigation has to meet a higher standard of public accountability and integrity.'' Prophetic words, indeed, Mr. Speaker.  These are the words of the current Speaker of the House in 1988 referring to the investigation of a former Speaker of this House. This House cannot and must not tolerate a double standard. The Ethics Committee must follow the standard set by Speaker Gingrich.  We need an outside counsel to investigate Speaker Gingrich and we must not restrict the scope of that counsel's investigation.                          ____________________
