President, one of my fondest memories of my undergraduate days at St. Michael's college was getting to know both Dr. William Tortolano and his extremely accomplished wife Martha.  I could tell many stories about the Tortolanos and the times they were also part of the Leahy family. I would rather let a story in the Burlington Free Press about his retirement after a 50-year career at St. Michael's speak for me, and I ask unanimous consent that it be printed in the Record.  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in the Record, as follows:            [From the Burlington Free Press, April 20, 2010]          St. Michael's College Professor Departs With Concert                           (By Matt Sutkoski)       St. Michael's College emeritus professor William Tortolano      has made big, varied contributions to the school in his 50-     year career there.       He's taught humanities and music, directed the chorus, gave      and organized countless performances, and even designed the      organ in St. Michael's chapel.       So it stands to reason his going-away gift to the community      is just as varied.       The free concert at 7:30 p.m. today in the chapel will      feature his beloved organ, even more beloved family members,      the Vermont Gregorian Chant Schola, the St. Michael's College      Chorale and a wide range of musical selections.       Tortolano, 80, is founder and first chairman of the St.      Michael's College fine arts department. He also founded the      St. Michael's Chorale and was its director for 28 years.       Music extends deeply into his personal life. He married a      musician, his three children are accomplished musicians and      his grandchildren are headed in the same direction, he said.      ``They were not forced into it, obviously. This was something      they wanted to do,'' Tortolano said.       Tonight's concert will feature two of his children, and a      grandson, a senior majoring in music at Boston College and a      cellist.       Tortolano said he had some experience with organ design      because he took a course on the subject while at the New      England Conservatory of Music, and he has always been      interested in the instrument.       He designed the organ for the Chapel of St. Michael the      Archangel with the structure's acoustics in mind. ``It has to      fit the acoustics, the reverberations. You don't buy it at      Walmart or anything,'' he said.       He completed the organ's design in 1962; the chapel opened      in 1964; and the organ was installed in 1966, he said. At the      time, it cost $13,500, which in today's dollars would be more      than $97,000, according to the Consumer Price Index inflation      calculator. That's not particularly expensive for a custom-     made organ, he said.       St. Michael's College's student body was strictly male when      Tortolano joined the faculty. He was in charge of the chorus,      but as more women became students, he created a new St.      Michael's Chorale in 1970, when the college became co-ed and      eventually disbanded the all-male group.       Tortolano said the Chorale is among his best memories of      his career. True, he performed for the Pope, and at Notre      Dame, and Cambridge University. But he said he takes great      joy in remaining in touch with past Chorale members and      attending reunions.       This semester, Tortolano is teaching humanities, but this      will be his last year, and the concert is his official      retirement.       He won't just sit back. ``I feel very good, and I keep very      busy,'' he said. He'll continue in music; he'll do workshops      and recitals. And, Tortolano says, he'll look back fondly at      his five decades at St. Michael's.       ``It's been a great experience,'' he said.                          ____________________
