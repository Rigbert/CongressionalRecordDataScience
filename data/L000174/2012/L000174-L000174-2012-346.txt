President, today, I am introducing legislation that will protect American consumers by improving the labeling on prescription drugs to promote consumer safety. This important bill will ensure that all drug manufacturers can update the warning labels for their products so that the information provided to doctors and consumers is as accurate and up-to-date as possible. It is a straightforward measure that has the support of patient groups and consumer advocates. I am pleased that Senators Franken, Coons, Whitehouse, Bingaman, Brown of Ohio, and Blumenthalhave joined me as original cosponsors of the bill.  The Patient Safety and Generic Labeling Improvement Act will promote consumer safety by ensuring that generic drug companies can improve the warning information for their products in the same way that brand manufacturers can under existing law. This ability is especially important given the large role that generics play in the market for prescription drugs. The Department of Health and Human Services reports that generic drugs now make up 75 percent of the market for pharmaceuticals. Studies show that when a generic version of a drug is available, 90 percent of prescriptions are filled with the generic version of the drug. The large role that generics play in the market gives them important insight into side effects experienced by their customers. The Patient Safety and Generic Labeling Improvement Act will allow generic manufacturers to act on this information, by authorizing them to improve their labels to provide accurate and up-to-date warnings to consumers.  A recent Supreme Court decision, Pliva v. Mensing, created the need for this important legislation. In the Mensing case, a narrow 5 4 majority on the Court held that a Minnesota woman, Gladys Mensing, could not recover for debilitating injuries she received from a mislabeled drug that was intended to treat her diabetes symptoms. Despite evidence that long-term use of the drug could cause a severe neurological condition known as tardive dyskinesia, the manufacturer's label did not expressly warn against long-term use until years after Ms. Mensing began taking the drug. She developed the condition, losing control of muscles in her face, arms and legs.  Ms. Mensing's injuries are life-changing and irreversible. The Supreme Court held that she cannot be compensated for the drug company's failures because of a technicality in the law. That technicality arose because Ms. Mensing's pharmacy had filled her prescription with the generic version of the drug. The Supreme Court held that, unlike brand name companies, generic manufacturers cannot be held liable for inadequate labeling, because they cannot change the labels on their products independently. Generic manufacturers should have the ability to participate fully in the labeling process, but they are unable to do so. More important to injured consumers, there is no remedy for them. The generic manufacturers can use this Supreme Court decision and the quirk in the labeling laws to avoid any accountability, even if they fail to inform the FDA that a label is inadequate.  The Mensing decision creates a troubling inconsistency in the law governing prescription drugs. If a consumer takes the brand-name version of drug, she can sue the manufacturer for inadequate warnings. If the pharmacy happens to give her the generic version, as happened to Ms. Mensing, she is unable to seek compensation for her injuries. The result is a two-track system that penalizes consumers of generic drugs even though many consumers have no control over which drug they take, because their health insurance plan or state laws require them to take generics if they are available.  In an editorial published last month, The New York Times criticized the inconsistency of this outcome, writing: ``Same drug. Same devastating health consequences. Opposite results. This injustice will affect more people as generics, which already dominate the market, expand even more under the pressure to control health care costs.'' Even Justice Thomas, writing for the majority in Mensing, acknowledged the inconsistent outcome, writing: ``[I]t is not the Court's task to decide whether the statutory scheme established by Congress is unusual or even bizarre.'' Writing in dissent, Justice Sotomayor accurately warned of ``absurd consequences'' that will flow from the ``happenstance'' of whether a prescription was filled with a brand-name or generic drug.  I agree that having different rules for patients who take generic and brand-name drugs makes little sense, and raises significant policy concerns. It is also troubling that generic manufacturers cannot update their safety labels in the same way that brand manufacturers can. In today's world, where generic drugs make up 75 percent of the prescription drug market, all manufacturers should be able to improve the warning information they provide to doctors and consumers. The Patient Safety and Generic Labeling Improvement Act will achieve this goal.  This legislation is not intended to overburden the makers of generic drugs. Instead, it authorizes generic drug manufacturers to act upon drug safety information that they already gather pursuant to existing regulation. The FDA requires generic manufacturers to monitor, investigate and report adverse side effects experienced by users of their drug. Generics already must submit an annual report to the FDA summarizing new information that ``might affect the safety, effectiveness or labeling of a drug product'', including a ``description of actions they have taken or intend to take as a result of this new information''. When brand-name manufacturers exit the market--as is often the case after generics are introduced--generics may be the only manufacturers who gather this information.  The Patient Safety and Generic Labeling Improvement Act authorizes generics to act on the information they gather to improve the labeling on their product in the same way that brand-owners may do under existing law. It creates an exception to the general requirement that the labeling of a generic drug must be the same as the labeling of its brand-name or listed equivalent, and instead allows generic manufacturers to initiate a labeling change where that process is available to brand-name manufacturers. Under the law, a generic manufacturer would be able to use the ``Changes Being Effected'' process that permits manufacturers to implement a labeling change while the change is simultaneously reviewed by the FDA. When a labeling change is made under this provision, the FDA would be authorized to order conforming changes across equivalent drugs to ensure consistent labeling among products.  This legislation has the support of public interest groups and advocates, including the AARP, Public Citizen, the Alliance for Justice, and numerous consumer groups.  I have long worked to ensure that safe, affordable generic drugs are available to American consumers. Earlier this Congress, I introduced legislation to facilitate the importation of low-cost generic drugs from Canada, a measure that will increase competition and help drive down the prices of prescription drugs. We all benefit from the availability of safe, affordable medication to help reduce the overwhelming costs of healthcare.  The legislation I am introducing today will promote accountability and ensure that all drug makers can take appropriate steps to enhance warnings given to doctors and consumers. I hope that other Senators will join me and my cosponsors in supporting this important legislation.  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill and letters of support be printed in the Record.  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in the Record, as follows:                                S. 2295       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of      the United States of America in Congress assembled,     SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.       This Act may be cited as the ``Patient Safety and Generic      Labeling Improvement Act''.     SEC. 2. WARNING LABELING WITH RESPECT TO GENERIC DRUGS.       Section 505(j) of the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act      (21 U.S.C. 355(j)) is amended by adding at the end the      following:       ``(11)(A) Notwithstanding any other provision of this Act,      the holder of an approved application under this subsection      may change the labeling of a drug so approved in the same      manner authorized by regulation for the holder of an approved      new drug application under subsection (b).       ``(B) In the event of a labeling change made under      subparagraph (A), the Secretary may order conforming changes      to the labeling of the equivalent listed drug and each drug      approved under this subsection that corresponds to such      listed drug.''.                                  ____                                                         AARP,                                                   March 30, 2012.     Hon. Patrick J. Leahy,     U.S. Senate,     Washington, DC.       Dear Senator Leahy: AARP is pleased to endorse your      legislation, the Patient Safety     and Generic Labeling Improvement Act, to address the issue of      whether generic drug manufacturers have a duty to include new      warnings about potentially serious side effects on their      labels as they become known. Your bill would accomplish this      by giving generic drug makers the same ability to update      their labeling as currently exists for manufacturers of brand      name drugs.       AARP believes generic drugs are one of the safest and most      effective ways for consumers to lower their prescription drug      costs, and we encourage our members to use generic drugs      whenever possible. However, AARP is concerned that, unlike      brand name drug manufacturers, generic drug manufacturers      cannot be held liable for inadequate drug warning labels due      to their inability to directly update their labels under      current law.       As noted in an AARP Foundation amicus brief submitted in      Pliva v. Mensing, AARP believes that holding generic drug      makers to a lower standard will effectively punish consumers      for choosing generic drugs and send the message that generics      are less trustworthy than name brand drugs--directly counter      to the intent of the Hatch-Waxman Act. We are encouraged by      your bill and hope it will serve to not only ensure patients      have adequate legal protections, but also prompt improvements      to the FDA process for updating warning labels when new      information about potentially harmful side effects comes to      light.       We thank you for your leadership in this area, and we look      forward to working with you and your colleagues on both sides      of the aisle to advance the Patient Safety and Generic      Labeling Improvement Act. If you have any further questions,      please feel free to call me or have your staff contact KJ      Hertz of our Government Affairs staff at 202 434 3770.           Sincerely,                                                  Joyce A. Rogers,     Senior Vice President, Government Affairs.                                  ____                                                   April 17, 2012.     Hon. Patrick Leahy,     U.S. Senate,     Washington, DC.       Dear Chairman Leahy: We write to express our strong support      for the Patient Safety and Generic Labeling Improvement Act,      which would promote consumer safety by ensuring that generic      drug companies can improve the warning information for their      products in the same way that brand manufacturers can under      existing law.       By authorizing generic manufacturers to improve their      labels using the same ``Changes Being Effected'' process that      is currently available to brand-name manufacturers, this      legislation will help protect millions of Americans. The      Department of Health and Human Services reports that generic      drugs now make up 75 percent of the market for      pharmaceuticals, and studies show that when a generic version      of a drug is available 90 percent of prescriptions are filled      with the generic.       This much-needed legislation responds to the Supreme      Court's 2011 decision in PLIVA v. Mensing, in which the Court      held 5 4 that a Minnesota woman, Gladys Mensing, could not      recover damages for debilitating injuries she received from a      drug with an inadequate warning label simply because her      prescription was filled with the generic version of the drug,      rather than with the brand-name drug. The Court previously      held in Wyeth v. Levine (2009) that federal law does not      preempt failure-to-warn claims against brand-name drug      manufacturers. The Mensing decision thus created an arbitrary      distinction whereby a court's ruling on whether or not a      consumer can obtain relief turns solely on the happenstance      of whether his or her prescription was filled with a brand-     name or generic drug.       This troubling and unfair inconsistency in the law is      exacerbated by the fact that many consumers have little      control over which version of a drug they are given. Many      brand-name manufacturers exit the market after generics are      introduced. Moreover, many state laws and health insurance      plans require consumers to be given generics if they are      available.       Given the inherent unfairness of the current law and the      ongoing harm to millions of Americans, the Senate should pass      this legislation without delay.           Sincerely,         Alliance for Justice, Consumer Action, Consumer            Federation of America, Consumers Union, Consumer            Watchdog, National Association of Consumer Advocates,            and US PIRG.                                  ____                                               Public Citizen,                                   Washington, DC, April 18, 2012.     Re Letter in support of Patient Safety and Generic Labeling          Improvement Act     Hon. Patrick Leahy, Chairman,     U.S. Senate, Committee on the Judiciary,     Washington, DC.       Dear Chairman Leahy: Public Citizen, a nonprofit consumer      advocacy organization with 250,000 members and supporters      nationwide, writes to applaud your introduction of      legislation that would give generic drug manufacturers the      authority to revise labeling for their products when they      become aware of risks that are not adequately disclosed. This      bill would fill a gaping hole in drug regulation that poses a      threat to patients' health and safety.       Your legislation reflects the concerns voiced by Public      Citizen in a citizen petition that we submitted to the Food      and Drug Administration in August 2011. As we explained in      the petition, the generic drug market has grown exponentially      in the past 25 years, and generic drugs now constitute a      majority of the prescription drugs sold in the United States.      The growth of generic drug sales reflects the fact that      generics offer equally effective but more affordable      alternatives to their brand-name counterparts. The regulatory      system, however, has not adjusted to the marketplace.       Under current law, a generic drug manufacturer is not      authorized to revise product labeling when it becomes aware      of inadequacies in the labeling. Specifically, FDA      regulations provide that, unlike brand-name manufacturers,      generic drug manufacturers are not permitted to initiate      labeling revisions to strengthen warnings, contraindications,      or precautions. As a result, the millions of patients who use      generic drugs may not have access to up-to-date information      on safety and proper use. And generic drug manufacturers lack      incentive to monitor and ensure the safety of their products,      even when the generic versions represent a majority of the      market for a particular drug. Your legislation would correct      this problem.       Your bill would also correct an illogical inconsistency in      the accountability that generic and brand-name drug      manufacturers have to patients. In a 2011 decision, PLIVA v.      Mensing, the Supreme Court relied on FDA regulations to hold      that a consumer injured by a generic drug with inadequate      warnings cannot seek compensation under state law for failure      to warn. By contrast, in a 2008 decision, Wyeth v. Levine,      the Court had held that manufacturers of prescription drugs      could be held accountable to patients for harm their drugs      caused. The Justices in Mensing itself noted that this      inconsistency ``makes little sense,'' with four Justices      calling it ``absurd.''       As the Supreme Court has noted, ``the FDA has limited      resources to monitor the 11,000 drugs on the market, and      manufacturers have superior access to information about their      drugs, especially in the postmarketing phase as new risks      emerge.'' Under your bill, generic drug manufacturers, who      already have access to relevant safety information, would be      able to revise their labeling as new information comes to      light, thereby making their products safer for patients.       For these reasons, Public Citizen strongly supports your      intent to fill the regulatory gap in generic drug safety. We      look forward to working with you to pass this important      legislation.           Sincerely,                                             Allison M. Zieve,                                                         Director,                                  Public Citizen Litigation Group.                                          Sidney M. Wolfe, MD,                                                         Director,     Public Citizen Health Research Group.                                  ____                [From the New York Times, Mar. 23, 2012]                   A Bizarre Outcome on Generic Drugs       Dozens of suits against drug companies have been dismissed      in federal and state courts because of a decision by the      Supreme Court last year that makes it virtually impossible to      sue generic manufacturers for failing to provide adequate      warning of a prescription drug's dangers. This outrageous      denial of a patient's right to recover fair damages makes it      imperative that Congress or the Food and Drug Administration      fashion a remedy.       This situation is particularly bizarre because patients      using the brand-name drug can sue when those using the      generic form of the drug cannot, as explained by Katie Thomas      in The Times on Wednesday. In 2008, the Supreme Court ruled      that a Vermont woman who had her hand and forearm amputated      because of gangrene after being injected with a brand name      antinausea drug could sue the manufacturer for inadequate      warning of the risks; she won $6.8 million from Wyeth.       In 2011, the court ruled that similar failure-to-warn suits      could not be brought against makers of generic drugs. As a      result, an Indiana woman who was also forced to have her hand      amputated because of gangrene after being injected with a      generic version of the same antinausea drug had her case      dismissed.       Same drug. Same devastating health consequences. Opposite      results. This injustice will affect more people as generics,      which already dominate the market, expand even more under the      pressure to control health care costs.       The Supreme Court's disparate rulings hinge on the ability      of the drug makers to change a warning label if they detect      new evidence of dangers. In 2008, the court found that brand-     name manufacturers had the unilateral power to change      warnings through various mechanisms even before asking the      Food and Drug Administration for a formal change.       Then, in 2011, the court found that, under the F.D.A.'s      interpretation of a 1984 law, known as the Hatch-Waxman      amendments to the Food, Drug and Cosmetic Act, the generic      versions must carry warning labels identical to those of the      brand-name drug. The goal was to minimize confusion and      dispel any doubt that a generic was therapeutically      equivalent to the brand-name drug. Generic makers can't      change the warnings but can propose a change to the F.D.A.,      which can then bring about a revision of the brand-name label      to trigger a corresponding change in the generic label. The      court ruled that because the generic makers do not control      the     labeling, they cannot be sued under state law for inadequate      warnings.       Justice Clarence Thomas, writing for the majority in 2011,      acknowledged that the distinction ``makes little sense'' in      the eyes of consumers, and Justice Sonia Sotomayor, writing      the dissent, predicted ``absurd consequences'' depending on      the ``happenstance'' of whether a prescription was filled      with a brand-name or generic drug.       Congress should fix the disparity by amending the law to      make it clear--as Representative Henry Waxman, a co-author of      the statute contends--that the act did not intend to preempt      all failure-to-warn claims. Alternatively, the F.D.A. should      fix the liability problem by amending its regulations to      allow generic manufacturers to change the warning labels.       Generic drugs have rapidly expanded their reach, and, by      one estimate, from one-third to one-half of all generic drugs      no longer have a brand-name competitor. The regulatory system      needs to hold generic companies, many of them large      multinationals, accountable for labels on the products they      sell.
