 Mr. Speaker, I urge all of my colleagues, do not think about party on this vote. Think about precedent. Think about this institution. Think about the Constitution of the United States of America. And if you haven't read, read some of the legal opinions that say you have to establish a predicate before you can tell an American that they will be held criminally liable if they don't respond to your questions.  That is what this issue is about. It is not about party, it is not about any of us, but about the constitutional protections that every American deserves and ought to be given.
