Madam Speaker, as chair of the congressional Lyme Disease Caucus and a person who has been closely involved in Lyme disease issues for over twenty years, I want to bring to your attention extremely troubling issues regarding Lyme disease.  Lyme disease is the most common of all vector-borne infections in the U.S., with approximately 290,000 new cases in 2008. With the increase in Lyme cases, problems due to poor diagnostics and ineffective treatments for Lyme disease have become almost overwhelming--affecting larger numbers of people over longer periods of time.  Many patients are angry because progress in addressing Lyme disease has been impeded by entrenched bias and a lack of accountability in the science of tick borne diseases. It is critical that we identify biases and impediments that are constraining the science on Lyme and to open up the dialogue to honest and transparent debate. The scientists who have long been marginalized, the treating physicians who have felt intimidated and threatened, and most importantly the sick patients and their families need our help.  My main purpose here today is to introduce for inclusion in the Congressional Record the following statement ``The Patient Perspectives on the Research Gaps in Tick Borne Diseases,'' written by three of the Nation's largest Lyme disease advocacy organizations, who represent tens of thousands of patients. I believe that this statement provides important perspectives that need to be heard and taken to heart.    Patient Perspectives on the Research Gaps in Tick Borne Diseases(Submitted by Time for Lyme, the national Lyme Disease Association, and    the California Lyme Disease Association on behalf of our patients                        across the United States)       In December 2009, Labor HHS 2010 appropriations language,      signed into law by President Obama, encouraged the National      Institutes of Health (NIH) to ``sponsor a scientific      conference on Lyme and tick-borne diseases . . . the      conference should represent the broad spectrum of scientific      views . . . and should provide a forum for public      participation and input from individuals with Lyme disease.''      The language also requires NIH to identify research gaps to      understand the ``mechanisms of persistent infection.'' The      passage of this language represents a significant opportunity      to summarize and solidify the issues that prevent scientific      progress for a disease recognized here for 35 years, if, and      only if, this process occurs without bias. Progress can be      accomplished if the stewards commit to the elimination of      predisposition by key decision makers.       It is not clear why the NIH elected to subcontract this      issue to the Institute of Medicine (IOM), given that the      existing NIH conference structure contains the best process      to address the appropriations language requirements.      According to the NIH Consensus Development Program, which      explains the two relevant types of conferences offered by      NIH, ``when the available evidence is weak or contradictory,      or when a common practice is not supported by high-quality      evidence, the State-of-the-Science label is chosen.'' This      conference format would appropriately address the research      gaps that exist for Lyme and tick-borne diseases as it      provides a ``snapshot in time'' of the state of knowledge on      the conference rather than a policy statement of the NIH or      the Federal Government.       In Lyme disease, there are two distinct disease paradigms,      each providing science to support its claims. One paradigm      views the disease as ``hard to catch and easy to cure'' and      denies the existence of chronic Lyme disease--persistent      infection with Borrelia burgdorferi, the spirochete that      causes the disease. Under this paradigm, the state of the      science for patients with chronic Lyme disease is closed. Any      treatment is considered too risky because practitioners are      unable to determine the cause or extent of patient symptoms,      or they view the symptoms     as insignificant and write off the patients' complaints as      psychiatric in nature. This leaves seriously ill patients      without any viable therapeutic avenues. It also shuts the      door on future research necessary to get patients to a state      of wellness.       The alternative paradigm says that the science is too      unsettled to be definitive and there can be one or more      causes of persistent symptoms after initial treatment in an      individual who has been infected with the agent of Lyme      disease. These causes include the possibility of persistent      infection, or a post-infectious process, or a combination of      both, with the Lyme bacterium itself driving the autoimmune      process. This paradigm allows doctors the ability to exercise      their clinical judgment and provide therapies that are      helping their patients.       Patients with Lyme disease need a research agenda that      reflects outcomes that matter to patients, namely effective      diagnostic tools and effective treatments that restore them      to health. The reason there are two disease paradigms in Lyme      disease is because central pieces of the puzzle are missing      or are inadequate. The first area of concern involves      testing.       There are no reliable biomarkers of the disease.\1\ Current      diagnostic tests commonly used do not detect the spirochete      that causes Lyme disease, rather, they detect only whether      the patient has developed antibodies to the pathogen.      Antibody production, if it registers on the tests at all,      takes weeks to appear, thus rendering the current tests      ineffective in the earlier and more easily addressed stage.      Additionally, the Lyme antibody has been shown to form a      ``complex'' with the bacterium itself--and tests cannot      detect ``complex'' antibodies. Once triggered, antibody      reactions may remain long after an infection has been      treated, also clouding the diagnostic and treatment picture.       The two-tier testing system endorsed by the Centers for      Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) is very specific for      Lyme disease (99%), so it gives few false positives. But the      tests have a uniformly low sensitivity (56%)--missing 88 of      every 200 patients with Lyme disease. By comparison, AIDS      tests have a sensitivity of 99.5%--missing only one of every      200 infected patients.\2\ Sensitive AIDS tests were developed      less than 10 years into the disease, while archaic Lyme tests      remain unreliable 35 years later. There is a critical need      for research exploring newer technologies such as polymerase      chain reaction (PCR), which is used with many other diseases,      and cutting-edge proteomics. Strain variations and co-     infections with other organisms, often transmitted by the      same tick bite, obscure the diagnostic picture further.       A vast number of strains of Borrelia burgdorferi have been      identified. Variation in strain may cause differing symptoms      or severity of symptoms as well as determine the appropriate      antibiotics and duration of treatment needed to clear the      infection.\3\ Different strains may also express different      proteins. Preliminary research shows that proteins need to be      examined to find the ones most often expressed, then using      microarray technology, doctors may be able to diagnose      patients using a chip which contains the proteins.       Research is needed concerning the role of mutation on      persistence. Some research indicates that bacteria can      exchange genetic material, probably contributing to its      ability to invade different systems in the body--some may      have a proclivity for the heart muscle, others for the brain,      and some for muscles and joints. By exchanging genetic      material, bacteria may be able to form a symbiotic      relationship to avoid detection by the immune response or to      further invade the body.       To date, every NIH-funded treatment research study has been      designed using the inaccurate diagnostic test results as part      of the entry criteria. The entry criterion in these studies      excluded the vast majority of Lyme patients and created      sample sizes too small (less than 220 patients to date) to      detect clinically important treatment effects or generalize      to the clinical population. Moreover, Lyme has not attracted      industry funding for treatment approaches, which places the      disease at a considerable research disadvantage. To detect      clinically relevant treatment effects requires much larger      treatment trials with sample populations that reflect those      seen in clinical practice.\4\       One thing that past research has demonstrated is that      patients with Lyme are a heterogeneous population. Hence, the      course of illness and responsiveness to treatment may vary      depending on the duration of onset of the disease to its      diagnosis and treatment, the presence of co-infections,      comorbid factors, other genetic characteristics of the      patients, and the virulence of the strain(s) with which      the patient is infected. Research sample populations must      reflect those seen in clinical practice to yield      clinically relevant results.       As advised by the Appropriations language, research on the      pathophysiology of Lyme disease is necessary. Research      projects need to be designed which determine the course of      the disease from inception, and which utilize treatments that      effectively interfere with the mechanisms that allow the      infection to persist. Little to no government sponsored      science has been dedicated to the effects on persistence of      the different forms of the Lyme bacterium (cyst vs.      flagellar), the role, if any, of biofilms, sequestration of      the organism from the immune system, the exchange and      mutation of genetic material of the spirochete, and the role      that components of the bacterial genome may play in      protecting it from eradication by the immune system or      antibiotics. Understanding the pathology of the organism can      greatly enhance targeted diagnostics and treatment      modalities.       Patients also need studies that explore a range of      treatment options. The ideal antibiotics, route of      administration, and duration of treatment for any stage of      Lyme disease are not established. No single antibiotic or      combination of antibiotics appears to be capable of      completely eradicating the infection in all patients, and      treatment failures or relapses are reported with all current      regimens, although they are less common with early aggressive      treatment.\5\ Treatment failure rates suggest the need to re-     examine the effectiveness of the currently recommended      monotherapy as a treatment approach. Studies need to explore      combination treatments and longer term treatment regimens,      which have been critical to the successful treatment of AIDS      and tuberculosis.       Patients need the type of outcomes research advocated by      the IOM to examine how well treatments are working in actual      clinical practice.\6\ While not all patients with chronic      Lyme disease have returned to a state of wellness, many have,      and we need to find out how and why. This information can      then be applied to other patients and used to establish a      research agenda for treatment that has a likelihood of      success, rather than abandoning patients based on limited      treatment trials.       The IOM process does not allow these research ideas to be      heard in an unbiased and transparent fashion with balanced      divergent viewpoints. While the NIH process precludes bias on      the part of panel members, the IOM does not. Four of the six      members of the IOM panel that have been selected belong to      IDSA, a medical society that has a known bias against chronic      Lyme disease diagnosis and treatment. Rather than providing      curative treatments that restore health, the IDSA would      provide costly and long term palliative treatments,      presumably for life. While the NIH requires participation by      major stakeholders (including patients and treating      physicians), the IOM does not.       The summary of the IOM proceedings will reflect this      pervasive lack of objectivity, undermining its integrity and      credibility. Additionally, much IOM deliberation is done      behind closed doors and an anonymous panel will be permitted      to comment on the written record. Because of such flaws in      the IOM proceedings, the three largest patient interest      groups who were offered a brief opportunity to speak (TFL) at      the IOM October 2010 meeting and an opportunity to provide a      commissioned paper--CALDA, the LDA and TFL--pulled out of the      conference in protest.       From a research perspective, strongly held paradigms can      create a closed loop, and experiments may be designed,      implemented and interpreted to support a particular      viewpoint.\7\ The antidote to bias is to balance scientific      perspectives and to ensure that all scientific viewpoints are      being heard and explored. Given the extraordinary stream of      federal funding granted to researchers who support the closed      paradigm which was created and is supported by the Infectious      Diseases Society of America (IDSA) and their vested interest      in maintaining the status quo, it is not reasonable to expect      this group of researchers to serve as neutral arbiters of      scientific debates over competing scientific paradigms. For      example, Lyme related panels dominated by IDSA have time and      time again excluded opposing viewpoints from participating or      controlled the review process to ensure outcomes that      reinforce the IDSA paradigm. If past is prologue, it is      obvious what the future holds for panels dominated by one      group.       Worse, the small treatment trials that have been conducted      have been given an undue amount of weight by IDSA researchers      and in its guidelines and used to apply a degree of certainty      on the science that far exceeds the limitations of the small      sample sizes of the studies. Further, they claim that the      state of the science is sufficient to determine with      certainty that chronic Lyme disease does not exist, is not      treatable with antibiotics, and that no further research on      this topic is needed. Sample size affects the strength of the      conclusions that may be drawn from them: ``Providing      definitive answers in the face of low event rates and small-     to-moderate treatment effects necessitates sample sizes in      the thousands or tens of thousands. . . . Funding for such      mega-trials is very limited, and is often restricted to      industry sources.'' \8\       For that reason, the Connecticut Attorney General antitrust      investigation into the development process of IDSA Lyme      guidelines found exclusionary practices and suppression of      divergent viewpoints on the part of IDSA panels that crafted      IDSA 2000 and the 2006 Lyme disease guidelines. Although IDSA      settled the investigation with the Attorney General by      agreeing to review its guidelines with a panel without      conflicts of interest, the control of the process was in the      hands of IDSA, which again selected a panel consisting almost      exclusively of IDSA members and excluding treating physicians      who held divergent viewpoints.       It was patients who pressed for the language in the      Appropriations bill that called for a review of the state of      the science of Lyme disease. However, patients need that      process to occur in a transparent manner, without bias, and      with the participation of all stakeholders. Albert Einstein      defined insanity as ``doing the same thing over and over      again and expecting different results.''     This process is a perfect example of that insanity.       Patients want research which will restore their health.      Their voice and the voice of the clinicians must be given the      necessary weight to legitimize the research agenda and the      research process. Truth in science can be achieved through      open debate in an independent process free from bias and      conflicts of interest. The scientific process fails when one      side of a debate controls the arena and sets the rules to      ensure that its viewpoint prevails.
