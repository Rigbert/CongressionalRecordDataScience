The question to me is: Will this system work? We really do not know if it will work. If we do not know it is going to work, why are we buying 10 additional interceptors at a price of about $500 million?  So this is not the same amendment, the amendment written over and over again. This is an amendment about scarce resources--will we devote them to these interceptors that are untested or will we devote them to other issues?  I point out that there is nothing in this amendment that slows up the program. There is nothing in this amendment that would take away funds. It simply says, let us get into an operational testing mode before we buy these additional systems.  Final point. This system has been plagued by delays, but they are technological delays. The reason we are not having a test--we did not have one in March, and we are having it in July--is because this kill vehicle is not ready for such testing. There is nothing about our amendment or about our procedures. This is a hard technology, but let us make sure it works.
