Carole is retiring after serving as my legislative director for more than 10 years. In total, she has 16 years of Senate service along with more than a decade in the House of Representatives. I want to take this opportunity to talk about Carole and how much I appreciate everything she has done for the Nation, the State of Oregon, and me.  When it comes to legislative directors, Carole was truly the gold standard. Her skills and ability to get things done were unsurpassed. She was a master at designing strategies to take a concept, develop it into legislation, and guide it through Congress to become law. And she pursued each of these efforts with passion and commitment until the legislation made it into the statute books.  Known by many as one of this Nation's top ranked squash players, Carole brought that same competitive passion to the Senate's competitive marketplace of ideas and legislation. Keeping the Internet free of discriminatory taxes, recognizing electronic signatures as legally valid, protecting Oregon's vote by mail, retraining service workers displaced by trade, and our ongoing effort to end secret holds are just a few examples of initiatives Carole made into her personal quests.  Carole also brought out the best in our entire legislative team, using an approach that was part den mother and part drill sergeant. She proudly described our legislative staff as the best on Capitol Hill and pushed them to meet that standard every day. But the same big, competitive heart that made Carole expect the best from herself and her staff also filled her with enormous compassion and a burning desire for justice.  Carole always viewed the entire Wyden staff, from the most senior to the newest intern, as part of one team--Team Wyden. And she successfully marshaled all our staff in efforts ranging from shutting down AdmiralPoindexter's Total Information Awareness Program, which basically would have involved holding every American upside down and shaking them to see if anything bad fell out, to crafting my fair flat tax bill to simplify and reform the Tax Code.  Carole's team-building efforts extended well beyond the office. She organized and served as captain for a Wyden Team that ran the 195-mile relay race from Mt. Hood to the Oregon coast. As Carole saw it, there is no better way to build camaraderie than to have a bunch of sweaty runners crammed into a van together for 20 hours.  For someone who is used to spending her spare time running marathons and winning national championship squash tournaments, I don't see Carole's retirement as a glidepath to the rocking chair. She has got too much energy and too much passion to sit on the sidelines for long. I know that she and her long-time partner--and fellow Senate veteran--Kate Cudlipp, will be making certain that her skills and energy are put to good use. And in whatever she chooses to do, I know she will continue to shine.  Again, I can't thank Carole enough for all she has done for me, my staff, the State of Oregon, and the Nation. She will always be my dear friend and a member of our Team Wyden family. I wish her all the best for the next chapter of her life.                          ____________________[Pages S10449-S10450]From the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]                        HONORING CAROLE GRUNBERG
