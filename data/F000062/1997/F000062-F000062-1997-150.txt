 President, during the 104th Congress, I was privileged to serve as ranking minority member of the Foreign Relations Subcommittee on Near Eastern and South Asian Affairs. In that time, while visiting and monitoring events in the South Asia region--which includes India, Pakistan, Afghanistan, Nepal, Sri Lanka, and Bangladesh--I had the honor of working with a talented and dedicated group of diplomats. I wish to pay tribute to some of them today.  The South Asia Bureau is the smallest and youngest of the State Department's regional bureaus, having been created by congressional mandate in 1992. Despite its size, it has ably represented American interests in this critical part of the world. This summer, it will undergo its first major transition, as nearly all the ranking diplomats in the bureau will rotate on to other assignments. Before they do, I wanted to take an opportunity to commend them for their service.  At the top, of course, is Assistant Secretary of State for South Asian Affairs Robin L. Raphel, the first person to ever hold the position. During the past 4 years, Assistant Secretary Raphel has deftly managed the complex web of issues that encompass South Asia--from Indo-Pakistani tensions to nonproliferation, from human rights to the environment, and from counterterrorism and narcotics to the deadly conflict in Afghanistan. She has also been a trusted and valuable interlocuter with Congress, making the administration's case fairly and straightforwardly to those on all sides of every issue under her purview.  Assistant Secretary Raphel has been assisted in her efforts by an outstanding team of ambassadors in the field: Ambassador Frank Wisner in New Delhi, Ambassador Tom Simons in Islamabad, Ambassador Peter Burleigh in Sri Lanka, Ambassador David Merrill in Dhaka, and Ambassador Vogelgesang in Kathmandu. Due to a quirk of timing, with the exception of Tom Simons, all of these ambassadors either have or are expected to vacate their posts this summer.  I want to commend each of these fine diplomats: Frank Wisner, one of the most senior and well-regarded members of the entire Foreign Service, and David Merrill, both of whom have announced their retirements from Federal service: Peter Burleigh, a native of my home State of California and a first-rate linguist, who will next be furthering United States interests as Deputy Permanent Representative at the United Nations; and Sandy Vogelgesang, for whom I have a special, personal regard.  Last November, when I traveled to Nepal to view United States assistance projects, I was highly impressed by Ambassador Vogelgesang's knowledge of Nepal and her depth of caring for its people, the high degree of respect she enjoyed throughout the country, and the way these traits enabled her to be an effective advocate and promoter of U.S. interests. She is, in short, one of the finest Ambassadors I have ever had the privilege of working with. I hope and expect that our Nation will enjoy the benefit of her service in future posts in the years to come.  Mr. President, during my tenure on the Foreign Relations Committee, I have developed a high regard for the work of our talented and dedicated Foreign Service personnel. Almost without exception, I have found the people representing our Nation in embassies overseas to be infused with seriousness, patriotism, and professionalism. Sadly, they are too often underappreciated, and occasionally even criticized. As Senators, who are called upon to approve the highly competitive selection and promotion processes, and to confirm appointments to the Foreign Service's most senior levels, it behooves us to take the time to recognize some of our most accomplished diplomats.  On behalf of my colleagues, I express appreciation and admiration for a job well done to Assistant Secretary Raphel and Ambassadors Wisner, Simons, Burleigh, Merrill, and Vogelgesang. Our country owes them thanks for their able service, and we are grateful for their significant contributions to improving and expanding our relationships with the countries of South Asia.                          ____________________
