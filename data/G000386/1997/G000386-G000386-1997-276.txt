 President, I rise today to continue my observations about major problems in the FBI's crime lab, and about the Bureau's failed leadership. This is my fourth such statement.  My colleagues are no doubt curious about the harshness of my criticisms of the Bureau's leadership. But my critique directly matches the level of the Bureau's misleading of the public.  I have not been unfair or unmeasured in my comments. I dare say, I have been softer on the FBI than others in Congress. Yet the ranks of those of us who are perturbed are growing swiftly.  I have raised these issues for two reasons: First, to use the Justice Department's and FBI's own documents to show where the Bureau is misleading the public; and second, to contribute an understanding of why it is happening.  I will briefly remind my colleagues of what I already revealed before this body. Many of the allegations of the lab's whistleblower--Dr. Frederic Whitehurst--are being substantiated. FBI documents are showing that. In previous statements, I have referenced three problem cases, examined by the Justice Department's Inspector General, that were uncovered by the press. The three cases are those of Alcee L. Hastings, George Trepal, and Walter Leroy Moody. The conduct of specific FBI agents in each of these cases is in question.  Second, the FBI tried to explain Dr. Whitehurst away by questioning his credibility, and saying no one else backs up his allegations. But now we know that is false. At least two other scientists have backed him up. One has been made public. The other is fixing to.  Third, we now know that the FBI investigated these same allegations, knew about the problems, and covered them up. They did not fix them. They covered them up. The IG, then, took an independent look and flushed out the problems. The Bureau is now doing a mad scramble to control the damage. At the heart of its damage control operation is an effort to mislead. And that effort comes right from the top of the FBI. Right from the Director himself--Louis Freeh.  But their scheme is unraveling, Mr. President. I rise today, to assist in the unraveling process. The public has a right to know what the FBI is covering up. And I am here to help them know.  The latest case of misleading by the FBI involves the public testimony of Mr. Freeh approximately 2 weeks ago. On March 5, Mr. Freeh testified before the House Appropriations Subcommittee on Commerce, Justice, State. The chairman is Representative Harold Rogers of Kentucky.  During the hearing, Mr. Freeh was asked why the FBI placed Dr. Whitehurst on administrative leave. In response, Mr. Freeh stated:       [T]he action that was taken against Mr. Whitehurst was      taken solely and directly on the basis of the recommendation      by the Inspector General and their findings with respect to      Mr. Whitehurst....  Mr. Freeh also said the IG, Mr. Michael Bromwich, was notified about the action and had not objected. Mr. Freeh concludes by saying:       The only reason that action was taken was because of what      the Inspector General wrote and recommended to the FBI.  When the IG found out what Director Freeh had stated, he fired off a letter the very next day. He demanded that Mr. Freeh correct the record in three specific areas.  First, the FBI has consistently maintained that it was not just the IG report that factored into action against Dr. Whitehurst. I know this, Mr. President, because the Deputy Director, Weldon Kennedy, told me the same thing. The other reason involves the FBI's belief that Dr. Whitehurst would not answer questions in an administrative inquiry. It seems the FBI Director is using the IG report to hide behind. In my view, he wants the public to think he was forced by the IG to take action against a whistleblower.  Second, the IG says it is inaccurate for Mr. Freeh to say the IG did not object to action against Dr. Whitehurst. In fact, the IG spent over a year objecting to such treatment of Dr. Whitehurst. I had not known this before, Mr. President. According to the IG, representatives of the FBI had an active campaign--for more than a year--to take action against the whistleblower. The IG spells this out in detail in his letter.  That sounds suspiciously like retaliation against a whistleblower. And as you know, Congress has passed statutes prohibiting retaliation against whitleblowers. But it would certainly explain why the FBI is over-reacting to the IG's report, with respect to Dr. Whitehurst. I suspect that the IG would have had nothing but praise for Dr. Whitehurst, and the Bureau's response would still be, ``See? The IG recommends that we fire Whitehurst!''  I met on January 28 with then-Deputy Director Kennedy. I asked him what it was in the IG report that he thought gave the FBI grounds to take action against Dr. Whitehurst. I am bound to maintain the confidence of what is contained in the report that Mr. Kennedy cited. But let me assure you, Mr. President. When you see the report, you will be scratching your head in bewilderment. I was.  Third, the IG says no such recommendation pertaining to Dr. Whitehurst is in his report.  These were the three specific points about which the IG took issue with Mr. Freeh. If I could offer a translation, I will bet Mr. Bromwich thought Mr. Freeh misled the subcommittee. If Mr. Bromwich indeed reached that conclusion, the facts would be on his side.  The IG's request that Mr. Freeh correct the record was responded to on March 11. In letters to both Mr. Bromwich and Mr. Rogers, Mr. Freeh appears to do what some of his agents have been accused of doing in a court room--cutting corners to get a conviction.  I ask unanimous consent that those three letters be printed in the Record.  There being no objection, the letters were ordered to be printed in the Record, as follows:                                       U.S. Department of Justice,                              Office of the Inspector General,                                    Washington, DC, March 6, 1997.     Hon. Louis J. Freeh,     Director, Federal Bureau of Investigation, U.S. Department of          Justice, Washington, DC.       Dear Director Freeh: I am writing to urge you to correct      testimony you gave during your appearance yesterday before      the House Subcommittee on Appropriations. I have reviewed the      videotape of your testimony and believe that your response to      a question regarding Dr. Whitehurst is incorrect in three      respects.       Your testimony was as follows:       Q. (By Chairman Rogers) Now why was Mr. Whitehurst      suspended?       A. What I can say in the open session, sir, is that the      action that was taken against Mr. Whitehurst was taken solely      and directly on the basis of the recommendation by the      Inspector General and their findings with respect to Mr.      Whitehurst, which they furnished us in writing. We notified      the Inspector General and the Deputy Attorney General's      office that we were going to take administrative action. They      did not object to it. The only reason that action was taken      was because of what the Inspector General wrote and      recommended to the FBI. And when that is public, I think you      will be satisfied.       First, we have consistently been informed that the FBI did      not take administrative action against Dr. Whitehurst      ``solely and directly on the basis of the recommendation by      the Inspector General and their findings with respect to Mr.      Whitehurst,'' as you testified. Rather, Deputy Counsel James      Maddock has informed us (and others) on several occasions      that the FBI's action was also taken because of Dr.      Whitehurst's refusal--after being administratively      compelled--to testify in 1996 in the matter regarding leaks      of information about the laboratory. Indeed, that dual      rationale was contained in the memo from Weldon Kennedy to      the Deputy Attorney General, a copy of which was sent to      me, on January 24, 1997, notifying her of the FBI's      intention to place Whitehurst on administrative leave that      afternoon.       Second, it was inaccurate to say that I ``did not object''      when the FBI notified my office that it intended to place Dr.      Whitehurst on administrative leave. In fact, at a meeting      held on January 21, I expressed my opposition when Mr.      Maddock informed us that the FBI intended to take such action      against Dr. Whitehurst. This was consistent with the position      that I had taken over the course of more than a year when FBI      representatives had repeatedly proposed firing Whitehurst or      placing him on some sort of administrative leave. Although it      is correct that I did not specifically respond to Mr.      Kennedy's January 24 memorandum informing the Deputy Attorney      General of the FBI's decision to place Dr. Whitehurst on      leave that same afternoon--or formally reiterate my objection      to taking any action against Dr. Whitehurst--it was because I      had already made my views known rather than because I agreed      with the FBI's proposed action.       Third, your testimony implies that we specifically      recommended that Dr. Whitehurst be placed on administrative      leave based on the draft report. The draft report in fact      contains no such recommendation, nor can it be fairly      construed to imply that such action should be taken while the      draft was being reviewed.       Because I believe the inaccuracies in your testimony should      be corrected as promptly as possible, I urge you to write to      Chairman Rogers and Congressman Mollohan to correct the      record. Should sharing this letter with the Appropriations      Subcommittee assist in correcting the record, please feel      free to include it with your correction.           Very truly yours,                                              Michael R. Bromwich,     Inspector General.                                                                    ____                                        U.S. Department of Justice                              Federal Bureau of Investigation,                                   Washington, DC, March 11, 1997.     Mr. Michael R. Bromwich,     Inspector General, U.S. Department of Justice, Washington,          DC.       Dear Mr. Bromwich: In your letter of March 6, 1997, you      state that it is your understanding that the FBI did not      place Frederic Whitehurst on administrative leave solely on      the basis of the recommendations set forth in your draft      report. Your understanding is correct and I am writing to      clarify my prior statement in that regard.       In a memorandum to Deputy Director Kennedy dated January      23, 1997, I recused myself from any Whitehurst-related      disciplinary or administrative matters contained in the OIG      report regarding the FBI Laboratory. Instead, I designated      the Deputy Director to make or review all such decisions. It      is my understanding that Deputy Director Kennedy based the      decision to place Mr. Whitehurst on administrative leave on      the following two grounds: (1) the FBI's receipt of notice in      your draft findings that you intend to recommend that the FBI      consider whether Mr. Whitehurst can continue to usefully      serve the FBI in any capacity; and, (2) Mr. Whitehurst's      refusal to answer questions, in direct contravention of an      order to cooperate by an FBI Acting Assistant Director, with      regard to an investigation into allegations that Mr.      Whitehurst, without authorization, disclosed official      information to the media.       We maintain that either of these grounds, standing alone,      suffices to justify the temporary personnel action with      respect to Mr. Whitehurst. However, as you know, the      Department of Justice advised against taking any action      concerning Mr. Whitehurst's refusal to cooperate with the      leak investigation until you issued your draft report on the      Laboratory investigation. Therefore, upon review of your      draft findings with respect to Mr. Whitehurst, we notified      your office that the FBI would be placing Mr. Whitehurst on      administrative leave. As we advised Mr. Whitehurst in a      letter dated January 24, 1997, this action did not constitute      an adverse action, did not indicate inappropriate conduct on      his part, and did not involve any loss of  pay. However,      because your draft findings put the FBI on notice of      potentially serious problems with respect to Mr.      Whitehurst and other Laboratory employees, the FBI would      have been remiss had it failed to take temporary actions      with respect to these individuals.       We received your draft report on the FBI Laboratory on      January 21, 1997. On January 24, 1997, after reviewing your      findings and recommendations, the FBI temporarily reassigned      two Laboratory employees to positions outside the Laboratory,      temporarily reassigned one employee within the Laboratory,      and placed one employee, Mr. Whitehurst, on administrative      leave with pay. You indicate in your letter that, at a      meeting on January 21, 1997, you expressed opposition to the      decision to place Mr. Whitehurst on administrative leave. I      understand this topic was only briefly addressed and that the      discussion moved on to other topics, which may account for      why both Mr. Maddock and Mr. Collingwood do not recall your      comments on this issue. Furthermore, as you concede in your      letter, you did not respond to the Deputy Director's      memorandum dated January 24, 1997, in which he informed the      Deputy Attorney General that Mr. Whitehurst would be placed      on administrative leave that afternoon.       Finally, you are correct that the draft report does not      specifically recommend that Mr. Whitehurst be placed on      administrative leave. I did not intend to imply that to the      Subcommittee. However, it is significant that, after a 17-     month investigation of the Laboratory, Mr. Whitehurst is the      only FBI employee whose suitability for continued employment      you question. Your findings also make clear that the majority      of Mr. Whitehurst's allegations are unfounded and that he is      often unable to distinguish fact from conjecture. I believe      that the Subcommittee would have considered your draft      findings with regard to Mr. Whitehurst helpful in balancing      your testimony before them on February 26, 1997, that ``[w]e      have found substantial problems based on the allegations that      Dr. Whitehurst made to us.''       In order to clarify the entire record, I recommend that we      provide the Subcommittee Chairman and Ranking Minority Member      with your draft findings concerning Mr. Whitehurst in      executive session and request that the findings be treated      confidentially. I believe a fair reading of these findings      supports Deputy Director Kennedy's decision to place Mr.      Whitehurst on administrative leave with pay pending the      finalization of your report on the FBI Laboratory and our      review of that report to the extent it concerns Mr.      Whitehurst's employment.       I appreciate your having provided me with an opportunity to      address your concerns.           Sincerely,                                                   Louis J. Freeh,     Director.                                                                    ____                                       U.S. Department of Justice,                              Federal Bureau of Investigation,                                   Washington, DC, March 11, 1997.     Hon. Harold Rogers,     U.S. House of Representatives, Chairman, Subcommittee on          Commerce, Justice, State, and Judiciary of the Committee          on Appropriations, Washington, DC.       Dear Mr. Chairman: Enclosed please find a letter to me from      Michael R. Bromwich, Inspector General, Department of      Justice, dated March 6, 1997, as well as my response to that      letter.       As indicated by Mr. Bromwich, my testimony before the      Subcommittee on March 5, 1997 was incomplete with regard to      the decision to place Frederic Whitehurst on administrative      leave. Although I recused myself from any Whitehurst-related      disciplinary or administrative matters, I understand from      former Deputy Director Kennedy that he based the decision to      place Mr. Whitehurst on administrative leave on two grounds:      (1) the FBI's receipt of notice in Mr. Bromwich's draft      findings that he intends to recommend that the FBI consider      whether Mr. Whitehurst can continue to usefully serve the FBI      in any capacity; and, (2) Mr. Whitehurst's refusal to answer      questions, in direct contravention of an order to cooperate      by an FBI Acting Assistant Director, with regard to an      investigation into allegations that Mr. Whitehurst, without      authorization, disclosed official information to the media.      In response to Subcommittee questioning, I failed to include      the second basis for Deputy Director Kennedy's decision. I      have submitted an amendment to the record in this regard.       In light of the Subcommittee's concerns regarding the      decision to place Mr. Whitehurst on administrative leave, I      believe that Mr. Bromwich's draft findings with respect to      Mr. Whitehurst should be provided to you in full. As you can      see from the enclosed correspondence, I have urged Mr.      Bromwich to share his draft findings with you in executive      session in order to clarify the record and explain one of the      underlying bases for the FBI's temporary action with regard      to Mr. Whitehurst. Mr. Bromwich objects to providing you with      these draft findings and has directed that I not quote from      them in testimony or correspondence with the Subcommittees.       I appreciate the opportunity to clarify my prior testimony      and look forward to providing you and the Subcommittee      members a thorough briefing following the release of Mr.      Bromwich's final report on the FBI Laboratory.           Sincerely,                                                   Louis J. Freeh,                                                         Director.
