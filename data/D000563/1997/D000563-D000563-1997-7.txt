I thank my colleague for his statement on the future of Social Security. He is recognized in this Chamber as one who has studiously addressed himself to this and many other challenges.  I hope that next year my colleague will lead a bipartisan effort to take a serious look at the future of Social Security and Medicare, and so many entitlement programs that we worry about, in terms of long-term solvency. I thank my colleague for his remarks. Though I may not agree with every particular, I certainly do respect the fact that he continues to stick with this issue through thick and thin, as he should. The Senate should address it, and, hopefully, we can do it together in a bipartisan fashion.
