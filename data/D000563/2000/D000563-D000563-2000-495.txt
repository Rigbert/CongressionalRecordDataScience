President, the hour is late and I have a special sensitivity to the fact that many of the staff people have been here for a long time, and I know we will return to this amendment and debate first thing in the morning. I will make my remarks mercifully brief and just alert the Members of the Senate and those who follow this debate of the nature of the amendment I am offering.  I think this amendment goes to the heart of politics, the best part of politics. It goes to a clash of ideas, a difference of opinion, a true choice for the Members of the Senate and for the people of the United States because the amendment I offer has become the cornerstone of the Presidential debate for the year 2000.  The two candidates who are the likely nominees of their party, George W. Bush and Vice President Al Gore, have one marked difference. Governor Bush has proposed a substantial--some would say massive and risky--tax cut. Vice President Gore believes that, as do many of the Members of the Senate and the House, with this surplus we anticipate in the coming years, our first priority should be the reduction of the national debt so that our children don't bear that burden, and that we don't have to generate in taxes every day of every year the interest payments on old debt.  Furthermore, Vice President Gore and many of us believe that we should take our surplus and dedicate it to preserving Social Security, making certain that Medicare will be there for many years to come. He believes, as many of us do, that we should have targeted tax cuts well within our means, consistent with our goal of reducing the national debt, and that we should then have specific spending priorities for education and health care.  On the other side of the coin, there is quite a different proposal. Governor Bush has suggested perhaps the largest tax cut that has been proposed in recent memory. Every politician applauds a tax cut, and most of us like to offer one. But certainly we don't want to do something that is unrealistic. I suggest to my colleagues that the Bush tax cut being offered in the Presidential campaign is not only unrealistic; it is risky. And if we are not careful, if we follow his campaign pledge and his advice, we could jeopardize the economic growth that we have seen over the past 7 years.  Twice in the Senate Budget Committee, I allowed my colleagues--both Republicans and Democrats--to go on record in reference to the Bush tax cut. I thought it was only fair that the Republican members of the Senate Budget Committee would have that opportunity to stand by their Presidential candidate and the cornerstone of his campaign, the Bush tax cut because, you see, the Senate budget resolution we are considering today, proposed by Senate Republican leaders, doesn't include Governor Bush's tax cut.  I think this is a terrible oversight and omission that the standard bearer of the Republican Party would come forward with a vision of America that includes a tax cut, and for some reason the Senate Republicans don't want to include it in their proposal for the course of action in America for the next 5 or 10 years.  So twice in the Senate Budget Committee I offered the Bush tax cut for an up-or-down vote, take it or leave it, stand by your man, the Republicans with the Democrats, make it clear you disagree.  I was disappointed to find that my Republican colleagues in the Senate Budget Committee did not want to go on record when it came to the tax cut proposed by the standard bearer of the Republican Party, the possible Presidential nominee, Governor George W. Bush. I think there is good reason for that. I will explain it in a minute.  But I said in the committee that if the Senate Republicans in the Budget Committee didn't want to vote for Bush's tax cut in the committee, I would feel duty bound to offer that same opportunity to all of the Members of the Senate here on the floor. After all, as we debate important policy questions such as funding and education and whether we are going to drill in ANWR, these are policy questions on which we go on record. We establish our positions by our votes.  I am hoping by offering this amendment that the Senate will go on record. The Republican Members have their chance with this amendment to stand up for the tax cut proposed by their Presidential candidate. I think they should vote no. Above all, I hope they don't continue to duck this vote. They cannot duck this vote any more than Governor Bush can duck the responsibility to explain his tax cut and what it means to America.  Take a look at where we have been in this Nation over the past 7 years and the progress we have made. Record budget deficits have been erased. We have had the largest paydown of debt in the history of the United States with $297 billion in debt reduction. We are on the right track. We have seen the smallest Government in over three decades while we have increased key investments in education and in training for the people of this country. The typical family has seen their tax burden lowered to a level where you would have to reach back to the 1970s to find a comparison. Investment has boomed.  Take a look at the investment that is mirrored by our stock exchanges and our investments across America and you will see that people have been putting money into companies for growth. It has paid off. Unemployment is the lowest in decades, the welfare rolls the lowest in decades, inflation under control, housing starts at record levels, and business creation at record levels.  Frankly, everything you like to see that is positive in our economy has been moving forward under the Clinton-Gore administration. Of course,they can't take complete credit for that, but they can take some credit for it. They would certainly be blamed if we were back in the recessions of previous Presidents.  We have to say as well that some credit should go to the Federal Reserve because they have tried to quell the flames and forces of inflation, and they have been very effective in doing so. The Chairman of the Federal Reserve, Alan Greenspan, deserves credit for his leadership. I was happy recently to vote to reconfirm him for another term as Chairman of that important body.  But, on balance, most Americans believe we are headed in the right direction.  One American who apparently does not believe that is the Republican candidate for President because George W. Bush has proposed a dramatic change and a drastic shift in America's economic policy. He said we should take the surplus we see coming because of a strong economy and dedicate it to a massive and risky tax cut primarily for the wealthiest people in America.  If you take a close look at what this means, this chart shows our economy moving forward as a great ocean liner and a $168 billion proposed tax cut from the Presidential candidate, George W. Bush, that masks an iceberg of a tax cut that is so large, it would exceed the available surplus and force us to move into the Social Security trust fund to pay for it.  Our fear, and the fear of Chairman Greenspan and many others, is that such a tax cut at this moment in history would fire up an economy, create inflation, force increases in interest rates, and, frankly, doom the economic expansion we have seen for over 108 months, a record in the history of the United States.  Take a look at what the Bush tax cut would cost over a 5-year period of time based on research by the Center on Budget and Policy Priorities. It would be a $483 billion tax cut, and over 10 years it would be a $1.3 trillion tax cut.  What would be the impact of a $1.3 trillion tax cut on the Social Security surplus? As you can see, the non-Social Security surplus is $171 billion. That is what we can consider using for such things as debt reduction, targeted tax cuts, and expenditures on education. But George W. Bush would take $483 billion out for his tax cut. You may note that is far in excess of the amount that is available outside of the non-Social Security surplus.  The obvious conclusion is, to pay for the George W. Bush tax cut, you would have to raid Social Security. I find we have decided on a bipartisan basis that won't happen, that we will protect the Social Security trust fund.  That is why I believe the Republican Members of the Senate, if they share that belief, as I do, that Social Security should be protected, should vote against the George W. Bush tax cut. My amendment gives them a chance to go on record against this tax cut to make it clear that they want to protect Social Security and avoid a raid on the Social Security trust fund to make up the $312 billion difference in the first 5 years we would see if we followed George W. Bush's plan.  The obvious question is whether this Bush tax cut is fair and whether it would help American families. As I said earlier, all of us would like to see tax cuts. We would certainly like to go back to families in Illinois and across America and say to them, We can give you a break to help pay for your bills. Most of them would welcome it. But if you take a close look at the proposal from George W. Bush for his tax cut, you will see that most working families and middle-income families in America won't even notice a change.  If you notice, the bottom 60 percent of wage earners in America, those making below $39,300 a year, will see an average tax cut of about $249 a year, a little over $20 a month. That comes down to 75 cents a day they might see by way of George W. Bush's tax cut--60 percent of American families. But in the top 1 percent, the people who are making over $300,000 a year already, the George W. Bush tax cut is worth over $50,000 a year. Not only does this tax cut raid Social Security but the beneficiaries of it turn out to be wealthiest people in this country. Frankly, that isn't fair.  If we are going to jeopardize our economic growth, if we are going to in some way avoid the debt reduction, which most economists agree is important for the growth of America, you would think a tax cut on the table would at least benefit most American families. Honestly, it doesn't or, if it does, it is so small, they wouldn't notice it. Twenty dollars a month? That is what 60 percent of the working families of America would see. As I mentioned earlier, it would be at great expense and peril to the Social Security trust fund and others.  As I offer this amendment, I am hoping we can have a bipartisan consensus to tell Governor George Bush to go back to the drawing board, to come forward with a proposal, if you will, that is consistent with continuing the economic growth in this country and that in fact identifies as the highest priority the reduction of our national debt and doesn't jeopardize Social Security. Frankly, his tax cut does. That is why I think this Senate should go on record in opposition to it on a bipartisan basis.  There is a lot of criticism of current political campaigns across America: They are too long; they are too nasty; they are too negative. And virtually all of those criticisms are true. But if our political campaigns in this democracy are of any value, they are because we have a true clash of ideas, a difference of opinions, and a real choice for voters.  When it comes to the George W. Bush tax cut, there couldn't be a clearer choice.  I hope my colleagues in the Senate will accept their responsibility, step up, and say whether they endorse the proposal of the Presidential candidate on the Republican side for this tax cut or whether they believe, as Chairman Greenspan does, Vice President Gore, and most American people do, that it is an unwise course of action.  I understand, as most people do, that there are a lot of differences of opinion in the course of a campaign. But Governor Bush has been very specific in spelling out his tax cut. In order to achieve his tax cut, you not only have to raid Social Security, but when you go in the outyears beyond 5 years, to achieve it you have to cut dramatically in spending on very important programs for America.  If that is something which the Republican side of the aisle wants to embrace, so be it. I, frankly, think it is shortsighted to take over $3.7 million low-income women and children off the WIC Program, a nutrition program for children and pregnant women so their babies are born healthy and get off to a good start.  If you follow through on the George W. Bush tax plan, you see massive spending cuts in key programs such as WIC. There is a $4.8 billion cutback in the Pell Grant Program, meaning 784,000 college students who receive grants--not loans, because they are low income--would see those disappear.  Mr. President, 400,000 kids, $2.9 billion cuts in Head Start--does it make sense to offer a tax cut of $50,000 a year to some of the wealthiest people in America and at the same time cut back and eliminate 400,000 kids from the Head Start Program?  The community development block grant programs and so many other job training assistance and support programs would be decimated by the proposal of the Presidential candidate on the Republican side, Governor Bush.  I believe if we are to stand on the record for this Bush tax cut plan, we have to answer to the voters in Illinois and across the Nation why we are prepared to threaten the future of Social Security and Medicare; why would we make deep cuts in Medicare spending; why would we fail to invest in debt reduction and help these important programs to provide the largest tax cuts in history to the richest people in our Nation.  Eliminating the estate tax primarily benefits millionaires. I asked a group who came to my office recently who said they wanted to see the estate tax eliminated: What percentage of estates in America pay the tax? They didn't know. The answer is 1.3 percent. It is a very small percentage. It comes down to the fact that if we are going to eliminate those taxes on the richest people in America, we should only do it if we can justify it. I don't believe Governor Bush can justify it in terms of the benefits that it would mean for the rest of the people who live in this country.  I hope we will not jeopardize our economic prosperity. I hope we will followthe model that has been suggested by Vice President Gore. I sincerely hope my colleagues in the Senate will not duck this opportunity to vote on the George W. Bush tax cut plan. If they are proud of their candidate, if they believe in his platform, if they share his vision, for goodness sake, have the courage to stand up and vote yes; if you disagree with his position, at least have the courage to go on the record and say so.  I hope, as in the Budget Committee, we don't run into the same experience on the floor where the Republican majority refuses to go on the record when it comes to the cornerstone of the campaign of the Republican Presidential candidate George W. Bush.  I yield the floor.                          ____________________
