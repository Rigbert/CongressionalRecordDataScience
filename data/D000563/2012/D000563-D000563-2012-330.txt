President, I thank the majority leader and especially Senators Boxer and Inhofe, as well as their counterparts on the Commerce Committee and the Banking Committee, who have put so much time into this bill, so much effort. We are trying now to get this important and complex bill right and then to secure the support of both sides of the aisle to move it forward. A lot of work has been going into it. Everybody is working hard to try to accomplish what the majority leader has spelled out. I am sure he will tell us if there are any developments.                          Political Prisoners
