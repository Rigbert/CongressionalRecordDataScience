President, I, too, commend the Senator from Arizona for bringing this measure to the Senate floor. As Senator Stevens has pointed out, it is directly relevant to port security because many of the containers that come into our ports by ship are then deployed throughout the country by rail. So I would argue this is directly relevant to the goal of the legislation before us.  This is a Commerce Committee matter that Senator McCain has broughtup, but I did just want to let my colleagues know that it is very relevant to our goal of securing our ports. I strongly support the amendment and commend the Senator for his initiative.
