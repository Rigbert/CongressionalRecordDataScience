Speaker, I thank the gentleman for his observations. And I want to say that, although I would have agreed with the position of the gentleman from Minnesota (Mr. Sabo) that it ought not to be shifted, I believe the gentleman is correct that he has tried to build in protections so that this program is not undermined. I appreciate those actions which I think certainly make this switch a more positive one than it otherwise would have been, and I thank the gentleman.
