 President, I am writing to recognize a longtime member of my staff, who will shortly retire from public service, after honorably serving me and the people of Iowa for over 35 years.  Fred Schuster joined my staff in 1984 as my regional director in Des Moines, IA. He had been president of the Iowa State University student body and a member of ISU's Cardinal Key Honor Society. He had also been president of the College Republicans of Iowa.  In 1987, I asked Fred to move to Waterloo and become the regional director. During this time, Fred was elected president of the largest Kiwanis club in North East Iowa and served as its lieutenant governor, covering seven other clubs. He was appointed to the Cedar Falls Library Board and was elected an officer each year he served. He was also selected to be on the North East Iowa regional library board. In 1999, there was a devastating flood in northeast Iowa, the recovery from which resulted in a significant shortage of drywall in the region. Fred worked to get suppliers to provide extra drywall to the Waterloo area stores. One of the companies instead provided two semi loads for free, which was distributed by the Area Agency on Aging to those in greatest need.  In 2002, President George W. Bush appointed Fred to be the Region 7 Director for the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services covering the States of Iowa, Kansas, Missouri, andKansas. At its peak, there were over 600 employees at HHS in that region. Fred traveled extensively, visiting with the Governors and State and Federal officials and testified before congressional committees. Fred was ranked overall the best regional director in each of the last 3 years he served.  Following Fred's service in the Bush administration, he returned to work as my State business and economic liaison. Part of his responsibilities was to raise funds and plan an ambassadors tour I had been hosting every other year at that time to foster and facilitate greater awareness of Iowa's workforce and exports with those assigned to the U.S. Embassy in Washington from nationals around the world. Iowa's an exporting State with outstanding manufacturing and leading in agriculture commodities. Even though 2009 was a challenging economic time, Fred raised more than enough to cover the cost of the ambassadors' airfare to and from Washington, DC, renting three commercial tour buses, and organized lodging for the diplomats, security detail, and staff. He organized the cultural, educational, manufacturing, and agricultural sites for the ambassadors to visit.  In January 2011, I asked Fred to become the regional director in my Cedar Rapids office, the role he presently holds. Fred again took an active role in the recovery from the flood of 2016, visiting the numerous communities and businesses damaged by the floodwaters.  Fred Schuster will retire from my office after more than 35 years of service to me and my office, the U.S. Senate, and the people of Iowa, effective September 11, 2018. His honest, thoughtful, helpful, and insightful wisdom and advice have been valuable to me and to everyone with whom he connected. His absence will be a loss to my office, but I am glad that he will have more time to spend with his daughters, granddaughter, and friends, as well as to visit the remaining of the 50 State capitols and Presidential historical sites. I greatly value Fred's friendship and his commitment to public service, and I wish him well.                          ____________________
