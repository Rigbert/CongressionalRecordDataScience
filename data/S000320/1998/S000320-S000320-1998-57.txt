 President, something was said just a minute ago about the threat of a veto by the President. I have heard this a lot on different bills. But I know the process should work. Especially when you have a principle that you believe in and that you know is right, you should not step aside because someone intimates that they might veto it. That is part of the legislative process.  Mr. President, having said that, later in the debate--probably Monday when we get back--I will be offering an amendment to the bill dealing with the Community Reinvestment Act, or CRA. My proposed amendment would authorize a small bank exemption from the Government-mandated credit requirements of the Community Reinvestment Act, which Senator Gramm from Texas so eloquently talked about earlier this morning. Community banks, as you well know, as a Senator and present Presiding Officer, by theirvery nature, serve the needs of their community.  They do not need a burdensome, government mandate to force them to allocate credit or originate profitable loans. Make no mistake about it. Community banks would not exist very long if they didn't take care of the whole community; and they do.  Since H.R. 1151 increases the competitive advantage credit unions have over banks, we feel this amendment is necessary to reduce the inequities in this area and allow our small community banks to better meet the needs of consumers.  Nine members of the Banking Committee sponsored a small bank exemption amendment to H.R. 1151 in the committee markup. The amendment resulted in a tie vote of nine to nine. The nine members of the committee that supported the amendment felt so strongly about the small bank exemption, that all nine members signed a statement of additional views to the committee report, which is unusual.  Let me say from the start, CRA is a tax on community banks, CRA raises the costs of inputs to banks by increasing their regulatory burden and compliance costs. In addition, CRA forces banks to make loans according to a federal quota, increasing the risks, and therefore the costs, of borrowing to consumers. Make no mistake about it, the Community Reinvestment Act raises the cost of borrowing through higher loan rates and punishes savers in the form of lower savings rates. Congress I believe should adopt policies that lowers the cost of borrowing, and my amendment would do that.  I would also point out that the federal government does not know the demand for loans any better than the local banker. CRA preempts the free market lending criteria of community banks and imposes the judgment of federal bureaucrats. CRA is government mandated credit allocation, the form of credit allocation that has proven disastrous most recently in east Asia. We have an opportunity to reduce the scope of government mandated credit allocation with this amendment, and I urge my colleagues to do so.  I want to revisit, and give a little history contextually.                                history  When the Community Reinvestment Act was introduced in 1977, the bill's chief sponsor and chairman of the Banking Committee, William Proxmire stated:       The authority to operate new deposit facilities is given      away, free, to successful applicants even though the      authority conveys a substantial economic benefit to the      applicant. Those who obtain new deposit facilities receive a      semi-exclusive franchise to do business in a particular      geographic area. The Government limits the entry of other      potential competitors into that area if such entry would      unduly jeopardize existing financial institutions. The      Government also restricts competition and the cost of money      to the bank by limiting the rate of interest payable on      savings deposits and prohibiting any interest on demand      deposits.  Senator Proxmire later said:       The regulators have thus conferred substantial economic      benefits on private institutions without extracting any      meaningful quid pro quo for the public.                                 review  The central premise on which Senator Proxmire bases his justification for ``extracting any meaningful quid pro quo'' may have existed in 1977, but absolutely does not exist today. Taken one at a time, each and every claim Senator Proxmire used to justify CRA in 1977 is no longer applicable today. Let us go through them one at a time:  Chartered institutions ``receive a semi-exclusive franchise to do business in a particular geographic area.''  Congress passed the Reigle-Neal Interstate Banking and Branching Efficiency Act of 1994, which allowed one bank to acquire another bank in any other state, thus subjecting small community banks to the competition of acquisition hungry megabanks.  Senator Proxmire also said:  ``Government limits the entry of other potential competitors.''  That was in 1977.  Clearly this is not the case. The underlying bill, H.R. 1151 does not limit, but dramatically increases the entry of potential competitors.  The bill essentially says that credit unions can serve every group in a community--making them the same as community banks.  Senator Proxmire said in 1977 regarding CRA justification:  ``Government also restricts competition and the cost of money to the bank by limiting the rate of interest payable on savings deposits and prohibiting any interest on demand deposits.''  This is no longer true.  The Depository Institutions Deregulation and Monetary Control Act of 1980 phased out the interest rate ceilings on savings deposits and introduced Negotiable Orders of Withdrawals (NOW Accounts) that allowed the payment of interest on demand deposits to consumers.                   Proxmire Premise no longer exists  Twenty-one years later, the ``substantial economic benefit'' to which Senator Proxmire refers no longer exists. Since the benefit no longer exists, neither should the Government mandate of credit allocation. Congress should lift this mandate off small community banks.                           Regulatory Burden  According to a recent Federal Reserve study, entitled, ``The Cost of Banking Regulation: A Review of the Evidence,'' regulatory costs account for up to ``13 percent of noninterest expenses'' of banks. That is a lot of money. In addition, the study concluded that ``(A)verage compliance costs for regulations are substantially greater for banks at low levels of output''--in other words, smaller banks--``than for banks at moderate or high levels of output''--or larger banks.  This regulatory burden is borne out in the efficiency rate of banks. As you can see by the chart, small banks are less efficient than large banks.  Banks with less than $250 million in assets have an efficiency ratio of 63 percent versus that of large banks over $250 million with an efficiency ratio of 60.5 percent. These inefficiencies translate into a lower return on equity for small banks. Large banks have a return on equity of 14.4 percent versus 11.3 percent for small banks. This means the average large bank has a return on equity 27 percent greater than small banks.                        Exemption of Bank Assets  Contrary to what opponents of the amendment would have you believe, the small bank exemption would not ``gut'' CRA.  Banks with less than $250 million in assets account for less than 12 percent of bank assets nationwide. Thus, 88 percent of bank assets are concentrated in banks with over $250 million in assets and would still be subject to CRA, assuming that the Shelby amendment is adopted.  I have a chart that will help put that into perspective for my colleagues. Although there are 8,110 small banks below $250 million in assets, those banks account for only $593 billion in combined assets. That means small banks account for 11.7 percent of bank assets nationwide.  However, one bank--BankAmerica, the new bank resulting from the merger of NationsBank and BankAmerica--possesses assets of $570 billion or 11.3 percent of total bank assets. Thus, one financial giant holds assets nearly as big as that of all 8,110 small banks across America. That begs the question, why do we have to burden 8,110 small community banks that only account for such a small portion of CRA monies? The vast majority of bank assets are concentrated in the large, billion dollar megabanks that can more easily shoulder the burden.                     small banks serve communities  Small community banks have an excellent record of serving their communities. Since over half of all banks and thrifts below $250 million have only one or two branches, they really have no other place to go but to their community to do business. Of the 8,970 small banks and thrifts, only nine--.1 percent--received a ``substantial noncompliance'' CRA rating in 1997. In addition, small banks have a better record with regard to the most common type of community-based lending--real estate lending.  Banks under $250 million had a real estate lending to assets ratio of 37 percent in 1997 versus 23.9 percent for large banks over $250 million.                           fair lending laws  The small bank exemption from CRA is not about discrimination. The following fair lending laws will still apply, including: The Fair Housing Act of 1968 which prohibits discrimination on the basis of race, color, religion, sex, national origin, familial statusand handicap in all aspects of the housing industry; the Equal Credit Opportunity Act of 1974 which prohibits creditors from discrimination based on race, color, religion, national origin, sex, marital status, age, or receipt of public assistance; and the Home Mortgage Disclosure Act of 1975 which requires banks to keep current records of its mortgage lending activity.  Any assertion that small banks do not serve their communities rings hollow. Small banks must serve their communities if they want to survive. Any claim of discrimination also rings hollow given the fair lending laws that apply to all lenders.                               conclusion  In conclusion, Mr. President, the Community Reinvestment Act was introduced in 1977 by Senator Proxmire under the premise that banks receive a ``substantial economic benefit.'' That benefit does not apply today as we enter the 21st century.  The small bank exemption from CRA would go a long way in helping reduce the costs and risks of mandated credit allocation. CRA is not only a bad law for banks, but it is also a bad law for consumers. CRA forces banks to underwrite risky loans because they find that preferable to being terrorized and vandalized by so-called community groups that extort money from banks. As a result, consumers around this country are being forced to subsidize this terrorist activity in the form of higher loan rates, lower savings rates and a lower return on equity.  Mr. President, I ask my colleagues to support this very important amendment on behalf of the small community banks around America but, more importantly, every bank customer who walks in to get a loan and is forced to subsidize this government mandated credit allocation.  I yield the floor.
