President, I often hear from members of the public who feel that the United States is spending too much on ``foreign aid.'' Why are we sending so much money abroad, they ask, when we have so many problems here at home?  This concerns me a great deal, because it has been shown over and over again that most Americans mistakenly believe that 15 percent of our national budget goes to foreign aid. In fact it is about 1 percent. The other 99 percent goes for our national defense and to fund other domestic programs--to build roads, support farmers, protect the environment, build schools and hospitals, pay for law enforcement, and countless other things the governments does.  The United States has by far the largest economy in the world. We are unquestionably the wealthiest country. The amount we spend on foreign aid totals only a few dollars per American per year.  What does the rest of the world look like?  Imagine, for a moment, if the world's population were shrunk to a population of 100 people, with the current ratios staying the same. Of those 100 people, 57 would be Asians. There would be 21 Europeans. Fourteen would be from North and South America. Eight would be Africans.  Of those 100 people, 52 would be women, and 48 would be men. Seventy would be non-White, and 30 would be White. Seventy would be non-Christian, and 30 would be Christian.  Six people would possess 59 percent of the world's wealth, and all 6 would be Americans. Think about that.  Fifty people--one half of the population, would suffer from malnutrition. 80 out of 100 would live in substandard housing, often without safe water to drink.  Seventy would be illiterate. Only 1 would have a college education. And only 1 would own a computer.  Are we spending too much on foreign aid? These statistics put things in perspective. I would suggest that there are two reasons to conclude that not only are we not spending too much, we are not spending enough.  First, we are a wealthy country--far wealthier than any other. Yes we have problems. Serious problems. But they pale in comparison to the deprivation endured by over a billion of the world's people who live in extreme poverty, with incomes of less than $1 per day. Like other industrialized countries, we have a moral responsibility to help.  Second, it is often said, but worth repeating, that our economy and our security are closely linked to the global economy and to the security of other countries. Although we call it foreign aid, it isn't just about helping others. These programs help us.  By raising incomes in poor countries we create new markets for American exports, the fastest growing sector of our economy.  Raising incomes abroad also reduces pressure on people to flee their own countries in search of a better life. One example that is close to home is Mexico, where half the population survives on an income of $2 per day. Every day, thousands of people cross illegally from Mexico into the United States, putting enormous strains on U.S. law enforcement.  Foreign aid programs support our democratic allies. There are few examples in history of a democracy waging war against another democracy.  These programs protect the environment and public health, by stopping air and water pollution, and combating the spread of infectious diseases that are only an airplane flight away from our shores.  They help deter the proliferation of weapons, including nuclear, biological and chemical weapons.  These are but a few examples of how ``foreign aid'' creates jobs here at home, and protects American interests abroad.  The American people need to know what we do with our foreign aid, and why in an increasingly interdependent world the only superpower should be doing more to protect our interests around the world, not less.                          ____________________
