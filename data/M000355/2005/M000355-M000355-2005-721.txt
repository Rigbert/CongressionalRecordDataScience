 President, I move to reconsider the vote and I move to lay that motion on the table.  The motion to lay on the table was agreed to.                    Amendment No. 1273, as Modified  Mr. McCONNELL. Mr. President, I have a modification to an amendment already filed, No. 1273. I send the modification to the desk.  The assistant legislative clerk read as follows:       The Senator from Kentucky (Mr. McConnell), for Mr.      Grassley, proposes an amendment numbered 1273, as modified:  The amendment is as follows:       On page 326 between lines 10 and 11 insert the following:                           EXPORT-IMPORT BANK       Sec. 6113. None of the funds made available in this Act may      be used by the Export-Import Bank of the United States to      approve or administer a loan, guarantee, or insurance policy,      or an application for a loan, guarantee, or insurance policy,      for the development, or for the increase in capacity, of an      ethanol dehydration plant in Trinidad and Tobago.  Mr. McCONNELL. Mr. President, Senator Leahy and I are aware of only a few amendments to this bill which must be disposed of prior to final passage.  Let me reiterate for all of our colleagues who are interested in amending this bill, we are not interested in encouraging that sort of thing, but if we are going to do it, since both the majority leader and Democratic leader have indicated we are going to finish this bill today, I think it would be considerate of all the Members of the Senate, and helpful, if we were to dispose of these amendments while the Sun is still up rather than this evening, because Members typically have many responsibilities in the evening. We would all like to finish up in the late afternoon.  If you have an amendment that you simply must offer, come over and discuss it with us. Hopefully we can take it. If not, we will look for a short time agreement, a vote, and move toward final passage this afternoon.  I suggest the absence of a quorum.
