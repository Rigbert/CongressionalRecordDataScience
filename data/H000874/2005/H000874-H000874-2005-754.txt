DeLay), the majority leader.  Mr. DeLAY. Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentleman for yielding to me.  Mr. Speaker, the House will convene on Tuesday at 2 p.m. for legislative business. We will consider several measures under suspension of the rules. A final list of these bills will be sent to Members' offices by the end of the week. Any votes called on these measures will be rolled until 6:30 p.m.  On Wednesday and Thursday, the House will convene at 10 a.m. We will likely consider additional legislation under suspension of the rules, as well as the Transportation Equity Act: A Legacy for Users.  And, finally, I would like to note for all the Members that we are making a change to the schedule that was sent to offices at the beginning of the year. We do not plan to have votes next Friday, March 11.
