 President, I thank my distinguished colleague from Washington for an absolutely brilliant discourse on the impact of this bill on the political process. As usual, he is right on the mark, and I thank him for his important contribution to this debate.  My friend and colleague from New Hampshire has been on the floor for some time. Mr. President, how much time do I have remaining?
