 For example, the accounts that deal with cleaning up the cold war legacy, that means that communities across our country that sacrificed in the name of the country would have to wait even longer for a resolution to the contamination that exists.  It is astounding how much there is from coast-to-coast. When you start looking, you almost want to close the book because there is so much, and I think that the communities that have been dealing with these remediation problems over the years would not appreciate the gentleman's amendment this evening.                              {time}  2200  In addition to that, I wanted to say something about ARPA-E, where we have our advanced energy research going on. You know, the United States is not energy secure. We are still too vulnerable here at home on many levels, and ARPA-E provides us with a real global advantage.  I don't think we need to shave anything from ARPA-E because if I look at some of the competition that is coming at us from China, for example, it is even coming in very unfair ways, such as hacking into our intellectual property that any of our private companies hold.  We view ARPA-E as essential to our future, really, with what we are doing within the global marketplace. So I think the gentleman is very well-intentioned in trying to have regular order. I wish that it all worked so perfectly, but I don't think that we should hurt communities across this country nor the long-term energy interests of the Nation, because I think that is what would be done if the gentleman's amendment were to pass.  I just wanted to put that on the Record and rise in opposition, but I respect the gentleman for coming down here and for trying to perfect the way that we conduct the affairs of the Nation.  Mr. Chairman, I yield back the balance of my time.  Mr. McCLINTOCK. I appreciate the gentlelady's kind words.  I would point out that this defunds nothing. All that it does is to freeze spending of those unauthorized programs at last year's level until the authorizing committees actually sit down and review them and revise them and reauthorize them. Nor is anything in the NDAA affected by this freeze.  I appreciate my friend from Idaho's sympathy, but I would trade it in a moment for his support. And I would point out that this amendment, the whole point of this amendment is that authorizing committees have got to review, reauthorize, revise, or repeal these measures. They have got to do one of those things.  But why should they, why would they want to go to all of the fuss and bother of reviewing these programs, taking on entrenched interests, asking hard questions, making people cranky in the process, when all they have to do, under our current practice, is sit there, do absolutely nothing, and the funding, just like the mighty Mississippi, just keeps rolling along.  We cannot continue down this course responsibly. We have a responsibility to the American people to do that heavy lifting, to go through these programs with a fine-tooth comb, to make the revisions that are necessary according to our own experience and, in the most important mandate this Congress has been given, to stop wasting people's money.  This measure is a very small step. To suggest that it is going to have dire consequences, cutting thirty-six one-hundredths of 1 percent of the total funds in this bill, is a measure of how out of control our thinking on spending has gotten.  So, with that, Mr. Chairman, I would ask for this single token, that we take a stand and at least freeze the unauthorized spending.  The CHAIR. The time of the gentleman has expired.
