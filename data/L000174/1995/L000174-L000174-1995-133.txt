President, I concur with the analysis of the Senator from Kentucky. I point out, as I did earlier, the Senator from Kentucky and I went into this conference with 193 items in disagreement; we settled 192, after a great deal of work, a lot of informal conferences, and a formal conference that went well after midnight. This was the only item, and this is the only way to take care of it, frankly.  The Senate has spoken loudly and clearly on this, and it is a good compromise between both bodies. Let us get off this subject. The issue can come up on authorizations bills, where it belongs, not on appropriations bills, and we can go on with the business of the Senate.  The only way we are going to get out of the real budget problem we have, when people are out of work and everything else, is to pass the appropriations bills. Here is another 1 of the 13 appropriations bills that could go to the President. If he signed it, that would be 3 of the 13 appropriations bills signed, with only 10 more to go, and we are out of this problem.  I yield the floor.
