President, I rise in support of amendment that is being offered by the Senator from Nevada.  Yesterday, the Republican leader, Senator Frist, told us that the only chance the Senate would have to pass critical legislation to help countless deserving Americans will be if we are willing to reduce and virtually repeal the estate tax in America.  My question and the question of the Senator from Nevada and this side of aisle is, why? Why not just pass this tax-extender package that is ready right now on the Senate floor?  Those of us who have been in Congress for a few years know that this package of extenders is a spoonful of sugar. It helps the medicine go down. It is saved until the end of the session. It is offered as a sweetener to pass a package that is otherwise not palatable for indigestion.  We all know the merits of these proposals.
