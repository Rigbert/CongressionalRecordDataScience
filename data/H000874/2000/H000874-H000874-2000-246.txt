Chairman, I thank the gentleman for yielding me this time.  I too congratulate the gentleman from Illinois (Mr. Porter) for his leadership of this committee, but this bill does not represent the gentleman's leadership; and it ought not to be hung around his neck, because if he were in charge, this would not be his bill. These would not be his figures. This would not represent the depth of hispriorities. So let us not delude ourselves, I say to my friends.  Newt Gingrich stood on this floor, and he talked to the perfectionist caucus on the Republican side of the aisle; and he pointed out that the American public sent a President, House Members, and Senate Members, and the real problem with why we have gridlock in Washington and why we have the absurd charade through which we are now going, and undercutting the American people's priorities, not just our priorities, is because there is one group that does not agree with most of the other groups; and it is, I say to my friends, the Republican Conference within the House of Representatives.  Mr. Chairman, we have had a number of people stand up here and say oh, what you Democrats want to do. Do you not want the American public to know that what we want to do, our colleagues in the United States Senate have already done in their committee? Their figures are more than our figures, I say to my colleagues, not less. They too believe that our Republican colleagues are undercutting America's children and America's families and America's health; they too, our Republican colleagues in the Senate, not just those on this side of the aisle that you would like to say oh, look at how awful they are, and then show your charts about your spending. It is interesting, the red lines they put up showing more spending. What a different story you tell at home about how you are cutting spending. My colleagues cannot have it both ways. But they try; but they try.  For instance, the gentleman from Oklahoma (Mr. Coburn) got up here and said this is a 14.6 percent increase. Hooey, hooey. It is a 3.8 percent increase. Why? Because last year, my Republican colleagues played games and they pretended the 302(b) numbers were at $84 million, their figures. But guess what? They then added on a lot of money after that so the real spending was $96 billion. But it did not count on the 302(b)s.  Now, why are we here? The American public must wonder, why are we having this debate? Because we are discussing priorities.  I am going to offer an amendment and talk about how many children and families are adversely affected by this bill as opposed to the priorities we are offering and the priorities they put forward across the Capitol in the United States Senate. But we are here because we are deciding between those large tax cuts that my colleagues do not like us to talk about. They lament and say, oh, these numbers are not good; but we had to do this because the budget makes us do it.  However, nobody made us adopt the budget. Nobody made us adopt the large tax cuts for the wealthiest Americans that are going to shortchange children and families. I tell my friend from North Carolina, nobody made us do that. We did it ourselves. Not with my vote, but it was done. And as a result, we are going to talk about the number of children and families that will not be served, but that the Senate wants to serve on both sides of the aisle and that we want to serve. I hope my Republican colleagues will support my amendment.                Announcement by the Chairman Pro Tempore  The CHAIRMAN pro tempore (Mr. Pease). Members are reminded that they are to refrain from characterizing positions taken by Members in the other body.
