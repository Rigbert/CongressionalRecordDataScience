Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.  Mr. Speaker, H. Res. 128, bipartisan legislation--we got about 114 Members, maybe as many as 118, a few came in right at the end--is a visible and necessary manifestation of deep congressional concern that egregious human rights abuses immediately end in Ethiopia and that fundamental human rights be promoted and protected for all.  I would note parenthetically that, like others in this House, my commitment to promoting human rights in Ethiopia spans decades and includes country visits, chairing numerous congressional hearings and legislation, including the Ethiopia Freedom, Democracy, and Human Rights Advancement Act of 2006.  The resolution before us today, Mr. Speaker, is balanced and recognizes the recent peaceful and voluntary transfer of power from Prime Minister Hailemariam to the new Prime Minister Abiy, and welcomes Prime Minister Abiy's inaugural speech calling for open political competition and the defense of fundamental human rights. However, Prime Minister Abiy has been a member of the governing Ethiopian People's Revolutionary Democratic Front since the EPRDF took power in 1991.  Prior to becoming Prime Minister, he played a critical role in the government security apparatus as the cofounder of the Ethiopian Information Network Security Agency. He is the leader of the Oromo Peoples' Democratic Organization, one of the four ethnic groups that make up the EPRDF.  Also, H. Res. 128 commends Ethiopia's efforts to promote regional peace and security, as well as our longstanding partnership in addressing health challenges.                              {time}  1715  However, the resolution carefully and accurately highlights that, despite these developments, human rights abuses remain at the core of the government's treatment--or should I say mistreatment--of the Ethiopian people.  So after decades of serious human rights abuse--often ignored and trivialized by some in Africa, the European Union, and the United States--it is now time for positive action and meaningful deeds. Words, Mr. Speaker, are just not enough.  In a letter asking Members of Congress to support our resolution, Amnesty International notes that, in the last 2 months, the government has released large numbers of political prisoners--although many remain behindbars--and closed the notorious Maekelawi prison, known for its torture. Yet some have already been rearrested, and all--absolutely all of them--are at risk of rearrest. Making matters worse, repressive laws and state of emergency, used to brutalize people, remains in place. There has been no reform there. None whatsoever.  Human Rights Watch strongly supports H. Res. 128 and has reported in its reporting on human rights that: ``Since late 2015, security forces have killed over 1,000 people''--and some estimates put that far higher--``and detained tens of thousands during widespread protests against government policies.''  The Human Rights Watch goes on to say: ``A state of emergency began in February 2018''--that is just several weeks ago--``the second in 2 years, and permits draconian restrictions on rights to freedom of expression, association, and assembly. Authorities regularly use arbitrary arrests and politically motivated prosecutions to silence journalists, activists, and perceived opposition party members. Torture remains a serious problem in detention.''  Earlier today,  Mike Coffman and I had a press conference. There were several men and women there who have suffered the torture of the Ethiopian Government and bear on their bodies and their minds and their hearts the horrible and horrific indignity of the use of torture by the Government of Ethiopia. Human Rights Watch continues: ``The Ethiopian Government has not conducted meaningful investigations into any of these abuses. Repressive laws restrict the activities of nongovernmental organizations. The ruling coalition won all 547 parliamentary seats in the 2015 election.''  All of them. What does that tell you?  Mr. Speaker, the 2017 Department of State Country Report on Human Rights Practices for Ethiopia also cited serious human rights violations, including arbitrary arrests, killings, and torture committed by the security forces, restrictions on freedom of expression and association, politically motivated trials, harassment, and intimidation of opposition members and journalists.  On February 18 of this year, the U.S. Embassy in Ethiopia issued a strong statement against the state of emergency. They said, in pertinent part: ``We strongly disagree with the Ethiopian Government's decision to impose a state of emergency that includes restrictions on fundamental rights such as assembly and expression.''  ``We strongly urge the government to rethink this approach''--the State Department goes on to say--``and identify other means to protect lives and property while preserving, and indeed expanding, the space for meaningful dialogue and political participation. . . . `'  My resolution--cosponsored by well over 110, I think it is 118 now, Members of the House--calls on the Government of Ethiopia to:  Lift the state of emergency;  Repeal or amend proclamations used as a tool to suppress human rights in Ethiopia, including the so-called Antiterrorism Proclamation--which accuses any Ethiopian who criticizes the government of being a terrorist--and the Charities and Societies Proclamation--which makes it virtually impossible for civil society organizations to function by severely restricting foreign funding;  We are asking in the resolution to stop the killing of peaceful protestors and hold accountable those responsible for killing, torturing, and detaining innocent civilians;  Release dissidents, journalists, students, activists, and political leaders jailed for exercising their right to free expression and peaceful assembly;  Engage with citizens about development strategies, especially when these people could lose their land;  Allow a U.N. rapporteur unfettered access to examine the state of human rights in Ethiopia. Unfettered. Go anywhere, any time, and talk to anyone without fear of reprisal or retaliation;  And the resolution calls on the U.S. Department of State and USAID to, among other things, engage in a cooperative effort with the Government of Ethiopia in the formulation of a comprehensive strategy to help advance democracy, rule of law, human rights, economic growth, and peace and security in Ethiopia, and hold accountable individuals responsible for gross human rights violations in Ethiopia through appropriate mechanisms like the Global Magnitsky Act.  Mr. Speaker, let me conclude by thanking Congressman  Mike Coffman, who has been an amazing tenacious supporter for this legislation and has really made a difference in helping to get it to the floor, and, of course, our majority leader for actually getting it to the floor. I see many of my colleagues on the Democrat side. I thank them. This is bipartisan legislation, and that is what it ought to be.  I want to thank Ms. Bass, the ranking member of the Africa, Global Health, Global Human Rights, and International Organizations Subcommittee, for her cosponsorship and leadership as well, as well as Chairman Royce and Ranking Member Engel.  I would also like to thank the many human rights groups and the Ethiopian-American community, who have and continue to work diligently and tenaciously to secure fundamental human rights for the people of Ethiopia.  This is a first step today. My hope is that it will begin a process of this body being absolutely in solidarity with the oppressed and standing in opposition to the oppressor.  Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.
