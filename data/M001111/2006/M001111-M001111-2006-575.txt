 President, I rise this evening to discuss my vote on the confirmation of Judge Samuel Alito, Jr., to the U.S. Supreme Court. After meeting with Judge Alito and studying his record and comparing his answers to my criteria for judicial nominees, I have decided to vote against confirming Judge Samuel Alito, Jr., as an Associate Justice of the U.S. Supreme Court.  The next Justice will have the power to change the Court, change the country, and change our rights for generations. Judge Alito has a very troubling record. In his hearing and in our private meeting he did not show that he will be an independent judge who will uphold the rights and liberties of all Americans. With our rights and freedoms on the line, I will not take a chance on Judge Alito because I have serious questions about his independence and his commitment to protecting our rights and our liberties.  As with past nominees, I have evaluated this nominee based on my longstanding criteria, which ask: Is the nominee qualified, ethical, and honest? Will the nominee be fair, evenhanded, and independent? And will the nominee uphold the rights and liberties of all Americans?  Personally, I got involved in politics because of another Supreme Court nomination, that of Clarence Thomas. At the time, I was frustrated that average Americans didn't have a voice in the process that affects them so much. I have worked to be the voice of working families in my State, and I have asked the questions they would ask. I am voting to protect their interests.  I recognize the significance of a seat on the U.S. Supreme Court. The Constitution directs Senators to provide advice and consent on all judicial nominees, and the people of my home State of Washington have trusted me to be their advocate to safeguard their rights as I vote on judicial nominees.  I take that responsibility very seriously. That is why I have reviewed Judge Alito's past writings, studied his answers to the Senate Judiciary Committee, and asked to meet with him in my office.  A lifetime appointment to the Supreme Court is a tremendous grant of unchecked power. If the Supreme Court rules incorrectly, there is no option for appeal. There is no backstop. Any seat on the Supreme Court can affect our rights for generations. But there are three factors involved in this particular nomination that make it even more significant. Those factors are the times, the seat, and the process.  First, I am well aware that we are living in historic times. Each day, it seems that the rights of the individuals and the power of government are being tested. We are at war overseas, we face threats from terrorism here at home, and the current administration is pushing the bounds of governmental power in remarkable ways.  The Bush administration has arrested U.S. citizens and held them without access to the courts. It has run secret prisons around the world. It has expressed views on torture that put our own troops at risk. As we recently learned, the administration has been spying on American citizens without prior approval from a court. These are grave issues which will likely come before the Supreme Court. How that Court rules will affect the rights of our citizens, the balance of power between the branches of our Government, and the balance of power between our citizens and Government.  So as I make my decision on this nominee, I am very mindful of the historic times we are living in and the serious questions this Supreme Court will address in the coming years.  Secondly, I am very mindful of the seat that is open on the Supreme Court and its significance. Justice Sandra Day O'Connor was a pioneer in the field of law, and her decisions will shape the lives of the American people for generations to come.  As I said when she announced her resignation, we live in a better America due to her 24 years of service on the Court. Justice O'Connor was often a swing vote on those critical decisions. Her successor could easily change the balance of power on the Court, which could dramatically shift the Court's ruling on so many issues. Because this is a swing seat that could tip the Court's balance of power, we need to make sure that the person we confirm is someone who will protect our rights and liberties.  Some have suggested that I should just go along and support the President's nominee. That is not the way I make decisions. I have criteria that I use to evaluate all judicial nominees, and Judge Alito is no different.  Third, I am also well aware of how Judge Alito came to be the President's nominee. The President, as we all remember, had nominated his counsel, Harriet Miers, to the High Court, but Ms. Miers was not acceptable to the rightwing of the President's party. I found it very interesting that before her nomination, Republicans were demanding an up-or-down vote on the Senate floor for anyone the President nominated. But when President Bush nominated Ms. Miers, suddenly we stopped hearing that urgent call for an up-or-down vote. In fact, Ms. Miers' nomination was killed by the President's own party, apparently because she did not meet the ideological test of the extreme right.  I recount this history tonight not to diminish Judge Alito but to point out that his nomination comes before the Senate in the context of an ideological battle that has been created by the rightwing. When the President nominated Judge Alito, the rightwing cheered, confident that he would vote their way. That reaction gives me pause as to whether this nominee can keep an open mind on the issues that come before him. If the rightwing is so confident that he is going to vote their way, how can all of us be confident that he will put our country's needs first? That alone does not suggest that Judge Alito cannot be fair, but it did lead me to explore those questions diligently.  Given the importance of the Supreme Court and the background of the times and the seat and the process, I began to evaluate how Judge Alito measured up to my standards for judicial nominees. Judge Alito's record contains some disturbing statements, rulings, and pronouncements that require detailed explanations. Does he still hold some of those views? In many cases, we don't know. I wish Judge Alito had been more forthcoming during his hearing. At the same time, many of the things he said and refused to say spoke volumes.  As I noted earlier, my standards are simple: Is the nominee qualified, ethical, and honest? Will the nominee be fair and evenhanded and independent? And will the nominee uphold the rights and liberties of all Americans?  I am very comfortable that Judge Alito is qualified, he is honest, and he is ethical. But whether he will be fair and evenhanded is another question. And, as was discussed at his hearing, he does have a troubling record for fighting for the government and corporations and against individuals. He seems to favor the entrenched power over the little guy. His record does not give me the confidence that everyone who comes before the Court will be treated fairly.  I am also deeply concerned about Judge Alito's independence. We rely on our courts as a critical check and balance against government abuse. That independent check helps to protect our rights. This is especially important today because of the growing questions of the expansion of Executive power.  The Supreme Court will need to evaluate whether recent Executive actions are constitutional. Here Judge Alito's unbalanced minority view of the scope of Executive power tells me he does not have the independence to be an adequate check on the Government's abuse of our rights.  Finally, I have serious doubts that Judge Alito will uphold our rights and liberties. One example is his hostilityto the right of privacy. In the hearings, he refused to say that Roe v. Wade is settled law, and he did not adequately explain his 1985 statement that the Constitution does not protect a right to an abortion.  Last year, when I voted to confirm, yes, Chief Justice John Roberts, I said I was choosing hope instead of fear and that Judge Roberts, through his answers, inspired such hope. Judge Alito, through his writings, his rulings, and his nonanswers, does not inspire confidence in me that he will protect all our rights. Because so much is on the line, because I do not believe he will be sufficiently independent or will uphold our rights and liberties, I will respectfully vote against his confirmation to the U.S. Supreme Court.  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to print in the Record a letter from teachers around the country who have opposed this nomination.  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in the Record, as follows:                             Society of American Law Teachers,                                                  January 9, 2006.     Re The Society of American Law Teachers' Opposition to the          Nomination of Judge Samuel Alito to the United States          Supreme Court.     Hon. Arlen Specter,     Chair, Committee on the Judiciary, U.S. Senate, Washington,          DC.     Hon. Patrick Leahy,     Ranking Minority Member, Committee on the Judiciary, U.S.          Senate, Washington, DC.       Dear Senators Specter and Leahy: The Society of American      Law Teachers (SALT) opposes--and urges all members of the      Senate Judiciary Committee to vote against--the nomination of      Judge Samuel Alito to the United States Supreme Court. SALT      is the largest organization of law professors in the United      States, representing more than 900 professors at more than      160 law schools. SALT has taken a position opposing only a      very few judicial nominations. It did not oppose the      nomination of Justice Roberts or Harriet Meirs. However, it      is deeply committed to civil rights, individual rights and      liberties, and an interpretation of federalism that retains a      robust role for Congress in protecting these rights. Judge      Alito's work in the United States Department of Justice and      fifteen year record on the United States Court of Appeals for      the Third Circuit evidence his disregard for all three.      Replacing Justice Sandra Day O'Connor with Judge Alito will      result in the Court shifting profoundly to the right.       A Knight-Ridder comprehensive review of published opinions      written by Judge Alito concluded that Alito has worked      quietly but resolutely to weave a conservative legal agenda      into the fabric of the nation's laws . . . [His] record      reveals decisions so consistent that it appears results do      matter to him . . . [He] rarely supports individual rights      claims. . . [and] often goes out of his way to narrow the      scope of individual rights.       While Judge Alito's opinions are devoid of explosive      language and appear to reflect a dispassionate application of      law to facts, he has used legal craftsmanship and existing      precedent in the service of predetermined results. As      Professor Lawrence Tribe has stated, ``I simply make a plea      to quit pretending that law, life and an individual's      assumptions about both can be entirely separated. . . .'' A      judge's values, beliefs and experiences do matter. Judge      Alito has undermined the protections of civil rights laws,      devalued individual rights, overturned or weakened federal      statutes, and narrowly reinterpreted precedent in the name of      dispassionate application of the law.                  Undermining Civil Rights Protections                       Employment Discrimination       Judge Alito has engaged in an effort to eviscerate the laws      that seek to remedy violations of federal civil rights. This      effort can be seen in particular in an evaluation of his      opinions in the area of employment discrimination. Judge      Alito has written opinions in eighteen employment      discrimination cases and has sided with the plaintiff only      four times, which includes one case in which he sided with      white police officers challenging an affirmative action      policy. He has evinced deep skepticism about the      legitimacy of most discrimination claims and an      unwarranted belief that discrimination is rare in our      society.       In three cases in which Judge Alito would have dismissed      claims of harassment, he displayed a lack of understanding of      the dynamics of harassment and hostile environment      discrimination and their impact on a victim's workplace      environment and psychological well-being. In one case,      writing for the court, he upheld the exclusion of a report      showing the harasser had previously harassed another woman      because ``the report in no way put the City on notice that      Dickerson was harassing Robinson.''       In another case, Pirolli v. World Flavors, Inc., there was      an undisputed evidence that an employee with mental      disabilities had suffered sexually motivated, physically      abusive workplace harassment. The trial court dismissed      Pirolli's claim, calling the quite horrifying harassment mere      macho horseplay. In a 2-1 decision, the Third Circuit      reversed and sent the case back for trial. Judge Alito      dissented, not because Pirolli had failed to meet the legal      standard for sexual harassment, but because his brief never      explicitly asserted that he suffered from a work environment      that a reasonable person without mental retardation would      find hostile or abusive, even though all the necessary facts      had been alleged. In other words, Judge Alito would have      dismissed the case for sloppy brief writing. Additionally, he      would have held Pirolli to a higher standard of      reasonableness than the law requires. Judge Alito would have      compared Pirolli to a reasonable person without mental      retardation. The Supreme Court had previously emphasized in      Oncale v. Sundowner Offshore Services, Inc., Justice Scalia      writing for the majority, that the severity of the harassment      is to be judged from the perspective of a reasonable person      in the plaintiff's position--in this case, a reasonable      person with a mental disability.       Lastly, in a dissenting opinion, Judge Alito would have      excluded evidence crucial to the victim's discrimination case      in Glass v. Philadelphia Electric Co. Mr. Glass had worked      for Philadelphia Electric for twenty-three years and received      only one job evaluation less than satisfactory. He applied      for and was denied many promotions. The employer explanation      was based part in on the one sub-par evaluation Glass had      received. Glass tried to present evidence that during that      time period he was assigned to a position where he was      subject to racial harassment and a hostile work environment.      Amazingly, Judge Alito's dissent argued that allowing Glass      to tell his side of the story might cause ``substantial      unfair prejudice'' and, failing to do so was, in any case,      harmless error.       In several cases, Judge Alito would have granted summary      judgment depriving plaintiffs of their right to trial by      setting the evidentiary bar so high that it would be almost      impossible for a plaintiff to survive summary judgment. In      Sheridan v. E.I. de Nemours and Co., a hotel employee brought      suit for sex discrimination in the failure to promote her.      The District Court granted the employer summary judgment, and      the case was appealed to the Third Circuit. The issue was how      much evidence a victim of discrimination must present to get      her case to trial. In an en banc 10-1 decision in which Judge      Alito was the only dissenter, the majority overturned the      grant of summary judgment and sent the case back for trial.      The majority held that a plaintiff would survive summary      judgment if she made her prima facie case and presented      evidence of pretext to rebut the employer's evidence.      Judge Alito would have disregarded the evidence in      plaintiff's prima facie case if the employer presented      evidence of a non-discriminatory reason for its action and      would have required additional evidence of discrimination.      Judge Alito's approach misinterpreted a Supreme Court      case, St. Mary's Honor Society v. Hicks, regarding      litigants' shifting evidentiary burdens in Title VII      cases. The majority's interpretation of Hicks was      reaffirmed by the Supreme Court in Reeves v. Sanderson      Plumbing Products, Inc. Although the dispute in Sheridan      appears to be highly technical, it is central to whether      victims of discrimination will have their day in court.       In another discrimination case in which Judge Alito      dissented from the reversal of a grant of summary judgment,      the majority said, ``Title VII would be eviscerated if our      analysis were to halt where the dissent suggests.'' An      African American woman was denied promotion and alleged race      discrimination. The issue was whether the employer's      evaluation that a white woman was the best candidate was the      result of discrimination. In spite of conflicting evidence,      Judge Alito would have simply accepted the employer's      judgment of who was the best candidate. The majority accused      Judge Alito of overstepping his judicial role and acting as a      fact finder in resolving the conflicting evidence in favor of      the employer. Judge Alito's hostility toward some employment      discrimination cases was reflected in his dissent:       ``I have no doubt that in the future we are going to get      many more cases where an employer is choosing between      competing candidates of roughly equal qualifications and the      candidate who is not hired or promoted claims discrimination.      I also have little doubt that most plaintiffs will be able to      use the discovery process to find minor inconsistencies in      terms of the employer's having failed to follow its internal      procedures to the letter. We are allowing disgruntled      employees to impose the costs of trial on employers who,      although they have not acted with the intent to discriminate,      may have treated their employees unfairly.''       Taken together, these cases reflect a palpable hostility      toward plaintiffs in employment discrimination cases.                    Discrimination in Jury Selection       Judge Alito has written troubling opinions in two death      penalty cases where the defendants challenged jury selection      as reflecting discrimination. The cases are troubling for      three reasons. First, they reflect a general hostility toward      civil rights. Second, they suggest that Judge Alito is among      the most conservative judges when it comes to the death      penalty (whereas Justice O'Connor was frequently the swing      vote in capital cases). Third, one of the cases reflects      Judge Alito's hostility to the use of statistics to prove      discrimination. This hostility is most troubling because      statistics have been an important element of proof in      creating an inference of discrimination or a discriminatory      impact.       While picking a grand jury in Ramseur v. Beyer, the judge      announced that he was not randomly selecting jurors because      he was trying to pick a cross section of the community,      instead asking some prospective jurors, including at least      two African Americans, to sit separately in the body of the      courtroom. An en banc divided Third Circuit ruled against      Ramseur's claim of an equal protection violation. Judge Alito      wrote a separate concurrence, making the astounding assertion      that defendants have no constitutional basis to challenge      a grand jury when certain racial groups were treated      differently in order to get a cross section jury. Equally      dismayingly, he suggested that defendants may not be able      to assert rights of jurors who are the victims of      discrimination with respect to grand jury jurors (although      the right is clearly established for challenges to regular      jurors). Judge Alito reached well beyond what was      necessary to decide the case in order to present radical      ideas in dicta.       In Riley v. Taylor, the defendant was convicted of felony      murder and sentenced to death. Eventually he filed a motion      in federal court challenging his conviction on numerous      grounds, including that peremptory challenges were used      impermissibly to strike jurors based on race. The full Court      reversed his conviction, in part based on a violation of his      constitutional rights with respect to peremptory challenges.      Judge Alito filed a dissenting opinion. Ramsey presented      evidence that all three of the potential Black jurors were      struck in his trial and that prosecutors struck every      potential Black juror in all four murder trials held the same      year in Delaware County. Judge Alito completely discounted      the statistical evidence, writing that inferring      discrimination was no more reasonable than attempting to      explain why a disproportionate number of recent presidents      were left handed. As the majority noted, the analogy ignored      the underlying constitutional right and ``minimize[d] the      history of discrimination against prospective black jurors      and black defendants.'' Because of this history of      discrimination, courts have consistently held that, barring      another explanation by the defendant, statistics can aid in      proving discrimination. Judge Alito's approach would      completely discount reliance on statistics to help prove      discrimination and would fly in the face of years of judicial      decisions in discrimination cases.                Endangering Core Legal Rights for Women       In cases raising issues of gender discrimination, Judge      Alito has written troubling decisions in which he appears to      accept traditional notions of the subservient role of women      in society and to deny the separate rights of women to      control their own destiny.       Judge Alito's record, both prior to and subsequent to      joining the bench, reflects clearly that he does not support      the constitutional right to choose and that his elevation to      the Supreme Court would endanger this fundamental right. In      1985, while in the Solicitor General's office, he wrote a      memo offering his own strategy for using the government's      brief in Thornburgh v. American College of Obstetricians and      Gynecologists to (1) advance the goal of bringing about an      eventual overruling of Roe v. Wade, and (2) in the meantime      to mitigate its effects by upholding even the most burdensome      barriers to abortion. In the same year, Judge Alito submitted      an application for a Justice Department promotion, wherein he      wrote that he was particularly proud of his contributions in      cases in which the government has argued to the Supreme Court      that the Constitution does not protect the right to an      abortion.       Judge Alito's record in the Third Circuit demonstrates that      he has sought to implement his earlier views. In a concurring      opinion rejected by the majority and subsequently rejected by      the Supreme Court in Planned Parenthood v. Casey, Judge Alito      would have upheld a requirement that a woman notify her      husband before having an abortion. He discounted the      liberty and bodily integrity of the woman while showing      great concern for the husband's rights. Judge Alito's view      that the spousal notification provision in the law caused      no undue burden to women suggests that he believes a woman      loses her autonomy rights when she marries. Even in two      cases concerning abortion rights protections which had      previously been struck down by the Supreme Court and in      which Judge Alito was compelled to follow precedent, he      wrote narrow concurring opinions to insure that there was      no language that might support the upholding of Roe or      inhibit the ability to further narrow the right to choose.       Just as Judge Alito has denied the liberty rights of women      to control their bodies, his decision striking down the      Family and Medical Leave Act demonstrates that he has no      understanding of the distinctive burdens women face in      juggling work and family. Likewise, his opinions have      demonstrated a lack of understanding of the dynamics of      sexual harassment and its detrimental impact on victims of      harassment. Even in cases involving fathers of unborn      children, Judge Alito's solicitude seems to apply only to      married couples. He has shown a lack of sympathy for      protection of people and couples who are unmarried. In an      immigration case, Judge Alito held that it was justifiable to      permit a husband, but not a fiance to contest a woman's      deportation to China where she fears coerced abortion of the      couple's unborn child. In another asylum case, Judge Alito      denied asylum to an Iranian woman who asserted she would be      persecuted for refusal to wear the traditional veil and for      her feminist beliefs if she returned to Iran. While      acknowledging that an asylum claim can be based on gender-     based persecution, Judge Alito was not convinced that she      would be willing to actually defy the authorities and      therefore suffer the severe consequences alleged. In other      words, a woman must show her willingness to become a martyr      in order to prevail in the typical gender-based asylum case.  An Expansive View of the Police Power at the Expense of Individual                                  Rights       Judge Alito has advanced an expansive view of the police      power. His 1985 application to the Justice Department      expressed his disagreement with Warren Court decisions      concerning criminal procedure. Since ascending to the Third      Circuit, he has in criminal cases consistently deferred to      state courts, police, and prosecutors. In particular, he has      written a series of decisions narrowing the Fourth Amendment      protection against unreasonable search and seizure. Judge      Alito has sat on at least twelve panels in which judges      agreed regarding a citizen's Fourth Amendment rights. In each      case, Judge Alito adopted the view most supportive of the      government's position.       One of the most troubling examples of Judge Alito's      expansive view of law enforcement authority is his dissent in      Doe v. Groody, where he voted to approve the strip search of      a mother and her ten-year-old daughter, even though the      search warrant obtained by the police did not name or refer      to either of them. As then Judge Michael Chertoff wrote,      Judge Alito's position threatened to turn the Constitution's      search warrant requirement into little more than a ``rubber      stamp.''       Other dissenting decisions of Judge Alito suggest that he      views individual and other constitutional rights as stopping      at the prison door. He would have upheld a Pennsylvania law      prohibiting certain inmates from having newspapers,      magazines, and photos of their family and friends. In a death      penalty case, Judge Alito wrote an opinion for the court      rejecting a claim of denial of the right to effective      counsel. In the sentencing phase of the trial, the attorney      had failed to look at materials he knew would be relied on by      the prosecutor, materials that would have revealed a range of      mitigation leads. The Supreme Court overturned Alito in a 5-4      decision with Justice O'Connor in the majority. Extreme View of Federalism and Separation of Powers That Would Limit  the Role of Congress in Protecting the Health, Safety and Welfare of     Its Citizens and Give Unwarranted Power to the Executive Branch                     Limiting the Role of Congress       Judge Alito has written two opinions that reflect an      extreme view of the limits of congressional power to pass      legislation. He voted to invalidate the federal prohibition      on machine gun possession and part of the federal Family and      Medical Leave Act. His decisions are consistent with his 1985      application to be Deputy Assistant Attorney General, in which      he wrote that he ``believe[s] very strongly in . . .      federalism.       In United States v. Rybar, Judge Alito argued in dissent      that the federal ban on machine gun possession, which had      been on the books in some form since 1934 is unconstitutional      Commerce Clause legislation. The Commerce Clause undergirds      many of the most important civil rights, consumer protection,      worker protection and environmental protection laws. Judge      Alito argued that the majority's theory would lead to the      conclusion that Congress may ban purely intrastate possession      of just about anything. He rationalized his decision in part      by claiming that there were no congressional findings or      statutory bases for the law, thus imposing a new stringent      fact-finding requirement for Congressional justification of      its laws. He ignored common sense--the facts involved a      licensed gun dealer selling machine guns at a gun show--     transactions which involved interstate commerce.      Additionally, he ignored references in conference reports and      on the floor of Congress concerning the effect of the ban on      interstate commerce. Judge Alito's colleagues accused him of      institutional disrespect by requiring the ``coordinate      branches of government'' to ``play'' show and tell with the      federal courts at the peril of invalidating congressional      statutes. All of the other appellate courts which had      considered the law in the wake of United States v. Lopez      agreed with Judge Alito's colleagues, and all but one court      to have looked at the law since then has done the same. The      Supreme Court rejected Judge Alito's restrictive view of      Congress' lawmaking authority in Gonzales v. Raich.       In another case concerning Congress' lawmaking authority,      Judge Alito again advocated an extremely narrow view of      congressional power. Chittister v. Department of Community      and Economic Development involved a state employee who sued      for damages under the Family Medical Leave Act (FMLA) when      his sick leave was revoked and he was terminated. Congress      claimed the authority to pass the FMLA under section 5 of the      Fourteenth Amendment on the grounds that the Act attempted to      remedy sex discrimination by allowing women to take leave      without sacrificing their jobs. Judge Alito held that      Congress does not have the authority to give state employees      the right to sue their employers for damages for violating      the FMLA. He rejected the justification that the FMLA      remedied sex discrimination and claimed that Congress had      failed     to make any findings that state statutes had discriminated      against women. The preamble to the statute explicitly states      that the purpose of the Act is to remedy sex discrimination.      There is of course, a long history of litigation striking      down state statutes disadvantaging women in the workplace.      Nevertheless, Judge Alito would require Congress to engage in      fact finding specifically directed at the FMLA. In a similar      challenge, Nevada Department of Human Resources v. Hibbs the      Supreme Court later held that state employees can enforce      their right to damages pursuant to a violation of another      provision of the FMLA.            Advocating an Expansive Scope of Executive Power       Since the Nixon Administration, the country has witnessed a      legal battle concerning the scope of presidential authority      under our Constitution. The present administration advances      an extreme, expansionist theory of the scope of presidential      power, both foreign and domestic. The theoretical      underpinnings for the concept of the ``imperial presidency''      have been developed by writings of the Federalist Society.      Judge Alito's 1985 application to serve as Deputy Assistant      Attorney General in the Office of Legal Counsel (OLC) boasts      of his regular participation in the Federalist Society, an      involvement which continues to this day. OLC, during his      tenure, was the source of extreme thinking about expansive      presidential power. For example, OLC opined that the      executive branch could ignore congressionally authorized      procedures for federal procurement and determined that the      President had constitutionally unfettered authority to      determine when to tell Congress of his covert initiative with      regard to Iranian arms sales--even though the power to      regulate foreign trade is an express congressional authority.       In other memoranda which Judge Alito wrote during his time      at the Justice Department, he argued in favor of expanded      government authority to intercept computer messages and      broader authority for government agents to set up shell      companies to help with undercover operations. He also told      the FBI that it was not bound by two district court decisions      restricting the Bureau's power to investigate employees whose      jobs were not critical to national security.       During his years on the bench, Judge Alito has been      extremely deferential to assertions of executive authority,      particularly in the area of criminal law, and has gone out of      his way to place limitations on Congress's legislative      powers. It is this line of thinking that has spawned (1)      unprecedented claims of executive privilege, (2) claims of      authority to engage in torture, (3) claims to hold U.S.      citizens indefinitely as enemy combatants and foreign      nationals as enemy combatants in Guantanamo Bay without any      right of review of that designation, and now (4) an apparent      pattern of flagrant violations of the Foreign Intelligence      Surveillance Act by sanctioning domestic wiretapping without      obtaining a warrant.                               Conclusion       With the retirement of Justice O'Connor, the direction of      the Court stands in the balance. Judge Alito's record      demonstrates that he would shift the court radically      rightward. His vision of federalism and separation of powers      would dangerously expand the power of the executive and the      states; shrink the power of Congress to protect the health,      safety and welfare of this nation's citizens; and diminish      the role of the courts in guarding against discrimination and      undue government intrusion into individual rights. Justice      Alito's opinions show an alarming detachment from real life      and real people. His opinions are a historical and reflect a      lack of empathy for or appreciation of the human condition      and the role of courts in protection the rights of      minorities.       We urge you to reject the nomination of Judge Alito to the      Supreme Court.           Sincerely,                                                   Eileen Kaufman,                                                     Co-President.                                                    Tayyab Mahmud,                                                     Co-President.
