President, I am here to talk about the Intelligence Committee report, but before the Senator leaves the floor, I just want to tell my colleague from Nebraska how much I appreciate his service. I note for the body that in the effort to build a bipartisan coalition for major tax reform, Mike Johanns was the Senator whose counsel we all thought we needed, and I thank him. I will have more to say about his career before the end of this week.                          ____________________
