 President, on October 8, the Committee on Foreign Relations ordered reported three bills, S. 2667, H.R. 3656, and H.R. 4073. I ask unanimous consent that the cost estimates prepared by the Congressional Budget Office with regard to these bills be printed in the Record.  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in the Record, as follows:                                                    U.S. Congress,                                  Congressional Budget Office,                                 Washington, DC, October 10, 2002.     Hon. Joseph R. Biden, Jr.,     Chairman, Committee on Foreign Relations,     U.S. Senate, Washington, DC.       Dear Mr. Chairman: The Congressional Budget Office has      prepared the enclosed cost estimate for S. 2667, the Peace      Corps Charter for the 21st Century Act.       If you wish further details on this estimate, we will be      pleased to provide them. The CBO staff contact is Joseph C.      Whitehill, who can be reached at 226-2840.           Sincerely,                                                 Barry B. Anderson                                   (For Dan L. Crippen, Director).       Enclosure.               congressional budget office cost estimate     S. 2667--Peace Corps Charter for the 21st Century Act       Summary: S. 2667 would authorize appropriations for the      Peace Corps for years 2004 through 2007 totaling $2.1      billion. It would authorize a doubling in the number of      volunteers to 14,000 and would increase the authorized      readjustment allowance paid to returning volunteers to $275      for each month of service. The bill also would authorize $10      million in 2003 for a grant program to support returned Peace      Corps volunteers' efforts to promote a better understanding      of other peoples on the part of the American people. Assuming      the appropriation of the authorized amounts, CBO estimates      that implementing S. 2667 would cost $1.9 billion over the      2003-2007 period. S. 2667 would not affect direct spending or      revenues.       S. 2667 contains no intergovernmental or private-sector      mandates as defined in the Unfunded Mandates Reform Act      (UMRA) and would not affect the budgets of state, local, or      tribal governments.       Estimated cost to the Federal Government: The estimated      budgetary impact of S. 2667 is shown in the following table.      The costs of this legislation fall within budget function 150      (international affairs). For this estimate, CBO assumes that      the legislation will be enacted early in fiscal year 2003,      that the authorized amounts specified in the bill for each      year over the 2003-2007 period will be provided in annual      appropriation acts near the start of each fiscal year, and      that outlays will follow historical spending patterns.------------------------------------------------------------------------                                By fiscal year, in millions of dollars--                               -----------------------------------------                                 2002   2003   2004   2005   2006   2007------------------------------------------------------------------------                    SPENDING SUBJECT TO APPROPRIATION Spending Under Current Law for the Peace Corps:  Authorization Level \1\.....    275    365      0      0      0      0  Estimated Outlays...........    276    343     72      8      2      0Proposed Changes:  Authorization Level.........      0     10    465    500    560    560  Estimated Outlays...........      0      8    365    474    536    549Spending Under S. 2667 for the Peace Corps:  Authorization Level.........    275    375    465    500    560    600  Estimated Outlays...........    276    351    437    482    538    549------------------------------------------------------------------------\1\ The 2002 level is the amount appropriated for that year. Section  3(b)(1) of the Peace Corps Act authorizes the appropriation of $365  million in 2003.       Intergovernmental and private-sector impact: S. 2667      contains no intergovernmental or private-sector mandates as      defined in UMRA and would not affect the budgets of state,      local, or tribal governments.       Estimate prepared by: Federal Costs: Joseph C. Whitehill      (226-2840); Impact on State, Local, and Tribal Governments:      Greg Waring (225-3220); and Impact on the Private Sector:      Paige Piper/Bach (226-2940).       Estimate approved by: Peter H. Fontaine, Deputy Assistant      Director for Budget Analysis.                                  ____                                                    U.S. Congress,                                  Congressional Budget Office,                                 Washington, DC, October 10, 2002.     Hon. Joseph R. Biden, Jr.,     Chairman, Committee on Foreign Relations,     U.S. Senate, Washington, DC.       Dear Mr. Chairman: The Congressional Budget Office has      prepared the enclosed cost estimate for H.R. 3656, an act to      amend the International Organizations Immunities Act to      provide for the applicability of that act to the European      Central Bank.       If you wish further details on this estimate, we will be      pleased to provide them. The CBO staff contact is Joseph C.      Whitehill, who can be reached at 226-2840.           Sincerely,                                                 Barry B. Anderson                                   (For Dan L. Crippen, Director).       Enclosure.               congressional budget office cost estimate     H.R. 3656--An act to amend the International Organizations          Immunities Act to provide for the applicability of that          act to the European Central Bank       H.R. 3656 would extend to the European Central Bank (ECB)      the same privileges, exemptions, and immunities given to the      central banks of sovereign states. Specifically, it would      protect the ECB's assets from judicial process and      attachment. The ECB is an independent legal entity owned by      the central banks of the 12 countries of the European Union      that comprise the euro area and functions as the central bank      for the euro. It holds some of the foreign reserve assets of      those countries in the Federal Reserve Bank of New York and      commercial banks in the United States. The act would assure      that the assets held collectively by the ECB retain the same      protection they had when they were held separately by the      central banks of its member countries. CBO estimates that      H.R. 3656 would have no effect on federal spending or      receipts.       H.R. 3656 contains no intergovernmental or private-sector      mandates as defined in the Unfunded Mandates Reform Act and      would not affect the budgets of state, local, or tribal      governments.       On March 27, 2002, CBO transmitted an estimate for H.R.      3656 as ordered reported by the House Committee on      International Relations on March 20, 2002. The two versions      of the legislation are identical, as are the two cost      estimates.       The CBO staff contact is Joseph C. Whitehill, who can be      reached at 226-2840. This estimate was approved by Peter H.      Fontaine, Deputy Assistant Director for Budget Analysis.                                  ____                                                    U.S. Congress,                                  Congressional Budget Office,                                 Washington, DC, October 10, 2002.     Hon. Joseph R. Biden, Jr.,     Chairman, Committee on Foreign Relations,     U.S. Senate, Washington, DC.       Dear Mr. Chairman: The Congressional Budget Office has      prepared the enclosed cost estimate for H.R. 4073, an act to      amend the Microenterprise for Self-Reliance Act of 2000 and      the Foreign Assistance Act of 1961 to increase assistance for      the poorest people in developing countries under      microenterprise assistance programs under those acts, and for      other purposes.       If you wish further details on this estimate, we will be      pleased to provide them. The CBO staff contact is Joseph C.      Whitehill.           Sincerely,                                                Barry B. Anderson,                                   (For Dan L. Crippen, Director).       Enclosure.               congressional budget office cost estimate     H.R. 4073--An act to amend the Microenterprise for Self-         Reliance Act of 2000 and the Foreign Assistance Act of          1961 to increase assistance for the poorest people in          developing countries under microenterprise assistance          programs under those Acts, and for other purposes       Summary: H.R. 4073 would authorize the appropriation of      $175 million in 2003 and $200 million in 2004 for grants and      credits to microenterprise development programs, or programs      that would provide access to financial service to poor      persons in developing countries. The act would place emphasis      on assistance to persons living within the bottom 50 percent      below a country's poverty line or living on less than the      equivalent of $1 per day. CBO estimates that implementing      H.R. 4073 would cost $328 million over the 2003-2007 period,      assuming the appropriation of the authorized amounts. The act      would not affect direct spending or revenues.       H.R. 4073 contains no integovernmental or private-sector      mandates as defined in the Unfunded Mandates Reform Act      (UMRA) and would not affect the budgets of state, local, or      tribal governments.       Estimated cost to the Federal Government: The estimated      budgetary impact of H.R. 4073 is shown in the following      table. The estimate assumes this legislation will be enacted      near the beginning of 2003, that the specified amounts will      be appropriated before the start of each fiscal year, and      that outlays will follow historical spending patterns.
