Speaker, I move to suspend the rules and agree to the resolution (H. Res. 451) directing the Committee on Standards of Official Conduct to respond to the indictment of, or the filing of charges of criminal conduct in a court of the United States or any State against, any Member of the House of Representatives by empaneling an investigative subcommittee to review the allegations not later than 30 days after the date the Member is indicted or the charges are filed.  The Clerk read the title of the resolution.  The text of the resolution is as follows:                              H. Res. 451       Whereas on June 4, 2007, Representative William Jefferson      was indicted on 16 criminal counts by a grand jury in the      United States District Court for the Eastern District of      Virginia;       Whereas recent credible media accounts indicate that the      Department of Justice is investigating the conduct of other      Members of the House of Representatives, and these      investigations may lead to further indictments;       Whereas the One Hundred Tenth Congress, in its first day of      session, strengthened the rules concerning the ethical      behavior of Members of the House;       Whereas the House has approved on an overwhelming and      bipartisan basis H.R. 2316, the Honest Leadership and Open      Government Act of 2007, to establish strict standards and      penalties concerning the relationship between lobbyists and      Members; and       Whereas these actions by the One Hundred Tenth Congress      demonstrate that illegal, unethical, or inappropriate conduct      by Members of the House will not be tolerated: Now,      therefore, be it       Resolved,  That whenever a Member of the House of      Representatives, including a Delegate or Resident      Commissioner to the Congress, is indicted or otherwise      formally charged with criminal conduct in a court of the      United States or any State, the Committee on Standards of      Official Conduct shall, not later than 30 days after the date      of such indictment or charge--       (1) empanel an investigative subcommittee to review the      allegations; or       (2) if the Committee does not empanel an investigative      subcommittee to review the allegations, submit a report to      the House describing its reasons for not empaneling such an      investigative subcommittee, together with the actions, if      any, the Committee has taken in response to the allegations.
