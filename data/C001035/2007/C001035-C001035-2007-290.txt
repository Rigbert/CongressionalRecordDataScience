President, I rise today to join my colleagues in cosponsoring S. 1, a bill to provide greater transparency in the legislative process.  The recent elections sent a clear message to Congress that the American people have lost confidence in their government. Without the support of the people, we cannot tackle the difficult issues that this Congress must face. This bill, then, is a critical part of restoring the people's trust by reforming ethics and lobbying rules.  It is important to remember that the conduct of most Members and their staffs is beyond reproach. Likewise, it is important to recognize that lobbying--whether done on behalf of the business community, an environmental organization, a children's advocacy group, or any other cause--can provide us with useful information and analysis that aids, but does not dictate, the decision-making process. Unfortunately, in the minds of many Americans, ``lobbying'' has come to be associated with expensive paid vacations masquerading as fact-finding trips, special access to Members and staff that an ordinary citizen could never hope to have, and undue influence that leads to decisions made in the best interest of the lobbyist and his or her client instead of the American people.  S. 1 which is nearly identical to a bill that was the product of bipartisan efforts by the Senate Committee on Homeland Security and Governmental Affairs and the Senate Committee on Rules and Administration and that was passed by this Senate just last year--includes a number of important provisions that will help to restore the public image of the United States Congress.  S. 1 bans gifts from lobbyists. This is clear, brightline rule that diminishes the appearance of impropriety that gifts can create.  S. 1 requires greater disclosure of the sponsors of and the purposes for earmarks included in a bill so that the people can know where tax dollars are being spent and why.  S. 1 eliminates floor privileges for former Members who are seeking to lobby other members. They will enjoy no more access to Senators and Congressmen than any other citizen.  S. 1 will eliminate the practice of anonymous holds in the Senate so that we can bring debate into the open and not simply kill a bill with a secret hold.  S. 1 will require enhanced disclosure of the activities of groups lobbying Congress so that the public can easily find out which interests are trying to influence the decisions we make.  S. 1 will slow the revolving door between the Hill and the private sector by limiting the ability of departing Members and staff to lobby their former colleagues.  While I am pleased to be a cosponsor of this bill, I also believe strongly that it would be improved by the addition of an independent Office of Public Integrity within the Legislative Branch. This Office would be able to conduct nonpartisan investigations of possible ethics violations. These investigations would help to promote public confidence in the enforcement of any laws that we pass to enhance congressional ethics. During debate on this bill last year, an amendment that Senator Lieberman, Senator McCain, and I offered to create this Office was defeated. However, I hope my colleagues have taken the lessons of the recent elections to heart and that the idea of an Office of Public Integrity will be approved this year. To that end, I am also cosponsoring Senator McCain's lobbying reform package, which he has introduced today and which contains a number of the provisions of S. 1 as well as creating an independent Office of Public Integrity.  I once again commend my colleagues on recognizing the importance of this issue by making it our first priority in the 110th Congress. I urge the Senate to work quickly to get this legislation finished so that we can move on from the task of governing ourselves and get down to the business of governing our Nation.                                 ______                                       By
