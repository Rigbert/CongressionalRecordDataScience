Speaker, I rise today to salute the good works and mourn the passing of Mr. Edward Pree a life-long community activist in Springfield, IL. Mr. Pree shared his life of the arts, sports, and his nation with many in the Springfield community.  After completing his law school education and service in the Army during World War II, Mr. Pree returned to Springfield to practice law with his father. The demands of this successful law practice did not keep Edward from serving those who returned from their tour of duty disabled. Mr. Pree was honored for his distinguished service by the Disabled American Veterans in 1962. He continued his work with veterans as a life member of the Veterans of Foreign Wars.  Edward's life-long work with the American Legion led to his being honored with the American Legion's Americanism Award in 1991. Edward was an enthusiastic and devoted patriot. This was witnessed on many occasions when he would be called on to address a gathering at a Memorial Day, Veterans' Day, or July 4th event.  Mr. Pree's love of the arts will long be remembered because of the endowments and scholarships he established to advance Springfield's artistic community. In 1978, Edward began an endowment to benefit the Springfield Art Association. He also set up the Georg Art Scholarship, the Edward Pree Speech award at Pawnee High School, and the Georg Endowment for the preservation of Edwards Place, a local historic site.  Mr. Pree's work with the Springfield sports community led to his being named one of the first inductees to the Springfield Sports Hall of Fame. Edward was inducted as a ``Friend of Sports'' because of his generosity in team sponsorships and his tenure as president of the American National Sports Corporation and as sports director at American Legion Post 32.  Mr. Speaker, I ask my colleagues to join me in extending their condolences to Mrs. Margaret Pree and the entire Pree Family.                          ____________________
