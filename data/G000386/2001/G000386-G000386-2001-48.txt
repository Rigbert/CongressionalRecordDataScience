 President, I am pleased to join my colleague from Vermont in introducing a bill to protect victims of identity theft.  This legislative remedy is prompted by the sweeping impact of the Supreme Court's decision this past week on the rights of more than 750,000 Americans who annually have their identity stolen and their credit put at risk. Under current law, consumers have a two-year statute of limitations to sue credit reporting companies that fail to protect private financial information from improper disclosures and security lapses. The problem with the Supreme Court's decision is that a victim of identity theft often has no idea that information about his finances has been negligently handled or disclosed by a credit reporting company until it's too late to take any legal action. Under current law, the two year statute of limitations begins when the consumer's credit reporting company fails to comply with the law--not when the consumer discovers or should have discovered the problem.  Our bill, the Protect the Victims of Identity Theft Act of 2001, changes that rule. As stated, it simply clarifies that the statute of limitations for identity theft does not start until the consumer discovers the problem or should have discovered the problem. This change in the law ensures that consumers have a fair chance to vindicate their rights should credit reporting companies fail to take reasonable steps to protect private financial and personal information from theft and misuse.  I urge my Senate colleagues to join us in co-sponsoring this legislation to protect the American consumer.                                 ______                                       By
