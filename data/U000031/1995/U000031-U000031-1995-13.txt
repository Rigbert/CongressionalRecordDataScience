Chairman, I have had extensive discussions with the chairman of the House Commerce Committee concerning the fact that teaching hospitals and academic medical centers have traditionally had higher costs. This is due to the special mission that these institutions have providing specialty patient care, conducting clinical research, and training new physicians to treat our poor.  After these discussions, I have been assured that it should be the policy of the States, when creating their new MediGrant programs, to take it into account. Obviously, it is in the best interest of this Nation's health care to ensure top quality doctors and research facilities, along with continuing specialty care. This can be done if the States recognize that additional reimbursements will be required to these types of facilities.
