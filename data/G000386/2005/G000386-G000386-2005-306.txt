 President, I ask Members to vote no on this amendment. There is an odd situation here. We have had a formula in the legislation for 40 years. That formula regularly has some States getting more reimbursement, some States getting less. Next year your State might go up. The next year it might go down. That is the way it has been working. All of a sudden, some States are receiving a reduction, and they want to keep it where it is. I have never had a situation where, when the formula worked to the benefit of the State, their reimbursement went up, that you come in here and ask for us to reduce the reimbursement. No, you accept the formula. If you want to change the formula, Senator Baucus and I have a good plan to change the formula. It would smooth out the peaks and valleys. That is what we ought to be doing instead of piecemeal doing it this way. I ask Members to vote against the amendment.                    Amendment No. 2365, as Modified
