Unfortunately given the current parliamentary situation, the only way for a vote to occur on the important issue of fiscal responsibility is by suspending the rules. My amendment would not be in order at this time and therefore my option is to move to suspend rules XVI and XXII. Although clearly that motion is within my rights as an individual Senator, I do not believe that is the best way for this body to proceed. Our rules and precedents govern how we operate on these appropriations, bills and I think that we should work within that framework. Therefore, I am not going to make that motion because it is not an appropriate way for the Senate to address this amendment. I will say, however, that the Senate will vote on this issue. I will be back on this floor at the first opportunity available to this Senator and the Senate will work its will on this language.
