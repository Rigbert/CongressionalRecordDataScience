President, I offer this motion along with my colleague, Senator Collins from Maine. I will shortly yield to her the last 30 seconds. I also offer it on behalf of myself and other Senators, including Senator Lautenberg.  The reality is very clear to so many poor families in this country. Energy prices are rising, temperatures are falling, and they are going to be in a very vulnerable and very disadvantaged position. This amendment would add $2.9 billion in additional funding for LIHEAP. It would bring it up to the authorized level of $5.1 billion.  We have considered this proposal in various procedural means four times. A majority of the Senate has always supported it. I hope it continues to do so.  I yield my remaining time to Senator Collins.
