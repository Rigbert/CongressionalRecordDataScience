 President, the Senate will soon vote to confirm another fine candidate to serve on the Federal bench.  Yesterday afternoon, we voted to advance the nomination of Judge Elizabeth Branch for the Eleventh Circuit Court of Appeals. Judge Branch has sat on the Georgia Court of Appeals since 2012. This follows a fine career that spanned both private practice and public service.  Judge Branch has previously answered the call to serve at the Department of Homeland Security, where she worked as associate general counsel, and then at the Office of Information and Regulatory Affairs. Her record and qualifications are well known.  Our colleagues on the Judiciary Committee reported her nomination favorably by an overwhelming vote. Confirming this worthy nominee will be a further credit to the outstanding work of Chairman Grassley and the members of the committee.  I encourage all my colleagues to join me in voting to confirm Elizabeth Branch today. Let's continue to fulfill our constitutional responsibility and confirm the President's outstanding judicial nominees.  I suggest the absence of a quorum.
