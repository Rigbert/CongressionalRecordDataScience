 Offering or voting for this motion is saying that the Senate does not want to fix the marriage tax penalty. Recommitting the bill is an attempt, I think, to kill the bill.  We are going to deal with the prescription drug problem. As I said in my opening comments this morning, Republicans have already set aside $40 billion in our budget to do so. We do not need to delay fixing the marriage tax penalty in order to fix the Medicare problem. We have the resources and the time to do both.  Again, I think this is a transparent effort to kill marriage tax penalty relief, and, consequently, I object.
