President, today the Senate will pass the amended Intelligence Authorization Act for fiscal year 2010, S.1494. I appreciate the commitment of Senator Feinstein, the chair of the Senate Select Committee on Intelligence, to work with me to strengthen this important legislation. The bill the Senate has approved recognizes the shared jurisdiction of the Committee on the Judiciary, and the Select Committee on Intelligence, in several legislative areas.  The first opportunity to review this legislation arose on August 5, shortly before the Senate was scheduled to recess, and in the midst of the debate on the confirmation of Associate Justice Sonia Sotomayor. At that time, I recognized several provisions in the bill that fall under the jurisdiction of the Judiciary Committee, as well as issues about which the committee shares an interest with the Select Committee on Intelligence. Since that time, Senator Feinstein and I, as well as our staffs, have engaged in serious negotiations concerning these provisions. We negotiated agreements regarding exemptions to the Freedom of Information Act, FOIA, as well as numerous reporting requirements, such as a significant, new requirement for the Federal Bureau of Investigation, FBI, an agency clearly under the jurisdiction of the Judiciary Committee, and an important new cybersecurity oversight provision.  The amendment to the intelligence authorization bill agreed to today identifies the Judiciary Committee as a recipient of relevant reporting provisions, narrows the operational files FOIA exemption for information provided by intelligence agencies to the Office of the Director of National Intelligence, ODNI, and strikes a FOIA (b)(3) exemption for terrorist identity information. Senator Feinstein has told me she is also committed to ensuring that the Judiciary Committee will receive reports required by the bill's section 340, cybersecurity oversight. I appreciate Senator Feinstein's support for these improvements.  The intelligence authorization bill includes several reporting requirements that involve areas of long-standing interest and jurisdiction of the Judiciary Committee. The amended bill ensures that the Judiciary Committee is a recipient of those reports. Section 336 of the bill directs the Director of National Intelligence to provide a comprehensive report on all measures taken by the Office of the Director of National Intelligence and by elements of the intelligence community to comply with the provisions of applicable law, international obligations, and executive orders relating to the detention or interrogation activities of the intelligence community. These include compliance with the Detainee Treatment Act of 2005; the Military Commissions Act of 2006; common Article 3 of the Geneva Conventions; the Convention Against Torture; Executive Order 13492, relating to lawful interrogations; and Executive Order No. 13493, relating to detention policy options.  The amendment to the intelligence authorization bill modifies section 336 to ensure that to the extent that the report addresses an element of the intelligence community within the Department of Justice, it shall be submitted, along with associated material, to the Judiciary Committees of the House and Senate.  I fought for years to obtain information about the Bush administration's detention and interrogation policies and practices, and the legal advice from that administration authorizing those policies and practices. The last administration refused to give this information to Congress, instead issuing secret legal advice that misconstrued our laws and international obligations with regard to the treatment of people in our custody. Years later we found out that the administration had sanctioned cruel interrogation techniques, including torture. It is imperative that the Judiciary Committee be fully informed of the extent to which the government is complying with our laws and international treaties relating to detention and interrogation in order to be able to conduct proper oversight and ensure that our government cannot shield policies that authorize practices in violation of our laws. The Judiciary Committee is an important partner in this oversight.  Section 407 of the bill establishes a new office of inspector general of the intelligence community to conduct independent investigations, inspections, audits and reviews on programs and activities conducted under the authority of the Director of National Intelligence. Under this new authority, the inspector general is required to submit a semiannual report to the Director of National Intelligence summarizing its activities. The amendment incorporated into S.1494 modifies the reporting provision to require the inspector general to submit reports that focus on Government officials to the committees of the Senate and the House of Representatives with jurisdiction over the department that official represents.  Section 407 of the bill creates an entirely new inspector general with significant authority and responsibility in the intelligence community. That authority will implicate agencies within the jurisdiction of the Judiciary Committee, including the Department of Justice and components of the Department of Homeland Security. I believe this modification to the bill provides an important recognition of the Judiciary Committee's need to be involved in the investigations and activities of this new inspector general.  Another significant new provision is section 445 of the bill, report and assessment on transformation of the intelligence capabilities of the Federal Bureau of Investigation, which creates a broad new reporting requirement for the FBI. The Judiciary Committee has always had primary oversight over the FBI. As the FBI takes on more responsibility in the areas of intelligence and national security, its policies and practices in these areas must be subject to the oversight of Congress. The Intelligence Committees have particular expertise that make them an important partner in this oversight. However, it is the Judiciary Committee that has the primary legislative and oversight responsibilities over the FBI.  I am very pleased that the amendment adopted today contains severalimportant improvements that I recommended to strengthen FOIA. I am particularly pleased that the bill, as amended, deletes a broad and unnecessary exemption to FOIA's disclosure requirements for terrorist identity information.  No one would quibble with the notion that our government can--and should--keep some information secret to protect our national security. But, in the case of terrorist identity information, our government has successfully withheld this sensitive information under the existing FOIA exemptions for classified and law enforcement information. In addition, the many instances of mistaken identities and other errors on terrorist watchlists and ``no-fly'' lists make it clear that FOIA can be a valuable tool to help innocent Americans redress and correct mistakes on these lists.  Lastly, the revised bill also narrows the exemption to FOIA's search requirements for operational files information that the Nation's intelligence agencies share with the ODNI. The bill now makes it clear that operational files that are already exempt from these search requirements retain this exemption under circumstances where the files are disseminated to the ODNI. This carefully crafted compromise will help ensure both effective information sharing among our intelligence agencies and the free flow of information to the American public.  I believe the amendment strengthens this legislation by recognizing the value and significance of the shared jurisdiction in many areas of national security between the Judiciary and Intelligence Committees. I appreciate Senator Feinstein's cooperation in adopting these improvements. In a letter sent to me today, Senator Feinstein has also committed to continuing to work with the Judiciary Committee in the area of cyber matters. I will ask to have her letter printed in the Record.  The agreement to proceed with the intelligence authorization bill today includes a commitment to ensure that the Judiciary Committee receives reports required by the bill's section 340, cybersecurity oversight. The Judiciary Committee has long engaged in oversight and legislative activity regarding cyber threats and cybersecurity. Senator Feinstein and I have worked together in the Judiciary Committee for many years on these issues, and we both recognize the shared jurisdiction and responsibilities of the Judiciary and Intelligence Committees with regard to oversight of cyber matters and cybersecurity.  As Senator Feinstein has described it, section 340 of the bill is intended to provide a preliminary framework for executive and congressional oversight of cybersecurity programs, as defined in the section, to ensure that these programs are consistent with legal authorities, preserve reasonable expectations of privacy, and are subject to independent audit and review. Section 340 of the bill creates several reporting requirements with regard to the executive and congressional oversight of cybersecurity programs. These include Presidential notifications to Congress, reports to Congress and the President from the head of a department or agency with responsibility for cybersecurity programs, in conjunction with the inspector general of that department or agency, and a joint report to Congress and the President from the inspector general of the Department of Homeland Security and the inspector general of the intelligence community on the status of the sharing of cyber threat information within one year. I look forward to continuing to work with Senator Feinstein in the Judiciary Committee and in the Senate to ensure strong oversight and legislation with regard to cyber matters.  I am pleased the Senate today will pass the amended Intelligence Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2010. The progress that Senator Feinstein and I have made to improve this bill demonstrates the success we can have when we work together constructively.  Mr. President. I ask unanimous consent to have the letter to which I referred printed in the Record.  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in the Record, as follows:                                                      U.S. Senate,                             Select Committee on Intelligence,                               Washington, DC, September 15, 2009.     Hon. Patrick Leahy,     Chairman, Committee on the Judiciary,     Washington, DC.       Dear Chairman Leahy: As you know, our staffs have been in      discussions since the beginning of recess over various      provisions of S. 1494, the Intelligence Authorization Act for      Fiscal Year 2010, ordered reported from the Committee on July      22, 2009. Among the provisions at issue is Section 340,      Cybersecurity Oversight.       Section 340 is intended to provide a preliminary framework      for executive and congressional oversight of cybersecurity      programs, as defined in the section, to ensure that these      programs are consistent with legal authorities, preserve      reasonable expectations of privacy, and are subject to      independent audit and review.       Section 340 contains several reporting requirements. One      requires the President to provide certain notifications to      Congress. In addition, the head of a department or agency      with responsibility for cybersecurity programs, in      conjunction with the inspector general of that department or      agency, is to submit to Congress and the President periodic      reports on the program. Finally, the Inspector General of the      Department of Homeland Security and the Inspector General of      the Intelligence Community are jointly to submit a report to      Congress and the President on the status of the sharing of      cyber threat information within one year.       Under the provision as reported, notifications and reports      under the section are to be submitted ``to the Congress.''      Vice Chairman Bond and I have consulted with the Senate      parliamentarian to convey our recommendations for how      referrals of notifications and reports under the section      should be made.       As we have discussed before, cybersecurity is a matter of      interest to many of the committees of the Senate. Of note is      the longstanding interest in, and jurisdiction over, cyber      matters by the Judiciary Committee. This includes but is not      necessarily limited to the cybersecurity of the Justice      Department and other departments and agencies under the      Committee's jurisdiction, privacy interests of the American      people, and legal dimensions of the government's cyber      activities. Given the Judiciary Committee's role in these      matters and the expectation that reports under Section 340      will touch on one or more of the Committee's areas of      jurisdiction, it is my strong belief that documents provided      to the Congress should be provided to the Judiciary      Committee.       In addition, should the Intelligence Committee receive      reports under this section that are within the jurisdiction      of the Judiciary Committee but that are not provided to the      Judiciary Committee, I will ensure that access to those      reports is provided to Judiciary Committee members and staff      as appropriate.       Thank you for your cooperation over this issue, and other      provisions of the intelligence legislation.           Sincerely,                                                 Dianne Feinstein,                                                         Chairman.
