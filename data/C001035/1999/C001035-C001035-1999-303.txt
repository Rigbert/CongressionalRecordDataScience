Let me give you a little background.  The needs of the homeless population in Maine have increased in recent years. Often when we think of the homeless, we think of large cities. In fact, there are homeless people throughout this Nation, including in rural States such as Maine.  From 1993 to 1996, Maine's homeless population grew by almost 20 percent. It is estimated that more than 14,000 people are homeless in my home State today. Despite this great and growing need, however, the Department of Housing and Urban Development denied both the applications from the State of Maine for continuum of care funding last year. In effect, the HUD competitive homeless assistance funding distributed to the State of Maine went from $3.7 million to zero. You can imagine the impact on my State.  Moreover, we were stunned by HUD's decision because Secretary Cuomo, in 1998, had awarded Maine's programs with the HUD ``best practices'' awards of excellence.  A vigorous public campaign by people in Maine and repeated efforts by the congressional delegation ultimately compelled HUD to provide $1 million to the city of Portland to renew certain projects. This money, though welcomed, was far from sufficient to allow the State to meet the needs of its homeless population.  That is the experience I wanted to share with the Senator from Missouri and the Senator from Maryland.
