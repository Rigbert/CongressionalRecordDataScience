 The truth is, it was not necessary, but I would like to give the explanation why it was included, and the majority can speak even more clearly to it.  The concern on the part of the majority was that the Clinton administration would use the Biden-Byrd language to justify sending a modification of a treaty for a two-House approval by majority vote rather than to the Senate for a supermajority vote when, in fact, it was a modification that constituted an amendment to the treaty.  You never intended it for that purpose; I never intended it for that purpose. The concern was, I think it is fair to say on the part of the majority, that the Clinton administration might have attempted to read it to allow them to avoid submission to the Senate for a supermajority vote under the Constitution and just go to each House for a majority vote.
