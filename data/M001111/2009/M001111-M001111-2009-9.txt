  Tomas Villanueva has been a farmworkers, warehouse packers, and other economically disadvantaged laborers advocate since the early 1960s. Tomas was one of the first people involved in the United Farmworkers Union in my home State and has fought for years to ensure that workers are treated with dignity, respect, and under the protections of the law.  Tomas' involvement with the human rights movement began in the early 1960s when he was inspired by UFW leader Cesar Chavez. And since that time, Tomas has fought for numerous causes and people while maintaining his reputation as a kind, generous, compassionate and humble leader.  Tomas has also been a close friend and partner of mine for a very long time. He has helped my staff and I recognize the depth of the difficult conditions that farmworkers face, and has been a consistent voice in fighting to improve conditions through the legislative process.  Farmworker housing is a moral issue, an economic issue, and a family issue. Too many workers and their families face very difficult living conditions. Some live in their cars. Others share run-down, overcrowded rooms with other families. These are not the kinds of living conditions we can tolerate in the United States in the 21st century. They are certainly not suitable for the people who help put food on our tables and who keep our State's economy strong. Tomas knows that we can and must do better.  Tomas Villanueva was 14 when his family emigrated from Mexico. After following the crops for three years, the family settled in Toppenish, Washington in 1958. Tomas spent the next several years working various jobs before earning a high school GED and enrolling in Yakima Valley College.  Hearing about Caesar Chavez's United Farm Workers movement, Tomas travelled to California in 1967 to learn about organizing. Returning to the Yakima Valley, he helped found the United Farm Worker Cooperative, one of the very first Chicano organizations in the State of Washington.  From 1967 to 1974, Tomas devoted himself to farm worker organizing and Chicano movement activism. Out of these efforts came the Yakima Valley Farmworkers Clinic, the United Farm Workers Service Center, a wave of hop harvest strikes in 1969, 1970, 1971, and a successful grape boycott.  In 1974, Tomas started a construction company with his father and brothers, but in the 1980s he was back in the union movement. In 1986 he became the first president of the newly formed United Farm Workers of Washington State. Today he lives in Toppenish and remains active in State and local politics.  Tomas Villanueva continues to be a valued friend, hard-working partner, and widely-respected leader in his community. I am so pleased to recognize his lifetime of achievements on this special day.                          ____________________
