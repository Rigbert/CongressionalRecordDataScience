 I speak on her behalf as well. Agriculture is in crisis. We have a $34 billion industry. Labor is down by as much as 30 percent. What is happening is farmers are renting land in Mexico. They don't want us to know that. It is difficult to get these figures, but we got them, and this is what is happening. Now, what will happen to the land in California, Idaho, Washington, and in other places? It will lie fallow. Farmers will soon decide they would rather farm in Mexico, with fewer restrictions on pesticides and lower phytosanitary standards. Their land will be sold for development and we will lose our farmland in this Nation.  The catastrophe, the crisis, is now. The harvest system is coming up now. What Senator Boxer, Senator Craig, and many others ask is please pass this 5-year pilot program and enable people who have worked in agriculture, who will continue to work in agriculture, to be able to do so legally. Reform the H2-A program so it functions for the rest of us.  The fact of the matter is, 90 percent of agriculture is undocumented labor. Why doesn't the Senate recognize that? Why doesn't the Senate recognize you cannot get Americans to do this work?  Why do we want to drown American agriculture? Why do we want to send it over the border?  What Senator Craig, Senator Boxer, and I are saying is, with this money, you take away our leverage to get this bill done, unless we can have some kind of commitment that we can do this bill as a stand-alone bill or move it on another bill. We ought to just face that right now, that Senator Craig and I would like to have a commitment that we can put this bill on another bill, or move it as a stand-alone bill without amendments, and hopefully get it passed so agriculture in America can harvest their crops this fall. We ought to have a discussion because this money we all would like to do, no question about it. We all want border security. We all want to fund border security.  (
