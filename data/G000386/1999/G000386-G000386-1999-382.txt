 President, if there is no further business to come before the Senate, I now ask unanimous consent that the Senate stand in adjournment under the previous order.  There being no objection, the Senate, at 6:28 p.m., adjourned until Thursday, June 24, 1999, at 9:30 a.m.                          ____________________
