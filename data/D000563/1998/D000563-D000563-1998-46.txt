It pains me to believe we would have a difference of opinion, but those things do occur. I am certain the Senator as majority leader did his constitutional responsibility--there has never been a doubt about that--and also acted with dispatch in a timely manner.  I think the Senator makes a good point. We not only want to protect the clear constitutional responsibility and right of the Senate in this process, we want to bring the best men and women forward to continue serving our Government, and we want it all done in a timely fashion. My concern with this bill is it addresses one side of the equation. It says to the executive branch, you have to move in a more timely fashion to bring these men and women to the Senate for consideration. If we are clearly looking for filling vacancies in a timely fashion, that is only half the process. Once the nomination is brought to the Senate, we should move in a timely fashion, too. Otherwise, using the old reference to equity, we don't come to this argument with clean hands, and that is why I think there should be some symmetry here in the requirement of the executive as well as the legislative branch.
