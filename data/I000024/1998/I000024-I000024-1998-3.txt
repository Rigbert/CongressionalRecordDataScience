President, I, too, rise in support of S. 1194, the Medicare Beneficiaries Freedom to Contract Act.  You and I, Mr. President, and all other Americans not covered under Medicare, may obtain health services without informing the federal government. However, our nation's senior citizens must first seek out Washington's approval--even when they prefer to pay for those services out of their own pocket.  Congress intended to correct this situation by permitting private contracts. Unfortunately, the President insisted he would veto the entire 1997 Balanced Budget Act unless this fundamental right of all Americans was eliminated or severely limited for senior citizens.  Medicare beneficiaries should have the same freedom to obtain the health care they choose from the physician or provider of their choice--as do Members of Congress and virtually all other Americans. It's ridiculous that this right was taken away and unfortunate that it's taken so long to correct.  Mr. President, I thank the majority leader, Senator Lott, and Senate Finance Committee Chairman Roth for acknowledging the importance of this issue and for pledging to look into it further next year in the 106th Congress.
