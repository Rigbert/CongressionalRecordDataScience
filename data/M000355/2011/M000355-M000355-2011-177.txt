 I see no reason why we shouldn't advance that to now so it can be clear whether this measure would pass the Senate. I am pretty confident it will not, and I don't see any purpose to be served by delaying the outcome of that, making the outcome clear on Monday when we could have a clear outcome today; therefore, I object.
