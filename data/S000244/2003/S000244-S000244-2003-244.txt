Speaker, I yield myself 6 minutes.  Mr. Speaker, H.R. 760, the Partial-Birth Abortion Ban Act of 2003, would prohibit the gruesome and inhumane procedure of partial-birth abortion that, unfortunately, we are all too familiar with. An abortionist who violates this ban would be subject to fines, a maximum of 2 years' imprisonment, or both. The bill includes an exception for those situations in which a partial-birth abortion is deemed necessary to save the life of the mother. An identical bill, H.R. 4965, was approved by this Chamber last summer by a 274-151 vote, but the then-Democratic leadership in the other body chose not to bring it up for a vote.  A moral, medical, and ethical consensus exists that partial-birth abortion is an unsafe and inhumane procedure that is never medically necessary and should be prohibited. Contrary to the claims of advocates of this gruesome procedure, the procedure remains an untested, unproven, and potentially dangerous procedure that has never been embraced by the medical profession. Unfortunately, two Federal bans that were passed by prior Republican Congresses and sent to President Clinton's desk were promptly vetoed.  In June 2000, the United States Supreme Court struck down Nebraska's partial-birth abortion ban, which was similar, but not identical, to bans previously passed by Congress. The Court concluded that Nebraska's ban did not clearly distinguish the prohibited procedure from the other more commonly performed second trimester abortion procedures. The Court also held, on the basis of highly disputed factual findings of the district court, that the law was required to include an exception for partial-birth abortions deemed necessary to preserve the health of a woman.  H.R. 760's new definition of partial-birth abortion addresses the Court's first concern by clearly and unambiguously defining the prohibited procedure. The bill also addresses the Court's second objection to the Nebraska law by including extensive congressional findings based upon medical evidence received in a series of legislative hearings, that, contrary to the factual findings of the district court in Stenberg, a partial-birth abortion is never medically necessary to preserve a woman's health, poses serious risk to a woman's health, and in fact is below the requisite standard of medical care.  H.R. 760's lack of a health exception is based upon Congress's factual determination that partial-birth abortion is a dangerous procedure that does not serve the health of any woman. The Supreme Court has a long history, particularly in the area of civil rights, of deferring to Congress's factual conclusions. In doing so, the Court has recognized that Congress's institutional structure makes it better suited than the judiciary to assess facts upon which it will make policy determinations.  As Justice Rehnquist has stated, the Court must be, ``particularly careful not to substitute its judgment of what is desirable for that of Congress, or its own evaluation of evidence for a reasonable evaluation by the legislative branch.'' Thus in Katzenback v. Morgan, while addressing section 4(e) of the Voting Rights Act of 1965, the Court deferred to Congress's factual determination that section 4(e) would assist the Puerto Rican community in ``gaining nondiscriminatory treatment in public services,'' stating: ``It is not for us to review the congressional resolution'' of the various issues it had before it to consider. Rather, ``It is enough that we are able to perceive a basis upon which the Congress might resolve the conflict as it did.''  Similarly in Fullilove v. Klutznick, when reviewing the minority business enterprise provision of the Public Works Employment Act of 1977, the Court repeatedly cited and deferred to the legislative record and factual conclusions of Congress to uphold the provisions as an appropriate exercise of congressional authority.                              {time}  1730  In addition to the health risks to women who undergo the partial-birth abortion procedure, it is particularly brutal and inhumane to the nearly born infant as virtually all the infants upon whom this procedure is performed are alive and feel excruciating pain. Furthermore, a child upon whom a partial-birth abortion is being performed will not be significantly affected by medication administered to the mother during the performance of the procedure.  As credible testimony received by the Subcommittee on the Constitution confirms, ``Current methods for providing maternal anesthesia during partial-birth abortions are unlikely to prevent the experience of pain and stress'' that the child will feel during the procedure. Thus, claims that a child is almost certain to be either dead or unconscious and near death prior to the commencement of the partial-birth abortion are unsubstantiated.  H.R. 760 enjoys overwhelming support from members of both parties precisely because of the barbaric nature of this procedure and the dangers it poses to women who undergo it. Additionally, the American Medical Association has recognized that partial-birth abortions are ``ethically different from other destructive abortion techniques because the fetus, normally 20 weeks or longer in gestation, is killed out of the womb.'' Thus, the ``partial birth'' gives the fetus an autonomy which separates it from the right of the woman to choose treatments for her own body.  Implicitly approving such a brutal and inhumane procedure by choosing not to prohibit it will further coarsen society to the humanity of not only newborns but all vulnerable and innocent human life. Thus, Congress has a compelling interest in acting, indeed it must, to prohibit this inhumane procedure.  Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.
