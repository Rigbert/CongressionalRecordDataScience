Chairman, I wish to explain my priorities as we debate the budget resolution for FY 2000.  I am a cosponsor of a Constitutional Amendment to Balance the Budget and have introduced budget enforcement legislation in the past. As such, I am pleased that we balanced the nation's budget in FY 1998. However, we should not be complacent.  Before we talk of new spending or new tax cuts, we should keep our eye on one goal, and that is maintaining a balanced budget: a balanced budget for our current fiscal year and for FY 2000. Moreover, we should recognize that trust fund surpluses from Social Security, Medicare, the Highway Trust Fund and other federal trust funds totaled $150 billion last year and masked our true situation by making our budgetary position appear more favorable than it really was. Hence, I feel our second priority should be to really balance the budget without the use of any trust fund surpluses.
