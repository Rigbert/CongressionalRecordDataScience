 I would like to note that there is some promising news from Ireland. The International Independent Commission on Decommissioning, led by GEN John de Chastelain, of Canada, has announced that the IRA has begun to decommission its weapons. The Irish Taoiseach, Bertie Ahern, has appropriately called this an ``unparalleled breakthrough.'' David Trimble, with whom I talked here in Washington a few days ago, has said he will recommend to the Ulster Unionist Council that the party reenter the Northern Ireland Executive.  I commend Gerry Adams and Martin McGuinness from Sinn Fein for their efforts to take this important step. I have been one who has been critical of the IRA taking so long to begin to decommission its weapons.  There are justifiable and long-held grievances on both the Protestant and Catholic sides in Northern Ireland, and there are generations who will never completely forgive or forget. But for the sake of the children in Ireland, both in the Republic of Ireland and Northern Ireland, they must move forward, and this is a critical step. Peace will not be won by assassinations or guns and bullets, whether done by Protestants or by Catholics. Peace will only come about if children are allowed to grow up in peace so we will not have scenes such as we saw just in the opening of school this year of little children, 7- and 8-year-old girls and boys, running terrified past a mob, screaming at them because all they wanted to do was go to school. That cannot continue.  I ask unanimous consent that a number of news items be printed in the Record.  There being no objection, the material ordered to be printed in the Record, as follows:                 [From the Irish Times, Oct. 23, 2001]         De Chastelain Says IRA Has Begun Decommissioning Arms                           (By Patrick Logue)       The International Independent Commission on      Decommissioning, led by General John de Chastelain, has said      it has witnessed the IRA begin to decommission its arsenal of      weapons, including guns, ammunition and explosives.       ``We are satisfied the arms in question have been dealt      with in accordance with the scheme and regulations. We are      also satisfied it would not further the process of putting      all arms beyond use were we to provide further details of      this event.''       ``We will continue our contact with the IRA representative      in the pursuit of our mandate.'' This afternoon the IRA said      in a statement that it had begun the process.       In a statement the IRA said its motivation behind the move      on weapons was ``to save the peace process''.       * * * says: ``The political process is now on the point of      collapse. Such a collapse would certainly, and eventually,      put the overall peace process in jeopardy.       ``There is a responsibility upon everyone seriously      committed to a just peace to do our best to avoid this.       ``Therefore, in order to save the peace process, we have      implemented the scheme agreed with the IICD in August.       ``Our motivation is clear. This unprecedented move is to      save the peace process and to persuade others of our genuine      intentions''.       In August the IICD said in a statement it had agreed a      method for putting arms ``completely and verifiably beyond      use''. Details of the method were not made public however.       The move comes in response to a call yesterday by the Sinn      Fein president Mr. Gerry Adams for a ``ground-breaking''      gesture to save the peace process.       Speaking in West Belfast last night Mr. Adams said: ``We      have put to the IRA the view that if it could make a ground-     breaking move on the arms issue that this could save the      peace process from collapse and transform the situation''.       Sinn Fein this evening welcomed the IRA statement saying it      was a courageous initiative to save the peace process''.                        ira's estimated arsenal       650 AK47/AKM assault rifles;       36 Armalite AR-15 assault rifles;       2 Barret M82A1 sniper rifles;       60 Webley .455 revolvers;       20 12.7 107mm DshK heavy machine guns;       12 7.62mm FN MAG machine guns;       6 LPO-50 flamethrowers;       1 SAM-7 surface-to-air missile;       600 bomb detonators;       3 tons of Semtex plastic explosives                                  ____                 [From the Irish Times, Oct. 23, 2001]                Trimble Hints UUP Will Reenter Executive                           (By Kilian Doyle)       The leader of the Ulster Unionists Mr. David Trimble said      tonight he would recommend to his party that they reenter the      Northern Ireland executive following IRA weapons      decommissioning.       Mr. Trimble was speaking after a meeting with the head of      international decommissioning body, General John de      Chastelain, where he said he was told the IRA had begun to      put its arms beyond use.       ``This is the day we were told would never happen'', he      said. Mr. Trimble said he would attend of meeting of the      Ulster Unionists Council later this week, and he would be      recommending that they re-enter the Northern Ireland      Executive.       UUP ministers could be back in their offices in Stormont as      early as next week, Mr. Trimble said.                                  ____                 [From the Irish Times, Oct. 23, 2001]                Ahern Hails `Unparalleled Breakthrough'                           (By Kilian Doyle)       The Taoiseach, Mr. Bertie Ahern, said the IRA statement was      an ``unparalleled breakthrough'' that was of ``profound      importance'' to the peace process.       He said the IRA had now done enough to satisfy General de      Chastelain, but there was still an ``enormous'' amount of      work remaining to be done.       Mr. Ahern paid tribute to the leaders of the IRA, who he      said had made a brave and difficult decision in agreeing to      decommission.       The Minister for Foreign Affairs, Mr. Brian Cowen, said the      statements from the IRA and the International Commission on      decommissioning heralded a new era in the history of Ireland.       ``That is a moment for political leaders to be responsive      and generous. The reaction to decommissioning will be as      important as decommissioning itself,'' he said.       ``It is imperative that politics is made to work and that      the nightmarish scenes like those from north Belfast are      consigned forever to the pages of history.''       ``We must harness the new energy that has been released by      today's developments and begin a new, dynamic era on this      island at all levels, based on partnership, equality and      mutual respect.       ``We simply cannot afford to let this opportunity slip.''       Mr. Michael Noonan, the leader of Fine Gael, said he      believed decommissioning had ``already occurred'' and that      General de Chastelain would be confirming that ``before too      long''.       ``What we had was the Good Friday Agreement, there is an      opportunity now to make it the Good Friday Settlement.       ``Now that [decommissioning] has happened, it seems to me      that there is no difference in principal between putting some      arms beyond use and putting all arms beyond use.''       Mr. Ruairi Quinn, the leader of the Labour Party, said we      are now witnessing events of ``historic proportions.''       He said all parties must now intensify efforts to overcome      the ``distrust and sectarianism that has bedevilled Northern      Ireland for so long.''       There is a particular obligation on the loyalist      paramilitaries to honour the statements made that they would      follow suit if the IRA started decommissioning.
