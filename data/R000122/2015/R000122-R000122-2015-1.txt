President, today I am pleased to be introducing the Cybersecurity Disclosure Act of 2015 with Senator Collins. In response to data breaches by various companies, which exposed the personal information of millions of customers, this bill asks each publicly traded company to include, in Securities and Exchange Commission, SEC, disclosures to investors, information on whether any member of the Board of Directors is a cybersecurity expert, and if not, why having this expertise on the Board of Directors is not necessary because of other cybersecurity steps taken by the publicly traded company. The legislation does not require companies to take any actions other than to provide this disclosure to its investors.  Many investors may be surprised to learn that board directors who participated in National Association of Corporate Directors roundtable discussions on cybersecurity late in 2013 admitted that ``the lack of adequate knowledge of information technology risk has made it challenging for them to `effectively oversee management's cybersecurity activities.' Participating board members also suggested that `without sound knowledge of--or adequate sensitivity to--the topic, directors cannot easily draw the line between oversight and management,' and that once in the technical `weeds,' directors `find it difficult to assess the appropriate level of [the board's] involvement in risk management.' ''  Investors and customers deserve a clear understanding of whether publicly traded companies are not only prioritizing cybersecurity, but also have the capacity to protect investors and customers from cyber related attacks. This bill aims to provide a better understanding of these issues through improved SEC disclosure.  While this legislation is a matter for consideration by the Banking Committee, of which I am a member, this bill is also informed by my service on the Armed Services Committee. It is through this dual Banking-Armed Services perspective that I see that our economic security is indeed a matter of our national security, and this is particularly the case as our economy becomes increasingly reliant on technology and the Internet.  For example, James Clapper, Director of National Intelligence, recently appeared before the Armed Services Committee on September 29, 2015, and testified that ``cyber threats to the U.S. national and economic security are increasing in frequency, scale, sophistication and severity of impact.'' He further said that ``[b]ecause of our heavy dependence on the Internet, nearly all information communication technologies and I.T. networks and systems will be perpetually at risk.''  With mounting cyber threats and concerns over the capabilities of corporate directors, we all need to be more proactive in ensuring our Nation's cybersecurity before there are additional serious breaches. This legislation seeks to take one step towards that goal by encouraging publicly traded companies to be more transparent to its investors and customers on whether and how their Boards of Directors are prioritizing cybersecurity.  I thank Harvard Law School Professor John Coates, MIT Professor Simon Johnson, Columbia Law School Professor John Coffee, and the Consumer Federation of America for their support, and I urge my colleagues to join Senator Collins and me in supporting this legislation.                                 ______                                       By
