This bill, authored by Senator Elizabeth Warren of Massachusetts, would allow students to refinance their college debt down to today's interest levels--3.8 percent, if I am not mistaken, for undergraduate loans--which would make paying back their loans easier and sooner, and we have to go through a procedure of waiting 2 days in the Senate to even start talking and debating on the bill. Is that what the Senator is telling us?
