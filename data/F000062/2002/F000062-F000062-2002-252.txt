 President, over the past few days and weeks the drumbeat for war against Iraq has been rising in both volume and tempo. I rise today to express my concern, and to urge President Bush to proceed with care and prudence.  At a minimum: the United States must first exhaust every diplomatic solution that might avoid war, with war seen as a last resort; the United States must assure sufficient international support, similar to the coalition that made the Gulf War viable; and, the administration must fully consult with Congress, which has a significant constitutional obligation in this matter, and receive proper authorization.  Let me be clear: There is little question that Iraq poses a grave risk to the United States and our friends and allies. How to deal with Iraq remains, as it has for over a decade, one of the top foreign policy priorities for the United States.  At this point we can not and should not lose sight of the fact that we still have considerable work to do in Afghanistan. Rushing precipitously towards another military confrontation, unless the need is imminent, would not be prudent.  We are all aware of the nature of the threat: Iraq under Saddam Hussein seeks to develop WMD, has used these weapons against its own people, has invaded its neighbors and threatened others in the region with its missiles.  And we are all well aware that Iraq, having agreed to United Nations inspectors after its defeat in the Gulf War a decade ago, banned them in 1998. For 4 years the international community has had no access to Iraq and no ability to inspect its weapons facilities.  The administration believes Iraq is continuing to develop chemical and biological weapons, and is seeking nuclear weapons. As a member of the Intelligence Committee I believe that the administration is correct in this assessment.  And the administration has argued that Iraq's weapons of mass destruction must be dismantled before President Saddam Hussein forms an alliance with Al Qaeda or other terrorist groups.  It is critical, therefore, that the United States, through the United Nations, seek additional inspections, under a ``go anywhere, anytime'' inspection regime, to provide Iraq with the opportunity, one last time, to either work with the international community on this issue or, by its refusal, admit guilt and face the consequences.  I also believe that it is critical that, should an imminent threat require U.S. action, that the Administration come to Congress to seek its judgment and assent.  The resolution authorizing the use of force against the September 11 attackers provides the President authority to take military action only against those groups, individuals, or nations who aided in the September 11 attacks, or harbored those involved.  It states: ``The President is authorized to use all necessary and appropriate force against those nations, organizations, or persons he determines planned, authorized, committed, or aided the terrorist attacks that occurred on September 11, 2001, or harbored such organizations or persons, in order to prevent any future acts of international terrorism against the United States by such nations, organizations, or persons.''  On its face, then, this resolution is both narrow and specific, in that it applies only to the September 11 attacks.  In order to take action against Iraq under this resolution, the President must determine both that Iraq has harbored any Al Qaeda members, or anyone else who aided in the September 11 attacks, and that such an attack would ``prevent any future acts of international terrorism,'' as also required by the resolution.  On the other hand, if the President attacks Iraq simply to destroy its weapons of mass destruction, which may be a justified action under certain circumstances, this resolution does not provide the authority for such an attack. Iraq's WMD program, if not directly linked to the September 11 attacks, is a separate issue not covered by the September resolution.  In such a circumstance the President would need to, must, seek an additional authorizing resolution from Congress.  I was pleased to see that Secretary of State Powell has indicated President Bush will fully consult with Congress before any military action is taken against Iraq.  It is imperative that we comply with the provisions of the War Powers Resolution, a joint legislative act that will ensure: ``The collective judgment of both Congress and the President will apply to the introduction of United States armed forces into hostilities.''  Given the gravity of placing potentially large numbers of America's forces in harm's way, I think anything less than such a ``collective judgment'' would tarnish the sacred trust our people have in their government.  As our colleague Senator Byrd wrote in The New York Times earlier this week: ``The Constitution states that the President shall be commander in chief, but it is Congress that has the constitutional authority to provide for the common defense and general welfare, raise armies, and to declare war. In other words, Congress has a constitutional responsibility to weigh in on war-related policy decisions.''  The challenges in taking action against Iraq underscore the need for the United States to work with our friends and allies in the region and elsewhere if we are to take effective action against Iraq.  The administration has made great strides in creating as wide an international coalition as possible for action against terror and terrorists, it must do likewise for any action against Iraq.  In contemplating any such action against Iraq, we must consult with allies and build the kind of coalition that supported our efforts in the Gulf War, especially those countries whose peoples and governments are bound to be affected by such an undertaking.  We should not take action against Iraq until both we, the American people and our regional partners, are convinced of the reasons for so doing and that there is a clear mission and goal in mind.  The United States must also consider carefully the consequences of precipitous action.  Can we assure our regional partners that our actions will not involve the de-stabilization of the region?  Might unilateral unsupported action against Iraq result in attacks against close allies such as Israel or protests against regional leaders in Egypt, Saudi Arabia or Jordan?  Following any military action, are we prepared militarily and financially to remain in the region until Saddam is removed, the people of Iraq are free, and a viable democratic government is in place?  These are complex questions to which there may be no easy answers. But they are questions that must be addressed before we take any action if those actions are to be successful and the results, enduring.  If this matter is not handled properly, there is a profound risk that the Middle East will be further destabilized, and place U.S. interests in the region and in the war against terrorism in jeopardy.  None of us has the wisdom or foresight to see where this war will lead us, how long it will last, or when it will end.  But we are all foursquare in our determination that we, and all civilized peoples, succeed.  I offer my thoughts and comments today not as a criticism of the administration, but rather because I feel that we have a deep obligation to make sure that as we proceed with this endeavor we do so with thoughtfulness, not afraid to ask the tough questions that must be asked or address the issues that must be addressed, and with the unity of purpose that will guarantee our success.                          ____________________
