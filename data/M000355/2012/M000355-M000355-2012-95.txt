S. Embassy in Cairo and the U.S. Consulate in Benghazi, Libya. In Benghazi, our Ambassador Chris Stevens and three other Americans were killed in the service of our Nation. Our thoughts and sympathies today are with the families of these brave Americans.  These attacks remind us of the sacrifices made on a daily basis by foreign service officers, diplomatic security personnel, and our marine security guards. I join my colleagues in strongly condemning the murder of these innocent Americans, and I support employing every available tool at our disposal to ensure the safety of Americans overseas and to hunt down those responsible for these attacks.  Yesterday we commemorated the anniversary of the attacks of September 11, and today we are reminded that brave Americans serve us every day at the risk of their own lives. We honor the Americans we lost in Libya and we will stand united in our response.  Among the things we can agree on in Washington is that the attacks on the United States and its representatives will be met with resolve and that America's presence and defense of our national interests across the globe will not be deterred by the acts of violent extremists.  I yield the floor.                          ____________________
