m, hopefully, will be the same vote. It is a vote to oppose cloture, even though we are toward the end of this bill. The reason is, we have not been able to figure out which of our amendments will be shut out by the invocation of cloture. I urge my Republican colleagues to, once again, vote no on cloture, while at the same time saying I think we are very close to wrapping up this bill, as the Senator from Connecticut and I have previously outlined tonight.
