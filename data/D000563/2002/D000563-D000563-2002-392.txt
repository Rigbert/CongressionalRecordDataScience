President, I ask to be recognized for 2 minutes, and then yield 1 minute to Senator Levin from Michigan.  Mr. President, I rise in opposition to this amendment. With the last vote, we threw in the towel on fuel efficiency. We said this Congress is incapable of requiring the automobile manufacturers to make a more fuel-efficient car so that America could have energy security and energy independence. We gave up on it. We turned it over to NHTSA and said: Study it, look at it, and we will get back to you.  Now, with this amendment, we are saying we are going to exempt pickup trucks forever and that 20.7 miles a gallon is all we will ever ask of them. We will not ask Detroit to make a pickup truck that is more fuel efficient. And the argument has been made that it is unfair, that it is unpatriotic, that it is impossible to ask the drivers of pickup trucks across America to ask for a more fuel-efficient vehicle--even 1 more mile per gallon.  Let me tell you what is also unfair. It is unfair to ask the men and women in uniform in the United States to risk their lives in a war in the Middle East to fight to preserve more imported fuel to fuel these vehicles on the highways. These hard-working farmers and ranchers and blue-collar men and women who drive these pickup trucks have kids who may be forced to serve in the military to fight a war because of our dependence on Middle East oil.  With the last vote, we bowed down to the special interests on fuel efficiency. And I want to tell you that as a result of it, we are going to continue to bow down to OPEC for decades to come. That is not in the best interests of people who drive cars and pickup trucks in America.
