 President, I rise today to pay tribute to fellow Kentuckian Steve Higdon on his recent success in becoming president and chief executive officer of Greater Louisville, Inc.  Steve Higdon grew up in Hikes Point and graduated from Trinity High School. He received a bachelor's degree in business administration from the University of Kentucky and began work with Yellow Freight Systems in Louisville after college.  Steve made his way to the top of the Louisville business world through hard work and determination. After his work at Yellow Freight Systems, he held several positions of leadership within the United Parcel Service (UPS), including economic development manager. Steve's work at UPS led to his involvement with Greater Louisville, Inc., and to his being hired as executive vice president for economic development and chief operating officer.  Many of Steve's colleagues have noted his extraordinary leadership skills. Steve's co-workers at UPS and colleagues within Greater Louisville, Inc. have all spoken of his drive and ambition, his work ethic and intelligence. From everything I've observed, Steve deserves all of these compliments--and more. He has taken on a huge responsibility in the Louisville community, and his past experience and success is a sign of good things to come for the city, its residents and its workers.  Steve also is involved in efforts to build a better Louisville community. He holds positions on the Workforce Investment Board, Housing Partnership Board, Kentucky Industrial Development Council, Industrial Development Research Council, and the Trinity High School Alumni association. This is further evidence that Steve's commitment to the community goes beyond mere business interests--he genuinely cares about Louisville's children and families.  Steve, on behalf of my colleagues and myself, thank you for your dedicated service to Louisville and to the people of Kentucky. I have every confidence in your ability to lead Greater Louisville, Inc. and its efforts to build great accomplishments and successes in the years to come.  Mr. President, I also ask that an article which ran in the Louisville Courier-Journal on Sunday, January 30, 2000, appear in the record following my remarks.  The article follows:          [From the Louisville Courier-Journal, Jan. 30, 2000]Greater Louisville Grew New Leader From the Inside--Steve Higdon Loves                           To Deal With People                            (By David Goetz)       Steve Higdon, the new man in charge of Louisville's      economic future, speaks the language of development in a      broadcast-quality baritone. He moves seamlessly from      discussions of work-force issues to business retention to the      prospects of city-county merger.       But if you watch him speak as well as listen, you can catch      glimpses in his gestures of the airport baggage handler he      was not too many years ago. He seems to grab his words as he      speaks them bracketing them between his hands or rolling them      up in front of him. Then he hands them to you, or takes them      to heart, or just places them here and there like a man      sorting bundles.       Higdon, 37, is the new president and chief executive      officer of Greater Louisville, Inc., a hometown guy whose      love of long distances shaped a business career in shipping      and distribution that never took him very far from home.       He's not too far removed in years or though from the      college graduate of 1987 who found himself bossing men twice      his age on the loading dock of Yellow Freight Systems at 35th      and Duvall streets in Louisville.       ``It was the most stressful job I've ever had,'' Higdon      recalled last week in his modest new office, a passable view      of Sixth Street over his shoulder, business cards on his desk      still identifying him in his former job as the non-profit      corporation's head of economic development.       ``I was very young and green, there were the hours,      managing Teamsters whose average on the job was 25 to 30      years,'' Higdon continued. ``The productivity goals were      extremely tough.''       He was young and it would have been easy to quit, Higdon      said, but he had already developed a sense of having a career      rather than just a job.       ``I didn't know what the career was, but I knew I would      have to be responsible,'' he said. ``I knew I would have to      work my way through it.''       It was the beginning of a career that eventually placed      Higdon with air carrier UPS and brought him into contact with      the old Greater Louisville Economic Development Partnership.       There he garnered the notice and respect of entrepreneur      Doug Cobb, who had signed on as president of Greater      Louisville Inc., in 1997 when the partnership merged with the      Chamber of Commerce to create a unified front for      Louisville's business-support and economic-development      efforts.       Cobb said he wasn't intentionally grooming a successor when      he hired Higdon to run the development side of Greater      Louisville Inc., in 1997.       ``I called Steve because he had a good idea of what was      going on'' in Louisville, Cobb said. ``But when you find out      what people can do and you ask them to do more, which they do      well, they just naturally grow into leadership.''       Higdon is ``maybe the most impressive executive I've ever      worked with,'' Cobb said. ``He's a great organizer. He knows      how to figure out what needs to be done and get it done. He's      good judge of talent.''       Higdon has ``a lot of the leadership characteristics that      make the difference,'' said LG Energy Corp. executive Steve      Wood, chairman of Greater Louisville, Inc.'s economic      development committee.       ``To be a successful executive, you have to out-work and      out-think the competition, in this case, other jurisdictions      competing for new business,'' Wood said. ``I don't think you      can outwork him. His energy level's extremely high, and he's      as bright as they come.''       Retired banker and civic leader Malcolm Chancey advocated a      broader, national search for Cobb's successor, but he praised      Higdon's energy and talent.       ``If he has the right kind of support, he'll be      successful,'' Chancey said. ``I hope everybody will support      him. I certainly will.''       Higdon grew up one of four kids in a house off Klondike      Lane near Hikes Point. His father was a photoengraver at the      old Standard Gravure printing plant.       The Rev. David Zettel, a counselor at Trinity High School,      remembers Hidgon as bright, gregarious and outgoing. ``He      smiled a lot,'' Zettle said.       Higdon was ``more social than most smart guys.'' and he had      the ability to befriend any group, said friend Tom Scanlon,      now president of ScanSteel Service Center Inc. in      Louisville.       Scanlon remembers exchanging words with students from a      rival school in the parking lot one night after a football      game. Then Higdon walked over to them.       ``What looked like it was going to turn into a fight, 30      minutes later we were sitting on the hood of their car      drinking beer with them,'' Scanlon said. ``He has a look in      his eye and you trust him.''       Higdon started out in accounting at the University of      Kentucky but found marketing more to his taste. ``It was      exciting. It was fun. It was creative,'' he said. ``You got      these marketing problems and there were 30, 40, 50 different      ways to come up with a solution.''       He had never been on a plane before, but on a whim Higdon      left a summer job before his senior year to fly with a co-     worker to Europe. He visited 13 countries on about $4 a day,      he said, and discovered a personal maturity and a love of      travel that have marked his career since.       His first job out of college was as a part-time baggage      handler for Piedmont Airlines in Louisville--not for the $6      an hour, Higdon said, but for the free flights, employees got      if the planes weren't full.       ``I flew 100,000 miles that year. We'd fly out to L.A. for      ladies night at the Red Onion, fly to Miami for the Super      Bowl, all we did was travel--it was so much fun,'' he said.      ``I've worked for an airline most of my life since. Travel is      the spice of life.''       Even the full-time jobs at Yellow Freight and Emery      Worldwide that followed had a touch of the exotic for Higdon.      ``Every piece of freight had a destination or an origin in      cities all over the world,'' he said.       He was a sales manager for the local office of Emery parent      CF Airfreight when UPS won landing rights in Japan and hired      him to run the Louisville office of its new UniStar cargo      company. His charge was finding enough freight customers to      fill the overnight package-delivery jets flying to and from      Japan.       ``I was one of the first people hired to a significant      management position from outside UPS,'' Higdon said. ``In      less than two years this was the most profitable of their 40      offices in the U.S.''       UPS later named Higdon the first marketing manager of its      own air-cargo division and had him create its first air-     passenger charter service.       ``In a real sense I've been like a corporate      entrepreneur,'' Higdon said. ``Every job I've had (with UPS)      was a new job. I never went into a position where I was      replacing somebody.''       Doug Kuelpman, a former boss at UPS, said Higdon      ``understands the business world and what has to be done. He      has a knack.       ``I never had to tell Steve more than once about doing      something, even in areas where he may not have felt well-     equipped going into it. He's the kind of guy who likes to put      his head down and charge.''       In 1995, UPS ``loaned'' Higdon to the development      partnership to help recruit transportation-intensive      businesses. Louisville Mayor Dave Armstrong was county judge-     executive at the time and worked with Higdon in an      unsuccessful attempt to lure a new Harley-Davidson      manufacturing plant to the area.       ``We were out of the picture altogether'' when he and      Higdon went to work on the project, but in the end, ``we were      barely edged out'' by Kansas City, Armstrong said. ``He did a      great job with that.''       Higdon concentrated on a strategy for attracting high-tech      industries and recruited seven computer-repair firms with 700      jobs by the end of 1996.       But while he loved his work, Higdon said, ``there was never      a time I felt this is where I want to be.'' The following      year he went to Cobb for advice on starting his own company.       Instead, Cobb hired Higdon to head the business-attraction      efforts of what had become Greater Louisville Inc.       His first day on the job, Oct. 8, 1997, Higdon told Cobb      that UPS was planning to expand its operations and was      seriously considering Columbus, Ohio, as the site.       That conversation resulted in five months of intensive      negotiations that ended with the announcement that the $1      billion expansion and its 6,000 jobs were ticketed for      Louisville.       As a former UPS insider, Higdon had ``a good sense of what      was going on'' inside the company, Cobb said, and he played      ``a huge role'' in the negotiations' success.       Higdon is credited with helping develop the innovative      Metropolitan College concept that lets UPS package handlers      work their night shifts while attending college.       When Cobb said last fall that he wanted to step down as      president and CEO, the board of directors decided to look      internally for a successor, said Ed Glasscock, chairman of      the board's search committee. The aim was to maintain      momentum and avoid a long adjustment period under a new      executive.       They chose Higdon.       ``It's not fair to characterize it as Doug naming his      successor. We asked Doug for his recommendations,'' Glasscock      said. ``You had a number of independent business people on      the search committee who reviewed the job description and      Steve's background. We felt he matched up, not because Doug      said he was the perfect candidate. We came to that conclusion      independently.''       Choosing a successor internally is not unusual in      corporations, Higdon said, and, under Cobb, Greater      Louisville Inc. adopted the corporate model in its structure      and thinking.       ``That's why we're successful,'' he said. ``The mentality      is we're all running a business here.''       Running a business--his own--is still on Higdon's mind,      though it's been pushed into the indefinite future. He said      he is committed to his new job for at least three years and      that has its rewards.       ``I love dealing with people more than anything,'' he said.      ``Since I was a kid I loved to be out among people.''                          ____________________
