President, as I said a few minutes ago, I agree with Senator Sanders, the author of this amendment, in terms of what is the problem we have. We have to have a transportation reauthorization bill and we are going to have it.  I know Senator Sanders has characterized his bill as being paid for by closing tax loopholes, but I would still say that, in my opinion and my analysis of this, this would equate to nearly a half a trillion dollar tax increase, and this is not the way I want to have a transportation reauthorization bill.  Let me remind my colleagues that there is a reserve fund in Chairman Enzi's budget that serves as a placeholder for Chairman Hatch to address a long-term highway bill later this year. We have a deadline of May 31, and I think we can meet that deadline. We are working with Senator Hatch right now to come up with that plan.  So I urge my colleagues to vote against the Sanders amendment and pursue our bill.
