Speaker, 3 years ago, with a bipartisan group of lawmakers, I met with Vice President Cheney to discuss the then crisis and run-up of electricity prices in the western United States. On a bipartisan basis, Republicans and Democrats, we told the Vice President that we believed the market was being manipulated by Enron and others, and he lectured us and told us that we were out to lunch, that this was nothing but market forces and, in fact, if we did not build a 500 megawatt electric generating plant every week for the next 16 years, prices would stay up at $2,000 or $3,000 a megawatt hour.  Now, of course, the transcripts are now out there from the Enron traders. I cannot read them on the floor because they are absolutely chock full of obscenities, but they carry on about a few things. They carry on about how great it is going to be when the Bush administration goes to the White House, no more price caps; how Ken Lay was the greatest single contributor to George Bush over his political lifetime and might even be Secretary of Energy, or otherwise would be setting energy policy for the United States.  One has to wonder why Vice President Cheney is still hiding the records of those conversations. Then, as they manipulated the market on 450 out of 573 days, one day they were on the phone yelling, cheering, ``burn, baby, burn'' as power lines were scorched by fire. They bragged about stealing millions from Grandma Millie in California.                              {time}  1800  They talked about withholding power, increasing prices, wandering power through Oregon and other neighboring States in order to jack up prices in California, and still today people in my State are paying about 43 percent more for their electricity than they did 4 years ago for the same electrons generated by the same plants because of these scams by Enron, scams that of course Vice President Cheney said were nothing but market forces.  Now the Republicans are refusing to do anything about it. This energy bill does nothing to deal with what Enron has done to defraud the people of the western United States and roll back these illegal and unfair contracts and prices.  But now we are on to a new one, oil. Now, this is kind of familiar. Dick Cheney and George Bush say it is market forces, nothing we can do about it. In fact, the White House has done nothing about the escalating oil prices here in the United States.  Now, it is kind of interesting because it is awfully similar to the electricity industry. There have been 2,600 mergers in the petroleum industry in the last decade. There are virtually no more small independent distributors, and many of the smaller companies have been gobbled up by others. Tremendous concentration in this industry.  Of course the same thing that follows with these market forces is an absolutely obscene runup in profits. We are seeing just in the first quarter this year British Petroleum 165 percent increase in profits. ChevronTexaco, 294 percent increase in profits. Conoco-Phillips, a measly 44 percent. Their market forces are not working as well as the others, I guess. And Exxon-Mobil, 125 percent, and this next quarter promises to be even more lucrative for these companies.  Now, there was a day when the United States Congress set an independent path on critical issues to the American people, like the oil crises of the 1970s, and the Congress actually took definitive steps. They enacted windfall profit tax to get at the price gouging of the industry. They adopted mandatory fuel economy standards. They in fact capped the price of fuel, because they knew that this was being manipulated and the American people were being gouged.  But not this Congress. This Congress is offering the same old lame energy bill that it passed 3 years ago, 2 years ago, last year, and now we are going to vote on it again, same bill, $18 billion of subsidies to the suffering oil-gas industry that has record profits, profits of over $700 billion last year, and the taxpayers should subsidize it. Oh, come on now. I guess that is market forces. No. Wait a minute. How can subsidizing the industry be market forces? Well, I guess it is socialism, but we do not count that as socialism because we are giving it to a meritorious industry that needs the money; or, well, it does not need the money but it should get the money.  Now, what is going on here? When are we going to begin acting on behalf of the American people? When is the Bush administration going to file their complaint in their favorite organization, the World Trade Organization? They love rules-based trade. They love the WTO, but guess what? Eight of the OPEC countries are in the WTO. They are violating the rules of the WTO by constricting supply to drive up prices; but the Bush administration, no, they are not going to file a complaint against OPEC.  Then of course there is the Petroleum Reserve, which the President is filling at outrageous prices, and the list goes on and on. I have offered productive alternatives, as have other Democrats, but this administration stands mute because their friends in the oil industry are making out like bandits.                          ____________________
