 Speaker, I am delighted to be joined this evening by the gentleman from Oregon (Mr. DeFazio), my good friend.  Mr. Speaker, I want to begin, as the first Independent elected to Congress in 40 years and I have been here now for 11 years, I want to talk about some issues that are often not addressed by my colleagues in the House or the Senate and some issues that are not talked about on television or radio with our corporate media but issues that need to be discussed and debated and thought about.  The first issue that I want to talk about is the most important issue. That is the quality of American democracy.  Mr. Speaker, we have an American flag behind us, and the American flag reflects the struggle and the deaths of so many Americans who fought and died to preserve our democracy. Democracy is a big deal. It means that the people, ordinary people, working people, low-income people, people who are not wealthy and powerful, but ordinary people having the right to control their own lives and making the decisions which impact on their children and on the future of the country, that is a big deal and something that we kind of take for granted.  What I am extremely concerned about, that the quality of our democracy and our democratic traditions are deteriorating, and that more and more people are giving up on our democratic process or not paying attention to what is going on and believe for many very good reasons that this institution, that Washington, D.C., is controlled by big money interests who do not pay attention to the lives and struggles of ordinary people, to the middle class. People are saying why should I bother to vote, why should I bother to participate. The deck is stacked against me, big money controls both political parties, big money controls the agenda.  Let me just say a word about what goes on in this country in terms of money. Let me quote if I can, Mr. Speaker, from today's Washington Post. ``Vice President Cheney held a reception at his official residence last night for $100,000 donors to the Republican Party, giving the Democrats, after years of enduring GOP criticism of their use of the perks of office for fund-raising a chance to accuse Republicans of engaging in the same practices. Cheney's hospitality was a prelude to tonight's Presidential gala, a black-tie dinner that is expected to raise at least $15 million for the Republican National Committee, and willmark President Bush's post-inaugural debut as a major fund-raising draw for his party.''  Mr. Speaker, we ended our debate over education kind of early this evening, about 5:00, for a very special occasion. And the occasion was because many of our Republican colleagues were racing out to this $15 million fund-raising dinner.  In my State of Vermont and all over this country, people sit back and they cannot believe it. They cannot believe that there are people who go to fund-raising dinners for $25,000 a plate, Republican dinners and Democratic dinners, people who contribute hundreds of thousands of dollars to both political parties. People say, ``What is going on in this country. That is not what democracy is supposed to be.''  Now, what people also understand is that folks do not go to fund-raising dinners like the one that the Republicans are holding tonight and do not contribute hundreds of thousands of dollars to the Republican Party or the Democratic Party because they believe in the democratic process. No one thinks that.  The reason that people contribute huge sums of money, the reason that corporate America is throwing hundreds of millions of dollars into the political process is that when you contribute, you gain access to the people who make the decisions, and they make decisions that benefit you.  Does anybody think that at tonight's fund-raising dinner for the Republican Party the major donors are coming up to the President and saying, ``Mr. President, you have got to raise the minimum wage because American workers cannot make it on $5.15 an hour.''  Does anyone think that is what is being discussed tonight? Do you think that the donors of the Republican Party are saying, ``Mr. President, what are we going to do about the fact that 43 million Americans have no health insurance, and many more are underinsured? Mr. President, we have to move that issue.'' I do not think so.  I think what is happening tonight is the President is taking some bows for his tax proposal which will give hundreds of billions of dollars in tax breaks to the wealthiest 1 percent of the population, people who make a minimum income of $375,000; and that is why people contribute to the political process.  Mr. Speaker, I would say the major issue as a Nation we have got to face is how do we revitalize American democracy. How do we go from having the lowest voter turnout of any major industrialized Nation to the highest voter turnout.  In next year's election, 2002, the estimate is 36 percent of the American people are going to vote. Almost two-thirds of the American people are saying, ``I am not going to participate in terms of who is going to the Congress, Senate, who is going to be the governor of my State. It does not matter.''  What is even scarier is that the voter turnout for young people is even lower, which portends very badly for the future of this country in terms of democratic participation.  I hope tonight, along with the gentleman from Oregon (Mr. DeFazio), we will be exploring the role that big money plays in the political process, in terms of energy, tax breaks, in terms of our environment, and I think there is a lot to be discussed in that respect.  Mr. Speaker, I yield to a gentleman who has played a fantastic role in this Congress in taking on the big oil companies and fighting for an energy policy that makes a lot of sense to working Americans, rather than just Exxon and the big oil companies.  Mr. DeFAZIO. Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentleman. Just in following up on that train of thought, there is 1 billion, ``b'' as in billion, that is 1,000 million dollars spent by candidates for Congress in this last cycle; by far a new record, more than a $200 million increase.  I have to say sadly most of that money came from powerful special interests whose interests is not good public policy, not universal health care, not how to rein in the outrageous cost of prescription drugs, not how to have a sustainable energy policy for the United States of America that benefits small business, big business and residential ratepayers and working people alike, but no, they are narrow special interests.  Mr. Speaker, I would like to read sort of a roll call here from the energy industry of their contributions. Now, number one, it is hard to choose. I do not know whether to go to Enron because the CEO of Enron is Mr. Ken Lay, who is the largest single contributor to George Bush, $2 million over George Bush's political lifetime, and all of his company executives were required to give substantial funds to President Bush, and they raised millions of dollars. This is one company.                              {time}  2015  What is at stake for them? Well, last year, they had a billion dollars of income or a billion dollars of revenue and $100 million of income, a lot of it through manipulating energy markets. They do not produce things. They just manipulated energy markets.  So I am going to give them the number one spot, as I said, $2 million from the CEO of Enron. When Mr. Cheney, who wrote our national energy policy, was asked to name people who he had met with, he said, well, I met with lots of people, lots of people; but the only one he could name, the only person that Cheney in that press conference, Vice President Cheney, could name, was Ken Lay, the head of Enron, because he said they have a different take on things.  That is right. They do not produce oil and gas. They do not produce electricity. What they produce is money by speculating on these markets, driving up the price and manipulating the markets to extract the money from consumers, but they do not add anything productive to the mix.  It was reported by the Wall Street Journal last Friday that Mr. Lay of Enron chose two key regulators who he had to call over to the White House to get appointed to be on the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission to make certain that policies that benefit his billion dollar company are put in place.  Number two, close behind Enron, they could have been number one, is ExxonMobil; ExxonMobil, $15.9 billion in profits in the last year. It is a 100 percent increase. Americans are seeing it every day at the pump; and they are also seeing it in their homes, because Mobil has very substantial interests in the natural gas market which has been manipulated to extraordinary new highs.  They are kind of pikers, though. With that $15.9 billion of profits far outstripping the billion dollars of profits of Enron, they only gave $1.2 million to George Bush's election. They could have done a little better, but hopefully they are downtown tonight and they are making up for that deficit because certainly this so-called national energy policy which we received, this glossy, wonderful thing last week, in fact James Watt said that they dusted off his work from 20 years ago. I actually kind of think it was probably written more like 50 years ago in terms of how enlightened it is in moving us beyond the petroleum, coal, and nuclear economy. They certainly would do very well under that.  Let us go to number three here. Looks like number three goes to Chevron, $5.1 billion of profits; 150 percent increase. Total pikers, less than a million dollars to the Republican Party, only $770,000. I am certain, again, that they are making up for that tonight.  There is a direct linkage between this so-called national energy policy and massive, massive contributions from the energy industry in this country. It is just scandalous what is going on, the influence we have, two people from Texas, although Mr. Cheney did move his residency to Wyoming in order to meet constitutional requirements, where he had formerly lived; but they both lived in Texas up until the election; both working previously for oil companies, Mr. Cheney for Halliburton, and Mr. Bush a long history with the industry.  People wonder what is this big run-up in prices at the pump? What is going on with energy deregulation in California? How can the price of the electricity sold in California in 2 short years go from $7 billion to $70 billion? The same amount of electricity will be sold in California this year as 2 years ago. Despite what one reads in the press, they are conserving. They will consume probably as much or a little bit less than they did 2 years ago, and the price has gone up by 1,000 percent; 1,000 percent.  Every small business, every big business, every residential ratepayer is paying through the nose for the same essential commodity that keeps these lights on in this so-called deregulated market; and this national energy policy says this is such a great plan it is working so well, so well in the State of California that according to an unnumbered page in the summary of recommendations, in appendix one of President Bush's and Vice President Cheney's national energy policy, that every State in the Union, despite, of course, the normal States' rights position of my colleagues on the other side of the aisle, should be required to implement California-like deregulation because it would be unbelievably profitable for Enron.  It is such a great deal. The lights go out. You do not know if you can afford your bill, but they think this is a model for the future and we should model this in every State in the union.  It has failed every place it has been tried.
