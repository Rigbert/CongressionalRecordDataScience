 I am not going to drag my colleague into the earlier discussion, but what I am concerned about, and have been, is that the Senator from Arizona is relitigating the past. In effect, when the Bush administration took away the power because it was too intrusive, he wanted to go back to it.  But apropos of my colleague, isn't that the heart of her case--that she is looking to the future--FBI resources, resources to deal with hate crimes, resources to deal with prevention? It seems to me she is trying to lay out a plan for the future.
