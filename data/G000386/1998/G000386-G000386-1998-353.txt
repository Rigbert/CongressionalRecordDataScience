 President, we have kept our word, and we have increased education spending by exactly what the President and the Congress decided to do last year in the Balanced Budget Act.  We provide an additional $8 billion in additional discretionary education funding over the next 5 years. In total, we will provide close to $20 billion in K-12 education funding this year. That is a 98 percent increase over the last 10 years.  We agree with the President on the funding. However, we disagree with the President on how to spend the money, because the President and his party want to make Washington, DC, education central. Republicans want to decentralize education decisionmaking and put power and resources into the hands of the States, the localities, and the families. We should oppose the amendment. I move to table the amendment.
