  Marvin was one of about a dozen original staffers brought on to help shoot the first ever live, gavel-to-gavel broadcast of the Senate floor. He has since become a real pro at capturing the best angles of this Chamber. For Marvin, getting there meant studying up on Senate procedure and teaching himself to instantly recognize a rotating cast of 100 different names and faces, an impressive feat in itself. His career includes a number of historical milestones, from Presidential inaugurations and gold medal ceremonies to Supreme Court nominations and the occasional all-night filibuster. I am told he is now looking forward to having a little more time to focus on his family.  On behalf of the entire Senate family, I thank Marvin for his many years of dedicated public service and wish him well in his retirement.                          ____________________
