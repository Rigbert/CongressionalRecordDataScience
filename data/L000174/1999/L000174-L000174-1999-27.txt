Kennedy, Mrs. Feinstein, Mr. Jeffords, Mr. Torricelli, Mrs. Murray, Mr. Durbin, Mr. Wellstone, Mr. Feingold, Mr. Harkin, Mr. Kerry, Ms. Mikulski, and Mrs. Boxer) submitted the following concurrent resolution; which was referred to the Committee on Foreign Relations:                            S. Con. Res. 76       Whereas the United States and Mexico have a long history of      close relations and share a wide range of interests;       Whereas a democratic, peaceful and prosperous Mexico is of      vital importance to the security of the United States.       Whereas the United States Government provides assistance      and licenses exports of military equipment to Mexican      security forces for counter-narcotics purposes;       Whereas the Department of State's 1998 Country Report on      Human Rights Practices in Mexico stated that a ``culture of      impunity pervades the security forces'' and documented human      rights violations, including arbitrary detention, torture,      extrajudicial killings, and disappearances, by these forces;       Whereas confrontations in August 1999 between members of      the Mexican military and supporters of the Zapatista National      Liberation Army (EZLN) in Chiapas, Mexico are representative      of the political tension and violence that has plagued the      region for years;       Whereas the conflict has its roots in the poverty and      injustice suffered by the indigenous people of Chiapas, and      shared by the poor in the neighboring states of Oaxaca and      Guerrero;       Whereas the lack of progress in implementing a preliminary      peace agreement signed in 1996 and the intimidating level of      militarization by the Mexican army, paramilitary groups and      the EZLN has resulted in the forced displacement of thousands      of indigenous people and exacerbated the impoverished      conditions in Chiapas;       Whereas on September 14, 1999, the Commission for Peace and      Reconciliation in Chiapas of the Conference of Mexican      Catholic Bishops urged the Government of Mexico to consider      relocating military forces in Chiapas to only those positions      absolutely necessary to maintaining the integrity and      security of Mexico;       Whereas the Government of Mexico has devoted resources to      reduce poverty in Chiapas, but the breakdown in peace      negotiations and the lack of trust between the Mexican      Government and some indigenous communities have limited the      impact of that assistance;       Whereas on September 7, 1999, the Government of Mexico      pledged to renew dialogue with the EZLN, support the      formation of a new mediation tea, and investigate human      rights abuses in Chiapas;       Whereas the EZLN has not yet accepted the Government of      Mexico's overtures to resume negotiations; and       Whereas the summary expulsions of American citizens and      human rights monitors from Mexico are inconsistent with the      freedoms of movement, association and expression: Now,      therefore, be it       Resolved by the Senate (the House of Representatives      concurring), That it is the sense of Congress that the      Secretary of State should--       (1) take effective measures to ensure that United States      assistance and exports of equipment to Mexican security      forces--       (A) are used primarily for counter-narcotics purposes; and       (B) are not provided to units of security forces that have      been implicated in human rights violations, unless the      Government of Mexico is taking effective measures to bring      the individuals responsible to justice;       (2) encourage the EZLN and the Government of Mexico to take      steps to create conditions for good faith negotiations that      address the social, economic and political causes of the      conflict in Chiapas, to achieve a peaceful and lasting      resolution of the conflict, and to vigorously pursue such      negotiations;       (3) commend the Government of Mexico for its renewed      commitment to negotiations and for establishing a date for      the United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights to      visit Mexico to discuss human rights concerns there;       (4) give a higher priority in discussions with the      Government of Mexico to criminal justice reforms that protect      human rights, emphasizing United States concerns about      arbitrary detention, torture, extra judicial killings, and      disappearances, and the failure to prosecute individuals      responsible for these crimes; and       (5) urge the Government of Mexico to implement the      recommendations of the Inter-American Commission on Human      Rights, particularly with regard to American citizens and      others who have been summarily expelled from Mexico in      violation of Mexican law and international law.
