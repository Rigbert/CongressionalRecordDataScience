Speaker, I rise to recognize the centennial anniversary of Macedonia Baptist Church, located in Toledo, Ohio. The congregation will celebrate this milestone event on August 25, 2012.  Since its founding in 1912, Macedonia Baptist Church has served its congregation and its community inspired by Christ's teachings as recorded in Matthew 25:40 that, ``Whatsoever you do to the least among you, that you do unto me.'' Its ``rich history of service began on Yondota Street on the East side of Toledo'' where the church originally stood and continues to the present day from its location in West Toledo.  Through a century of service the church has been a neighborhood mainstay. In addition to worship services, Macedonia Baptist Church members teach fellowship and provide services to families in need. Motivated by their servants' hearts and strong pastoral leadership, the church carries forth a tradition of reaching out. All are welcome into the faith-filled, inspired congregation. We proudly commemorate this 100th anniversary while looking forward to Macedonia Baptist Church's future.                          ____________________
