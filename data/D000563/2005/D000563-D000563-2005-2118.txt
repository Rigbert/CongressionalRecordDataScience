 Before my colleague from Kansas leaves--I know he is off to a committee meeting--I thank the Senator for his statement. It is critically important that all of us on both sides of the aisle, Democrat and Republican, make it clear every single day about this senseless killing that is going on in the Darfur region of Sudan.  We had the gentleman who is the subject of ``Hotel Rwanda'' in Chicago a week ago, Paul Rusesabagina. He saved 1,200 people in Rwanda from genocide. He did not come to brag; he came to beg that we do something about Sudan. He touched my heart. I said I will come back and do everything I can, and every day I will get up and speak, if I have a chance, to remind people that we have to do something as a nation.  I thank the Senator from Kansas for his statement. It was very eloquent. Although I may not agree on every single thing he said, I certainly agree this is a matter of great urgency and immediacy. I thank him for his leadership.                          ____________________[Pages S1816-S1818]From the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]                                 SUDAN
