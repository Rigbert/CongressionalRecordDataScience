Speaker, Casey Martin is a 25-year-old young man who lives in America, the land of opportunity. He suffers from K-T-W syndrome which is a circulatory disorder in his right leg which causes great pain when he walks significant distances. Notwithstanding that, he had the courage to become a second team all-American on the Stanford golf team. The Professional Golfers Association said that the ADA did not apply to Casey Martin and it was not designed or intended to apply to competitors in professional sporting events.  The judge felt differently and sustained what I think we in this body felt, that somebody with a disability ought to be given a reasonable accommodation to participate as fully as their courage and commitment would allow.  Gary Phelan, a disability expert, was quoted as saying that the ADA was about opportunity, not pity. Casey Martin was the victim of fate, but he was not defeated by that disability. He has competed and prevailed. It was a great day for America yesterday when he was allowed to compete fully to the extent of his ability.                          ____________________
