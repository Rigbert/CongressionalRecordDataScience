President, I want to take a few minutes with Senator Moran tonight to reflect on the events of the last few days with respect to the Internet legislation. I want to begin by thanking Majority Leader Harry Reid for reopening the debate on anticounterfeiting and copyright protection legislation. In pulling the Protect IP Act from the floor, Leader Reid has given the Senate an opportunity to get this policy right. The Senate now has the opportunity to consult all of the stakeholders, including the millions of Internet users who were heard last week. The Senate has the opportunity to ensure that those exercising their first amendment rights through the Internet, those offering innovative products and services, and those looking for new mediums for sharing and expression, have their voices heard.  I also express my appreciation to Senator Moran. He is an impassioned advocate for job creation and innovation on the Net--the first on the other side of the aisle to join me in this cause. My colleague, Senator Cantwell from Washington State, who is as knowledgeable as anybody in public service about technology, and Senator Rand Paul, who is a champion of the Internet as a place where those who look at the Net as a marketplace of ideas, stand together and approach policy in an innovative way.  Last week, tens of millions of Americans empowered by the Internet effected political change here in Washington. The Congress was on a trajectory to pass legislation that would change the Internet as we know it. It would reshape the Internet in a way, in my view, that would have been harmful to our economy, our democracy, and our national security interests.  When Americans learned about all this, they said no. The Internet enables people from all walks of life to learn about the legislation and then take collective action to urge their representatives in Washington to stop it.  So everybody asked, come Wednesday, what would happen? In fact, the American people stopped this legislation. Their voices counted more than all the political lobbying, more than all of the advertising, more than all of the phone calls that were made by the heads and the executives of the moviestudios. Their voices were heard loud and clear.  Last week, the Congress did what the American people called for instead of what the Washington insiders wanted. That is what I call real change. It was a grassroots victory for the history books, and, as one commentator said, now we are in unexplored territory. Here is why. Eight million of 162 million who visited Wikipedia took action to influence their Member of Congress; 7 million Americans signed Google's petition to block consideration of PIPA; hundreds of thousands of Americans called the Congress. In all, in just 1 day, more than 15 million Americans communicated with Congress and urged it to reject the Hollywood proposal to censor and censure the Internet.  The 15 million Americans who took action, who signed petitions, who provided their e-mail addresses and ZIP Codes in a desire to be informed are now going to be watching us like never before. The 15 million who looked up and spoke up are not faceless and they are not anonymous. They are people such as Frances Stewart of Maryland, Nancy Linton from Oregon, Debbie Kearns from East Hartford, CT, and John Jewett of Colorado, who gave their names to Web sites around the country. They are joined by millions of other Americans who were raising concerns for months before last week's Web blackout and supporting the filibuster I announced here in the Senate almost 1\1/2\ years ago.  These 15 million citizen activists were not the only ones saying the PROTECT IP Act took the wrong approach. The New York Times and the Los Angeles Times--the hometown newspapers for the content industry--both wrote editorials saying the legislation overreached. I ask unanimous consent to have printed in the Record copies of those articles.  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in the Record, as follows:               [From the Los Angeles Times, June 7, 2011]                         Policing the Internet       A Senate bill aims to cut off support for any site found by      the courts to be `dedicated' to copyright or trademark      infringement. Its goals are laudable, but its details are      problematic.       Hollywood studios, record labels and other U.S. copyright      and trademark owners are pushing Congress to give them more      protection against parasitical foreign websites that are      profiting from counterfeit or bootlegged goods. The Senate      Judiciary Committee has responded with a bill (S 968) that      would force online advertising networks, credit card      companies and search engines to cut off support for any site      found by the courts to be ``dedicated'' to copyright or      trademark infringement. Its goals are laudable, but its      details are problematic.       The global nature of the Internet has spawned a profusion      of websites in countries that can't or won't enforce      intellectual property law. Under S 968, if a website were      deemed by a court to be dedicated to infringing activities,      federal agents could then tell the U.S. companies that direct      traffic, process payments, serve advertisements and locate      information online to end their support for the site in      question. Copyright and trademark owners would be able to      follow up those court orders by seeking injunctions against      payment processors and advertising networks that do not      comply.       Cutting off the financial lifeblood of companies dedicated      to piracy and counterfeiting makes sense. A similar approach      to illegal online gambling has shown that it is technically      feasible for payment processors to stop directing dollars      from U.S. bettors to gambling sites anywhere in the world.      The operators of the largest online advertising networks say      they can do the same, although they object to the bill's      proposal to let copyright and trademark owners seek      injunctions against them.       The main problem with the bill is in its effort to render      sites invisible as well as unprofitable. Once a court      determines that a site is dedicated to infringing, the      measure would require the companies that operate domain-name      servers to steer Internet users away from it. This      misdirection, however, wouldn't stop people from going to the      site, because it would still be accessible via its underlying      numerical address or through overseas domain-name servers.       A group of leading Internet engineers has warned that the      bill's attempt to hide piracy-oriented sites could hurt some      legitimate sites because of the way domain names can be      shared or have unpredictable mutual dependencies. And by      encouraging Web consumers to use foreign or underground      servers, the measure could undermine efforts to create a more      reliable and fraud-resistant domain-name system. These risks      argue for Congress to take a more measured approach to the      problem of overseas rogue sites.                                  ____                [From the New York Times, Nov. 26, 2011]                        Going After the Pirates       Online piracy is the bane of the Internet. Still, bills      proposed in the House and the Senate have overreached. The      legislation needs to be tightened to protect intellectual      property without hindering online speech and innovation.       Forty billion music files were shared illegally in 2008,      according to the International Federation of the Phonographic      Industry, amounting to 95 percent of all music downloads      worldwide. Three-quarters of the video games released in late      2010 and early 2011 were shared illegally.       Musicians, moviemakers, authors and software designers are      not the only victims. Piracy's cost is measured in less      innovation and less economic activity, as creators lose hope      of making a living from their creations. Still, the      definition of wrongdoing in the ``Stop Online Piracy Act''      introduced in the House is too broad.       Under the bill, copyright owners could direct payment      providers like Visa and advertising networks like Google's to      cut off business to a Web site simply by filing notice that      the site--or ``a portion'' of it--``engages in, enables or      facilitates'' intellectual property infringement or is being      willfully blind to it.       Accused Web sites would have only five days to assert their      innocence. And the payment providers and ad networks could      not be sued by sites that were wrongly cut off, so their      easiest course of action might be to just comply with      copyright owners' requests. If copyright owners could starve      a Web site of money simply by telling a payment processor      that the site was infringing on intellectual property, the      bill could stymie legitimate speech.       The purpose of the legislation is to stop business flowing      to foreign rogue Web sites like the Pirate Bay in Sweden. But      these provisions could affect domestic Web sites that are      already covered by the 1998 Digital Millennium Copyright Act.      That act has safe harbors protecting sites, like YouTube,      that may unknowingly host pirated content, as long as they      take it down when notified.       Another provision would allow the attorney general to sue      foreign sites that ``facilitate'' piracy, and to demand that      domestic search engines stop linking to them and that      Internet service providers redirect traffic. Experts have      said this measure could be easily overcome by users and warn      that it could undermine an industrywide effort to reduce      hacking. Legislators should also think hard about the message      it would send to autocratic regimes like China's, which      outinely block political Web sites.       The House bill is right to focus on payment systems and ad      networks to cut off the money to rogue Web sites. But like      its Senate companion, the ``Protect IP'' bill, it has serious      problems that must be fixed.       The bill should be made to stipulate clearly that all of      its provisions are aimed only at rogue Web sites overseas.      Foreign sites must be granted the same safe harbor immunity--     and the bill must not open the door to punishments for      domestic sites that abide by the 1998 digital copyright law.      And rather than encouraging credit card companies and      advertising networks to pre-emptively cut off business to Web      sites accused of wrongdoing, a court order should be required      before they take action.                                  ____                [From the New York Times, June 8, 2011]                   Internet Piracy and How To Stop It       Online piracy is a huge business. A recent study found that      Web sites offering pirated digital content or counterfeit      goods, like illicit movie downloads or bootleg software,      record 53 billion hits per year. That robs the industries      that create and sell intellectual products of hundreds of      billions of dollars.       The problem is particularly hard to crack because the      villains are often in faraway countries. Bad apples can be      difficult to pin down in the sea of Web sites, and pirates      can evade countervailing measures as easily as tweaking the      name of a Web site.       Commendably, the Senate Judiciary Committee is trying to      bolster the government's power to enforce intellectual      property protections. Last month, the committee approved the      Protect IP Act, which creates new tools to disrupt illegal      online commerce.       The bill is not perfect. Its definition of wrongdoing is      broad and could be abused by companies seeking to use the law      to quickly hinder Web sites. Some proposed remedies could      also unintentionally reduce the safety of the Internet.      Senator Ron Wyden put a hold on the bill over these issues,      which, he argued, could infringe on the right to free speech.      The legislation is, therefore, in limbo, but it should be      fixed, not discarded.       The bill defines infringing Web sites as those that have      ``no significant use other than engaging in, enabling, or      facilitating'' the illegal copying or distribution of      copyrighted material in ``substantially complete form''--     entire movies or songs, not just snippets.       If the offender can't be found to answer the accusation (a      likely occurrence given that most Web sites targeted will be      overseas), the government or a private party can seek an      injunction from a judge to compel advertising networks and      payment systems like MasterCard or PayPal to stop doing      business with the site.       The government--but not private parties--can use the      injunction to compel Internet service providers to redirect      traffic by not translating a Web address into the numerical     language that computers understand. And they could force      search engines to stop linking to them.       The broadness of the definition is particularly worrisome      because private companies are given a right to take action      under the bill. In one notorious case, a record label      demanded that YouTube take down a home video of a toddler      jiggling in the kitchen to a tune by Prince, claiming it      violated copyright law. Allowing firms to go after a Web site      that ``facilitates'' intellectual property theft might      encourage that kind of overreaching--and allow the government      to black out a site.       Some of the remedies are problematic. A group of Internet      safety experts cautioned that the procedure to redirect      Internet traffic from offending Web sites would mimic what      hackers do when they take over a domain. If it occurred on a      large enough scale it could impair efforts to enhance the      safety of the domain name system.       This kind of blocking is unlikely to be very effective.      Users could reach offending Web sites simply by writing the      numerical I.P. address in the navigator box, rather than the      URL. The Web sites could distribute free plug-ins to      translate addresses into numbers automatically.       The bill before the Senate is an important step toward      making piracy less profitable. But it shouldn't pass as is.      If protecting intellectual property is important, so is      protecting the Internet from overzealous enforcement.                                  ____                [From the New York Times, Jan. 18, 2012]                 Online Piracy and Political Overreach       For months, it seemed as if Congress would pass an online      antipiracy bill, even though its main weapons--cutting off      the financing of pirate Web sites and making them harder to      find--risk censoring legitimate speech and undermining the      security of the Internet. But the unmovable corporations      behind those bills have run into an unstoppable force: an      outcry by Internet companies led by Google and Wikipedia that      culminated in an extraordinary online protest on Wednesday.       Lawmakers have begun peeling away from the bills, notably      Senators Marco Rubio, the Florida Republican who cosponsored      the Senate version, and John Cornyn, the powerful Texas      conservative. They dropped out after Wikipedia's English      language site went dark and Google put a black bar on its      homepage on Wednesday.       The Protect I.P. Act would have easily passed the Senate      last summer if not for a hold placed by Senator Ron Wyden, a      Democrat of Oregon. The Stop Online Piracy Act, introduced in      the House in October, has also lost some of its initial      backers. And on Saturday, the White House released a      statement warning that it would ``not support legislation      that reduces freedom of expression, increases cybersecurity      risk, or undermines the dynamic, innovative global      Internet.''       Though we are encouraged by legislators' newfound caution      about the potential consequences of the bills, Congress must      keep working on ways to curtail the growing business of      foreign rogue Web sites trafficking in counterfeit goods and      stolen intellectual property.       The Internet industry was pitted against some of the best-     honed lobbying groups, including Hollywood and the recording      studios, the United States Chamber of Commerce and the      A.F.L.-C.I.O. The industry has made a good case that some of      the definitions of wrongdoing--like ``facilitating''      intellectual property infringement--were overly broad. They      said allowing property rights owners to direct payment      companies like Visa and ad networks like Google's to stop      doing business with sites they deemed infringing--with no      penalties if they were proved wrong--could stymie legitimate      online expression.       They made the case that the proposal to make infringing Web      sites ``disappear'' from the Internet by forbidding search      engines from finding them or redirecting their Web addresses      to other Internet domains was easy to get around and could      potentially undermine efforts to stop hackers from doing      exactly the same thing.       The Internet companies now have the responsibility to come      up with a workable alternative that gives owners of      intellectual property rights better tools to stop piracy by      Web sites located in faraway countries. These sites get some      53 billion visits a year, more than Google or Wikipedia. Yet      they are outside the grasp of American law.       The focus on cutting the financing of online pirates, which      features in the House and Senate bills, is the right way to      go. Sponsors of both bills have moved to delete, at least      temporarily, provisions to make rogue Web sites disappear.      The legislation could be further amended to narrow the      definition of criminality and clarify that it is only aimed      at foreign sites. And it could tighten guarantees of due      process. Private parties must first get a court order to      block business with a Web site they deem infringing on their      copyrights.       We are happy that the drive to pass antipiracy legislation      has slowed enough that Congress might actually consider all      its implications carefully. Lawmakers can now act wisely to      create tools that can help combat the scourge of online      piracy without excessive collateral damage.
