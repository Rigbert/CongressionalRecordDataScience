Speaker, if the gentleman would keep in perspective, the total cost of the Democratic proposal, as I understand, it is to be twice as generous in terms of the extension of unemployment benefits; and to again, to begin to even penetrate some of those other people who have been longer unemployed or underemployed, is about one-twentieth, 5 percent, of what the President is proposing to gift upon the wealthiest by relieving them of the horrible burden of paying a small percentage tax on the dividends they earn by clipping coupons on stocks that they own.  Where are our priorities? Could he not do 10 percent for the unemployed and for their families? I mean, it is just extraordinary to me that the emphasis would be so thinly disguised.
