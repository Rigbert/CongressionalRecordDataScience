Speaker, I yield myself 15 seconds only to say that the reason, I say to the gentleman from Minnesota (Mr. Gutknecht) that we do not have prescription drug legislation is because this Congress did not pass it. And this is our only chance, and, unfortunately, a flawed bill is being presented as the only option that a few people here negotiated on their own, not in a bipartisan way.
