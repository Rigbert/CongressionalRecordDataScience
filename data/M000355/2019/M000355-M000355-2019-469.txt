 President, first, I want to acknowledge two notable events taking place in the Capitol today.  As we speak, the First Lady of the United States is just down the hall for a special event related to our Nation's opioid epidemic, marking the progress that Congress and the administration have made in recent years and focusing our efforts on the work still ahead.  I will have more to say on the subject tomorrow, which will mark the 1-year anniversary of President Trump signing our landmark opioid legislation into law.  I want to warmly welcome the First Lady to the Senate this morning and thank her for her continued focus on this crisis, which affects so many of our States. I offer these thanks not only as the majority leader but as the senior Senator from Kentucky, which has been hit hard by this epidemic.                          ____________________
