Chairman, if the gentleman from Connecticut (Mr. Maloney) will yield, I want to thank the gentleman from Connecticut and the gentleman from South Carolina (Mr. Spratt) for raising this issue.  As someone who has been involved in this, I have a lot of marinas in my district on the Chesapeake Bay and the Potomac River and Patuxent River. We have the fuel, commercial and recreational fuel, and that of course is colored as well. Not, obviously, the same issue but a similar one that I have been involved in. I think that the gentlemen's initiatives on this are very well taken. I look forward to working with my colleagues to see if we can get this problem resolved. I thank the gentlemen for their efforts.
