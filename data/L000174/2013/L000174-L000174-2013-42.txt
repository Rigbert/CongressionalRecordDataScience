For the third time this year, we are debating whether to end a Republican filibuster and allow a confirmation vote for a highly qualified woman to the DC Circuit. In March, it was Caitlin Halligan. Last month, it was Patricia Millet. Today, it is Nina Pillard. The qualifications of each of these nominees surpass those of many other attorneys who have been confirmed to the Federal bench. These are three women who have earned their way to the top of the legal profession. They are recognized by legal scholars, practitioners, and men and women alike as being at the top of the profession. It appears Senate Republicans are going to continue to launch filibuster after filibuster at these stellar nominees.  Like Caitlin Halligan and Patricia Millett, I am confident Nina Pillard would be confirmed if Republicans would stop filibustering and allow an up-or-down vote on her nomination. She would get well over the number needed. If Republicans vote in lockstep to continue their filibuster against Nina Pillard, then Senate Republicans will have blocked three outstanding women in a row from being confirmed to what is considered the second highest court in our country.  Senate Republicans have an opportunity to make this right by voting to end the filibuster of Nina Pillard's nomination today, and by voting on the nomination of Patricia Millett once the majority leader brings it again before the Senate as he said he intends to do. Confirming these two highly qualified nominees is the right thing to do and it will make history, once these two extraordinary women are confirmed, the DC Circuit will be the first Federal appellate court in our country to have an equal number of women serving as judges as men.  Wouldn't that be nice? The DC Circuit would actually reflect the proportion of women in this country. It would be a nice move. Despite having filled nearly half of law school classrooms for the last 20 years, women are grossly underrepresented on our Federal courts. What kind of message are Senate Republicans sending by refusing to even allow a vote on three of the most qualified female attorneys in this country?  When Senate Republicans talked about seating John Roberts on one of these seats on the DC Circuit, every Republican and every Democrat supported him. That was no problem for them. Of course, John Roberts was nominated by a Republican President.  We now have women nominees who are equally well qualified, and they are filibustered. Of course, they were nominated by a Democratic President. I guess if you are a Republican and nominate a qualified man, this nominee can be confirmed easily. If you are a Democrat nominating an equally qualified woman, this nominee will be filibustered. What does this say to people in law school? What does it say to our country? What does it say about the impartiality of our Federal bench? We need women in our Federal courts. A vote to end this filibuster is a vote in the historic direction of having our Federal appellate courts more accurately reflect the gender balance of our country.  Nina Pillard is a stellar nominee. She is an accomplished litigator whose work includes 9 Supreme Court oral arguments and briefs in more than 25 Supreme Court cases. She drafted the Federal Government's brief in United States v. Virginia, which after a 7-to-1 decision by the Supreme Court made history by opening the Virginia Military Institute's doors to women students and expanded educational opportunity for women across this country.  As a father who loves his daughter and his three granddaughters, I want to see us start paying attention to the fact that we have both men and women in this country. After Nina Pillard's work in U.S. v. Virginia, hundreds of women have had the opportunity to attend VMI and go on to serve our country. Josiah Bunting III, the superintendent of VMI when female cadets were first integrated into the corps, has since called VMI's transition to coeducation ``one of its finest hours.'' And it was. But it needed somebody like Nina Pillard to bring a case to the Supreme Court so they could have their finest hour.  Nina Pillard has not only stood up for equal opportunities for women but for men as well. In Nevada v. Hibbs she successfully represented a male employee of the State of Nevada who was fired when he tried to take unpaid leave under the Family and Medical Leave Act to care for his sick wife. In a 6-to-3 opinion authored by then-Chief Justice William Rehnquist, the Supreme Court ruled for her client, recognizing that the law protects both men and women in their caregiving roles within the family.  Nina Pillard has also worked at the Department of Justice's Office of Legal Counsel, an office that advises on the most complex constitutional issues facing the executive branch. Prior to that service, she litigated civil rights cases at the NAACP Legal Defense &Education Fund. At Georgetown Law School--a law school this chairman of the Senate Judiciary Committee loves, having graduated from there--Nina Pillard teaches advanced courses on constitutional law and civil procedure, and co-directs the law school's very prestigious Supreme Court Institute.  She has earned the American Bar Association's highest possible ranking--Unanimously Well Qualified--to serve as a federal appellate judge on the DC Circuit. She also has significant bipartisan support. Viet Dinh, the former Assistant Attorney General for the Office of Legal Policy under President George W. Bush, has written that:       Based on our long and varied professional experience      together, I know that Professor Pillard is exceptionally      bright, a patient and unbiased listener, and a lawyer of      great judgment and unquestioned integrity Nina . . . has      always been fair, reasonable, and sensible in her judgments .      . . She is a fair-minded thinker with enormous respect for      the law and for the limited, and essential, role of the      federal appellate judge--qualities that make her well      prepared to take on the work of a D.C. Federal Judge.  Former FBI Director and Chief Judge of the Western District of Texas, William Sessions, has written that her ``rare combination of experience, both defending and advising government officials, and representing individuals seeking to vindicate their rights, would be especially valuable in informing her responsibilities as a judge.''  Nina Pillard has also received letters of support from 30 former members of the U.S. armed forces, including 8 retired generals; 25 former Federal prosecutors and other law enforcement officials; 40 Supreme Court practitioners, including Laurence Tribe, Carter Phillips, and Neal Katyal, among others.  I ask unanimous consent to have a list of those letters of support for Ms. Pillard printed in the Record at the conclusion of my remarks.  Nina Pillard's nomination does not rise to the level of an extraordinary circumstance, which was what the Gang of 14 decided should be the standard for filibustering nominees back in 2005. According to a Senate Republican who still serves today:       Ideological attacks are not an `extraordinary      circumstance.' To me, it would have to be a character      problem, an ethics problem, some allegation about the      qualifications of the person, not an ideological bent.  There is no reasonable interpretation of that definition in which one could find an extraordinary circumstance with Nina Pillard. She has no character problem, no ethics problem, and most importantly, she has extraordinary qualifications.  Rather than debate the merits of President Obama's well-qualified nominees to the DC Circuit--because it would be impossible to debate them, as they are so well qualified--Senate Republicans have made clear that partisanship is more important to them than the Federal judiciary, the administration of justice, and the needs of the American people. With the exception of Senators Lisa Murkowski and Susan Collins, every single Republican Senator voted to filibuster Patricia Millett's nomination, arguing that we should not fill existing vacancies because suddenly they are concerned about the need for these existing judgeships. We know this is just a pretext for two reasons. First, they had no such concerns about the unique caseload of the DC Circuit when a Republican was in the White House and nominated judges to the 9th, 10th, and 11th seat. In fact, they filled the seat for this court that John Roberts was unanimously confirmed to when there was a lower caseload. Now, when we have a superbly qualified woman, suddenly she has to be filibustered.  And second, if Republicans actually cared about the cost of hampering our Government's functions they would not have shut down our Federal Government, which cost billions of dollars and set back our recovering economy. Avoiding the needless shutdown of our Government would have paid for all these Federal courts for years. So do not stand up and say we do not want these women on this court. Be honest about it. Do not give me a lot of folderol about numbers and expenses and everything else, because that is all it is: it is folderol.  In 2003, the Senate unanimously confirmed John Roberts by voice vote to be the ninth judge on the DC Circuit--at a time when its caseload was lower than it is today--and, in fact, his confirmation marked the lowest caseload level per judge on the DC Circuit in 20 years. Not a single Senate Republican raised any concerns about whether the caseload warranted his confirmation, and during the Bush administration, they voted to fill four vacancies on the DC Circuit--giving the court a total of 11 judges in active service. Today there are only eight judges on the court. What has changed? It is not the caseload--that has remained fairly constant over the past 10 years. In fact, the cases pending per active judge are actually higher today than they were when President Bush's nominees were confirmed to the DC Circuit. The only thing that has changed is the party of the President nominating judges to the court.  We also should not be comparing the DC Circuit's caseload with the caseload of other circuits, as Republicans have recently done. The DC Circuit is often understood to be the second most important court in the land because of the complex administrative law cases that it handles. The court reviews complicated decisions and rulemakings of many Federal agencies, and in recent years has handled some of the most important terrorism and enemy combatant and detention cases since the attacks of September 11. So comparing the DC Circuit's caseload to other circuits is a false comparison, and those who are attempting to make this comparison are not being fully forthcoming with the American public.  The DC Circuit should be operating at full strength, as it was when President Bush left office. Republicans supported this for President Bush but do not for President Obama. That is shameful. That is wrong. There are currently three vacancies and President Obama has fulfilled his constitutional role by nominating three eminently qualified nominees to fill these seats. Patricia Millett, Nina Pillard, and Robert Wilkins would fill the ninth, tenth, and eleventh seats on the DC Circuit. These are the same seats that were filled during President Bush's tenure when the caseload was lower. Do not give me balderdash; let us deal with reality. Let us judge each nominee based on his or her qualifications and not hide behind some pretextual argument that most Americans can see through.  If the Republican caucus continues to abuse the filibuster rule and obstruct the President's fine nominees to the DC Circuit, then I believe this body will need to consider anew whether a rules change should be in order. That is not a change that I want to see happen, but if Republican Senators are going to hold nominations hostage without consideration of nominees' individual merit, drastic measures may be warranted. I hope it does not come to that. I hope that the same Senators who stepped forward to broker compromise when Republicans shut down the government will decide to put politics aside and vote on the merits of these exceptional nominees. I also hope the same Senators who have said judicial nominations ought not be filibustered barring extraordinary circumstances will stay true to their word. Let us not have a double standard where one President is treated one way and another is treated differently. For the sake of justice in this country, for the sake of the independence of our Federal judiciary, let us stop the filibuster and consider Nina Pillard's nomination based on her qualifications. Let us treat her with the decency that she deserves. This Nation would be better off having her serve as a judge on the Court of Appeals for the DC Circuit.  I have argued cases before courts of appeal. I know how important it is to the administration of justice. I know how important it is for litigants who enter the courtroom not caring whether they are Republican or Democrat, whether they are plaintiff or defendant, whether the State or respondent. I know how important it is to have qualified judges. I call on the few Senators in this body who have argued cases before courts of appeals or before the U.S. Supreme Court to stop this game-playing with our Federal judiciary. Our independent judiciary is a model for the rest of the world. We must stop politicizing it, and stop using feeble, wrong, and misleading excuses. Let us start doing what is right for the country for a change. Stop the bumper sticker slogans. Stop the rhetoric that interferes with reality. Let us start doing what is right.  Would this not be a refreshing change in this country? I saw a poll this afternoon that showed the Congress at a 9 percent approval rating, and I would like to find out who those 9 percent are. Would it not be nice if the American people actually saw us doing what is best for America, and stopped this pettifoggery? Let us do what is right for America.
