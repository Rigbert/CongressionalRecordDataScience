President, I ask unanimous consent that the concurrent resolution now remain at the desk, and when the Senate receives the House companion, all after the resolving clause be stricken, the text of S. Con. Res. 86 be inserted and the concurrent resolution be immediately agreed to. I further ask unanimous consent that the Senate insist on its amendment, request a conference with the House on the disagreeing votes, and the Chair be authorized to appoint conferees on the part of the Senate, all without further action or debate.
