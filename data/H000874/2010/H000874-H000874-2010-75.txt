Speaker, I rise to honor the memory of one of Maryland's finest, a member of our Maryland State Police, Maryland State Trooper Wesley Brown, who was shot to death without warning while working on an off-duty security detail in the early morning of June 11. He was 24 years of age.  Though his life was cut far too short, Trooper Brown filled the years he was given with service to his community, mentoring young men, and love for his family.  It wasn't enough for Wesley to serve as a decorated State Trooper for more than 3 years. He also founded an organization called ``Young Men Enlightening Younger Men,'' a group dedicated to teaching life and leadership skills to boys in Wesley's Seat Pleasant neighborhood, just a couple of miles from where I grew up in District Heights, Maryland.  Many of them came to regard Trooper Brown as a father figure. ``I became a squared-away young man,'' said one of the pupils at his memorial service, ``and I'll never forget that smile.''  Wesley Brown's death was sudden and deeply unfair, but his community is better because he lived, and the seeds he sowed will outlive him. As the pastor said in Wesley's eulogy, ``He showed us how to serve his brother man, and no one had to beg him to do it.''  May all of those whom Trooper Brown left behind--his mother, Patricia Bell; his father, Sylvester Brown, Sr.; his fiancee, Ebony Norris; his seven brothers and sisters; and his grandmother, Rosella Bell--find comfort in the memory of his service and the greatness of his contribution to other young people.  We are protected every day by those who have the courage and commitment and love of country and neighbors to defend us here, our domestic defenders. Wesley Brown was one of those. God bless his soul.                          ____________________
