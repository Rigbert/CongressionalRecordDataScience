 President, I am concerned about a number of highly qualified persons who work at NASA'sAmes Research Center in California. It is my understanding that NASA is considering a layoff of these highly trained individuals and sending the technologies for the space station program on which they are working--the Centrifuge Facility--to the Japanese space agency NASDA. The Centrifuge Facility, and its related programs, have always been a part of the United States' contribution to the International Space Station. I simply do not understand why NASA would consider giving this work to the Japanese when they have significantly less experience in the life sciences area.  I say to the Chairman that we are both strong supporters of the International Space Station Program and want to see it become the premier microgravity research center of the world. This can only be accomplished if the best talent is focused on every sector of the program. To assign these biotechnology activities to anyone other than the individuals at the Ames Research Center--many of whom invented these technologies in the first place--makes little sense. Can he assure me that Ames Research Center will remain the center for these critical space station related biotechnical activities?
