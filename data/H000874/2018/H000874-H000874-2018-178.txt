McGovern hasn't read the bill. I have not read the bill. It was 8 o'clock last night. The only person that could read this bill is the supercomputers. None of us even claim to be supercomputers.  This rule ought to go down. Very frankly, there are a lot of things in here I know that I like and I know that everybody else likes, but if we defeat the rule, we ought to go back to a process that we can respect, that you argued you were going to follow, that you pledged to the American people you were going to follow, and that Mr. Cantor and Mr. McCarthy and Mr. Ryan wrote a book about and said they were going to change this institution and do it right.  This is wrong. Vote ``no.''                              {time}  1015  Mr. McGOVERN. Mr. Speaker, how much time do I have remaining?
