Speaker, I thank the distinguished gentleman from Massachusetts (Mr. Moakley) for yielding me the time.  Mr. Speaker, today we face, as too often we have, an emergency. That emergency is that we have not done our work; and, therefore, we must pass a continuing resolution to make sure that the Government stays in operation.  This is not the first time that has happened. It has happened under the leadership of both Democrats and Republicans. However, we are in a unique situation. And the emergency of which I speak is not a concocted emergency, as some would call the national census. Nor do we face an ``emergency,'' as some like in dealing with LIHEAP, the Low Income Home Energy Assistance Program.  One does not have to be a Member of Congress or a meteorologist to understand that, come winter, it is going to get cold outside and in some places it is hot and we need to fund LIHEAP.  These are not, however, the real emergencies facing America today. They are the contrived kind of gimmicks designed to do nothing more than to try to help the majority make its budget add up. The real emergencywe are facing here today is this body's inability to get its work done on time.  Under our Constitution, there is only one major legislative task required of Congress, and that is to pass the spending bills that fund the basic operations of Government. We will fail to accomplish that constitutional duty when the current fiscal year ends at midnight on Thursday and the new year begins at 12:01 on Friday.  I, of course, am for this continuing resolution. I would hasten to add that, in my opinion, had the chairman of our committee, the gentleman from Florida (Mr. Young), been leading this effort or, very frankly, the chairman of our subcommittees been leading this effort, particularly the distinguished gentleman from Alabama, we would not be in this position today.  It is, however, the thoughts of a minority of this House that have put us in this position, who, as the ranking member of the Committee on the Budget have observed, have demanded that we do unrealistic things that the majority of this House will not do, which is why the Labor, Health markup was put off at least four times, and now has produced a bill which is unrealistic in terms of what the ranking member so eloquently pointed out. There is no excuse for that.  Frankly, I think the 3-week continuing resolution we are considering today is too long, but it ought to be passed and the President ought to sign it.  When the gentleman from Illinois (Speaker Hastert) took the gavel on January 6, he said, ``We must get our job done. We have an obligation to pass all appropriations bills by this summer.'' We have not done that. Not because of the Committee on Appropriations was not able to do that, but because this House and the Senate were not able to pass the unrealistic demand of a minority of this House.  Since then, the leaders of the majority party repeatedly have told us that their primary goal was to make the trains run on time. Well, we all know that that budget process is running about as efficiently as the Washington, D.C., area does sometimes during a snowstorm.  Look at the numbers. To date, the President has signed into law only one, only one, of the 13 bills that we are supposed to pass. Two await his signature. And a third, the D.C. appropriations bill, clearly is going to be vetoed.  Frankly, let me say on the D.C. bill, everybody knows that that bill is going to be vetoed. We went through an exercise to make a social point, not a budget point, to make a point on one or more issues and to try to embarrass one or more sides. Frankly, we are almost in as bad shape as we were in 1995, when the Federal Government shut down, not once on November 19, 1995, but twice over the holiday period of Christmas and New Year's.  If my colleagues will remember, back on September 30, 1995, Congress had not passed a single spending bill. Over the next 7 months, it took 15 different legislative measures, 15, to fund the Federal Government for fiscal year 1996. The last one, an omnibus appropriations bill, was not enacted until April 26, some 8 months, 7-plus months into the fiscal year. The fiscal year was almost half over.  Now that, Mr. Speaker, in my opinion, was a real emergency. What the American people and more than, frankly, one million Federal employees who were furloughed during the two Government shutdowns during 1995 want to know is this: Is that where we are headed again today?  Now, I say that in the context of the fact that some people on the majority party, not anybody on the Committee on Appropriations are saying, we are not going to talk to the President.  Let me remind my colleagues of an extraordinary speech that Speaker Gingrich gave to what he called the perfectionist caucus of his party. That is the caucus who said, do it my way or no way, and that led to shutdown and no way.  Speaker Gingrich pointed out, I would remind my friends, that the American public have selected Republicans, Democrats, Senators, and a President and they expected us to work together, and we cannot work together, I say to my friend on the majority side, if you will not talk to the coequal branch of Government, headed up by the President of the United States.  Government is the art of compromise. I say ``art'' because it is necessary to accomplish the objectives the American public sent us here to do. It is necessary to do that to talk to one another.  I see my friend, the gentleman from Florida (Chairman Young). I want to tell the American public, if the gentleman from Florida (Chairman Young) were in charge, this would not happen. We would be finished with most of our work, maybe not all of it, but certainly most of it. And the chairman would have sat down with Chairman Stevens and President Clinton, maybe not directly, maybe through staff, maybe on the telephone, but they would have sat down and they would have said, how do we make this work, realizing that nobody is going to get 100 percent.  The tragedy, my friends, is that we ought not to be here today passing a CR but for the intransigence of some. A minority of this House, not the majority, a minority of this House, has tied up these bills with unrealistic expectations both from a policy standpoint and from a fiscal standpoint. What great news we have for the American public in the context of 2 years in a row a budget surplus, the first time in 50 years that that has happened, $115 billion surplus that we have, and yet we are mired in inability to do our work on time.  I thank the gentleman from Massachusetts (Mr. Moakley) for yielding me the time. I, obviously, will support this continuing resolution. But I will say to my friends in this House that I believe we ought not to pass a second resolution 3 weeks from now unless and only if meaningful progress and discussions have been made to reach agreement between those that the people of the United States have elected, the President, the House, and the Senate. We can do our business and we can do it in the next 21 days if that willful minority will let us proceed.                              {time}  1300
