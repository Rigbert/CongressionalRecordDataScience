Speaker, I have before me a speech given by James Lee Witt who was the director of the Federal Emergency Management Agency during the Clinton administration. It is actually testimony given on May 22, 2004. I think it is very relevant to the debate we had here today about what went wrong and how we are going to fix it and how we are going to understand what went wrong.  Basically, Mr. Witt predicted what happened. Here is some of his testimony.  Particularly on this issue of Department of Homeland Security and FEMA as an independent agency as the organization that responded for 8 years to the American people's needs in a customer-serviced focused way, that has been destroyed. It is not there now. It is buried down in the bottom of a huge bureaucracy. It now has no communications within the agency itself, nor does it have communications with State and local government where, before, we had a partnership working with State and local governments.  There is not even communications from FEMA headquarters in Washington to their 10 regional offices. FEMA employees call me constantly. They have got so many vacant offices within FEMA headquarters now that I doubt they could respond to a catastrophic event.  This was testimony on May 22, 2004. Because, when we left in 2001, FEMA was ranked as one of the top agencies in the Federal Government to work for. Just recently in the Washington Post, it was ranked dead last at 28. The morale within the agency is so bad some of the senior level people have quit, some that have the historical knowledge and capabilities to respond, recover, repair, everything the agency did. Our Nation right now suffers on the interoperability of public safety communications. It is zero.  This is James Lee Witt, May 22, 2004, talking about the state of the Federal Emergency Management Agency that this administration had said of the former director, Brownie, you're doing a great job. Of course, Brownie is now gone. But it is a much bigger problem than Brownie, the political hack appointed by the President to head this agency, which had been downgraded, underfunded, and basically dismissed by the Bush administration. It is a problem that is of tremendous magnitude.  Today, the House voted to investigate itself. I doubt that we will get an honest report out of the Republican majority here.  We offered an amendment on the floor. We said: if you put FEMA into this bureaucracy, you will degrade its capabilities. On a virtually partisan line vote, I think 10 brave Republicans voted with us, that amendment was rejected. I guess we were a little bit wrong. It is even worse and quicker than we could have thought that FEMA has been destroyed. It is extraordinary.  I hear so many speeches on the floor every night. One gentleman ended tonight with: ``We will never forget 9/11.'' We will not forget 9/11? What was the most basic lesson of 9/11 that killed many first responders who could have survived? The fact that they did not have secure interoperable communications. And what has the response of this administration been? The President recommended zero dollars to assist local communities, sheriffs, police, fire, emergency personnel to purchase interoperable or upgrade to interoperable communications in his budget this year. And the appropriations moved through this House doing the same.  Now, my colleagues will say, oh, no one could have anticipated this, and how could we have known, and this was a disaster of untold magnitude, and those local officials, they did not do their job. But it is actually the Congress that has to bear a lot of the responsibility here. It was the Congress that agreed with the politically motivated plan out of the White House to stick FEMA into the Homeland Security bureaucracy. It was the Congress that agreed with the President to cut the budget of FEMA, to cut the disaster teams from three to two. And we wonder why they could not respond and why people died unnecessarily?  We need a fair and honest evaluation and investigation comparable to the 9/11 Commission to unearth the facts around this. There are things that need to be done besides restoring FEMA to an independent, professionally led agency status with a robust budget. We are also entering into the greatest rebuilding effort and restoration and relief effort in the history of our country. We need to see that those monies will not be misspent; that those monies will not go to crisis profiteers; that they will get to the people and the communities that need it and the rebuilding will be done appropriately; that we will invest in the infrastructure that was not invested in to protect New Orleans.  And it is not unique to New Orleans. I have jetties failing in the State of Oregon. The Corps of Engineers has no money to fix them. If they fail much more, it will cost 10 times as much to rebuild them. I have a dam that was failing in my district, and the corps had to scramble all around the country to find the money to begin to rebuild that dam. It is not their fault. Congress has not given them the funds, and the President has not recommended the funds to protect the American people from disaster.  So we need to invest not only in a reconstructed FEMA but also in a more robust budget for the Corps of Engineers for prevention. And we need to make certain the dollars we are borrowing, because every dollar of this is borrowed, are spent wisely. And maybe we should reconsider the tax cuts for people who earn over $300,000 a year and have estates worth $600,000. Maybe they should contribute to the recovery effort too.                          ____________________
