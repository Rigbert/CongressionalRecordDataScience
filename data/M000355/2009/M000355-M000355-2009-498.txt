 President, on behalf of Senator Grassley, the ranking Republican on the Finance Committee, I ask unanimous consent that when the Senate resumes consideration of H.R. 1105, the omnibus bill, the pending amendments be set aside and, on behalf of Senator Grassley, it be in order to call up amendment No. 628, which strikes section 102 related to IRS private debt collection.
