Chairman, I thank the gentleman for yielding me the time.   Mr. Chairman, I will not vote for the President's budget, but I will tell my colleagues one thing: This President has brought the budget deficit down. This President, contrary to Mr. Bush, contrary to Mr. Reagan, who in 1981 said, ``If you will only adopt my tax cut, things are going to be rosy.'' They were rosy, all right, all red. All red. All deficits.  I voted for the coalition budget because I thought it was real. The Republican budget is not real. The President, this President, has already brought the budget deficit down 3 years in the running, the first time that has been done since Harry Truman. It will be a 4th year by my Republican colleagues' figures and our figures, which will be the first time in this century that the budget deficit has come down 4 years running.  President Clinton did it because he had the courage to put forth an economic program in 1993 that was real. It was not easy, but it was real, and none on the Republican side voted for it, so they cannot take credit for bringing the deficit down. All they can take credit for is putting it up $4 trillion.
