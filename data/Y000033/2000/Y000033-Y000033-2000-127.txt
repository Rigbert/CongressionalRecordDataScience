Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.  Mr. Speaker, S. 964, the Cheyenne River Sioux Tribe Equitable Compensation Act, addresses a number of specific Indian and public land problems that will assist thousands of Americans.  Title 1 of this bill will establish a Development Trust Fund in the Treasury of the United States for the Cheyenne River Sioux Tribe as compensation for the taking by condemnation proceedings by the United States of 104,492 acres of tribal lands.                              {time}  1800  The Comptroller General has determined that the appropriate amount of compensation to pay the tribe would be $290,723,000 for this taking.  Pursuant to S. 964, that amount and certain interest would be deposited by the Secretary of the Treasury into the Cheyenne River Sioux Tribal Recovery Trust Fund on the first day of the 11th fiscal year that begins after the date of enactment of S. 964.  Annual payments will be made to the tribe consisting of the income generated from the investment of the corpus of the trust fund by the Secretary of the Treasury in interest-bearing obligations to the United States.  Recovery funds have been created by Congress for four other Missouri River tribes which were impacted by the Pick-Sloan Missouri River Basin program.  Title II of S. 964, the Bosque Redondo Memorial Act, authorizes the establishment of a Bosque Redondo Memorial in New Mexico to pay tribute to the 9,000 Navajo Indians forced in the 1800s to walk 350 miles to Bosque Redondo where they were incarcerated for 5 years.  Title III expresses the sense of the Congress that public memorials commemorating military conflicts should be maintained in good condition; andto this end, the Secretary of the Interior should coordinate with Federal, State, and local officials to catalog these memorials and use the resulting information to promote and maintain them. This is based on a concurrent resolution sponsored by our colleague, the gentleman from California (Mr. Rogan).  Title IV requires the sale of a small historic site to the Chugach Alaska Natives and is noncontroversial.  Title V incorporates the provisions of legislation sponsored by the chairman of the Committee on Commerce, the gentleman from Virginia (Mr. Bliley). It adjusts the boundaries of the Richmond National Battlefield Park, expanding and completing the existing battlefield to include historically significant areas relating to the campaigns against, and in defense of, Richmond, Virginia.  Title VI consists of two important sections addressing the needs of southeast Alaska and the Navajo Nation, respectively.  Section 601 authorizes Southeast Alaskan Intertie system, a project critical to the future of southeast Alaska communities. Construction of an intertie will give southeast Alaska access to cheap, plentiful energy afforded through a power grid linking present and future hydroelectric sites. The Southeast Conference and the U.S. Forest Service have conducted a thorough environmental and economic analysis of this project. This section authorizes such sums that may be necessary for construction of the intertie on an 80/20 Federal-local cost-share basis.  The other section establishes a program to assist the Navajo Nation. The problem here is not lack of cheap electricity. It is lack of any electricity in 18,000 structures. In this modern era, it is inconceivable that electricity is unavailable for any Americans. The Federal Government has a responsibility to ensure the welfare of Indians, and to this end the grant program established in Title VI is key to the future well-being of the Navajo Nation.  This is a solid bill. It has been worked out with Senator Daschle. It is his bill. It has been worked out with everybody involved, and I believe it is a bill that should be passed and sent to the President.  Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.
