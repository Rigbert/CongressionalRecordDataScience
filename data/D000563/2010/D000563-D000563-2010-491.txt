 Madam President, yesterday I joined Senator Murray and others in giving my tribute to Senator Byrd, and I will not repeat my remarks. But I look forward to other Members coming to the floor with their own memories and reminiscences of this great man who served this Nation and the State of West Virginia so honorably for so long and the fact that I was honored to serve with him for 14 years in the Senate.                          ____________________
