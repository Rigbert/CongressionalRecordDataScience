Zero. Medicare is a word about which the Republicans don't want to talk. They don't want to use it. Yet we all know that, unless we do something significant for the Medicare program, by the year 2015 this program will be bankrupt and 40 million Americans, elderly and disabled, who rely on Medicare for their health insurance have a time of reckoning that is just over the horizon.  We on the Democratic side believe that if there is going to be any surplus, as the President has suggested, we should dedicate it, first, to any surplus we realize to Social Security; second, to Medicare; and, third, to reducing the national debt.  I ask you: Which is the party of fiscal conservatism?  Listen to this debate: $1 trillion taken out of funds such as the Social Security trust fund to give away to the wealthiest of Americans, which is the Republican plan, or the Democratic plan, which says to take care of priorities--reducing our debt, reducing our need to appropriate money each year for interest on the debt, and making sure that Medicare and Social Security are strong enough to survive.  I think our position is not only fiscally conservative but I think it is fiscally sane. Others will characterize an alternative.
