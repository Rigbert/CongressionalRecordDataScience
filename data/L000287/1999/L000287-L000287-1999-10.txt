Mr. Speaker, it is fitting today, a day on which our Atlanta Braves play for the right to join the New York Yankees in the World Series, that the United States Congress takes the time to pause and honor the contributions of a great Brave, Mr. Henry Aaron.  Number 44 for the Atlanta Braves is the all-time leader in home runs, a record that stands among the greatest in sports. And while records are made to be broken, the spirit of inspiration that Mr. Aaron's example offers to all Americans will stand for all time. I am pleased to join my Georgia colleague, Congressman Saxby Chambliss, in a truly bipartisan effort to ensure that the tremendous achievements of Henry Aaron, the baseball player and the man, are recorded by the U.S. Congress.  We cannot forget the difficult times, the troubled waters, and the lonely bridges that Henry Aaron and his family had to contend with. When a young Henry Aaron dared to dream of being a professional baseball player, he could not have imagined the naked, raw, and uncaring face of discrimination that he would later confront virtually every day. But despite the hurdles that both baseball and life placed in his way, henry Aaron refused to allow his dreams to die. He fought on not only to merely play professional baseball but to surpass the records of Ruth on his way to becoming one of the greatest players of all times. Today I honor Henry Aaron, not only for the thrill of watching a great player swing his way into the record books but for the pride of watching a great man march his way into the history books.  I rise, indeed I ask all of us to rise today in honoring the now and forever Number 44 of the Atlanta Braves, Mr. Henry Aaron.
