 President, as we stand here today women and children are suffering the ravages and privations of war and natural disasters. They are suffering food shortages and lack the most basic necessities in so many nations around the world. Five million people have been affected by the tsunami. Of that 5 million, 1.5 million are children, many alone and parentless, vulnerable to human trafficking, forced recruitment into military service or worse.  We can help. We can do our share by making sure U.S. programs do their share.  Today, I am introducing--along with Senator Lugar--the Protection of Vulnerable Populations During Humanitarian Emergencies Act of 2005, to make vulnerable people, especially women and children, an absolute priority of our foreign assistance programs. As a Nation, as a people, we probably should do more, but we certainly can do no less than to ensure the international community has a system in place to prevent the exploitation of so many lost, vulnerable, suffering women and children who are struggling to survive the most God-awful conditions imaginable.  Over the past fifty years the nature of war has changed dramatically. In today's world, 90 percent of the casualties in any war are civilians, most of them women and children. Since 1990, more than 2 million children have been killed, and 6 million maimed or injured as a result of a war somewhere in this world.  It is extraordinary to think that, in what we believe is the most sophisticated, technologically advanced period in world history, rape has become a routine weapon of war used at will by bands of marauding military forces--some of them young boys--everywhere from Burma to Bosnia, and from Sierra Leone to Sudan.  Forced displacement of civilians, rather than being one of the unfortunate results of war is now a deliberate tactic of war.  Look at Darfur in the last 18 months.  Civilians have been targeted by Khartoum in one of the most horrific genocides we have seen in recent years. Homes have been bombed, and villages attacked. Government sponsored militia are destroying crops and have fouled the water supply. They're burning homes, leaving mothers no choice but to flee for their lives and their children's lives.  Civilians forced to flee during war find their way to camps, but instead of relative safety what do they find? They find more suffering. The camps become virtual prisons. Women and girls are beaten and raped if they venture outside the camps for firewood.  When I recently read a report by a United Nations investigatory team which states that a number of U.N. peacekeepers--U.N. peacekeepers, mind you--deployed to protect civilians from ethnic violence in the eastern Democratic Republic of Congo were sexually exploiting girls as young as 13 years old, it reinforced my belief that we cannot stand by any longer. Something must be done and this bill only begins to do it. Let me read you what that report said:       Interviews with Congolese women and girls confirmed that      sexual contact with peacekeepers occurred with regularity,      usually in exchange for food or small sums of money . . .''       . . . ``Many of the contacts involved girls under the age      of 18.''  What's more horrifying to me: the investigators found that the abuse was going on while they were there, on the ground, conducting the investigation. These incidents as well as allegations of sexual exploitation by camp residents and humanitarian workers in refugee camps in West Africa and Nepal in 2002 are incredible, real life examples of the sad fact that women and children remain vulnerable even in the very places they flee for safety.  This bill seeks to do something about it.  It enhances the U.S. government's ability to see that women and children are protected before, during, and after a complex humanitarian emergency. It directs the Secretary of State to designate a special coordinator for protection issues who will be charged withmaking sure our embassies and consular posts are made aware of the warning signs that an emergency which may put the lives and safety of women and children at risk is imminent.  It directs the coordinator to compile a watch list of such countries and regions so that the Agency for International Development can plan to meet potential need. It prohibits U.S. funding for relief agencies that do not sign a code of conduct that outlaws improper exploitative relationships between aid workers and recipients.  It expresses the Sense of Congress that the U.N. Department of Peacekeeping Operations should improve its mechanism to prevent and respond to allegations of sexual exploitation and abuse by peacekeepers.  It establishes a fellowship with the AID for someone with expertise and skills in preventing and responding to violence and exploitation of those made vulnerable by war.  It calls upon the United States Executive Director of the International Bank of Reconstruction and Development to try to make sure World Bank demobilization, disarmament, and reintegration programs extend the same benefits that ex-combatants receive to women and children who were associated with them.  As it now stands, women and children who were used as cooks and porters and so called ``wives,'' a euphemism for women who were kidnaped to serve as sexual slaves, may well not be given a single thing through these programs--nothing with which to rebuild their lives despite the fact that they were not there by choice. Yet the very people who forced them into such conditions receive assistance with no qualms or reservations.  Finally, it amends the Foreign Assistance Act to authorize programs and activities specifically aimed at making people--especially women and children--who are affected by humanitarian emergencies safer from further exploitation and abuse.  This bill is by no means a panacea, but it is a decent beginning. It is the least we can do to mitigate the extraordinary violence against women and children in times of war and natural disasters the results of which we see all too often in a world that seems to have gone mad.  To do nothing in the face of it would be sinful, inhumane, and wrong.  I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be printed in the Record.  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the Record, as follows:                                 S. 559       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of      the United States of America in Congress assembled,     SECTION 1.

SEC. 4. FINDINGS.       Congress makes the following findings:       (1) The nature of war has changed dramatically in recent      decades, putting civilians, especially women and children, at      greater risk of death, disease, displacement, and      exploitation.       (2) In the last decade alone, more than 2,000,000 children      have been killed during wars, while more than 4,000,000 have      survived physical mutilation, and more than 1,000,000 have      been orphaned or separated from their families as a result of      war.       (3) The use of rape, particularly against women and girls,      is an increasingly common tactic in modern war.       (4) Civilians, particularly women and children, account for      the vast majority of those adversely affected by humanitarian      emergencies, including as refugees and internally displaced      persons, and increasingly are targeted by combatants and      armed elements for murder, abduction, forced military      conscription, involuntary servitude, displacement, sexual      abuse and slavery, mutilation, and loss of freedom.       (5) Large-scale natural disasters, such as the tsunami that      struck South East Asia, South Asia, and East Africa on      December 26, 2004, and claimed over 200,000 lives, are      particularly threatening to children, who are often orphaned      or separated from their families.       (6) Traditionally, the response to such humanitarian      emergencies has focused on providing food, medical care, and      shelter needs, and has placed less emphasis on the safety and      security of those affected by a humanitarian emergency.       (7) Refugee women and girls face particular threats because      of power inequities, including being forced to exchange sex      for food and humanitarian supplies, and being at increased      risk of rape and sexual exploitation and abuse due to poor      security in refugee camps.       (8) In some circumstances, humanitarian agencies have      failed to make individuals affected by a humanitarian      emergency, especially women and children, aware of their      rights to protection and assistance, to give them access to      effective channels of redress, and to make humanitarian      workers aware of their duty to respect these rights and      provide adequate assistance.       (9) Refugee and displaced women face heightened risks of      developing complications     during pregnancy, suffering a miscarriage, dying, being      injured during childbirth, becoming infected with HIV or      another sexually transmitted infection, or suffering from      posttraumatic stress disorder.       (10) Despite the heightened risks for women during a      humanitarian emergency, women's needs for specialized health      services have often been overlooked by donors and relief      organizations, which are focused on providing food, water,      and shelter.       (11) There is a substantial need for the protection of      civilians, especially women and children, to be given a high      priority during all humanitarian emergencies.
