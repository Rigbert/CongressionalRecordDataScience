President, let me pause in this class warfare for just a minute to make a couple of observations that I think are certainly important to me.  First of all, I agree that no one has said that the underlying bill is perfect.  Incidentally, I will not respond to the Senator's specific request until I have time to go back and get the proper response, and then I will be glad to do it. But I will say this. We are going to have a conference.
