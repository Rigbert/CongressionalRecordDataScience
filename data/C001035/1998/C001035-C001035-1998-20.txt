President, I rise to congratulate the UNUM Corporation on its 150th Anniversary.  UNUM is based in Portland, Maine, has offices across America and around the globe, and enjoys a reputation for excellence throughout the world.  July 17, 1998 marks the 150th Anniversary of the UNUM Corporation, a company incorporated in Maine in 1848 as Union Mutual Life Insurance Company.  Throughout the past 150 years, UNUM has stayed true to the charge of its founder Elisha B. Pratt to ``find the better way'' and is known today as the company that ``sees farther.''  UNUM has become the world leader in disability insurance and consistently ranks among the best places to work in America.  UNUM has chosen to celebrate its July 17 anniversary by having thousands of its employees volunteer a ``Day of Sharing'' to more than 200 community service projects in six countries.  UNUM's ``Day of Sharing'' builds on a record of community partnership that includes contributing more than 75,000 employee volunteer hours during each of the past five years and the UNUM Foundation contributing $2 million to community programs last year alone.  Not only is UNUM an outstanding and exemplary business leader, providing insurance protection to its customers, it is also an invaluable community partner, improving the communities where its employees have lived and worked for 150 years.  Today, I ask my colleagues in the Senate to join me in congratulating and commending UNUM on its 150th anniversary and its outstanding achievements as a business leader and community partner.
