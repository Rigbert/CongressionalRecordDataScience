President, I am delighted that the majority leader had decided to take up the nomination of Judge Anthony W. Ishii to be a United States District Judge for the Eastern District of California. Judge Ishii is an outstanding nominee. He is currently a municipal court judge in Fresno, California. The ABA found him to be well-qualified, its highest rating.  We first received Anthony Ishii's nomination on February 12, 1997, almost eight months ago. He had a confirmation hearing on June 25, where he was strongly supported by both California Senators. He was favorably reported by the Judiciary Committee back on July 10. There has been no explanation or justification for the delay in bringing this nomination forward from the Senate calendar. I am sure that Judge Ishii and his family are happy that their long wait is now over. I congratulate them and look forward to his service on the District Court.  Unfortunately, the Republican leadership has chosen again to skip over the nomination of Margaret Morrow. In spite of the adoption of the Wysen-Grassley amendment earlier this month, an amendment that calls upon Senators to come forward within two days of exercising a hold to identify themselves, Margaret Morrow's nomination has been the subject of an anonymous and mysterious hold over a period of two years and most recently since being reported on June 12, almost four months ago.  On September 29 Senator Hatch reiterated his continuing support for the nomination of Margaret Morrow and announced that he will vote for her. He said: ``I have found her to be qualified and I will support her. Undoubtedly, there will be some who will not, but she deserved to have her vote on the floor. I have been assured by the majority leader that she will have her vote on the floor. I intend to argue for and on her behalf.''  I have looked forward to that debate since June 12. I ask, again, why not now, why not today, why not this week? This is a nomination that has been pending for far too long and that has been stalled here on the floor twice over two years without justification. Last year this nomination was unanimously reported by the Judiciary Committee and was left to wither without action for over three months. This year, the Committee again reported her nomination favorably and it has been pending for another four months. There has been no explanation for this delay and no justification. This good woman does not deserve this shameful treatment.  Meanwhile, the people served by the District Court for the Central District of California continue to suffer the affects of this persistent vacancy--cases are not heard, criminal cases are not being tried. This is one of more than 28 vacancies that have persisted for so long that they are classified as ``judicial emergency'' vacancies by the Administrative Office of the United States Courts.  When the President spoke out in his national radio address, he asked that the delay in the consideration of judicial nominees come to an end. Unfortunately, the delay continues with respect to too many nominations, including that of Margaret Morrow.                   nomination of katharine g. abraham
