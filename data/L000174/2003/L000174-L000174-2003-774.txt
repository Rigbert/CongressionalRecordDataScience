President, I am pleased to join today with Senator McCaine to submit our bipartisan resolution to make Congressional Research Service products available over the Internet to the American people. I also want to thank the Project on Government Oversight for its excellent report on the need for access to CRS information.  The Congressional Research Service has a well-known reputation for producing high-quality reports and information briefs that are unbiased, concise and accurate. The taxpayers of this country, who pay millions of dollars a year to fund the CRS, deservespeedy access to these public resources and have a right to see that their money is being spent well.  The goal of our bipartisan legislation is to allow every citizen the same access to the wealth of CRS information as a Member of Congress enjoys today. CRS performs invaluable research and produces first-rate reports on hundreds of topics. American taxpayers have every right to have direct access to these wonderful resources.  Our legislation ensures that private CRS products will remain protected by giving the CRS Director the authority to hold back any products that are deemed confidential. Moreover, the Director may protect the identity of CRS researchers and any copyrighted material. We can do both--protect confidential material and empower our citizens through electronic access to invaluable CRS products.  The Internet offers us a unique opportunity to allow the American people to have everyday access to this public information. Our bipartisan legislation would harness the power of the Information Age to allow average citizens to see these public records of the Senate in their official form, in context and without editorial comment.  All of these reports are ``public'' for only those who can afford to hire a lawyer or lobbyist, or who can afford to physically travel to Washington to visit the Office of Public Records in the Hart Building and read them. Indeed, the Project on Government Oversight reports that over 150 registered lobbyists are former Members of Congress who have automatic access to CRS documents. That is not very ``public,'' and does almost nothing for the average voter in Vermont or the rest of this country who does not have easy access to Washington.  We can do better, and this resolution does better. Under our resolution, any citizen in any corner of this country with access to a computer at home, at the office or at the public library will be able to get on the Internet and get these important congressional documents under our resolution. It allows individual citizens to check the facts, to make comparisons, and to make up their own minds.  I commend the senior Senator from Arizona for his leadership on this and similar issues. I share his desire for the American people to have electronic access to many more congressional resources. I look forward to working with him in the coming days to let the information age open up the Halls of Congress to all our citizens.  As Thomas Jefferson wrote, ``Information is the currency of democracy.'' Our democracy is stronger if all citizens have equal access to at least the ``congressional-type'' of currency, and that is something in which Members on both sides of the aisle can celebrate and join.                                 ______                                 SENATE CONCURRENT RESOLUTION 4--WELCOMING THE EXPRESSION OF SUPPORT OF   18 EUROPEAN NATIONS FOR THE ENFORCEMENT OF UNITED NATIONS SECURITY                         COUNSEL RESOLUTION 1441  Mr. McCAIN (for himself, Mr. Lieberman, Mr. Graham of South Carolina, and Mr. Bayh) submitted the following concurrent resolution; which was referred to the Committee on Foreign Relations:                             S. Con. Res. 4       Whereas on November 8, 2002, the United Nations Security      Council approved Security Council Resolution 1441 under      Chapter VII of the United Nations Charter by a vote of 15-0,      giving Iraq ``a final opportunity to comply with its      disarmament obligations'';       Whereas on November 21, 2002, the North Atlantic Treaty      Organization's North Atlantic Council unanimously approved a      declaration stating, ``We deplore Iraq's failure to comply      fully with its obligations which were imposed as a necessary      step to restore international peace and security and we      recall that the Security Council has decided in its      resolution to afford Iraq a final opportunity to comply with      its disarmament obligations under relevant resolutions of the      Council.'';       Whereas the North Atlantic Council stated, ``NATO Allies      stand united in their commitment to take effective action to      assist and support the efforts of the United Nations to      ensure full and immediate compliance by Iraq, without      conditions or restrictions, with United Nations Security      Council Resolution 1441. We recall that the Security Council      in this resolution has warned Iraq that it will face serious      consequences as a result of its continued violation of its      obligations.'';       Whereas, on January 30, 2003, the Prime Ministers of      Denmark, Italy, Hungary, Poland, Portugal, Spain, and the      United Kingdom, and the President of the Czech Republic      (``The Eight''), issued a declaration regarding Security      Council Resolution 1441;       Whereas in their declaration, The Eight stated, ``The      transatlantic relationship must not become a casualty of the      current Iraqi regime's persistent attempts to threaten world      security. . . . The Iraqi regime and its weapons of mass      destruction represent a clear threat to world security. This      danger has been explicitly recognized by the United Nations.      All of us are bound by Security Council Resolution 1441,      which was adopted unanimously.'';       Whereas The Eight stated, ``Resolution 1441 is Saddam      Hussein's last chance to disarm using peaceful means. The      opportunity to avoid greater confrontation rests with him. .      . . Our governments have a common responsibility to face this      threat. . . . [T]he Security Council must maintain its      credibility by ensuring full compliance with its resolutions.      We cannot allow a dictator to systematically violate those      resolutions. If they are not complied with, the Security      Council will lose its credibility and world peace will suffer      as a result.'';       Whereas on February 5, 2003, the Foreign Ministers of      Albania, Bulgaria, Croatia, Estonia, Latvia, Lithuania,      Macedonia, Romania, Slovakia, and Slovenia (``The Ten'')      issued a declaration regarding Security Council Resolution      1441;       Whereas in their declaration, The Ten stated, ``[T]he      United States [has] presented compelling evidence to the      United Nations Security Council detailing Iraq's weapons of      mass destruction programs, its active efforts to deceive      United Nations inspectors, and its links to international      terrorism. . . . The transatlantic community, of which we are      a part, must stand together to face the threat posed by the      nexus of terrorism and dictators with weapons of mass      destruction.'';       Whereas The Ten stated, ``[I]t has now become clear that      Iraq is in material breach of United Nations Security Council      resolutions, including United Nations Resolution 1441. . . .      The clear and present danger posed by Saddam Hussein's regime      requires a united response from the community of democracies.      We call upon the United Nations Security Council to take the      necessary and appropriate action in response to Iraq's      continuing threat to international peace and security.'':      Now, therefore, be it       Resolved by the Senate (the House of Representatives      concurring), That Congress welcomes--       (1) the expression of support from Albania, Bulgaria,      Croatia, the Czech Republic, Denmark, Estonia, Hungary,      Italy, Latvia, Lithuania, Macedonia, Poland, Portugal,      Romania, Slovakia, Slovenia, Spain, and the United Kingdom      for Iraq's full compliance with Security Council Resolution      1441; and       (2) their expression of solidarity with the United States      in calling for the demands of the Security Council to be met      with regard to Iraq's full disarmament.                          ____________________
