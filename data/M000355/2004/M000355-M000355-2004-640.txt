  I don't think we should be afraid of this at all. I think the Senator from New Hampshire is precisely on target. This is why the voting record of, say, for example, the Democratic nominee for President reflects a belief in free trade, a consistent pattern of voting for free trade agreements.  I hope this bipartisan support we have had for breaking down barriers and competing in the word market and moving in the direction of free trade will not be jeopardized in this Presidential election year.
