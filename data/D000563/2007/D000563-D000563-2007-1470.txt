President, today I am pleased to introduce legislation to designate the U.S. Post Office at 2633 11th Street in Rock Island, IL, as the ``Lane Evans Post Office Building.''  For over 20 years, Lane Evans has been my closest friend in the Illinois congressional delegation. We came to the House of Representatives together and he proved to be an indomitable force. Time and again, Lane Evans showed extraordinary political courage fighting for the values that brought him to public service. But his greatest show of courage has been over the last 10 years as he battled Parkinson's disease and those who tried to exploit his physical weakness. His dignity and perseverance in the face of this relentless and cruel disease is an inspiration to everyone who knows Lane Evans.  I am pleased to offer this legislation to permanently and publicly recognize Lane Evans and his service to his congressional district, our State of Illinois, and the entire United States by naming the Rock Island Post Office in his honor. It would be a most appropriate way for us to express our appreciation to Congressman Evans and to commemorate his public life and work.  I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be printed in the Record.  There being no objection, the text of the bill was ordered to be printed in the Record, as follows:                                 S. 412       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of      the United States of America in Congress assembled,     SECTION 1. LANE EVANS POST OFFICE BUILDING.       (a) Designation.--The facility of the United States Postal      Service located at 2633 11th Street in Rock Island, Illinois,      shall be known and designated as the ``Lane Evans Post Office      Building''.       (b) References.--Any reference in a law, map, regulation,      document, paper, or other record of the United States to the      facility referred to in subsection (a) shall be deemed to be      a reference to the ``Lane Evans Post Office Building''.                                 ______                                       By
