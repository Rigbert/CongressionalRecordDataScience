 Madam Speaker, I rise in support of H.R. 6338, the Geneva Distinctive Emblems Protection Act of 2006. Introduced by the gentleman from Arizona (Mr. Flake), this legislation will assist in the implementation of important humanitarian programs. The Geneva Convention has long provided for the use of the Red Cross and Red Crescent emblems by governments and national societies to implement medical and humanitarian programs.  In December of 2005, the Geneva Convention, through the Third Additional Protocol, adopted a third distinctive emblem, the Red Crystal, to join the Red Cross and Red Crescent emblems. The adoption of the Red Crystal emblem cleared the path, with the acceptance of Israel's version of the Red Cross, into the Red Cross and Red Crescent movement after being excluded for more than 30 years.  The approval of the Red Crystal emblem provides the American Red Cross, United States military personnel and humanitarian organizations and workers with another option in the circumstances where the Red Cross or the Red Crescent may not be perceived as a neutral emblem. On the day of its adoption, 27 countries, including the United States, signed the Third Additional Protocol.  Since its adoption, the protocol has been signed by more than 49 other nations and becomes effective on January 14, 2007. Current United States law prohibits anyone, including corporations and associations, from wearing or displaying the American National Red Cross emblem or similar insignia for fraudulent purposes. This bill extends these same prohibitions and protections to the Red Crystal emblem and to the Red Crescent emblem by imposing a fine or a prison term for up to 6 months for fraudulently wearing or displaying the Red Crystal and Red Crescent emblems.  This legislation will help deter the fraudulent use of vital symbols of medical and humanitarian aid. I urge my colleagues to join together to pass this bipartisan legislation.  Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.
