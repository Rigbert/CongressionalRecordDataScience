 President, I rise today for two reasons. First, I want to talk about two little girls whose short lives have had an impact far beyond their youthful imaginings. Unlike their families and friends, we do not know them for the love they gave, nor do we know of them for their academic ability or artistic talents. Sadly, unlike their families and friends, we did not know them while they were alive--we know them only because of their tragic deaths.  The second reason I rise today is to introduce legislation with Senator Hutchison which is designed to prevent other children from suffering their fate, the Amber Hagerman Child Protection Act of 1996. I ask that a copy of the bill be printed in full following my remarks. An earlier version of this bill was introduced in the House by Representative Martin Frost of Texas.  The first little girl I want to tell you about is Polly Klaas. Many people throughout our Nation have come to know about this 12-year-old girl from Petaluma, CA, a small, close-knit community north of San Francisco, and the tragic circumstances of her death.  Polly was kidnaped from her bedroom on October 1, 1993, by a bearded, knife-wielding man who tied her up and threatened to slit her friends' throats as her mother slept in a nearby room. Polly and her friends--who were over for a slumber party--were playing a board game at the time of the abduction.  Immediately after the assailant had fled with Polly, her two friends awakened her mother, Eve Nichols, and she called 911: ``Apparently, a man just broke into our house,'' she said, her voice rising in panic, ``and they say he took my daughter.''  Richard Allen Davis, a 41-year old parolee with two previous kidnaping convictions and a history of psychotic behavior, was arrested on November 30, 1993, and 4 days later, police say, he led them to her body, dumped beside a highway. Next to Polly's body, police found a specialty condom identical to one Davis had bought at the adult novelty store Seductions a day or two before the kidnapping, according to the store's former owner. Polly's clothes were pushed up to her waist.  At Davis' trial, prosecutors presented expert testimony that Davis' abduction of Polly was motivated by a desire to gratify his sexual tastes for bondage.  Last month, Davis was convicted of all ten counts against him, including attempting a lewd act with a minor.  The second little girl I want to tell you about, Amber Hagerman, was visiting her grandparents on January 13 of this year, the day she was kidnaped. An eyewitness later told police that he saw a white or Hispanic man pull the child from her pink tricycle and drag her into a black pickup truck.  She was found dead 4 days later--her clothes stolen from her lifeless little body--in a creek behind an apartment complex. Police have made no arrests for the murder of Amber Hagerman, but are continuing to follow every lead.  Amber's killer is still free and her family continues to feel the pain caused by the loss of their beloved daughter. Just a few weeks ago, Amber's grief stricken mother, Donna Whitson, released an open letter to her daughter's unknown assailant. In it, she said:       [I]t has now been 122 days since I last saw my daughter      alive. One hundred twenty-two days since I felt her happiness      in my life. One hundred and twenty-two days ago, you tore my      baby girl from her family's love * * * [Y]ou destroyed      forever the happiness, harmony and dreams that my children      and I had been working so hard to bring to fruition. Our      plans for the future altered because of you.''  Imagine if you can, trying to comprehend what your own child's last moments of life were like, or trying to fathom the pain and fear felt by your own flesh and blood as they lived them. Donna Whitson has probably done so every day since the loss of her daughter. In her open letter, she asked her daughter's killer:       At what point between the time you stole my baby and the      time she was returned did you murder my child? Why had you      drained the life from her body? How could you steal the      clothes from her lifeless body and dump her like trash thrown      along the wayside?  Mr. President, it is for these two children and their families that we must join with Donna Whitson to say loud and clear that the abduction of children and child sexual abuse will not be tolerated by this society.                             The Crime Bill  Two years ago, Congress acknowledged that action must be taken to stop child sexual abuse when it passed the President's crime bill.  The Violent Crime Control Act contained several tough provisions to combat child sexual abuse. More specifically, the crime bill:  Established guidelines for State programs that require persons convicted of crimes against children, including sexual misconduct with a minor, to register their addresses with an appropriate State law enforcement agency for 10 years after their release from prison;  Sexually violent predators must remain registered until a court determines that they no longer suffer from a mental abnormality that would make a predatory sexually violent offense likely.  The crime bill also doubled the maximum prison term for offenders who commit a sexual abuse or sexual contact offense under Federal law after one or more prior convictions for a Federal or State sexual abuse or sexual contact offense.  I strongly believe that this landmark legislation will go a long way toward protecting our Nation's children.  Earlier this year, the President signed Megan's Law, which requires that State law enforcement agencies release information that is necessary to protect the public from convicted sex offenders in their midst. This change in the law was part of the Amber Hagerman Child Protection Act as it was introduced in the House.  Yet, much more needs to be done.                The Amber Hagerman Child Protection Act  Clearly, too many children suffer the physical and emotional impact of kidnaping and it must be stopped before more kids like Polly Klaas and Amber Hagerman fall victim to its tragic effects.  Child sexual abuse must be stopped by taking sexual predators off our streets. Swift, sure action must be taken to stop child sexual abuse, and penalties must be increased for those who commit this heinous crime.  The Amber Hagerman Child Protection Act will help accomplish this goal in several ways:  The heart of the bill is a tough ``two strikes and you're out'' provision for child sex offenders. First, the bill adds life imprisonment for a second offense where the second offense is a Federal one. Second, this legislation also reduces Byrne grant funding by 10 percent to States which do not pass a similar two strikes provision to ensure that all States take this important step to help save our children from sexual abuse.  This legislation expands Federal child sexual abuse statutes to cover instances when the perpetrator crosses State lines with the intent to commit the offense, or commits the offense in interstate or foreign commerce.  Lastly, the bill establishes a national database for sex offenders and child kidnappers to be maintained by the FBI; and makes that database accessible to appropriate State law enforcement officials.  The bill that we are introducing today differs from the House bill in two ways. First, because enhanced community notification has, fortunately, been enacted into law as Megan's Law, that provision is no longer necessary. Second, the House bill contains an explicit death penalty for killing a child in the course of a Federal sex offense. I agree that such an evil and perverted act deserves the death penalty; however, I believe that the death penalty which already exists in Federal law, and which would apply to this heinous act under our bill, is preferable, as it is slightly broader than the penalty in the House bill.                               Conclusion  Mr. President, the sick, tragic deaths of Polly Klaas and Amber Hagerman serve as stark reminders that from tragedy and grief can come constructive action and effective solutions, such as the crime bill's three strikes initiative to incarcerate for life the most dangerous criminals in our society.  We have much work to do to ensure the safety of our children from abduction and sexual abuse; passing this bipartisan legislation is a vital part of that effort. As a banner across the building in which the Polly Klaas Foundation is headquartered says: ``We ache. We grieve. We're angry. We're not done.''  I urge all of my colleagues to give their support to the Amber Hagerman Child Protection Act.  Mr. President, on behalf of Senator Hutchison and myself, I send the bill to the desk.
