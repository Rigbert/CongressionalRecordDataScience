Con. Res. 11       Whereas the United States Government has consistently      supported efforts to address the rise in anti-Semitism      through its bilateral relationships and through engagement in      international organizations such as the United Nations, the      Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe (OSCE),      and the Organization of American States;       Whereas, in 2004, Congress passed the Global Anti-Semitism      Review Act (Public Law 108-332), which established an Office      to Monitor and Combat Anti-Semitism, headed by a Special      Envoy to Monitor and Combat Anti-Semitism;       Whereas the Department of State, the Office for Democratic      Institutions and Human Rights of the OSCE, and others have      reported that periods of Arab-Israeli tension have sparked an      increase in attacks against Jewish communities around the      world and comparisons of policies of the Government of Israel      to those of the Nazis and that, despite growing efforts by      governments to promote Holocaust remembrance, the Holocaust      is frequently invoked as part of anti-Semitic harassment to      threaten and offend Jews;       Whereas, since the commencement of Israel's military      operation in Gaza on December 27, 2008, a substantial      increase in anti-Semitic violence, including physical and      verbal attacks, arson, and vandalism against synagogues,      cemeteries, and Holocaust memorial sites, has been reported;       Whereas, among many other examples of the dramatic rise of      anti-Semitism around the world, over 220 anti-Semitic      incidents have been reported to the Community Security Trust      in London since December 27, 2008, approximately eight times      the number recorded during the same period last year, and the      main Jewish association in France, Counsel Representatif des      Institutions Juives de France, recorded more than 100 attacks      in January, including car bombs launched at synagogues, a      difference from 20 to 25 a month for the previous year;       Whereas, interspersed with expressions of legitimate      criticism of Israeli policy and actions, anti-Semitic imagery      and comparisons of Jews and Israel to Nazis have been      widespread at demonstrations in the United States, Europe,      and Latin America against Israel's actions, and placards held      at many demonstrations across the globe have compared Israeli      leaders to Nazis, accused Israel of carrying out a      ``Holocaust'' against Palestinians, and equated the Jewish      Star of David with the Nazi swastika;       Whereas, in some countries, demonstrations have included      chants of ``death to Israel,'' expressions of support for      suicide terrorism against Israeli or Jewish civilians, and      have been followed by violence and vandalism against      synagogues and Jewish institutions;       Whereas some government leaders have exemplified courage      and resolve against this trend, including President Nicolas      Sarkozy of France, who said he ``utterly condemned the      unacceptable violence, under the pretext of this conflict,      against individuals, private property, and religious      buildings,'' and assured ``that these acts would not go      unpunished,'' Justice Minister of the Netherlands Ernst      Hirsch Ballin, who announced on January 14, 2009, that he      would investigate allegations of anti-Semitism and incitement      to hatred and violence at anti-Israel demonstrations, and      parliamentarians who have voiced concern, such as the British      Parliament's All-Party Group Against Anti-Semitism, which      expressed its ``horror as a wave of anti-Semitic incidents      has affected the Jewish community'';       Whereas, despite these actions, too few government leaders      in Europe, the Middle     East, and Latin America have taken action against the anti-     Semitic environments in their countries and in some cases      have even promoted violence;       Whereas other leaders have made hostile pronouncements      against Israel and Jews, including the President of      Venezuela, Hugo Chavez, who called Israel's actions a      ``Holocaust against the Palestinian people'' and singled out      Venezuela's Jewish community, demanding that they publicly      renounce Israel's ``barbaric acts'' and in so doing implying      that the Jewish community is co-responsible for any actions      by the Government of Israel and thus a legitimate target, the      leader of Hamas, Mahmoud al-Zahar, who recently called for      Jewish children to be attacked around the world, and the      Supreme Leader of Iran, Ayatollah Ali Khameini, who vowed to      confer the status of ``martyr'' on ``anyone who dies in this      holy struggle against World Zionism'';       Whereas incitement to violence against Jews also continues      in state-run media, particularly in the Middle East, where      government-owned, government-sanctioned, or government-     controlled publishing houses publish newspapers which      promulgate anti-Jewish stereotypes and the myth of the Jewish      blood libels in editorial cartoons and articles, produce and      broadcast anti-Semitic dramatic and documentary series, and      produce Arabic translations of anti-Semitic tracts such as      ``The Protocols of the Elders of Zion'' and ``Mein Kampf'';       Whereas Jewish communities face an environment in which the      convergence of anti-Semitic sentiment and demonization of      Israel in the public debate have fostered a hostile      environment and a sense of global insecurity, especially in      places such as Belgium, Argentina, Venezuela, Spain, and      South Africa;       Whereas, in response, the United States Government and      other governments and multilateral institutions have      supported international government and civil society efforts      to monitor and report on anti-Semitic activities and      introduce preventive initiatives such as tolerance education      and Holocaust Remembrance; and       Whereas challenges still remain, with the governments of      many countries failing to implement and fund preventive      efforts, accurately track and report anti-Semitic crimes, and      prosecute offenders: Now, therefore, be it       Resolved by the Senate (the House of Representatives      concurring), That Congress--       (1) unequivocally condemns all forms of anti-Semitism and      rejects attempts to rationalize anti-Jewish hatred or attacks      as a justifiable expression of disaffection or frustration      over political events in the Middle East or elsewhere;       (2) decries the comparison of Jews to Nazis perpetrating a      Holocaust or genocide as a pernicious form of anti-Semitism,      an insult to the memory of those who perished in the      Holocaust, and an affront both to those who survived and the      righteous gentiles who saved Jewish lives at peril to their      own and who fought to defeat the Nazis;       (3) calls on leaders to speak out against manifestations of      anti-Semitism that have entered the public debate about the      Middle East;       (4) applauds those foreign leaders who have condemned anti-     Semitic acts and calls on those who have yet to take firm      action against anti-Semitism in their countries to do so;       (5) reaffirms its support for the mandate of the Special      Envoy to Monitor and Combat Anti-Semitism; and       (6) urges the Secretary of State--       (A) to maintain the fight against anti-Semitism as a      foreign policy priority of the Untied States and to convey      the concerns of the United States Government in bilateral      meetings;       (B) to continue to raise with United States allies in the      Middle East their failure to halt incitement to violence      against Jews, including through the use of government-run      media;       (C) to urge governments to promote tolerance education and      establish mechanisms to monitor, investigate, and punish      anti-Semitic crimes, including through utilization of the      education, law enforcement training, and civil society      capacity building initiatives of the Tolerance and Non-     discrimination Department of the Organization for Security      and Cooperation in Europe (OSCE);       (D) to swiftly appoint the Special Envoy to Monitor and      Combat Anti-Semitism of the Department of State;       (E) to ensure that Department of State Annual Country      Reports on Human Rights and International Religious Freedom      Reports continue to report on incidents of anti-Semitism and      the efforts of foreign governments to address the problem;       (F) to provide necessary training and tools for United      States embassies and missions to recognize these trends; and       (G) to ensure that initiatives of the United States      Government to train law enforcement abroad incorporate tools      to address anti-Semitism.
