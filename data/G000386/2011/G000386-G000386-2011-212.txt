 I hope he comes forward with a strong program to get the budget deficit down because Presidential leadership will help us get the job done. Congress can do it on its own, but it will be a lot easier if we know we are working with the President instead of against the President.  I hope the President's remarks reflect the fact that elections have consequences and the consequence of the last election was a very strong message to Washington that we ought to get spending down and government ought to be smaller. In anticipation of what he says, I wish to make some remarks, and my anticipation is based upon things that have already been said from the White House by staff about the direction the President's speech is taking.  If we learned anything during the last 2 years, it is that America can't tax and spend its way back to prosperity.
