President, during the past year, I and other Senators have urged the Government of Kenya to effectively address reports of egregious misconduct by its police and military forces, including torture and summary executions. The Mount Elgon killings, culminating in the slaughter of some 200 people by the police and army soldiers in 2008, were particularly appalling, yet the government has yet to conduct a credible, transparent, thorough investigation.  We now have the report of the United Nations Special Rapporteur, which confirms, again, the conclusions of multiple human rights organizations. I would hope that the Government of Kenya recognizes that it is in its interest, and that it has a responsibility, to promptly implement the Special Rapporteur's recommendations.  Kenya is an ally and friend of the United States. In fact, we are training some of Kenya's security forces. It is imperative that these violations be addressed urgently and decisively, and that the individuals involved in these atrocities, including those who gave the orders, are brought to justice.  I ask unanimous consent that a press release on the Special Rapporteur's report be printed in the Record.  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in the Record, as follows:                From the Press Center--U.N. Headquarters       Nairobi, February 25, 2009.--Today, the UN Special      Rapporteur on extrajudicial executions, Mr. Philip Alston,      concluded his 16-25 February 2009 fact-finding mission to      Kenya.       The UN independent expert stated that, ``Killings by police      in Kenya are systematic, widespread and carefully planned.      They are committed at will and with utter impunity.'' He also      found that death squads were set up upon the orders of senior      police officials to exterminate the Mungiki.       He called on the President of Kenya to acknowledge the      widespread problem of extrajudicial executions in Kenya and      to commit to systemic reform. ``Effective leadership on this      issue can only come from the very top, and sweeping reforms      to the policing sector should begin with the immediate      dismissal of the Police Commissioner,'' concluded the      independent expert. ``Further, given his role in encouraging      the impunity that exists in Kenya, the Attorney-General      should resign so that the integrity of the office can be      restored.''       In addition, the Special Rapporteur found compelling      evidence that in Mt Elgon, the police and military committed      organised torture and extrajudicial executions against      civilians during their 2008 operation to flush out the Sabaot      Land Defence Force militia. ``For two years, the SLDF militia      terrorized the population and the Government did far too      little. And when the Government did finally act, they      responded with their own form of terror and brutality,      killing over 200 people.'' He said that since the security      forces had not investigated the allegations in any convincing      manner ``the Government should immediately act to set up an      independent commission for Mount Elgon, modeled on the Waki      Commission''.       With respect to the accountability for the post-election      violence, the Special Rapporteur stated that the setting up      of the Special Tribunal for Kenya was ``absolutely      indispensible to ensure that Kenya does not again descend      into chaos during the 2012 elections.'' He called on civil      society and the international community to take a firm line      on its establishment. ``At the same time, this is an ideal      case for the ICC to urgently take up'', he added, stressing      that the two approaches were not mutually exclusive and a      two-track approach should be adopted.       The Special Rapporteur also recommended that an independent      civilian police oversight body be established, that records      of police killings be centralized, that an independent      Department of Public Prosecutions be created, across-the-     board vetting of the police be undertaken, the setting up of      an independent witness protection program, that the      Government issue substantive responses to KNCHR reports, and      compensation for the victims of those unlawfully killed.       In the course of his ten-day visit, the Special Rapporteur      visited Nairobi, Central, Rift Valley, Western and Nyanza      Provinces. He conducted in-depth private interviews with more      than one hundred victims and witnesses. Mr. Alston met with      senior Government officials, including the Prime Minister,      the Minister of Justice, the Assistant Minister of Defence,      the Chief of Police and the Chief of Staff of the Armed      Forces, as well as officials at the provincial and district      levels. He also met with the Kenya National Commission on      Human Rights, the independent national human rights      institution, as well as with civil society organizations.
