Mr. Speaker, this bill is a good bill. It is a good bill because President Clinton and Democrats stood up for working Americans and demanded tax relief for working families.  In 1993, Democrats made hard budget choices, hard choices that have brought millions of jobs and economic prosperity to our Nation. Because of those hard choices, we are close to balancing our budget. Because of those hard choices, we can give tax cuts to the American people.  Today again, Democrats have succeeded. President Clinton and Democrats in Congress have turned a Republican tax bill targeted to Wall Street into a tax cut benefiting Main Street.  Because of Democrats, families earning between $20,000 and $30,000 a year will get a $500 per child tax cut. Because of Democrats, there is a HOPE scholarship to make college more affordable to our children. Because of Democrats, there are tax cuts for people inheriting farms and small businesses. Tax relief for working families, tax relief for education, tax relief for owners of farms and small businesses, these are Democratic values. These are the ideas President Clinton and the Democrats fought for and won.  Mr. Speaker, thanks to President Clinton and the Democrats, we have a growing, vibrant economy, a shrinking deficit and now a tax cut for working families.  Mr. Speaker, I urge all of my colleagues to support this tax cut bill.
