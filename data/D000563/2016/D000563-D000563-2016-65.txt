President, this has been a big week in Chicago and the Midwest, in fact, across the country, as some 35,000 students who attended ITT Tech have finally come to realize that school is closing and many of them have to assess now what their lives will be from this point forward.  In my hometown of Springfield, IL, there was a large sign in the local shopping mall ``ITT Tech,'' and I used to drive by and look at it, thinking: I know how this story is going to end, and it will not be good.  It turns out some 750 students signed up at this for-profit college in the State of Illinois and, as I mentioned, many outside the State, and many of them were fleeced, literally.  In this situation, they offered them an associate's degree at the ITT Tech campus at the White Oaks Mall in Springfield. There were several courses, one in communications, another one in computers.  The tuition charged at ITT Tech for a 2-year associate's degree was $47,000. If those same students got in their cars and drove 15 minutes away, they would have been at Lincoln Land Community College. The same course is offered not for $47,000 for a 2-year career degree but less than $7,000.  These students did not know better. They thought they were in good hands. They signed up for these loans, and now the school has disappeared. It disappeared after more than a dozen attorneys general around the United States started suing ITT Tech for its practices: recruiting students who were not ready for college, misleading them about the courses that were being offered, and overcharging them on their loans. It is currently being sued by the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau and the Securities and Exchange Commission. This is not the first major for-profit college to go down. Corinthian was an early casualty. I am sorry to say that I think others will follow.  It bears repeating that when we take a look at this industry, the for-profit college industry, we are looking at the most heavily subsidized private for-profit companies in the United States of America. For many of these companies, over 90 percent of their revenue sources come from the Federal Treasury in the form of Pell grants and direct government loans. They take the money from the government through the students. The students end up with the debt to pay off and many times, if they can stick with the course, a worthless diploma or certificate.  Why are we letting this happen? Why are we letting American families work hard to send their kids to college, only to be exploited by schools that are thinly veiled machines for taking money away from these poor students and saddling them with debt? Why aren't we speaking out? Well, sadly, the for-profit college and university industry in America has friends in high places. When the time comes, they hire some of the most effective lobbyists in Washington on both political sides to push for their agenda and to keep them in business. It is understandable. They take millions of dollars out of these operations. They end up with salaries for CEOs that are higher for their so-called university presidents than any university president in America. We let it happen. The Congress lets it happen. The government lets it happen.  It is time for a new day and some new thinking. The 2016-2017 school year has begun. Millions of students across the country are walking onto college campuses, and they are excited about their opportunities. Many of these students know they are going to have to take out loans to finance their education and will end up owing the government thousands of dollars.  We know that student debt is now larger than credit card debt. It is over $1 trillion. That means that students and their families across America are deeply indebted for higher education. If you are getting a good education out of it, something that really changes your life for the better and gives you new opportunities, the argument can be made. But, sadly, in many cases students don't receive the education they were promised. And at the end of the day whether these students owe money to the government or to private lenders, makes a big difference.  A lot of students--19, 20 years old--really don't understand the magnitude of the debt they are incurring. We know that two-thirds of students who take out private education loans really don't understand the terms of those loans, the interest rates of those loans, and how they compare with government loans. They don't understand that in many cases, private student loans are significantly more expensive and riskier.  Federal student loans have fixed, affordable interest rates. They have a variety of consumer protections built into them: forbearance in times of economic difficulty; manageable repayment options, such as income-based repayment plans which calculate your monthly student loan payment based on your income.  On the other hand, private student loans don't have these protections and offer interest rates that are some of the highest in the land, up to 18 percent. These private loans also don't include repayment options that Federal loans do. I have heard from many private education loan borrowers that their lender is unwilling to work with them when it comes to alternative repayment plans. They are harassed by collection agencies night and day when they owe these private student loans. In many cases, private lenders are more focused on their own bottom line than the students' welfare.  This past summer, the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau took action against Wells Fargo Bank--one of thelargest private student lenders--for illegal student loan servicing practices. Wells Fargo charged borrowers illegal fees, failed to provide borrowers with accurate loan information, and failed to correct inaccurate credit reports. Upon being caught, Wells Fargo was fined $3.6 million and is required to refund borrowers who were illegally charged.  While I commend the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau for their work to hold private student lenders accountable, there are steps we in Congress should take to make sure students have a fighting chance.  Today, Senators Franken, Reed, and I will introduce the Know Before You Owe Private Education Loan Act of 2016. This legislation requires school certification before a student can take out a private loan. There are certain steps the school has to take before certifying a loan. The prospective borrower's school has to confirm the student's enrollment status, cost of attendance, and estimated Federal financial aid assistance before certifying. The school must also notify students of the amount of unused Federal student aid for which they are still eligible. Think about that. Some of these schools are luring students into more expensive, terrible private loans when the students are still eligible for lower interest rates and better terms through the Federal Government. I have heard too many stories of for-profit colleges steering students into these private institutional loans. This bill will help stop that.  The bill will also ensure that students are given information about the differences in terms and repayment options. For students who still decide to get a private student loan, the bill requires private lenders to send the student borrowers quarterly updates on their balance, accrued interest, and capitalized interest.  The bill also requires private lenders to annually report the number of students taking out private loans, the amount of the loans, and the interest rates--all of these to be reported to the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau. Currently, there is little information publicly available about private student loans. Increasing the amount of available information will help policymakers and enforcement agencies more effectively protect students and their families.  Here are a few of the organizations supporting our bill: the Institute for College Access and Success, National Association for College Admission Counseling, National Consumer Law Center, Consumer Action, National Association of Student Financial Aid Administrators, National Association of Consumer Advocates, Consumers Union, the American Association of University Women, the American Federation of Teachers.  Loan certification for private education loans could keep many students from taking on unnecessary debt or unknowingly giving up the benefits and protections of Federal student loans. It is an important part of making college more affordable. I thank Senators Franken and Jack Reed for standing with me in this effort.  I sincerely hope that this Congress, which is now coming to a close before the election, will take up this question of student loans when we return after the election. I know we only have a few weeks, but if you ask working families across America what concerns them greatly, it is the amount of debt kids are incurring to go to college. In some families, mom and dad have never been to college, and sending their son or daughter off to a university is a dream come true. It can turn into a nightmare if they end up at for-profit colleges and universities.  I put on the Record the last time I spoke--and I will put it on again--the basic numbers to know about the for-profit college and university industry. Ten percent of all college students attend these schools, schools such as the University of Phoenix, DeVry, Kaplan, and Rasmussen. You know the names. Ten percent of the students end up in these schools, but when it comes to student loan defaults, 40 percent of the student loan defaults are students from for-profit colleges and universities. Students are dramatically overcharged for tuition. They are put into courses that are worthless, and they end up with maybe a certificate or a diploma that cannot even land them a job.  Another statistic that I think is shameful--and it really should be a reminder to Members of the Senate of our responsibility--the Department of Education analyzed programs at for-profit colleges and found that 72 percent of for-profit college graduates, on average, make less money than high school dropouts--72 percent. After all that time, all that debt, all those promises, they make less money than if they dropped out of high school. How can we continue to subsidize this industry after what we know about their performance? We need to hold them to higher standards.  In the meantime, let's find a way to protect students and working families who are trying to realize the American dream, make this a better nation, and provide a better life for themselves and their families.  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be printed in the Record.  There being no objection, the text of the bill was ordered to be printed in the Record, as follows:                                S. 3347       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of      the United States of America in Congress assembled,     SECTION 1.
