 President. I am pleased today to join as an original sponsor with Senators Snowe, Smith and Rockefeller, a bill to provide Medicare coverage of cancer drugs.  More than 8 million Americans require some form of cancer care: 1.2 million of these are newly diagnosed patients; some are already on treatment; some need follow-up care. Over half a million people will die from cancer this year.  Medicare, generally, does not cover cancer drugs. This bill will provide that coverage.  Providing Medicare coverage of cancer drugs is particularly important in light of a promising new class of drugs that are becoming available. One of those drugs is Gleevec, formerly known as STI 571.  I am greatly heartened by the news that on May 10 the Food and Drug Administration approved Gleevec for the treatment of chronic myelogenous leukemia. Gleevec is revolutionary because it can precisely target the dysfunctional proteins that cause this cancer and it can disable cancer cells to the point that they are metabolically inactivated with 12 hours of administering the drug.  Furthermore, Gleevec does not destroy the ``good'' cells, as other treatments do. It helped over 90 percent of patients in clinical trials and holds great promise for other cancers. Scientists say this drug is the wave of the future.  Not only is this drug highly medically effective, it is cost-effective. Gleevec is expected initially to cost around $25,000 annually. While that is a high price, in my view, the other alternative, or standard treatment for this kind of leukemia, is a bone marrow transplant. Bone marrow transplants cost on average $250,000 per procedure. So this drug will be cheaper than the conventional treatment.  Sixty percent of cancer cases occur among people over age 65, a number that will grow as the American population ages, so Medicare is a major payer of cancer care. Cancer therapies have evolved to the point where most cancer care is delivered on an outpatient basis, not in a hospital.  In terms of Medicare, oral, outpatient, prescription cancer drugs are currently covered by Medicare only if the drugs have the same active ingredient as the equivalent injectable cancer drug. This means that very few cancer drugs are covered.  No one really knows how much Medicare patients pay out-of-pocket for cancer drugs, but according to the Institute of Medicine, ``available evidence suggests that it is substantial.'' One study found that Medicare covered 83 percent of typical charges for lung cancer and 65 percent of typical charges for breast cancer. Out-of-pocket expenses ranged from less than $100 to near $4,000. One-third of Medicare beneficiaries have private insurance that covers the prescription drugs that Medicare does not cover. Even if beneficiaries have private drug coverage, that coverage often has high deductibles and other limits so that beneficiaries still have high out of pocket expenses.  The bill we are introducing today addresses just part of the problem. Clearly, we must work for a comprehensive Medicare drug benefit for all illnesses and we must work to improve private health insurance coverage.  The cost of delivering cancer care is $50 billion a year, says the National Cancer Institute. These are costs that we can reduce and this bill is one step.  I hope that by expanding Medicare coverage to cover cancer drugs we can garner support for broader coverage, we can encourage drug companies to make many more new drugs and we can give hope to millions who suffer from cancer.  I urge my colleagues to support this bill.                                 ______                                       By
