 President, I yield as much time as my friend from Vermont would like, and I ask unanimous consent that since I am going to be absent from the floor, that he have the authority to yield any time he wishes as well. I have 2 hours 10 minutes left. I yield up to 2 hours 5 minutes to my friend from Vermont.
