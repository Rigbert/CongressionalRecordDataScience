  Mr. DeFAZIO. Madam Speaker, every working day, every salary and wage-earning American will pay 6.2 percent, or 12.4 if they are self-employed, of their salary to Social Security, that is, up to the first $90,000. That is creating a $168 billion surplus, which is being borrowed and spent by this administration, some of it to give tax breaks to the wealthiest among us.  Now the Republicans have a new plan. Here is what Congressional Quarterly says: ``The House version essentially counts the Social Security surplus twice. First, the government would borrow the surplus from Social Security's trust funds in exchange for special Treasury bonds, as it does now. It would then direct the surplus into individual accounts, but then borrow it back again in exchange for more bonds. But only the debt to the individual accounts would appear in the government's budget; the debt to Social Security's trust funds would remain `off budget,' as is now. The surplus itself would be spent as part of the regular budget.''  Huh? That is the solution to the problems of Social Security? That is making the future retirement of Americans more secure? That is dealing with the fact that you are stealing money from working people and giving it to people who invest for a living? Give me a break.                          ____________________[Pages H5259-H5260]From the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]                 THE REPUBLICANS' SOCIAL SECURITY PLAN  (Mr. DeFAZIO asked and was given permission to address the House for 1 minute.)
