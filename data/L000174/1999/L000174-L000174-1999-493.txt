President, we are trying to do a number of things. One, the Senator from Utah and I are reflecting our respective parties. We want to get through the bill, get a final vote one way or another and do it in such a way as to protect Senators on both sides of the aisle. He has a responsibility for his side of the aisle, and I have responsibility for my side of the aisle. I take that responsibility strongly. Senators have a right to be heard and a right to vote. But at some point, we have to wrap it up and vote.
