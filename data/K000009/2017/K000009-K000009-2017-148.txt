Speaker, Congressman Rush is always calling the Nation to its higher principles. I thank him so very much for sharing our Special Order this evening.  Congressman David Cicilline of Rhode Island is here on the floor. I also want to thank Congressman John Garamendi for sharing his hour with us.  The focus tonight really is on jobs and trade, an issue on the mind of millions and millions of Americans. We have been joined by Congressman Brendan Boyle of Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, as well.  I will place this up for the Nation to see. It is a chart showing just U.S. trade relations with Mexico and Canada and what has happened since the deal was negotiated back in the early 1990s. It was also prepared before that, during the 1980s, when the United States actually had some trade surpluses on this continent with both Canada and Mexico.  This shows, in 1994, when NAFTA was actually enacted. You could see the United States begin to kind of fall into deficit. Then we had just a precipitous trade deficit, including the collapse of the peso after the NAFTA trade agreement was signed.  This is serious business for our country because this red ink represents lost jobs, lost productive power, and communities in disrepair across this country, where production units were just picked up and put either north or south of the border.  Tonight, we want to focus on President Trump's Manufacturing Jobs Initiative, which he announced during the campaign and afterwards. Here were his words:       Everything is going to be based on bringing our jobs back,      the good jobs, the real jobs. They have to come back.  Well, after all we have lost, we certainly do need job creation in this country.                              {time}  1730  We are now into the third month of Mr. Trump's Presidency and closing in on his first 100 days in office, a period when most Presidents are able to pass something through this Congress that really matters to the American people. I remember when we were able to save Social Security back during the 1980s and when a Congress was elected in response to Ronald Reagan's excesses, and it was in the first quarter of the year that that was done. So we are waiting. It is 100 days now, and nothing significant has been done on the jobs and trade front.  Candidate Donald Trump's campaign for President in my region of America was actually founded on the principle of fixing jobs and trade. People listened. But if we look at this first 100 days, we see that he has really taken a back seat to his billionaire donors and their interests and a staff that seems to be more and more peopled with individuals who spent a whole lot of time at Goldman Sachs, which is a company that has been notorious in helping to outsource jobs.  Throughout the campaign, Mr. Trump touted his trade policies, assuring voters he would renegotiate NAFTA. Well, we have been waiting. During a debate, he said: ``NAFTA is the worst trade deal maybe ever signed anywhere, but certainly ever signed in this country.''  I would say that that agreement is the foundational agreement, the precepts on which all subsequent trade deals have been negotiated that have placed America in a red ink position: many more imports coming into this country, many more of our jobs being outsourced elsewhere than our exports going out.  So I ask: Are the strong planks for a new NAFTA part of what the Trump administration is proposing?  Well, no. A leaked draft notice last week revealed a tepid agenda on trade that is little more than a rehash of what the President said in his campaign rhetoric. It is not a real plan. The one action item identified in the Trump trade agenda is the announcement of a study to find out why the United States is losing in global trade. It actually doesn't focus completely on NAFTA itself, and we need healing in this hemisphere before we start looking around the world.  The reality is we know why the deficit is so bad. Bad trade deals have led to a loss of nearly 4 million American jobs and a deficit just last month of $43.6 billion. President Trump promised a trade deal that would get Americans back to work and reduce our deficit. Instead, our deficit with NAFTA and Mexico and Canada is 31 percent higher. It got worse than a year ago. So I hope the President understands the real urgency of stopping U.S. job outsourcing, especially in the manufacturing sector. He should do more than pay lipservice. He should really take a look at how thin his administration proposals have been on renegotiating this agreement. He should establish real goals and timetables for U.S. trade to drive policy that will fix these job-killing trade agreements and deliver real benefits for the American people.  Now, we have Members who have been very active on this trade issue since being sworn in here in Congress.  Mr. Speaker, I yield now to Congressman David Cicilline, former mayor of Providence, Rhode Island, and a very strong leader for working men and women across this country.
