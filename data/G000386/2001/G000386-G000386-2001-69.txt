 So I thank the Senator.  I support the joint resolution approving the U.S.-Vietnam Bilateral Trade Agreement. I commend Chairman Baucus for his leadership in helping to bring this historic agreement before the Senate today. I also think we ought to take time to thank Senators McCain and Kerry for their strong support of the agreement.
