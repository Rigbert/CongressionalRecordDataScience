President, today I introduce with my colleague, Senator Grassley, the Prescribe A Book Act. I thank Senators Akaka, Bayh, Collins, Kerry, Lautenberg, Leahy, Lincoln, Lugar, Murray, Stabenow, and Whitehouse for joining us as original cosponsors of this bill.  Our legislation would create a Federal pediatric early literacy grant initiative based on the long-standing, successful Reach Out and Read program. The program would award grants to high-quality non-profit entities to train doctors and nurses in advising parents about the importance of reading aloud and to give books to children at pediatric check-ups from six months to 5 years of age, with a priority for children from low-income families. It builds on the relationship between parents and medical providers and helps families and communities encourage early literacy skills so children enter school prepared for success in reading.  The Reach Out and Read model has consistently demonstrated effectiveness in increasing parent involvement and boosting children's reading proficiency. Research published in peer-reviewed, scientific journals has found that parents who have participated in the program are significantly more likely to read to their children and include more children's books in their home, and that children served by the program show an increase of 4-8 points on vocabulary tests. I have seen up-close the positive impact of this program on children and their families when visiting a number of the 40 Rhode Island Reach Out and Read sites.  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be printed in the Record.  There being no objection, the text of the bill was ordered to be printed in the Record, as follows:                                S. 1345       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of      the United States of America in Congress assembled,     SECTION 1.
