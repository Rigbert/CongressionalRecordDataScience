Senator Feingold, who earlier had an amendment, stepped aside so Senator Sanders would have his chance. I say to the Senator from Alabama, it appears some who have been waiting all day are looking for a chance for a vote, and the Senator from Alabama is asking for consideration of an amendment that has not been filed and we have not seen.  Madam President, I say to the Senator, could I ask unanimous consent that the Senator from Alabama be recognized to offer an amendment and that he then be recognized for up to 15 minutes; that following his remarks, the Senate resume consideration of the Sanders amendment and there be 2 minutes of debate prior to a vote in relation to the Sanders amendment, with no second-degree amendment in order to the Sanders amendment prior to the vote?
