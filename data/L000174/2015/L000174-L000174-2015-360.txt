President, I would like to publicly thank U.S. attorney Tristram Coffin for his service to Vermont and our country. I have known Tris for decades, and I am proud that Vermont has been served by someone as thoughtful and fair as Tris. I join my fellow Vermonters in thanking him for his service to our State.  Tris earned his undergraduate degree from Wesleyan University and his law degree from Columbia University. He worked for me as a staff attorney on the Senate Judiciary Committee from 1991 to 1994 before becoming an assistant U.S. attorney in Vermont's civil division from 1994 to 1998 and in their criminal division from 1996 to 2006. He then worked in private practice in Burlington with the firm of Paul Frank & Collins, P.C. In 2009 I recommended Tris for the vacant U.S. attorney position, and he was unanimously confirmed by the Senate in August 2009 to be Vermont's 36th U.S. attorney.  Throughout his time as U.S. attorney, Tris has demonstrated thoughtful leadership in partnering with State and local law enforcement agencies and Vermont communities on a wide range of issues, including efforts to confront the crisis of heroin and opioid addiction. In September 2010 he convened a timely and constructive symposium in the State house in Montpelier to discuss the problem of opiate drug abuse. Impressed by his work, last year I invited Tris to deliver testimony at a Judiciary Committee field hearing in Rutland examining community solutions to the opioid crisis. At that hearing, I was moved by the dedication and passion Tris has brought to developing partnerships with Vermont schools to raise awareness and focus on prevention.  Vermont is a safer and better place because of dedicated public servants like Tris. I commend Tris for his years of service to the Green Mountain State and wish him the best in his future endeavors. He is a friend I treasure.                          ____________________
