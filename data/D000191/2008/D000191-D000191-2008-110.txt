  Mr. DeFAZIO. Madam Speaker, the presumptive Republican nominee for president, John McCain, has a solution to skyrocketing gas prices.  Is he going to take on Big Oil, their price gouging, and their obscene profits? No. Is he going to take on OPEC and their collusion to restrict supply and drive up the price in violation of international trade law? No.  Is he going to take on the hedge fund speculators on Wall Street that are driving up the price unnecessarily 50 cents a gallon so then they can make money? No.  He is going to be the GOP nominee, the Grand Oil Party nominee. He can't take that money. He has a solution. Suspend the Federal gas tax.  In 1993, the Federal gas tax was 18.3 cents and a gallon of gas was a buck. In 2008, a gallon of gas is $3.50. The Federal gas tax is the same 18.3 cents. It's dropped to 5 percent of the cost.  If we follow his plan, we will cancel hundreds of needed bridge projects and highway projects across the country, throwing construction workers out of jobs, an already hard-hit sector, or maybe he is just going to borrow the money after he cancels the gas tax, because the only thing going up faster on the Republican administration than the price of gas is the national debt.                          ____________________
