 Chairman, this bill will reverse the significant progress we have made under the Clean Water Act. For the first time in 25 years, our water is expected to become dirtier instead of cleaner. We may well be returning to a time when our rivers catch fire, we cannot swim and fish in our lakes, and human health is jeopardized by toxic chemicals in our water.  It is no secret that the House Republican leadership worked hand in hand with the chemical companies and other special interests to draft a bill littered with loopholes for polluters and developers. The bill includes a myriad of exemptions and waivers for industry which will significantly increase water pollution. It also removes approximately 50 percent of wetlands--which provide a natural water filtering system--from Federal protection. It is deeply disturbing that the attack on the environment that was so prevalent in the Contract With America has now reached into environmental successes like the Clean Water Act.  I am pleased that this bill reauthorizes funds for the State revolving loan fund that helps towns, like rural towns in my State of Vermont, upgrade their sewage treatment facilities. It also authorizes funds to help these same towns clean up agricultural pesticide runoff. Unfortunately, in today's environment of cutbacks I am seriously concerned that these needed funds will not become a reality. I strongly urge the appropriators to fully fund these programs so that small rural towns can meet their environmental responsibilities.  I am deeply disappointed that the House rejected an amendment which included these important authorizations and linked them with meaningful relief from unnecessarily burdensome regulations. Instead the House is considering a bill that gives industry free rein to pollute our waterways and developers the right to develop our ecologically important wetlands.
