Speaker, it is my distinct honor to pay tribute to the Indiana State League of United Latin American Citizens (LULAC), as it hosts the 1998 LULAC Midwest Conference. This year's conference, titled `Money Management and the Tools to Make It Work,' is being held on Saturday, September 26, 1998, in Hammond, Indiana. Giving the conference's keynote address is Rick Dovalina, LULAC's National President. He was elected this Fourth of July at the conclusion of the LULAC National Convention. I would also like to take this opportunity to commend Augustine Sanchez, Midwest LULAC Vice President, and the Indiana LULAC state officers, Maria D. Pizana, Terry Serna, Vickie Lipniskis, Belinda Medellin, Dave Jones, Amelia Velez, Louise Marinez, Alicia Rios, and Greg Chavez, for the leadership they have displayed in organizing this important event. Hosting the LULAC Midwest Conference is an honor and a challenge which the Indiana State LULAC has met with vigor and excitement.  Founded in 1929 in Corpus Christi, Texas, LULAC was established to protect the Constitutional rights and freedoms of Hispanic-Americans. Over the years, LULAC has improved the social and economic status of Hispanics through its activism in the areas of equal justice, housing, employment, and education. By 1954, LULAC had earned recognition for winning two landmark civil rights cases. The first integrated the Orange County, California school system, and the second secured jury duty rights for Mexican-Americans in Texas. Since that time, LULAC has worked hard to achieve full access to the political process for all Hispanics, as well as equal educational opportunity for Hispanic children. LULAC councils across the nation work toward this goal by holding voter registration drives and citizen awareness sessions, sponsoring health fairs and tutorial programs, and raising scholarship money for the LULAC national scholarship fund. In addition, LULAC's activism has expanded to include the areas of language and cultural rights. In response to a recent increase in anti-Hispanic sentiment, LULAC councils have fought back by holding seminars and public symposiums on language and immigration issues. The nation's oldest and largest national Hispanic civil rights organization, LULAC continues to be a strong voice in the struggle for equal opportunity for Hispanic-Americans.  The Indiana State LULAC has faithfully worked to fulfill the National LULAC mission through a strong commitment to community and education. The Indiana LULAC emphasizes the protection of civil and human rights for Hispanic citizens and immigrants, and it strives to achieve this goal by educating the Hispanic community. Extremely youth-oriented, Indiana LULAC hosts annual career days and college fairs, provides numerous educational workshops and seminars for students, and offers several leadership training opportunities to students. In addition, Indiana LULAC continues to award scholarships to academic achievers throughout the state and, to date, has awarded over $200,000 in college scholarships. In the future, the Indiana State LULAC aspires to open a LULAC National Education Center, which would provide counseling and tutorial services, scholarships, and low-interest loans to help Hispanic students attend college.  One of LULAC's primary goals is to advance the economic condition of Latinos in the United States and Puerto Rico. The leaders of LULAC are striving to empower members of the Latino community to take control of their financial futures and obtain financial security for their retirement years. With a significant economic disparity between Latinos and the general population, LULAC is taking this opportunity to address this immediate, important issue. The League of United Latin American Citizens 1998 Midwest Conference offers workshops and information sessions to give participants the opportunities and techniques to learn about becoming financially secure, independent, and taking the initiative to become one's own boss. Proceeds for this conference will be used to fund scholarships, as well as youth and young adult educational projects for the Midwest. These programs include the Young Reader Programs, the Hispanic Leadership Opportunities Programs, and the Washington, D.C. Youth Seminars.  Mr. Speaker, I ask you and my other distinguished colleagues to join me in commending the Midwest and State of Indiana LULAC organizations for their extraordinary efforts to unite Hispanics. All involved in the success of these organizations, as well as their endeavors, should be proud of their efforts in working toward equality, independence, and success for Hispanic-Americans.                          ____________________
