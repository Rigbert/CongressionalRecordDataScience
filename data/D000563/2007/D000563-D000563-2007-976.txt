Mikulski) submitted the following resolution; which was referred to the Committee on Health, Education, Labor, and Pensions:                              S. Res. 192       Whereas, since 2003, National Nurses Week is celebrated      annually from May 6, also known as National Nurses Day,      through May 12, the birthday of Florence Nightingale, the      founder of modern nursing;       Whereas National Nurses Week is the time each year when      nurses are recognized for the critical role they play in      providing safe, high quality, and preventative health care;       Whereas nurses are the cornerstone of the Nation's complex      health care system, representing the largest single component      of the health care profession, with an estimated 2,900,000      registered nurses in the United States;       Whereas, according to a study published in the New England      Journal of Medicine in May 2002, a higher proportion of      nursing care provided by registered nurses and a greater      number of hours of care by registered nurses per day are      associated with better outcomes for hospitalized patients;       Whereas nurses are experienced researchers and their work      encompasses a wide scope of scientific inquiry including      clinical research, health systems and outcomes research, and      nursing education research;       Whereas nurses are currently serving the Nation admirably      in the conflicts in Iraq and Afghanistan;       Whereas nurses help inform and educate the public to      improve the practice of all nurses and, more importantly, the      health and safety of the patients they care for;       Whereas our Nation continues to face a nursing shortage      unprecedented in its depth and duration, with a projected      1,200,000 new and replacement nurses needed by 2014;       Whereas the nationwide nursing shortage has caused      dedicated nurses to work longer hours and care for more      acutely ill patients;       Whereas nurses are strong allies to Congress as they help      inform, educate, and work closely with legislators to improve      the education, retention, recruitment, and practice of all      nurses and, more importantly, the health and safety of the      patients they care for; and       Whereas nurses are an integral part of the health care      delivery team and provide quality care, support, and      education to patients and their families, conduct essential      research, and serve as strong patient advocates: Now,      therefore, be it       Resolved, That the Senate--       (1) recognizes the significant contributions of nurses to      the health care system of the United States;       (2) supports the goals and ideals of National Nurses Week,      as founded by the American Nurses Association; and       (3) encourages the people of the United States to observe      National Nurses Week with appropriate recognition,      ceremonies, activities, and programs to demonstrate the      importance of nurses to the everyday lives of patients.
