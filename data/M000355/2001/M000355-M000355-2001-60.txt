 President, if the Senator will yield, the Senator is right on the mark. It is not too late to do the right thing, which is one of the points we are trying to make to the Senate and to the country. In those first years of those three administrations to which the Senator made reference--and I have talked about others--77 percent of those confirmed were confirmed after the August recess, which means it is not too late.  The idea some on the other side of the aisle may be thinking--that we can't possibly replicate the standard here--is not true. It can be done. We simply need to have hearings and have more than 1.4 judges heard per hearing. Hearings don't mean a whole lot if you are not having judges before the committee.  I commend the Senator and echo his thoughts. It is not too late to do the right thing. That is what we are saying.
