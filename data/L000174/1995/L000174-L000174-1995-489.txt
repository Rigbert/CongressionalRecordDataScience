President, personally, I like the plan that the majority leader has laid down. As he knows, we tried on this other one to move as quickly as we could, and we moved it much faster than some thought. I note in that regard, I appreciate those who expressed their concern in wanting to protect the Internet but also to protect children from being exposed to smut and pornography. I will state again, the protection of children is something we all want equally in this body. We just have different ways of trying to figure out ultimately how to protect them and the first amendment at the same time.  I hope we go to the dialing parity. I ask unanimous consent that it be in order for me to yield to the Senator from Louisiana to bring up an amendment on behalf of himself and myself. That may settle that part and save us several hours.
