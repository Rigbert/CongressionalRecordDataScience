 President, I understand I have 1 minute to discussthe amendment before the Senate. This amendment is on behalf of Senator Bingaman and myself. It essentially deals with an issue that emerged in the consideration of the class action bill.  I am a supporter of the class action bill. However, there is a loophole. That loophole is with class action consumer-related cases. They could go to a Federal judge, and the Federal judge could say the various laws of the 50 States are so complex he cannot decide on a given law. Then the class action remains in limbo. It cannot go back to State court.  This is a compromise between Senator Bingaman and myself. It essentially says the judge can either issue subclassifications as determined necessary to permit the action to proceed or, if that is impractical, look at other courses, including the plaintiff's State laws.
