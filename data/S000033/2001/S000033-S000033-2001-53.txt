 Chairman, I thank the gentleman for yielding me this time.  Mr. Chairman, what this debate is about, really, is the priorities of this country. Several months ago it was the wisdom of the President of the United States and a majority of the Members of the Congress that we were a rich enough Nation that we could afford to provide hundreds of billions of dollars to the wealthiest 1 percent of the population, people who have a minimum income of $375,000 a year. That is how rich we were. But today, when we are talking about the needs of our veterans, the men and women who put their lives on the line to defend this country, the men and women who were wounded in action, well, guess what, today we do not have enough money to address their needs.  All over this country, including the State of Vermont, there are waiting lines for veterans to get the quality treatment that they need. There is speculation that the prescription drug program for veterans will cost veterans more money because we do not have, as a Nation, the funding available to take care of those people who made such sacrifices for this country. Hundreds of billions of dollars for tax breaks for those who do not need it but inadequate funding for our veterans.  Mr. Chairman, in my State, and again all over this country, millions of Americans are paying 50 or 60 percent or more of their limited incomes for housing. In one region after another in this country affordable housing is unattainable. Yet, once again, we apparently do not have enough money to adequately fund affordable housing in this country, so that families and children sleep out on the street and working people pay 50, 60 percent of their incomes for housing. Tax breaks for millionaires, yes; adequate funding for affordable housing, no.  And, once again, all over this country communities are struggling to make sure that the air that they breathe, the water they drink, is not polluted. Money for tax breaks, yes; money for the environment, no.
