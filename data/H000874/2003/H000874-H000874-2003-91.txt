Speaker, I thank the gentleman from Texas for yielding me this time.  My friend who just spoke and I are going to vote together on final passage of this bill, but my friend and I disagree on the process that we are pursuing to accomplish the objectives of which he speaks. He speaks of the objectives and not the process because he feels comfortable defending the end result, but obviously not comfortable discussing the process. Why?  This bill that we are considering is larger than 10 of the 13 appropriation bills. As a matter of fact, it is almost 100 times larger than the District of Columbia appropriation bill which we spent in debate in committee and in hearings 10 times longer to consider. Hear me.
