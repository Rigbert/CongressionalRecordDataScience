 President, I will just add, we will finish tonight, and it might help us move quicker, in addition to having voice votes on a lot of amendments, if we sit at our own desks and see if we can just get through this as rapidly as possible without denying anyone their rights.  So I recommend we go ahead, whatever the next amendment is.
