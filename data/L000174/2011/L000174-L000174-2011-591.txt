President, I appreciate the amendment of the Senator from Colorado. When it comes to a vote, I think it will probably be unanimous. I suspect there will not even be a requirement for a rollcall vote. It does have this mandatory reduction in fees for small businesses at the Patent Office. I know the Senator is a strong advocate for small business in Colorado. The Patent Office has a backlog of more than 700,000 applications that haven't yet had a first response. This hits small businesses and independent ventures particularly hard because they can least afford a delay in receiving their rights. They have done a lot to reduce that backlog, but they need this legislation to finish it. They have the fast track process, where applicants pay additional fees to cover the costs and the examiners work overtime. Not all small businesses can afford the fast track application fee, and the Senator from Colorado, Mr. Bennet, wisely recognized that not all can afford that.  His amendment will ensure that small businesses and independent vendors will receive a 50-percent reduction in the fee. When the time comes for a vote, I will strongly support the amendment. I suspect both sides will strongly support it. I thank the Senator.
