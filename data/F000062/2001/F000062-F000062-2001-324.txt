 President, yesterday a Scottish court, meeting in the Netherlands, convicted Abdel Basset Ali Megrahi for the 1988 bombing of Pan American flight 103 over Lockerbie, Scotland. That court sentenced him to life in prison. Two-hundred seven people, including 189 Americans, lost their lives in this barbaric act.  In addition, the court conclusively tied the planning and execution of the bombing to Libya and Libya intelligence.  While no verdict could have fully comforted the families of the victims, eased their anguish, or removed the haunting images from their minds, they can take some solace in the fact that guilt has now been established. I would like to personally thank the families of the victims for their hard work, for their dedication, and for the unyielding determination to ensure that their loved ones did not die in vain. The international community truly owes them a debt of gratitude.  Nevertheless, the quest for justice is not over. Now some have suggested the verdict brings the matter to a close, and at the sanctions in place since 1992 should now be lifted. We, however, believe that would be a serious mistake and an insult to the victims and their families. U.N. Resolutions have required Libya to pay compensation to the families of the victims of Pan Am 103 if a guilty verdict is rendered, and, second, to officially end support for international terrorism before the multilateral sanctions can permanently be lifted.  A formal lifting of the sanctions now would send Libya the wrong signal. It would indicate that the international community has absolved Libya of its role in the bombing, a role, to repeat, clearly established by the Scottish court. It would say that Libya should be accepted back into the community of responsible nations. It would bestow upon Colonel Qadhafi's regime a respect and credibility it seeks but has not earned.  The United States must press Libya to publicly accept its role in the bombing of Pan Am Flight 103, issue an apology, and compensate the victims' families.  Consequently, today we are introducing the Justice for the Victims of Pan Am 103 Act of 2001. This legislation is cosponsored by Senators Helms, Brownback, Leahy, Reid of Nevada, Nelson of Nebraska, Clinton, Dodd, Baucus, Boxer, Byrd, and Carper.  The legislation states that it shall be the policy of the United States to oppose lifting U.N. and U.S. sanctions against Libya until all cases of American victims of Libyan terrorism have been resolved; the Government of Libya has accepted responsibility, has issued an apology, has paid compensation to the victims' families of Pan Am 103; and has taken real and concrete steps to end support of international terrorism; and the legislation would prohibit assistance to the Government of Libya until the President determines and certifies that Libya has fulfilled the above requirements.  In addition, the legislation expresses the sense of the Senate that the Government of Libya should be condemned for its support of international terrorism and the bombing of Pan Am 103.  Second, the Government of Libya should accept responsibility for the bombing, issue a public apology, and provide due compensation.  Finally, the President, the Secretary of State, and other U.S. officials should encourage other countries and the United Nations to maintain sanctions against Libya until it fulfills the above requirements. Until Libya accepts responsibility for its actions, apologizes, and ends its support for international terrorism, the United States should leave and will leave no stone unturned in the quest for justice.  We owe the victims of Pan Am 103 no less.  Mr. President, I yield the floor.                          ____________________
