One of the problems we have though, if we in fact fish the saber tooth flounder, or arrow tooth flounder, or whatever it is, and by the way, for the audience listening, it looks like an ordinary flounder, but it has the worst set of teeth you can imagine. You cannot catch one because it cuts the line and everything else. If we try to fish them down there would be a lawsuit contrary to saying you are doing it for economic purposes because you are saving the salmon and cod and halibut.  Now, there is our catch-22. That is why when we make things mandatory, we do mess up the soup. I am very concerned about that. It is, by the way, an ecology-type question. But the gentleman sees what I am saying. If I fish down the arrow tooth flounder, supposedly to provide more halibut, cod, or whatever else is available, then I can be in fact accused, or the council can be, of fishing for economic purposes.
