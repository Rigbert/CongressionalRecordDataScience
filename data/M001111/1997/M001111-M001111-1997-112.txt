 President, I am pleased to join my Washington State colleague in offering this amendment to require the Navy to revisit the awarding of the U.S.S. Missouri. I have followed closely the Navy's handling of the Missouri; working with Senator Gorton, Congressman Norm Dicks, the Washington congressional delegation, and my constituents. I am also pleased that California Senators have joined this effort to question the Navy's Missouri decision.
