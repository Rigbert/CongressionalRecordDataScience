Mr. Speaker, I move to suspend the rules and agree to the resolution (H. Res. 339) urging the Government of Ukraine to ensure a democratic, transparent, and fair election process leading up to the March 31, 2002, parliamentary elections, as amended.  The Clerk read as follows:                              H. Res. 339       Whereas Ukraine stands at a critical point in its      development to a fully democratic society, and the      parliamentary elections on March 31, 2002, its third      parliamentary elections since becoming independent more than      10 years ago, will play a significant role in demonstrating      whether Ukraine continues to proceed on the path to democracy      or experiences setbacks in its democratic development;       Whereas the Government of Ukraine can demonstrate its      commitment to democracy by conducting a genuinely free and      fair parliamentary election process, in which all candidates      have access to news outlets in the print, radio, television,      and Internet media, and nationally televised debates are      held, thus enabling the various political parties and      election blocs to compete on a level playing field and the      voters to acquire objective information about the candidates;       Whereas a flawed election process, which contravenes      commitments of the Organization for Security and Cooperation      in Europe (OSCE) on democracy and the conduct of elections,      could potentially slow Ukraine's efforts to integrate into      Western institutions;       Whereas in recent years, incidents of government corruption      and harassment of the media have raised concerns about the      commitment of the Government of Ukraine to democracy, human      rights, and the rule of law;       Whereas Ukraine, since its independence in 1991, has been      one of the largest recipients of United States foreign      assistance;       Whereas $154,000,000 in technical assistance to Ukraine was      provided under Public Law 107-115 (the Kenneth M. Ludden      Foreign Operations, Export Financing, and Related Programs      Appropriations Act, Fiscal Year 2002), a $16,000,000      reduction in funding from the previous fiscal year due to      concerns about continuing setbacks to needed reform and the      unresolved deaths of prominent dissidents and journalists,      such as the case of Heorhiy Gongadze;       Whereas Public Law 107-115 requires a report by the      Department of State on the progress by the Government of      Ukraine in investigating and bringing to justice individuals      responsible for the murders of Ukrainian journalists;       Whereas the Presidential election of 1999, according to the      final report of the Office of Democratic Institutions and      Human Rights (ODIHR) of OSCE on that election, failed to meet      a significant number of OSCE election-related commitments;       Whereas according to the ODIHR report, during the 1999      Presidential election campaign, a heavy proincumbent bias was      prevalent among the state-owned media outlets, and members of      the media viewed as not in support of the President were      subject to harassment by government authorities, while      proincumbent campaigning by state administration and public      officials was widespread and systematic;       Whereas the Law on Elections of People's Deputies of      Ukraine, signed by President Leonid Kuchma on October 30,      2001, which was cited in a report of the ODIHR dated November      26, 2001, as making improvements in Ukraine's electoral code      and providing safeguards to meet Ukraine's commitments on      democratic elections, does not include a role for domestic      nongovernmental organizations to monitor elections;       Whereas according to international media experts, the Law      on Elections defines the conduct of an election campaign in      an imprecise manner which could lead to arbitrary sanctions      against media operating in Ukraine;       Whereas the Ukrainian Parliament (Verkhovna Rada) on      December 13, 2001, rejected a draft Law on Political      Advertising and Agitation, which would have limited free      speech in the campaign period by giving too many      discretionary powers to government bodies, and posed a      serious threat to the independent media;       Whereas the Department of State has dedicated $4,700,000 in      support of monitoring and assistance programs for the 2002      parliamentary elections;       Whereas the process for the 2002 parliamentary elections      has reportedly been affected by violations by many parties      during the period prior to the official start of the election      campaign on January 1, 2002; and       Whereas monthly reports for November and December of 2001      released by the Committee on Voters of Ukraine (CVU), an      indigenous, nonpartisan, nongovernment organization that was      established in 1994 to monitor the conduct of national      election campaigns and balloting in Ukraine, cited five major      types of violations of political rights and freedoms during      the precampaign phase of the parliamentary elections,      including--       (1) use of government position to support particular      political groups;       (2) government pressure on the opposition and on the      independent media;       (3) free goods and services given by many political groups      in order to sway voters;       (4) coercion to join political parties and pressure to      contribute to election campaigns; and       (5) distribution of anonymous and compromising information      about political opponents:        Now, therefore, be it       Resolved, That the House of Representatives--       (1) acknowledges the strong relationship between the United      States and Ukraine since Ukraine's independence more than 10      years ago, while understanding that Ukraine can only become a      full partner in Western institutions when it fully embraces      democratic principles;       (2) expresses its support for the efforts of the Ukrainian      people to promote democracy, the rule of law, and respect for      human rights in Ukraine;       (3) urges the Government of Ukraine to enforce impartially      its newly adopted election law, including provisions calling      for--       (A) the transparency of election procedures;       (B) access for international election observers;       (C) multiparty representation on election commissions;       (D) equal access to the media for all election      participants;       (E) an appeals process for electoral commissions and within      the court system; and       (F) administrative penalties for election violations;       (4) urges the Government of Ukraine to meet its commitments      on democratic elections, as delineated in the 1990 Copenhagen      Document of the Organization for Security and Cooperation in      Europe (OSCE), with respect to the campaign period and      election day, and to address issues identified by the Office      of Democratic Institutions and Human Rights (ODIHR) of OSCE      in its final report on the 1999 Presidential election, such      as state interference in the campaign and pressure on the      media; and       (5) calls upon the Government of Ukraine to allow election      monitors from the ODIHR, other participating states of OSCE,      and private institutions and organizations, both foreign and      domestic, access to all aspects of the parliamentary election      process according to international practices, including--       (A) access to political events attended by the public      during the campaign period;       (B) access to observe voting and counting procedures at      polling stations and electoral     commission meetings on election day, including procedures to      release election results on a district-by-district basis as      they become available; and       (C) access to observe postelection tabulation of results      and processing of election challenges and complaints.
