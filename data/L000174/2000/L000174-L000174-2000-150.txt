President, I rise today to speak about an extraordinary Vermonter, Daniel Dyer. As the world celebrates the end of the twentieth century, Daniel Dyer is celebrating the end of his first century. He has seen history made, but he has also made history of his own. Growing up on a farm in Vermont, Mr. Dyer attended the local school in Albany. His strong academic record afforded him the opportunity to attend Craftsbury Academy--where he performed odd jobs to help defray the cost of his room and board. From there, he moved on to the University of Vermont to study education and agriculture, and graduated in 1924. Since then, Mr. Dyer has given over forty years of dedicated service to the young people of Vermont as a teacher, a coach and a principal.  Even after retiring, Mr. Dyer remains active in his community--just last year he was speaking to a classroom of sixth-grade students about his experiences growing up. His contributions to Vermonters were recognized by the University of Vermont when he received awards for Community Service Leadership in 1978 and Distinguished Service in 1988. Today Mr. Dyer is the University's oldest active alumnus and still maintains an amicable relationship with members of the faculty.  On November 3, Daniel Dyer will celebrate his one hundredth birthday with friends and family. Of course, this grand event will include his children, grandchildren and great-grandchildren, all of whom--along with countless other Vermont children--have been touched by this special man.                          ____________________
