 President, the Senator from Virginia would be next, but he has kindly yielded to the Senator from New Mexico.  My friend from Arizona keeps saying the ``acknowledged flawed treaty.'' It is not acknowledged to be flawed by 32 Nobel laureates in physics. It is not acknowledged to be flawed by four of the last five Chairmen of the Joint Chiefs of Staff. It is not acknowledged to be flawed by the weapons lab Directors, et cetera.  I want to make it clear, he states some believe it is flawed. The majority of the people who are in command and have been in command--the Secretaries of Defense who have been mentioned--if we balance it out, clearly think this is not a flawed treaty.  I yield on the Republican time to my friend from New Mexico.
