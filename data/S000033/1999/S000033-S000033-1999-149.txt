 Chairman, I hope the gentleman from New Mexico (Mr. Skeen) understands, I am not against ag research. I know that the gentleman has had a difficult time trying to fit in all of the needs. I do not disagree with the gentleman, and I do not disagree with the gentlewoman from Ohio (Ms. Kaptur). I just think that when we have senior citizens going into the hospitals suffering from malnutrition, that is an issue that cannot be ignored.  I would raise that to a higher level and ask for the support of the body in the passage of this amendment.
