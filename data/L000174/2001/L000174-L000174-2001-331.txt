As I said to the Senator from Nevada, the majority whip, it is extremely important that we were able to move especially Bob Mueller as quickly as we did.  I thank the leadership for making this possible, and I thank all Senators on both sides of the aisle for voting for him. It sends a strong signal. We have somebody who wants to preserve the very best of the FBI and to correct those areas where there are problems. I think he can do both. He comes with a strong mandate from the Senate, and that will help.  I yield the floor.
