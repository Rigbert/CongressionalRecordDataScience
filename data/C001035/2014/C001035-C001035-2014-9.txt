 First, let me express my sincere thanks to both Chairman Levin and Ranking Member Inhofe for their hard work in putting together a bipartisan bill that addresses the needs of our military and contains provisions that are important to Maine and to our national security.  This legislation fully funds both the vital DDG-1000 and DDG-51 Programs.
