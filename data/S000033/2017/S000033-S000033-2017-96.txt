 I want to summarize this. My friends from Oregon and Michigan can correct me if I am wrong.  We are looking at a bill that came from the House and various proposals being introduced in the Senate, which essentially says that we are going to throw over 20 million Americans off of the health insurance they currently have. What I haven't heard much discussion about is what happens to someone who today has health insurance and is struggling with cancer, maybe getting chemotherapy or radiation therapy right now. What happens to someone who is in treatment for diabetes? What happens to someone with a serious heart condition, who had a stroke and is on Medicaid? What happens to those people when their health insurance is simply cut?
