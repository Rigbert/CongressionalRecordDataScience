 They fear title XXXII of the bill would ``weaken the existing internal and external oversight structure for DOE's environmental, safety and health operations.''  I am very concerned about the DOE restricting provisions of this bill and so am tempted to vote against it. However, there are many provisions in the DOD authorization bill that will strengthen our country, our national defense, and our cleanup programs at DOE sites. I am particularly proud to support our belated efforts to increase the pay of our military personnel.  In addition, I very much appreciate Chairman Warner's agreement to enter into the colloquy that follows. Therefore, I will support this bill in the hopes that this colloquy and the public comments made by drafters of title XXXII will ensure continuing compliance with environment, safety, and health laws and orders by the NNSA.  I hope we can go back to the drawing board on the DOE restructuring provisions either through a veto of the bill this year or a new attempt to craft a better solution next year.  Thank you, again, Chairman Warner for your work on the overall bill and your colloquy with me on the important subject of protecting our communities and environment at DOE facilities.                              Title XXXII
