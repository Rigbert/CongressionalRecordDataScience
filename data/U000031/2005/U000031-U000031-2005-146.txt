Speaker, I rise today to pay tribute to the Kalamazoo Symphony Orchestra League, which is celebrating its 75th Anniversary with a performance by the Kalamazoo Symphony Orchestra on November 18, 2005.  The Kalamazoo Symphony Orchestra League was founded in 1930 by Leta G. Snowand was originally known as the Women's Committee. Through the years the League raised over $1.7 million and offered many community and educational programs to folks in the Kalamazoo area by making orchestral music a part of their daily lives.  The Kalamazoo Symphony Orchestra League provides services to our District that far surpasses the vital cultural contribution that their musical performances provide. I would like to acknowledge the many contributions of the Kalamazoo Symphony Orchestra League, congratulate them on 75 impressive years of entertaining the residents of Southwestern Michigan, and wish them many more years of continued success.                          ____________________[Extensions of Remarks][Pages E2283-E2284]From the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]             TRIBUTE TO KALAMAZOO SYMPHONY ORCHESTRA LEAGUE                                 ______                                                             HON.
