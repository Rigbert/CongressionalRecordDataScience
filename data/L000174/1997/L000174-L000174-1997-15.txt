President, I am pleased to say that we have finally completed action on the fiscal year 1998 foreign operations conference report. I want to thank the chairman of the Appropriations Committee, Senator Stevens, and the ranking member, Senator Byrd, for their support throughout this process, and the chairman of the Foreign Operations Subcommittee, Senator McConnell, for his leadership and bipartisanship. The Appropriations Committee is an extraordinary group of people who work together, Republicans and Democrats, like no other committee, and it is a privilege to be part of it.  The conference report that we are adopting as part of this package today is the product of a year's work and many sleepless nights. Although we finished our conference on all but two issues several weeks ago, it would be an understatement to say that resolving those open issues, especially funding for international family planning, has not been easy.  There were times when I did not think we would get here. As I have said before, I long for the time when we set aside a day or two each year to debate and vote on abortion--once, twice, 50 times if necessary. It would consume that day or two, but it would be worth it. Then we would not have to revisit the issue time and time again, as we do now for no apparent purpose, only to repeat what has already been said or voted on innumerable times before. It would save a great deal of time, it would give everyone ample opportunity to be counted, and we could spend the rest of the year on other pressing business. I offer that as a suggestion, for what it is worth.  The agreement we have reached on family planning is not everything that I would like, but that is to be expected. An issue as divisive as this is not going to be resolved in a way that anyone is happy about. The agreement would freeze funding for these programs at last year's level, and limit disbursement to a rate of 8.34 percent per month over the 1998 fiscal year. I would have far preferred the Senate funding level of $435 million, but the cut was part of the price of keeping Mexico City language out of the bill and avoiding a veto.  The American people should also be aware that the pro-Mexico City faction in the House exacted a heavy price on the administration for its refusal to accept the Mexico City language. The price was that the U.S. contribution to the IMF's New Arrangements to Borrow, the previously agreed upon down payment on U.S. arrears to the United Nations, and the authorization for the State Department reorganization, are no longer included. Although these last two are not foreign operations matters, it is outrageous that they were linked to the family planning issue in the first place. There are sound foreign policy reasons for paying our U.N. arrears especially when just yesterday we were petitioning the United Nations for support for sanctions against Iraq. This is the American people's loss, as much as it is the State Department's loss, and I find it incredible that the House leadership would permit this result. It is shortsighted, it is vindictive, and it severely undercuts U.S. leadership around the world. There should be no mistake about who bears responsibility. We have a Secretary of State who is deeply respected and admired around the world. She needs our support. It is tragic and inexplicable that because a few dozen House Members did not get their way on an unrelated issue, they have denied her the tools to do her job. I intend to do whatever I can to see that this is corrected at the earliest possible date next year.  Mr. President, I hope we can avoid repeating again next year the tortuous process that got us here. As long as President Clinton is in the White House, the Mexico City policy is not going to become law. It is time that people in the House accepted that and saved us all the headache of refighting this pointless battle.  Now that the conference report has been completed I want to take this opportunity to speak on a number of other provisions in it.  I am very pleased that we have fully funded our commitments, including arrearages, to the World Bank. I will have a separate statement on that because I believe it so important that the World Bank's management and the Treasury Department understand the importance we give to U.S. leadership in the international financial institutions, and our intention that our influence be exerted to achieve significant reforms in a number of critical areas.  One of the provisions I am especially proud of in the conference report is entitled ``Limitation on Assistance to Security Forces,'' which has also become known as the Leahy law. This provision expands on current law, which seeks to ensure that U.S. assistance does not go to individuals who abusehuman rights. I want to thank Congressman Gilman for his support for this provision. Despite an initial misunderstanding about how the current provision was being applied, I am convinced that he too wants to do everything possible to ensure that in our efforts to support foreign security forces that respect human rights, we also prevent those who abuse human rights from receiving our assistance.  In order to implement this provision, the State Department has required recipients of our assistance to enter into end-use monitoring agreements, and to ensure that if there is credible evidence that a security force unit that has received our assistance has abused human rights, effective measures are being taken to bring the responsible individuals to justice. These agreements should be routine whether or not the Leahy law were in effect. The kind of measures we expect a foreign government to take to bring those responsible to justice are discussed in the joint statement of the managers accompanying the conference report. We also make clear that we expect our own Government to do everything it can to assist in that effort.  Mr. President, before I leave this subject I want to mention that while we have seen a decrease in abuses by the Colombian Army, there has been an alarming increase in atrocities attributed to paramilitary forces in that country. We have seen this pattern in other Latin American countries where the armed forces, either actively or passively, supported the clandestine activities of paramilitary forces. I want it to be known that as the author of the Leahy law, I believe it is incumbent on the Colombian Army to demonstrate that it is not acting in collusion with the paramilitary groups, or standing by idly as they do their dirty deeds.  Mr. President, to turn to another subject, the international community rapidly responded with sanctions in the aftermath of the July 1997 coup in Cambodia. According to reports, the suspension of foreign assistance, which constitutes nearly two-thirds of Cambodia's annual revenue, sent a strong message to Hun Sen and his supporters.  The conference report prohibits most bilateral aid to the Cambodian Government and instructs United States executive directors of the international financial institutions to vote in opposition to loans to Cambodia. The joint statement of the managers also expresses the hope that Hun Sen's political opponents will be allowed to return to Cambodia and safely participate in free and fair elections.  These measures and others like them have been instituted around the world against the perpetrators of the coup. They are a necessary and important response to those who stand in the way of democracy. Nevertheless, the sanctions directed against Hun Sen and his supporters have also fallen heavily on the shoulders of the Cambodian people. Therefore, the conference report permits humanitarian, demining, and electoral assistance to go forward. One item Congressman Callahan and I had agreed upon but because of an oversight neglected to include in the joint statement of the managers, was a statement that the prohibition on assistance to Cambodia is not intended to preclude basic education programs as long as they are conducted at the local level and not through the central government. During the Khmer Rouge regime most of the country's teachers were killed or forced into exile. A large percentage of the population is illiterate, and we want to continue basic education activities as part of our effort to help the Cambodian people overcome that tragic period.  Finally, I want to make clear that while we do permit electoral assistance, I would not support significant expenditures in this area unless Hun Sen is demonstrating his commitment to free and fair elections, to the prosecution of individuals implicated in the U.N. human rights investigation of the July 1997 coup, and then only if Hun Sen has made an unequivocal statement that if defeated in a free and fair election he would relinquish power.  Mr. President, another initiative I am very proud of seeks to enhance U.S. leadership in the global effort to combat the spread of infectious diseases, which also poses a direct threat to the health and welfare of Americans. We include in the conference report sufficient funds to provide an additional $50,000,000 for these activities. The Senate and House foreign operations reports, as well as the joint statement of the managers, describe the rationale for this initiative and the purposes for which we are making these additional funds available. I also intend to solicit the recommendations of AID, the World Health Organization, the Center for Disease Control, the National Institute of Health, and other agencies, organizations and distinguished individuals, regarding how we can most effectively use these funds to buttress existing efforts in surveillance and control of infectious diseases.  The Leahy war victims fund has been assisting war victims in over a dozen countries since 1989. I am pleased that the joint statement of the managers recommends up to $7,500,000 for these programs in fiscal year 1998, a $2,500,000 increase over the current level. The fund has been primarily used to assist victims of landmine explosions, a problem that has attracted increasing world attention, but it is also available to support other types of assistance to disabled war victims. This is consistent with the President's September 17 announcement that the administration intends to devote considerably more resources to demining and to assist landmine victims.  Over the years, the Congress has passed numerous resolutions on the situation in East Timor. Despite international pressure, the Indonesian Government has refused to withdraw its thousands of troops from the island. The situation has remained tense since the 1990 Dili massacre, the anniversary of which coincidentally was yesterday, and arbitrary arrests and disappearances of East Timorese are common.  Indonesia is the world's fourth most populous country and enjoys close economic and security relations with the United States. I would like to see that relationship flourish. But we cannot ignore what happened this past June when supporters of democracy were arrested and killed by Indonesian soldiers, and the main political opponent of the Suharto regime was forced to withdraw from the election, notwithstanding that the election was rigged from the start. Nor can we ignore the abuses in East Timor. I had the honor of meeting East Timorese Bishop Bello earlier this year, and I believe that while we should encourage close relations with Indonesia, we should also do what we can to ensure that we are not contributing to the problems in East Timor. For that reason, a provision I authored was included in the conference report which is designed to prevent United States lethal equipment or helicopters from being used in East Timor. This provision is intended to expand on the administration's current policy of not providing small arms, crowd control items, or armored personnel carriers to Indonesia. It is also consistent with actions taken recently by the British Government.  There is a provision in the conference report which makes funds available for reconstruction and remedial activities relating to the consequences of conflicts within the Caucasus region. These funds, which will be made available through nongovernmental and international organizations, are very important. Contrary to what some have suggested, we are not providing direct assistance to the authorities in the conflict areas because we do not want to become embroiled in the issues of sovereignty and control that remain unresolved there. However, there are needy people in Nagorno Karabakh and Abkhazia who we want to help recover from the ravages of war.  Mr. President, I want to mention a couple of other items. The Senate report encourages AID to establish a program of physicians exchanges with the countries of the former Soviet Union, with a focus on the diseases that are major contributors to excess morbidity and mortality and where effective medical intervention is possible. I strongly support this idea and look forward to hearing AID's reactions.  Also in the Senate report we discuss the alarming incidence of violence against women in Russia. The administration has taken some steps in this area in response to congressional concerns, but I am convinced that farmore could be done to tap the experience and knowledge of U.S. police officers and prosecutors who have developed procedures for dealing with domestic violence here. We have requested the State Department, in consultation with the Justice Department, to submit a report on future plans in this area and I strongly encourage them to pursue training programs that bring U.S. and Russian police officers together, preferably in Russia, to address these issues.  Finally, the conference report requires the Department of Defense, in consultation with the Department of State, to submit a report to the Appropriations Committees describing potential alternative technologies and tactics, and a plan for the development of such alternatives, to protect antitank landmines from tampering in a manner consistent with the Ottawa Treaty, which bans antipersonnel mines. This is very important because if we are ever going to join that treaty, as I believe we must, we need to solve this problem. I am convinced it can be solved. Informed people in the Pentagon say it boils down to preventing tampering with antitank mines that are aerially delivered at remote distances, and then only for a period of 30 minutes which is the difference in time it takes an enemy soldier to disarm or remove an anti-tank mine alone, and one that is protected with antipersonnel mines. Unfortunately, there is an institutional inertia at the Pentagon that stands in the way of solving it. There is little inclination to do so absent an order from above. This report, which we expect to be objective and thorough, is intended to set the stage for such an effort.  Mr. President, I believe this is among the better foreign operations bills to have passed the Congress in several years. I am disappointed that the U.S. contribution to the IMF's New Arrangements to Borrow fell victim to the Mexico City issue, but I am confident that it will be passed on a supplemental appropriations bill next year. It does not score against the budget, and in fact would reduce the burden on the U.S. Treasury in the event the U.S. is needed to help prevent harm to the U.S. economy from an international financial crisis. Why the House did not want that is beyond me.                          ____________________
