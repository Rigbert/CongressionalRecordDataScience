President, if there is no further business to come before the Senate today, I now ask unanimous consent that the Senate stand in adjournment under the previous order.  There being no objection, the Senate, at 7:40 p.m., adjourned until Friday, March 2, 2007, at 9:30 a.m.                          ____________________
