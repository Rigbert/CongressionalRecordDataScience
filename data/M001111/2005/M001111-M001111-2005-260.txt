 President, I thank my colleagues for their consideration. I will come to the floor later to discuss both of these amendments, but essentially they deal with the children of our Guard and Reserve. I think all of us understand the impacts to families across our country. Our members from home have been called up for Guard and Reserve duty.  The first amendment I offered will help schools handle the sudden changes in student enrollment and help schools handle base closures, deployment, and force realignments. And the second amendment will make sure our military students get the counseling and support they need. Our Guard and Reserve families are spread across our States, not necessarily close to a base, and the schools are impacted across this country. When they are impacted, our children are impacted.  Both of these amendments will help all of our students in our schools make sure they reach the goals we all desire. I will be here again later to talk about both of these amendments. I thank the managers for their consideration in allowing me to call them up at this time.
