Speaker, I am inserting the following section-by-section analysis of H.R. 2517 into in the Record at this time.  The analysis follows:                           Brief Explanation       Title I of the bill will reduce projected agriculture      spending for farm commodity programs by $13.4 billion over      the period, fiscal year 1996 through 2002.       It consists of the final consideration by the Committee on      Agriculture of the Chairman's reconciliation recommendations      that are patterned in large part after H.R. 2195, the Freedom      to Farm Act. The latter bill is designed to reform U.S.      agricultural policy to perhaps the greatest extent since the      1930's. The title also conforms to the reconciliation      instructions directed to the Committee on Agriculture in      House Concurrent Resolution 67, the Current Resolution on the      Budget--Fiscal Year 1996. The provisions in the title I      recognize the realities of a post-GATT and NAFTA world trade      environment within which U.S. farmers and producers must      compete as we approach the 21st Century.       The balance of the budget savings within the jurisdiction      of the Committee on Agriculture designed to achieve the      budget reductions required by H. Con. Res. 67 were realized      with the House passage of H.R. 4, the Personal Responsibility      Act, under Title V, Food Stamp Reform and Commodity      Distribution, that is now scheduled for a House-Senate      conference.                            PURPOSE AND NEED                      Subtitle A--Freedom to Farm     Background       Since the last time Federal commodity programs were      addressed in a farm bill (1990) or in reconciliation (1993),      major changes in world trade policy, domestic budget policy,      and commodity producer opinion require a reconsideration of      Federal commodity policy.       The new majority in the 104th Congress is committed to      balancing the budget. With the passage of the first Budget      Resolution in June, the House Committee on Agriculture,      despite having cut over $50 billion in budget authority in      previous years, was directed in H.Con.Res. 67, the FY 1996      Budget Resolution to achieve $13.4 billion in savings from      Federal farm programs over the next seven fiscal years.      Admittedly, reducing Federal spending by that amount will      impact farmers. However, some economists predict that a      balanced budget will lead to a 1.5 percent reduction in      interest rates. Agriculture as a major user of credit has      over $140 billion borrowed in terms of long term and short      debt would benefit from such a result. If interest rates      decline by 1.5 percent, a balanced budget could lead to an      interest rate savings for U.S. agricultural producers      exceeding $15 billion over the next 7 years.       Following 19 hearings on Federal farm program policy by the      Subcommittee on General Farm Commodities and the full      Committee on Agriculture, the call from throughout the United      States was clear: agricultural producers wanted more planting      flexibility, more certainty with respect to Federal      assistance, and less Federal regulatory burden.       The combination of these factors led to the following      conclusions: (1) the U.S. production agriculture industry      needed to become more market-oriented, both domestically and      internationally; (2) the industry could not become more      market-oriented with a continued Federal involvement that      simply extended the current supply-management policies of the      past; and (3) the required budget cuts would not provide      adequate funding levels to allow the existing Federal      programs to function properly in a post-GATT and NAFTA world-     oriented market. Analyzing these conclusions is conjunction      with a review of the current Federal commodity price support      and production adjustment programs resulted in several      observations about agricultural policy.       First, current Federal farm programs are based on the 60      year old New Deal principle of utilizing supply management in      order to raise commodity prices and farm income. When the      Federal farm programs were first created, the government      relied on a system of quotas and allotments to control      supply. However, over the last 20 years the primary      justification for the programs has been the producers receive      in return for setting aside (idling productive farmland)      Federal assistance. That assistance was largely in the form      of deficiency payments to compensate producers for market or      loan levels that fell below a Congressionally mandated target      price for their production. Additionally, when Federal      commodity programs were set up, world markets were not a      major factor in determining agricultural policy. This      approach, while perhaps appropriate in the 1930's, ignores      the realities of a post-GATT and NAFTA world.       Second, current programs no longer achieve their original      goals and have collapsed as an effective way to deliver      assistance to producers. Worldwide agricultural competition      usurps foreign markets when the United States reduces      production. With respect to wheat, for example, world demand,      when combined with the United States' supply control      approach of idling acreage (including acreage idled under      the Conservation Reserve Program), has tightened U.S.      supplies so much that there have been no set-asides for      five years and there are not expected to be any in the      foreseeable future, which eliminates the supply management      policy justification for the present policy.       For the last ten years, congressional farm policy actions      have been driven by budget reductions. The 1995 debate has      re-affirmed the Federal budget as the driving force for      agricultural program policy. Modifications made to the      original farm programs since their inception have revolved      around two main goals: further restricting supply in order to      alleviate the overproduction which the programs encourage;      and decreasing Federal expenditures by limiting the amount of      production which is covered by Federal subsidies. These two      factors have combined in a way which has made current Federal      commodity programs less effective, both as a means of      increasing farm income and as a means to manage production,      with each successive modification. There have been several      recent situations where producers, who received an advance      deficiency payment based on U.S.D.A. estimated low prices,      have had a poor harvest and were required to repay the      advance because the nation-wide effect of the poor harvest      was to drive up the market price of the commodity beyond the      point at which current programs make a payment. This has      placed many producers in a difficult position. Even though      prices were high, their income is down because they have no      crop to market and the government assistance they had      previously received must be paid back.       Government outlays under current programs are the highest      when prices are lowest (and hence when harvests are the      best). This has had the effect of encouraging production      based on potential government benefits, not on market prices.      This incentive, when combined with the government's authority      to idle acreage (which is the only means that current      programs contain for limiting budget outlays) results in a      situation in which producers have an incentive to produce the      maximum amount of commodities while the government restricts      the acres that can be planted, thereby encouraging the over-     use of fertilizers and pesticides in order to get the most      production from the acres the government is allowing the      farmer to plant that year. This environmentally-questionable      incentive created by current programs has also resulted in      Congress authorizing greater and greater bureaucratic      controls on producers over the last ten years in order to      minimize environmental damage by requiring conservation      compliance plans, compliance with wetlands protection      provisions, and compliance with many other land-use statutes.      It would be hard to imagine a program which creates more      inconsistent incentives than the existing commodity programs.       Added on top of the regulatory burdens which have resulted      from the counter-productive environmental incentives of      current programs are the additional regulatory burdens      created by Congress over the past twenty years which attempt      to target program benefits to small producers. These so-     called payment limitation provisions have: (1) resulted in      substantial paperwork requirements for producers whose      operations do not actually approach the payment limit, (2)      required a substantial amount of government administrative      resources, which has inhibited the government-wide goal of      downsizing; and (3) been largely ineffective as a means of      ensuring that benefits are targeted to small producers      because of the loopholes in the existing structure.       Third, preserving the current Federal farm program      structure with the required $13.4 billion in cuts will leave      producers with an ineffective and counter productive      agricultural policy. The resulting system would be an      emasculated remnant of an out-of-date 1930's-era program      which no longer serves the people it was originally      intended to benefit. While further modifications of      current Federal commodity programs may accomplish required      budget savings, ten years of budget cuts has changed the      fundamental nature of farm programs to the extent they      have inhibited farm production and producer earning      potential.       Retaining the present policy would be a mistake when other      methods can achieve the goals of providing U.S. producers      with increased planting flexibility and less regulatory      burden while at the same time allowing for greater earnings      from the marketplace and reducing the budgetary exposure to      the Federal Government.     Rationale       With these conclusions in mind, the recommended changes in      Federal commodity policy which are accomplished in this title      have a cumulative reconciliation savings of $13.4 billion, as      estimated by the Congressional Budget Office. The Federal      farm policy for commodities, titled as the ``Freedom to      Farm'' in Subtitle A, captures the CBO projected baseline for      agriculture over the next seven years after incorporating the      $13.4      billion in savings required by the House Concurrent      Resolution 67 instructions to the Committee on Agriculture.       Freedom to Farm (``FFA'') replaces the commodity price      support and production adjustment programs with a seven-year      market transition contract payment for eligible owners and      operators and a nonrecourse marketing assistance loan program      for eligible producers. Contract participants will receive      seven annual market transition payments in exchange for      maintaining compliance with their respective conservation      plans and applicable wetlands protection provisions.      Producers utilizing the marketing assistance loan will get      the benefit of a nonrecourse loan at harvest time so that      they will not have to sell commodities at a time when market      prices are historically low in order to maintain a positive      cash flow. Additionally, contract payments are limited to      $50,000 per person, regardless of whether such payments are      received directly or indirectly through other entities, and      will be tracked according to Social Security numbers, hence      eliminating once and for all the devices and schemes such as      the ``Mississippi Christmas Tree'' to avoid payment limits.      The Secretary is also directed to implement adequate      safeguards to protect the interests of operators who are      tenants and sharecroppers.       From a GATT perspective, the termination of the commodity      price support programs will make U.S. commodities immediately      more competitive on the world market by removing the      distorting effect that current programs have maintained. This      is significant because at the current time, world commodity      supplies are relatively tight and estimates indicate that, at      best, this situation will remain for quite some time.       With respect to domestic farm policy, FFA accomplishes      several goals. First, it accomplishes a large amount of      deregulation by freeing farmers up to farm for the market and      not the government program. By removing government production      controls on land use, FFA effectively eliminates the number      one complaint of producers about the programs: bureaucratic      red tape and government interference. Complaints about      endless waits at the county office should end. Hassles over      field sizes and whether the right crop was planted to the      correct amount of acres should be a thing of the past. People      concerned about the environment will be pleased that the      government no longer forces the planting of surplus crops      and monoculture agriculture. Producers who want to      introduce a rotation on their farm for agronomic reasons      should be free to do so without the restrictions in      current programs.       Second, the Freedom to Farm Act provides U.S. producers      with a guaranteed payment for the next seven years, because      it establishes a contract between the Federal Government and      the producer. When compared to the alternative of further      modifying existing programs, it results in the optimum      producer net income over the next seven years and protects      the producer from further budget cuts should there be further      budget reconciliation bills in the future. The guarantee of a      fixed (albeit declining) payment for seven years will provide      the predictability that producers have wanted and will      provide certainty to lenders as a basis for extending credit      to production agriculture. The current situation in which      prices are above the target price as a result of poor crops      (producers do not get a payment or are forced to repay      advanced payments), and therefore have less income should be      corrected under FFA. Without a crop to market, producers      cannot benefit from the higher prices, and instead of getting      help when they need it most, the current system cuts off      their deficiency payments and demands that they repay advance      deficiency payments.       FFA insures that whatever government financial assistance      is available will be delivered, regardless of the      circumstances, because the producer signs a contract with the      Federal Government for the next seven years. Just as      producers will need to look to the market for planting and      marketing signals, FFA will require producers to manage their      finances to compensate for price swings. It may be true that      when prices are high, producers will receive a full market      transition payment under FAA but it is equally true that if      prices decline, farmers will receive no more than the fixed      market transition payment. That means the individual producer      must manage all income, both market and government, to      account for weather and price fluctuations.       Third, FFA encourages market orientation. Producers can      plant or idle all their acres at their discretion, with a      significant reduction in the restrictions on what can be      planted. Producers will have to make commodity planting      decisions in response to commodity markets instead of      decisions based on deficiency payment rates and crop acreage      bases. Decoupling Federal payments from production (a process      which began in 1985 when payment yields were frozen) would      end any pressure from the government in choosing crops to      plant. Under FFA, all production incentives should come from      the marketplace and not government programs. Additionally, as      long as producers maintain compliance with their applicable      conservation plans, they are free to choose to plant no crop      at all, which will benefit soil and water quality in marginal      areas, as well as benefitting wildlife.       Fourth, FFA recognizes that the benefits from current      programs have, to some extent, been incorporated into the      value of agricultural land. By abolishing the link between      production and benefits, but doing so in a manner which      provides a seven-year transition period, the economic      distortions caused by existing programs can be removed in a      manner that causes the least amount of disruption and harm to      rural America. For that reason the FFA contract payment has      been aptly named as a market transition payment.     Good policy for the future       FFA is also good policy for the future of production      agriculture in the United States. The most severe critics of      current farm programs, including the New York Times,      the Washington Post, the Economist, and a host of regional      newspapers, have hailed FFA as the most significant reform      in agricultural policy since the New Deal in the 1930's.      Congressional critics that have urged reform of the farm      programs have also indicated that FFA embodies the type of      reform necessary to transition agriculture into a market-     oriented industry. Nearly every agricultural economist who      has commented on FFA has supported its structure and its      probable effect on producers and the agricultural sector.       The reforms accomplished by FFA will help transition U.S.      agricultural producers into a new era of a market-oriented      Federal farm policy while simultaneously providing fixed,      declining payments over seven years in order to minimize the      economic distortions resulting from the change away from the      New Deal Era Federal farm programs.                           Subtitle B--Dairy     Summary       Subtitle B replaces the dairy price support program on      January 1, 1996, with (1) a market transition program which      provides seven market transition payments to milk producers      between April 15, 1996 and October 15, 2001, and (2) a      recourse loan program for processors. The Federal milk      marketing order program is replaced on July 1, 1996, by a      program which verifies receipts of, prices paid for, and uses      of milk, and which further, upon request, audits marketing      agreements and other private contracts for the receipt and      payment of milk between producers and handlers. The Dairy      Export Incentive Program (DEIP) is reauthorized through      September 30, 2002, and fully funded to the limits permitted      by the Uruguay Round of the GATT. The Fluid Milk Promotion      Program of 1990 is reauthorized and the producer assessment      for promotion under the Dairy Production Stabilization Act of      1983 is extended to imported products. The combined impact of      these changes saves $511 million, or approximately 23.5%, of      spending on Federal dairy programs projected by CBO over the      next seven fiscal years.     Background       Since the last time Federal dairy programs were addressed      in a farm bill (1990) or in reconciliation (1993), major      changes in world trade policy, domestic budget policy, and      dairy producer opinion require us to reconsider Federal dairy      policy.       Every Federal dairy program was created subsequent to      Section 22 and premised upon the ability of Section 22 to      stop foreign dairy products at our border. As of July 1,      1995, Section 22 was limited in its applicability by the      implementation legislation for the Uruguay Round of the GATT.       With the passage of the First Budget Resolution in June,      the House Agriculture Committee was required to achieve $13.4      billion in savings on Federal farm programs over the next      seven fiscal years. As a commodity, dairy's fair share of      that amount was slightly more than $500 million, or about $73      million annually.       Following ten hearings on dairy issues by the Subcommittee      on Livestock, Dairy and Poultry, including field hearings in      California, Florida, Minnesota, New York, and Wisconsin, the      mandate from dairy farmers to end budget reconciliation      assessments immediately became overwhelming. The elimination      of assessments would decrease funding available for Federal      dairy programs by approximately $250 million annually.       The combination of these events led to the following      conclusions: (1) the U.S. dairy industry needed to become      more market-oriented, domestically and internationally;      (2) the industry could not become more market-oriented      without a level field at home; (3) the industry needed      tools to become, and remain, competitive in the world      market; and (4) there was inadequate funding to retain and      maintain existing Federal dairy programs.       A review of Federal dairy programs (i.e., dairy price      supports, Federal milk marketing orders, and the Dairy Export      Incentive Program (DEIP)) produced the following conclusions.       First, since the support price was decreased to $10.10/cwt      in the 1990 Farm Bill, the dairy price support program has      been largely inactive. For example, in the last 12 months,      the Commodity Credit Corporation (CCC) has not purchased any      cheese and only purchased 26 million pounds of butter and 27      million pounds of nonfat dry milk. By contrast, a decade ago      the CCC purchased 293 million pounds of butter, 591 million      pounds of cheese, and 827 million pounds of nonfat dry milk      during the same 12 month period. Currently, we have no      butter, no cheese, and only 30 million pounds of nonfat dry      milk in government storage.       Secondly, existing Federal milk marketing orders act as an      impediment to a level playing field domestically. The U.S.      dairy industry cannot hope to be competitive in the world      market if our domestic marketing system produces competitive      advantages and disadvantages at home unrelated to market      indicators and other economic conditions. The Congressional      Budget Office projects that Class I differentials, fixed by      statute in 1985, will add an average of $134 million annually      to the cost of the dairy price support program in the next      five fiscal years by creating artificial incentives to      produce milk in regions with sufficient Class I supplies of      milk. Studies of Federal milk marketing orders by the General      Accounting Office in 1988 and 1995 have produced similar      conclusions.       Thirdly, the inactivity of the dairy price support program      and the low levels of government-stored dairy products are      directly related to the success of the DEIP program. Dairy      economists across the nation uniformly agree that the DEIP      program has added between $.50/cwt to $1.00/cwt to producer      prices in each of the last five years.     Rationale       With these conclusions in mind, the following changes in      Federal dairy policy are accomplished in this legislation      which have a cumulative reconciliation savings of $511      million estimated by the Congressional Budget Office.       Chapter 1 of subtitle B replaces the dairy price support      program on January 1, 1996 with a market transition program      for milk producers and a recourse loan program for dairy      processors. Producers will receive seven market transition      payments in exchange for the termination of the price support      program. Since any negative impact resulting from that      termination will be greatest in 1996, producers will receive      two of the seven market transition payments during calendar      year 1996.       From a GATT perspective, the termination of the price      support program will make U.S. cheese, butter and nonfat dry      milk immediately competitive on the world market. This is      significant because, by the end of the decade, 17 percent of      the world market for nonfat dry milk, 23 percent of the world      market for cheese, and 31 percent of the world market for      butter will have opened up due to reductions in subsidized      exports under the Uruguay Round.       The recourse loan program will permit processors of cheddar      cheese, butter and nonfat dry milk to place their product      under a recourse loan with the CCC at 90 percent of the      average market value for that product during the previous      three months. Loans will be at CCC interest rates and will      come due at the end of the fiscal year (September 30), but      can be extended into the upcoming fiscal year.       Chapter 2 of subtitle B further enables the United States      to become, and remain, a player in the world dairy market of      the 21st Century. The DEIP program is reauthorized through      September 30, 2002 and fully funded to the limits permitted      under the Uruguay Round in each fiscal year. The Secretary of      Agriculture is authorized to assist the U.S. dairy industry      in establishing an export trading company, or other entity,      to provide international market development and export      services.       Chapter 3 of subtitle B further assists the industry in      becoming more market-oriented by reauthorizing the Fluid Milk      Promotion Act of 1990, extending the producer promotion      assessment under the Dairy Production Stabilization Act of      1983 to imported dairy products, and by requiring that at      least 10 percent of the budget of the National Dairy      Promotion and Research Board be allocated to international      market development annually.       Indeed, the purpose of Federal dairy promotion programs      authorized under the Fluid Milk Promotion Act and the Dairy      Product Stabilization Act is to maintain and expand markets      for fluid milk and the products of milk, not to maintain or      expand the share of those markets which any particular      processor or association of producers currently has. The      programs created and funded by these Acts are not intended to      compete with or replace individual advertising and promotion      efforts, but rather to meet the governmental goal and      objective of maintaining and expanding the market for fluid      milk and the products of milk through continuous and      coordinated programs of promotion, research, and consumer      information.       Chapter 4 of subtitle B replaces current Federal milk      marketing orders on July 1, 1996, with a program which      verifies receipts of, prices paid for, and uses of milk, and      which further provides an auditing mechanism for marketing      agreements and other private contracts for the receipt and      payment of milk between producers and handlers. The Secretary      will report statistics to the industry including information      on payments to producers on a component basis, including      payments for milkfat, protein and other solids.       The elimination of the pricing and pooling functions of      Federal milk marketing orders will assure a level playing      field domestically among producers and insure that industry      responds to market signals rather than decade-old fixed      differentials which provide artificial incentives to produce      milk.       Chapter 5 of subtitle B extends miscellaneous expiring      provisions in law related to these Federal dairy programs.                     Subtitle C--Other Commodities       The Committee commenced hearings and received testimony      from over 100 witnesses in the areas of the United States      where peanuts and sugar beets, sugar cane, and corn are      grown, as well as in Washington, D.C., to discuss reform of      the peanut and sugar programs. The Committee outlined reform      criteria with the goal of revising the current peanut and      sugar programs to make them more market-oriented and operate      at no cost to the Federal Government, while still providing a      safety net for producers.       These programs have been increasingly criticized by      consumer groups, food processors and manufacturers,      environmental groups, and others for a variety of reasons,      including artificially increasing prices, encouraging the      environmentally-damaging practice of monoculture cropping,      and allowing a relatively small number of producers to      reap the program benefits at the expense of taxpayers and      consumers.       In this context, the Committee's recommendations with      respect to the Federal programs for peanuts and sugar are      reform-oriented and are made with the intention of providing      the framework for a more market-oriented approach to      production, with less government involvement.     Peanuts       According to the United States Department of Agriculture      (USDA), net peanut government program expenditures for fiscal      year 1995 are estimated to be $85.6 million. USDA projects an      annual cost of $76 million per year for fiscal years 1996-     2000 if current program provisions were retained. The      proposed title I would eliminate the administrative costs of      the program through the elimination of the national poundage      quota and undermarketing provisions which allow additional      peanuts to receive the quota price support rate. This will      allow the Secretary to set the national poundage quota at a      level that satisfies the estimated domestic consumption and      prevent additional peanuts from entering the quota pool at      the higher loan rate.       With respect to price support, title I would freeze the      price support loan rate for quota peanuts at $610 per ton for      the 1996 through 2002 crops. This is a reduction from the      current loan rate of $678 per ton, which is approximately      commensurate to a price support level based on current cost      of production. Current law provides that the price support      level may only increase based on cost of production, up to 5%      over the support rate for the preceding year. If the previous      years' quota price support rates were allowed to increase or      decrease 5% per year, today's price support level would be      approximately $608.64.       Among other changes, title I, as proposed, would also      instruct the Secretary to decrease the quota support rate by      15 percent to any producer who refuses an offer from a      handler to purchase quota peanuts at the quota support rate,      in order to provide an incentive to producers to sell to the      market rather than taking out a price support loan.       Title I would prioritize the method of covering losses in      area quota pools. Looses would first be covered through      individual gains on sales of additional peanuts, then by pool      gains on sales of additional peanuts, before proceeding to      the cross compliance provisions. The Secretary of Agriculture      would also be given the authority to increase the marketing      assessment on growers in a pool to cover any further losses,      with a provision directing any unused assessment funds to be      returned to the Treasury.       With respect to the sale, lease, and transfer of quota,      several changes are recommended. Currently, quota can only be      sold or leased to another owner or operator in the fall or      after the normal planting season within the same country. The      Committee recommends full sale, lease or transfer of quota to      any county within a State without any restrictions. The      Committee also proposes a review of the feasibility of quota      transfer of across state lines under the purview of the      Commission on 21st Century Production Agriculture.       In addition, the Committee's recommendation would tighten      the eligibility of those who own quota by mandating that any      required reductions in the national poundage quota in a State      shall first be reduced with respect to public entities, non-     resident quota holders who are not producers, and resident      quota holders who are not producers before reducing the      quota allocation of a State's producers.     Sugar       The Committee proposal increases revenue to the Treasury      through an increased marketing assessment from 1.1% to 1.5%      of the loan rate for raw cane sugar and from 1.17% to 1.6083%      of the loan rate for beet sugar. Provisions in current law      mandating that the program operate at no net cost to the      Treasury would be maintained.       Sugar beet and sugar cane loan rates are frozen at current      1995 levels. However, loan rates are required to be reduced      if the Secretary determines that negotiated reductions in      export subsidies and domestic subsidies provided for sugar of      the European Union and other major sugar growing countries in      the aggregate exceed the commitments made as part of the      Uruguay Round Agreement.       With respect to marketing allotments, the Committee's      recommendation would allow full and unrestrained production      of sugar in the United States through elimination of      marketing allotments.       The Committee also proposes a consistent increase of      imports through the establishment of a loan modification      threshold which is initially triggered at 1,257,000 short      tons raw value in fiscal years 1996 and 1997, and at 103% of      the loan modification threshold for the previous fiscal year      level for fiscal years 1998 through 2002. Under this      provision, recourse loans to processors are made available up      to the threshold level and would be converted into      nonrecourse loans if imports rise above the threshold level.               Subtitle D--Miscellaneous Program Changes       The Federal Crop Insurance Reform Act of 1994 (Reform Act),      contained in Title I of P.L. 103-354, made significant      changes in the multi-peril crop insurance (MPCI) program as      well as ending, for all practical purposes, ad hoc Federal      assistance to farmers for crop failures. Two controversial      and complex provisions of the new law have caused      consternation and irritation among agricultural producers,      and that, in turn, has made MPCI a less attractive product      for many farmers.       A principal provision of the Reform Act required any      agricultural producer who is a farm commodity program or      Conservation Reserve Program participant or who is receiving      a loan or loan guarantee through the U.S. Department of      Agriculture (USDA) to purchase a MPCI policy to insure      against at least a catastrophic crop loss (CAT), i.e., for a      crop loss of 50 percent loss in yield, on and individual or      area yield basis. To obtain CAT coverage, producers pay an      administrative fee for each crop produced in a county.      Because of USDA's implementation of the Reform Act, each      landlord who receives a program payment (shared tenancy) is      required to pay the $50 fee. This link between farm program      participation and crop insurance caused a great deal of      confusion and irritation among producers because of the      inequities in USDA implementation. For example, an owner-     operator growing only wheat on a section of land in a single      county could purchase CAT coverage for a single $50 fee,      while multiple owners with a tenant farming in more than one      county were required to pay multiple fees. One particularly      egregious case that came to light involved nine different      landlords and their tenants who farmed three different crops      in three counties. Each of the owners was required to pay      three fees for each crop in each of the three counties,      resulting a substantial amount of dollars in fees for      insurance on a minimal number of acres.       A second provision that caused undue confusion involved the      delivery system implemented by the Consolidated Farm Service      Agency (CFSA) within USDA. Because each agricultural producer      could be required to purchase at least the CAT insurance      policy, Congress allowed CFSA local offices to sell CAT      coverage in those areas of the country where private      insurance agents were not available or not readily available.      As implemented, however, CFSA became an instant competitor      with insurance agents around the country. Because the new      MPCI program was late in clearing Congress and even later in      getting into the field, local CFSA personnel obviously were      confused during the initial start-up phase of the new      program. This confusion was spread throughout farm country      during this past spring and harmed a program that already was      disliked and unused by a majority of producers in almost      every part of the country.       It also has come to the Committee's attention that the      assistant administrator for risk management who is the FCIC      manager and responsible for its day-to-day operations also      has become totally absorbed by CFSA administrators to an      extent that risk management and crop insurance are being run      as if they were just another farm program, in other words,      not in an actuarially-sound manner. Under any policy      scenario, Federal farm price and income support programs are      in transition, making it vitally important that our      agricultural producers have sound risk management programs      they can use for price and yield protection and marketing      assistance without undue USDA intervention. Creating an      independent agency and then subsuming the congressional      policy objective of providing new risk management techniques,      including MPCI offered generally through a private delivery      system, within the scope of traditional, 50-year-old New Deal      policies does not make sense. Congress clearly set new policy      and structural changes at the new CFSA, and thus far, CFSA      has ignored many of those policy objectives.       Finally, in that regard, the FCIC board has been inactively      engaged in its responsibility to manage FCIC operations in      the current Administration, ceding its authority to CFSA      personnel. Because of that, the MPCI program has been      neglected and is a less viable risk management tool than      Congress intended but for the inattention to its direction by      CFSA.       Admendments included in the agricultural title of the      omnibus budget reconciliation bill seek to change both the      mandatory link of MPCI and USDA farm and credit programs so      that producers not wanting to purchase CAT coverage could do      so by waiving the right to any possible crop disaster      assistance for the crop year in which CAT coverage had been      offered by the FCIC but not purchased by the producer. This      saves $180 million over the seven-year period.       Additional amendments provide for a totally private      delivery system by the crop insurance industry. Under the      Committee amendments, FCIC is required to submit its delivery      plan that will provide at least CAT insurance availability to      each producer in the country (who wants to purchase it) to      the agriculture committees of Congress by May 1, 1996. The      clear intent is that MPCI, both CAT coverage and additional,      buy-up coverage, will be offered, sold and serviced by the      private crop insurance industry that has invested a great      deal of time and money toward providing crop insurance      services to agricultural producers.       Other amendments included in the budgetary provisions      establish a fully independent Office of Risk Management with      an administrator who will manage the FCIC as well as assume      other risk management responsibilities enumerated by the      amendments. The Secretary of Agriculture is directed to      (shall) appoint the Administrator of the Office of Risk      Management.       Further amendments will recreate a more effective FCIC      board of directors by providing a more diverse composition of      the board's directors as well as providing for terms of      appointment for specific time periods. Impairment of the      board to act under the law also will impair the delegation of      authority to the FCIC manager. This should ensure the board      will remain an active participant in FCIC's policy and      operational direction.       By any measure, farmers, agricultural economists, wildlife      advocates and environmentalists alike believe the      Conservation Reserve Program (CRP), established by the 1985      Food Security Act ('85 FSA), has been a success. Landowners      have enrolled about eight percent of U.S. cropland in 12      separate signups from 1986 to June 1992. At the end of the      12th signup, about 375,000 contracts had been put into      effect, although around two-thirds of the acreage currently      subject to contracts will expire at the beginning of fiscal      year 1998.       Billions of tons of topsoil have been saved over the life      of the program. Large sections of prairie have been returned      to grass, providing critical habitat for migratory waterfowl      as well as restorative nesting cover for game birds. Net      savings in farm program expenditures also have been realized      throughout the life of the CRP.       As mentioned previously, however, 1992 was the last year of      new CRP enrollments even though the 1990 amendments to the      '85 FSA provided for a 38 million-acre program. The      appropriations committees of the Congress in those years      refused to provide for any additional acreage to be enrolled      in the CRP.       Current law also does not give a landowner with a CRP      contract any flexibility to opt out of his contract even      though the rental payment is intended to pay for conservation      in the Federal fiscal year for which the payment is made.      Should commodity prices rise enough to entice a landowner      using acceptable conservation systems with an approved      compliance plan to get out of the program to meet market      demands, he may not do so unless the Secretary is satisfied      there is sufficient grain needs worldwide to require use of      CRP lands.       The amendments set out in Section 1402 of Subtitle D are      intended to resolve these issues. As of the date of      enactment, the Committee will ratify, by an amendment in      title I, four years of appropriations committee policy by      capping the CRP at the current acreage of 36.4 million acres      during the seven-year period beginning with the date of      enactment.       The Committee's amendments also would allow for landowners      to opt out of their contracts by giving the Secretary 60 days      notice of the contract termination. Should the contract be      terminated prior the end of the fiscal year, September 30 of      any calendar, the Secretary shall prorate the payment. The      highly-erodible land must be farmed under a conservation      system and compliance plan that is not more onerous than      systems and plans for similar land in the area.       Landowners who have terminated a contract may resubmit a      subsequent bid to enroll the high-erodible land under a new      CRP contract. Extensions of existing contracts or any new      contracts of reenrolled lands will be at 75 percent of the      previous rental rate for the land. These provisions provide      savings between 1996-2002 of $570 million.     Subtitle E--Commission on 21st Century Production Agriculture       The changes in Federal farm policy made in the preceding      subtitles are a dramatic departure from current farm      commodity programs. Many of those involved in production      agriculture from the farmer to the economist, to rural      lenders, and especially to those with an economic interest in      current programs, are concerned that a change of the      magnitude described in the preceding subtitles coupled with      less Federal subsidy dollars will adversely affect not only      the U.S. agricultural industry, but also rural America. While      the dramatic changes proposed for the Federal Government's      involvement in agriculture as prescribed by the Freedom to      Farm Act, are in fact a recognition of the changing rural and      urban landscape of America, an examination of the changes      wrought by these policy changes and what farm policies are      needed for the 21st Century farm sector is in order.       When the present Federal programs for agriculture were      adopted, the nation was in the darkest depths of the Great      Depression of the 1930's. Not everyone believed the Federal      Government should get involved in agriculture. Indeed, the      original Agricultural      Adjustment Act of 1933 was declared unconstitutional by the Supreme      Court. But a consensus was reached and the United States      Government embarked upon a course of substantial involvement      in agriculture. The present programs were claimed to be      created out of political and economic necessity, because the      nation was largely rural and the majority of the population      lived on farms or rural areas.       In the intervening 60 years, the United States has been      transformed into a largely urban society with less than 2      million citizens on farms. There is evidence that Federal      farm programs may have eased the transition from a rural      society to an urban society. While the United States is now      largely an urban population, nearly 20 percent of the Gross      National Product can be attributed to agriculture if the      entire sector is considered, i.e., from the farm to the      manufacturing, distribution, and input infrastructure      involved in modern agriculture's miracle of productivity.       The United States is blessed with a very valuable asset:      fertile land, with adequate moisture, growing season, and      dedicated users of such land that make it the envy of the      world. The challenge for the United States as we enter the      21st Century is how do we wisely use our very valuable      natural resource: agriculture. The present system of      agricultural price supports and supply control programs has      come under increasing attack by economists,      environmentalists, and farmers as being inadequate for modern      agriculture. The Freedom to Farm Act is meant to be a      transition policy for U.S. agriculture. But a transition to      what?       Over the 7 years of the transition contract, the Congress      hopes a national debate can take place as to what should be      the Federal involvement in production agriculture in the 21st      Century. Should it be a system of direct price supports found      in the present system? Should it be some type of income      support mechanism that provides some means of income or      revenue protection given the nature of production      agriculture, which is subject to the vagaries of weather,      pestilence, and geo-political market disruptions. Should the      Federal involvement in production agriculture be limited to      only foreign market development and research that enhances      U.S. agriculture's relative competitive position? Or can many      of the goals necessary to have a healthy food and fiber      sector be accomplished through Federal tax policy?       To stimulate substantial debate and provide answers to      these questions, Subtitle E establishes a Commission on 21st      Century Production Agriculture, which is designed to give      future Congresses and Presidents and others information and      feedback to gauge the effectiveness of the changes made by      this legislation, and also to recommend further appropriate      Federal policy and involvement in production agriculture. The      Commission is to conduct a ``look-back'' (how successful is      Freedom to Farm) and a ``look-to-the-future'' that recommends      new or different policies for 21st Century agriculture.       This Commission, comprised of 11 members to be appointed by      the President and the Chairmen of the House and Senate      Agriculture Committees in consultation with their Ranking      Minority Members, will conduct a comprehensive review of      changes in the condition of the agricultural sector, taking      into account land values, regulatory and taxation burdens,      export markets, and progress under international trade      agreements. The Commission will also make an assessment of      changes in production agriculture, identify the appropriate      future relationship between the Federal Government and      production agriculture after 2002, and assess the future      personnel and administrative needs of USDA. Not later than      June 1, 1998, the Commission shall report its interim      findings with respect to its comprehensive review of the      condition of the agricultural sector. Not later than January      1, 2001, the Commission shall make a final report concerning      its assessments and determinations regarding the future role      of the Federal Government in farm policy.                      Section-by-Section Analysis                      subtitle a--freedom to farm     Section 1101.--Short title       This Subtitle may be cited as the ``The Freedom to Farm Act      of 1995''.     Section 1102.--Seven year contracts to improve farming          certainty and flexibility       Subsection (a). Contracts authorized       Subsection (a) amends obsolete section 102 of the      Agricultural Act of 1949 to provide authority for the      Secretary to enter into seven-year market transition      contracts.       Amended section 102(a), in paragraph (1), authorizes the      Secretary to enter into 7-year market transition contracts      between 1996 and 2002 with eligible owners and operators on a      farm containing eligible farmland. In exchange for annual      payments under the contract, the owner or operator must agree      to comply with the applicable conservation plan for the farm      and the wetland protection requirements of title XII of the      Food Security Act of 1985.       Amended section 102(a), in paragraph (2), describes      eligible owners and operators, that include:       (A) an operator who assumes all risk of producing a crop;       (B) an operator who shares in the risk of producing a crop;       (C) an operator with a share-rent lease regardless of the      length of such lease if the owner also enters into the      contract;       (D) an operator with a cash rent lease that expires on or      after September 30, 2002, in which case the consent of the      owner is not required;       (E) an operator with a cash rent lease that expires before      September 30, 2002, and the owner consents to the contract;      and       (F) an operator with a cash rent lease, but only if the      operator declines to enter into a contract, in which case      payments under the contract will not begin until the fiscal      year following the year in which the lease expires.       Amended section 102(a), in paragraph (3), instructs the      Secretary to provide adequate safeguards to protect the      interests of operators who are tenants and sharecroppers.       Amended section 102(b), in paragraph (1), provides that the      deadline for entering into a market transition contract is      April 15, 1996, except that owners and operators on farms      which contain acreage enrolled in the Conservation Reserve      Program (``CRP'') may enter into a market transition contract      upon the expiration of the CRP contract.       Amended section 102(b), in paragraph (2), provides that the      contracts shall begin with the 1996 crop year and extend      through the 2002 crop year.       Amended section 102(b), in paragraph (3), provides that, at      the time a contract is signed, the Secretary shall estimate      the minimum payment that will be made under the contract, and      the owner or operator may terminate the contract without      penalty if the first actual payment is less than 95 percent      of the estimate.       Amended section 102(b), in paragraph (4), instructs the      Secretary to issue a report to the House and Senate      Agriculture Committees within 90 days after the date of      enactment of this section setting forth a plan as to the      number of, and acreage in, contracts to be signed, the      anticipated amount of payments, and the manner in which the      contracts will be signed.       Amended section 102(c) describes eligible farmland, which      is land that contains a crop acreage base, at least a portion      of which was enrolled in the acreage reduction programs      authorized for a crop of rice, upland cotton, feed grains, or      wheat and which has served as the basis for deficiency      payments in at least one of the 1991 through 1995 crop years,      including zero-certified considered planted acreage under      section 503(c)(7) of the Agricultural Act of 1949. With      respect to contracts for acreage enrolled in the CRP, such      acreage must have crop acreage base attributable to it.       Amended section 102(d) establishes the payment dates under      the market transition contracts as September 30 of each of      the fiscal years 1996 through 2002, and provides that an      owner or operator may opt to receive half of each annual      payment not later than March 15 of each year. For the 1996      fiscal year, an owner or operator may elect to receive half      of the payment within 90 days of signing a market transition      contract.       Amended section 102(e), in paragraph (l), establishes an      overall spending limit for the fiscal years 1996 through 2002      at $38,733,000,000.       Amended section 102(e), in paragraph (2), establishes      yearly spending limits of:       (A) $6,014,000,000 for FY 1996;       (B) $5,829,000,000 for FY 1997;       (C) $6,244,000,000 for FY 1998;       (D) $6,047,000,000 for FY 1999;       (E) $5,573,000,000 for FY 2000;       (F) $4,574,000,000 for FY 2001; and       (G) $4,453,000,000 for FY 2002.       Amended section 102(e), in paragraph (3), directs the      Secretary to adjust the amounts specified in paragraphs (1)      and (2), if necessary, by:       (A) subtracting payments required under sections 101B,      103B, 105B, and 107B for the 1994 and 1995 crop years;       (B) adding producer repayments of deficiency payments      received during that fiscal year under section 114(a)(2);       (C) adding market transition contract payments withheld at      the request of producers, during the preceding fiscal year as      an offset against repayments of deficiency payments otherwise      required under section 114(a)(2); and       (D) adding market transition contract payments which are      refunded during the preceding fiscal year under amended      section 102(h).       Amended section 102(f) establishes the basis for      determining the allocation of available funds under a market      transition contract for crop acreage base for each contract      commodity;       Amended section 102(f)(2), in subparagraph (A), directs the      Secretary to calculate the total expenditures for all      contract commodities for the 1991 through 1995 crops under      sections 101B, 103B, 105B, and 107B, including expenditures      in the form of deficiency payments, loan deficiency payments,      marketing loan gains, and marketing certificates.       Amended section 102(f)(2), in subparagraph (B), authorizes      the Secretary to use estimates, as contained in the      President's budget for fiscal year 1997 submitted to      Congress under section 1105 of title 31, United States      Code, in the absence of information regarding actual 1995      crop expenditures for a contract commodity.       Amended section 102(f), in paragraph (3), provides that the      amount available for a fiscal year for payments with respect      to crop acreage base of a contract commodity shall be equal      to the product of:       (A) the ratio of the amount calculated under section      102(f)(2) for that contract commodity to the total amount      calculated for all contract commodities under paragraph (2);      and       (B) the amount specified in section 102(e)(2) for that      fiscal year (including any adjustments under section      102(e)(3)).       Amended section 102(g), in paragraph (1), establishes the      basis for determining the amount of production attributable      to a contract commodity covered by a contract, which is equal      to the product of:       (A) the crop acreage base of that contract commodity      attributable to the eligible farmland subject to the      contract; and       (B) the farm program payment yield in effect for the 1995      crop of that contract commodity for the farm containing that      eligible farmland.       Amended section 102(g), in paragraph (2), provides that for      each of the fiscal years 1996 through 2002, the total amount      of production of each contract commodity covered by all      market transition contracts shall be equal to the sum of the      amounts calculated under paragraph (1) for each market      transition contract in effect during that fiscal year.       Amended section 102(g), in paragraph (3), provides that the      payment rate for a contract commodity for a fiscal year shall      be equal to--       (A) the amount made available under section 102(f)(3) for      that commodity for that fiscal year; divided by       (B) the amount determined under paragraph (2) for that      fiscal year.       Amended section 102(g), in paragraph (4), provides that,      for each of the fiscal years 1996 through 2002, the amount to      be paid under a particular market transition contract with      respect to a contract commodity shall be equal to the product      of--       (A) the amount of production determined under section      102(g)(1) for that contract for that contract commodity; and       (B) the payment rate in effect under paragraph (3) for that      fiscal year for that contract commodity.       Amended section 102(g), in paragraph (5), provides that the      provisions of section 8(g) of the Soil Conservation and      Domestic Allotment Act relating to assignment of payments      shall apply to market transition contract payments, and      requires that the owner, operator, or assignee to notify the      Secretary of such assignment.       Amended section 102(g), in paragraph (6), directs the      Secretary to allow for sharing of payments made under a      market transition contract among the owners and operators      subject to a contract on a fair and equitable basis.       Amended section 102(h) establishes an annual payment      limitation under a market transition contract at $50,000 per      person during any fiscal year and instructs the Secretary to      issue regulations defining the term `person' which shall      conform, to the extent practicable, to the regulations      defining such term issued under section 1001 of the Food      Security Act of 1985. The Secretary is further instructed      to ensure that contract payments issued to corporations      and other persons described in section 1001(5)(B)(i)(II)      of such Act comply with the attribution requirements      specified in paragraph (5)(C) of such section.       Amended section 102(i), in paragraph (1), authorizes the      Secretary to terminate a market transition contract if an      owner or operator violates the farm's conservation compliance      plan or wetland protection requirements. Upon termination,      the owner or operator forfeits future payments and must      refund payments received during the period of the violation,      with interest as determined by the Secretary.       Amended section 102(i), in paragraph (2), provides that, if      the Secretary determines that the nature of the violation      does not warrant termination of the contract as provided in      paragraph (1), the Secretary may--       (A) require a partial refund with interest thereon; or       (B) adjust future contract payments.       Amended section 102(i), in paragraph (3), prohibits the      Secretary from requiring repayments from an owner or operator      if farmland which is subject to the contract is foreclosed      upon and the Secretary determines that forgiving such      repayments is appropriate in order to provide fair and      equitable treatment. This authority does not void the      responsibilities of such owner or operator if the owner or      operator continues or resumes control or operation of the      property subject to the contract, and in effect reinstate the      contract.       Amended section 102(i), in paragraph (4), provides that a      determination by the Secretary under this subsection shall be      considered as an adverse decision for purposes of review by      the National Appeals Division under subtitle H of title II of      the Federal Crop Insurance Reform and Department of      Agriculture Reorganization Act of 1994.       Amended section 102(j), in paragraph (1), provides for      transfers of land subject to a market transition contract.      Upon a transfer, a contract is automatically terminated      unless the transferee agrees to assume all obligations under      the contract. A transferee may request modifications to a      contract before assuming it, if the modifications are      consistent with the objectives of this section as determined      by the Secretary.       Amended section 102(j), in paragraph (2), authorizes the      Secretary to issue regulations regarding contract payments in      instances in which an owner or operator dies, becomes      incompetent, or is otherwise unable to receive a contract      payment.       Amended section 102(k), in paragraph (1), establishes      planting flexibility provisions on land subject to a market      transition contract. Crops which can be grown include--       (A) rice, upland cotton, feed grains, and wheat;       (B) any oilseed;       (C) any industrial or experimental crop designated by the      Secretary;       (D) mung beans, lentils, and dry peas; and       (E) any other crop, except any fruit or vegetable crop      (including potatoes and dry edible beans) not covered by      subparagraph (D), unless such fruit or vegetable crop is      designated by the Secretary as--       (i) an industrial or experimental crop; or       (ii) a crop for which no substantial domestic production or      market exists.       Amended section 102(k) in paragraph (2), authorizes the      Secretary to prohibit the planting of any crop specified in      paragraph (1) on acreage on the farm subject to the market      transition contract.       Amended section 102(k), in paragraph (3), directs the      Secretary to make a determination each crop year of the      commodities that may not be planted pursuant to this      subsection and make available a list of such commodities.       Amended section 102(k), in paragraph (4), provides that, in      lieu of planting crops, owners and operators may devote all      or part of the eligible farmland subject to a contract to      conserving uses in accordance with regulations issued by the      Secretary.       Amended section 102(k), in paragraph (5), allows for haying      and grazing of eligible farmland subject to a contract,      except that haying and grazing is not permitted during the 5-     month period designated by the State Committee established      under section 8(b) of the Soil Conservation and Domestic      Allotment Act between April 1 and October 31st of each year.      The Secretary may permit unlimited haying and grazing on      eligible farmland in cases of a natural disaster, and may not      exclude irrigated or irrigable acreage not planted in alfalfa      when exercising such natural disaster authority.       Amended section 102(l) provides that market transition      contracts are legally binding.       Amended section 102(m) directs the Secretary to carry out      this section through the Commodity Credit Corporation, except      that no funds of the Corporation shall be used for any salary      or expense of any officer or employee of the Department of      Agriculture in connection with the administration of market      transition payments or loans under this subtitle.       Amended section 102(n) authorizes the Secretary to issue      such regulations as are necessary to implement this section.       Subsection (b). Conforming amendments       Subsection (b) amends sections 107B(c)(1)(E),      105B(c)(1)(E), 103B, 101B(c), and 205(c) of the Agricultural      Act of 1949 so that such sections are applicable only through      the 1995 crop year (with respect to certain payments etc.),      and section 509 of such Act only until January 1, 1996.     Section 1103.--Availability of nonrecourse marketing          assistance loans for wheat, feed grains, cotton, rice,          and oilseeds       Subsection (a). Nonrecourse loans available       Section 1103(a) amends the Agricultural Act of 1949 by      inserting after section 102 a new section 102A which      establishes a nonrecourse marketing assistance loan for      certain crops.       New section 102A(a), in paragraph (1), directs the      Secretary to make nonrecourse marketing assistance loans      available to eligible producers of wheat, feed grains, upland      cotton, extra long staple cotton, rice, and oilseeds for each      of the 1996 through 2002 crops of such commodities under      terms and conditions prescribed by the Secretary at a loan      rate calculated under 102A(c). Such loans shall have a term      of nine months, and may not be extended by the Secretary.       New section 102A(b) directs the Secretary to announce the      loan rate for each commodity not later than the start of the      marketing year for such commodity.       New section 102A(c), in paragraph (1), establishes the loan      rate for each commodity at 70 percent of the simple average      price received by producers during the marketing years for      the immediately preceding five crops (a rolling average).       New section 102A(c), in paragraph (2), directs the      Secretary to reduce the loan rate of a commodity for a      marketing year if the Secretary estimates that the market      price for a commodity is likely to be less than loan rate      calculated under paragraph (1).       New section 102A(c), in paragraph (3), instructs the      Secretary to determine the five-year simple average price      received by producers, excluding the highest and lowest      years.       New section 102A(d) provides that, if the Secretary      determines that the market price of a commodity falls below      the lower of: (1) the loan rate; or (2) the adjusted loan      rate set under paragraph (2), the Secretary shall allow such      loan to be repaid at such market price. This subsection does      not apply to marketing assistance loans for extra long staple      cotton, rye or oilseeds.       New section 102A(e) authorizes the Secretary to make such      adjustments in the announced loan rate for a commodity as the      Secretary determines appropriate to reflect differences in      grade, type, quality, location, and other factors.       New section 102A(f), in paragraph (1), provides that, in      the case of a marketing assistance loan for a crop of wheat,      feed grains (except rye), upland cotton, or rice, only a      producer whose land on which the crop is raised is subject to      a market transition contact shall be eligible for a marketing      assistance loan.       New section 102A(f), in paragraph (2), provides that, in      the case of a marketing assistance loan for a crop of extra      long staple cotton, rye or oilseeds, any producer shall be      eligible for a marketing assistance loan except as provided      in subsection (d).       New section 102A(g) provides that the Secretary may not      make payments to producers to cover storage charges incurred      in connection with marketing assistance loans.       New section 102A(h), in paragraph (1), defines `feed      grains' to mean corn, grain sorghums, barley, oats, and rye;      and in paragraph (2), defines `oilseeds' to mean soybeans,      sunflower seed, rapeseed, canola, safflower, flaxseed,      mustard seed, and, if designated by the Secretary, other      oilseeds.       New section 102A(i) authorizes the Secretary to issue such      regulations as are necessary to carry out this section.       Subsection (b). Repeal of current adjustment authority       Subsection (b) repeals section 403 of the Agricultural Act      of 1949, relating to loan rate adjustment authority.     Section 1104.--Reform of payment limitation provisions of          Food Security Act of 1985       Subsection (a). Attribution of payments made to            corporations and other entities       Subsection (a) amends paragraph (5)(C) of section 1001 of      the Food Security Act of 1985 relating to payments made to      corporations and other entities.       Amended section 1001(5)(C), in clause (i), directs the      Secretary, in the case of payments to corporations and other      entities described in section 1001(B)(i)(II), to attribute      payments to individuals in proportion to their ownership      interests in the corporation or entity receiving the payment,      or in any other corporation or entity that has a substantial      beneficial interest in the corporation or entity actually      receiving the payment. The provisions of this subparagraph      shall apply to individuals who hold or acquire, directly      or through another corporation or entity, a substantial      beneficial interest in the corporation or entity actually      receiving the payment.       Amended section 1001(5)(C), in clause (ii), directs the      Secretary, in the case of payments to corporations and other      entities described in section 1001(B)(i)(II), to also      attribute payments to any State (or political subdivision or      agency thereof) or other corporation or entity that has a      substantial beneficial interest in the corporation or entity      actually receiving the payment in proportion to their      ownership interests in the corporation or entity receiving      the payment. The provisions of this subparagraph shall apply      even if the payments are also attributable to individuals      under clause (i).       Amended section 1001(5)(C), in clause (iii), provides that      for purposes of subparagraph (C), `substantial beneficial      interest' means not less than five percent of all beneficial      interests in the corporation or entity actually receiving the      payment, except that the Secretary may set a lower percentage      in order to ensure that the provisions of this section and      the scheme or device provisions in section 1001B are not      circumvented.       Subsection (b). Tracking of payments       Subsection (b) amends paragraph (3) of section 1001(A(a) to      provide that each entity or individual receiving payments as      a separate person shall notify each individual or other      entity that acquires or holds a substantial beneficial      interest in it of the requirements and limitations of section      1001(A)(a). Each such entity or individual receiving payments      shall provide to the Secretary, at such times and in such      manner as prescribed by the Secretary, the name and social      security number of each individual, or the name and taxpayer      identification number of each entity, that holds or acquires      a substantial beneficial interest.       Subsection (c). Conforming amendment       Subsection (c) amends paragraph (2) of section 1001(A)(a)      to provide that, for purposes of subsection 1001A(a),      `substantial beneficial interest' has the meaning given such      term in amended section 1001(5)(C)(iii).     Section 1105.--Suspension of certain provisions regarding          program crops       Section 1105 suspends provisions of permanent law relating      to commodity programs for the 1996 through 2002 crop years.       Subsection (a). Wheat       Subsection (a) suspends: (1) sections 331 through 339,      379b, 379c (relating to wheat crops for 1996 through 2002);      (2) sections 379d through 379j of the Agricultural Adjustment      Act of 1938 (applicable to wheat processors or exporters from      June 1, 1996 through May 31, 2003); (3) the joint resolution      entitled ``a joint resolution relating to corn and wheat      marketing quotas under the Agricultural Adjustment Act of      1938, as amended'' (applicable to the 1996 through 2002 crops      of wheat); and (4) section 107 of the Agricultural Act of      1949 with respect to the wheat crops of 1996 through 2002.       Subsection (b). Feed grains       Subsection (b) suspends 105 of the Agricultural Act of 1949      with respect to the 1996 through 2002 crops of feed grains.       Subsection (c). Cotton       Subsection (c) suspends sections 342, 343, 344, 345, 346,      and 377 of the Agricultural Adjustment Act of 1938 and      section 103(a) of the Agricultural Act of 1949 with respect      to the 1996 through 2002 crops of upland cotton.               subtitle b--milk and the products of milkChapter 1--Authorization of Market Transition Payments in Lieu of Milk                          Price Support Program     Section 1201.--Seven year market transition contracts for          milk producers       Section 1201 amends the Agricultural Act of 1949 by      replacing section 204, and conforming sections 201(a) and 301      accordingly.       Subsection (a). Contracts authorized       Subsection (a) replaces existing section 204 of the      Agricultural Act of 1949 with the following new provisions.       New section 204(a) authorizes the Secretary to enter into      market transition contracts with milk producers in which a      producer would agree to continue compliance with any      government animal waste regulations and any wetlands      protection requirements applicable to the producer's      operation in exchange for seven market transition payments. A      milk producer is defined as any person that was engaged in      the production of milk on September 15, 1995, and that had      received a payment during the 45-day period prior to that      date for cows' milk marketed for commercial use.       New section 204(b) requires that contracts be entered not      later than April 15, 1996, and that they shall extend through      December 31, 2001.       New section 204(c) requires the Secretary to provide an      estimate of payments anticipated under the market transition      contract at the time the contract is entered.       New section 204(d) provides that the first payment under a      market transition contract be made on April 15, 1996, or as      soon thereafter as practicable. Subsequent payments would      occur on October 15 of fiscal years 1997 through 2002.       New section 204(e) establishes the following payment      schedule and payment rates: April 15, 1996 (10 cents/cwt);      October 15, 1996 (15 cents/cwt); October 15, 1997 (13 cents/     cwt); October 15, 1998 (11 cents/cwt); October 15, 1999 (9      cents/cwt); October 15, 2000 (7 cents/cwt); and October 15,      2001 (5 cents/cwt).       New section 204(f) requires the Secretary to determine the      historic annual milk production, expressed in hundredweights      (cwt) of milk, for each milk producer on the basis of the      producer's milk checks or other records of commercial      marketings of milk acceptable to the Secretary. If a producer      has produced milk for at least three calendar years, the      producer's historic annual milk production will be the      average hundredweight of milk marketed during the three      highest production years from 1991-1995. If a producer has      produced milk for less than three calendar years, the      producer's historic annual milk production will be the      annualized average of the monthly quantity of milk marketed      by the producer during the period in which the producer has      produced milk.       New section 204(g) provides that a producer's payment in      any fiscal year will be equal to the payment rate in effect      for that fiscal year times the producer's historic annual      milk production.       New section 204(h) provides that market transition      contracts with milk producers are freely assignable, but that      the Secretary may require notice of any assignment of a      contract.       New section 204(i) permits the Secretary to terminate or      adjust the market transition contract of a milk producer if      the producer fails to comply with animal waste regulations or      wetlands protection requirements. The Secretary is required      to make a determination regarding violations of animal waste      management regulations in consultation with appropriate State      governmental authorities. If the Secretary determines that a      termination is appropriate, the producer forfeits all rights      to future payments and is further required to refund any      payment received after the producer was notified of the      violation. If the Secretary determines that the violation      does not warrant termination, the Secretary may require the      producer to refund any payment received after the producer      was notified of the violation and may make adjustments in the      amount of future payments otherwise required under the      contract.       New section 204(j) provides that market transition      contracts are legally binding.       Subsection (b). Continued operation of existing program            through 1995       Subsection (b) provides that the dairy price support      program under existing section 204 of the Agricultural Act of      1949 continues in operation through December 31, 1995 at      which time it is terminated. Producers that are entitled to a      refund of their 1995 budget reconciliation assessment (i.e.,      their marketings of milk in calendar year 1995 did not exceed      their markings of milk in calendar year 1994) will receive      those refunds from CCC funds rather than from assessments on      producers in 1996.       Subsection (c). Conforming repeal of general authority to            provide price support for milk       Subsection (c) conforms sections 201(a) and 301 of the      Agricultural Act of 1949 to eliminate milk from the      designated and undesignated nonbasic agriculture commodities      for which the Secretary has general authority to provide      price support.     Section 1202.--Recourse loans for commercial processors or          dairy products       Section 1201 amends the Agricultural Act of 1949 by      replacing section 424 with the following.       New section 424(a) authorizes the Secretary to make      recourse loans available to commercial processors of cheddar      cheese,      butter and nonfat dry milk dairy products to assist those processors in      assuring price stability for the dairy industry.       New section 424(b) provides that loans are to be made      available at 90% of the reference for a product and at      established CCC interest rates.       New section 424(c) provides that loans may not extend      beyond the end of the fiscal year in which they are made,      except that the Secretary may extend a loan for an additional      period not to exceed the next fiscal year.       New section 424(d) defines the reference price for cheddar      cheese as the average price for 40 pound blocks of cheddar      cheese on the National Cheese Exchange for previous three      months, for butter as the average price for butter on the      Chicago Mercantile Exchange for butter for the previous three      months, and for nonfat dry milk as the Western States      price for nonfat dry milk for the previous three months.                    Chapter 2--Dairy Export Programs     Section 1211.--Dairy Export Incentive Program       Section 1211 amends section 153(c) of the Food Security Act      of 1985 to make the following revisions in the Dairy Export      Incentive Program (DEIP).       Subsection (a). In general       Subsection (a) requires the Secretary to use the DEIP      program to export the maximum allowable quantities of U.S.      dairy products consistent with the obligations of the United      States as a member of the World Trade Organization, minus the      quantity sold under section 1163 of the Food Security Act of      1985 during that year, except to the extent that such volume      would exceed the limitations on value set forth in subsection      (f).       Subsection (b). Sole discretion       Subsection (b) establishes that the Secretary of      Agriculture exercises sole discretion over the DEIP program.       Subsection (c). Market development       Subsection (c) authorizes the Secretary to include an      amount for the development of world markets for U.S. dairy      products in the payment rate for DEIP.       Subsection (d). Maximum allowance amounts       Subsection (d) limits the Secretary's use of money and      commodities for the DEIP program in any year to the maximum      amount consistent with the obligations of the United States      as a member of the World Trade Organization minus the amount      expended under section 1163 of the Food Security Act of 1985      during that year.       Subsection (e). Conforming amendment       Subsection (e) extends the operations of the DEIP program      through the year 2002.     Section 1212.--Authority to assist in establishment and          maintenance of export trading company       Section 1212 authorizes the Secretary of Agriculture to      assist the United States dairy industry in establishing and      maintaining an export trading company under the Export      Trading Company Act of 1982 to facilitate the international      market development for an exportation of U.S. dairy products.

Subsection (e). Records       Subsection (e) amends section 113(k) to require importers      to maintain such records and make such reports as the      Secretary determines are appropriate to the administration or      enforcement of the promotion program.

Section 1224.--Issuance of amended order under Dairy          Production Stabilization Act of 1983       Section 1224 establishes the following procedure to      implement the amendments required by sections 1222 and 1223      to the dairy products promotion and research order issued      under the Dairy Production Stabilization Act of 1983.

Chapter 4--Verification of Milk Receipts     Section 1231.--Program to verify milk receipts       Section 1231 creates a new subsection (l) in section 204 of      the Agricultural Act of 1949 to establish a program to verify      receipts of milk and audit marketing agreements and other      contracts for the marketing and receipt of milk between      producers and handlers.       Subsection (a). Establishment of verification program       Subsection (a) provides that, under new section 204(l)(1),      the Secretary shall establish a program through which the      verification of receipts of all cow's milk marketed      commercially in the contiguous 48 States and the auditing of      marketing agreements with respect to receipts of such milk      can be accomplished. The Secretary shall prescribe      regulations to implement the verification program.       New section 204(l)(2) requires the program to provide a      means by which: (1) processors, associations of producers and      other engaged in the handling of milk and milk products file      reports with the Secretary regarding receipts of milk,      prices paid for milk, and the purposes for which milk was      used by handlers, (2) authorized deductions from payments      to producers, including assessments for research and      promotion programs, are collected, (3) assurance of      payment by handlers for milk is achieved, and (4) the      reports, records, and facilities of handlers are reviewed      and verified. The Secretary shall publish statistics      regarding receipts, prices and uses of milk. Statistics      published by the Secretary are to include information on      payments received by producers for milk on a component      basis. The expenses associated with the collection and      publication of such statistics are to be paid by handlers.      Such assessments shall not exceed the total expenses of      the Secretary.       New section 204(l)(3) directs that the program shall      further provide a means by which the weighing, sampling, and      testing of milk purchased from producers is accomplished and      verified. Cooperative Marketing Associations may continue to      provide such services for their members. The cost of      providing such marketing services shall be paid by producers.      Such assessments shall not exceed the total cost of the      services.       New section 204(l)(4) authorizes producer and associations      of producers to negotiate and enter into marketing agreements      or other private contracts with handlers for the marketing or      receipt of milk. Upon request, the Secretary may audit an      agreement or contract to assure compliance with its terms.      The Secretary is to be reimbursed for any costs associated      with an audit.       New section 204(l)(5) provides that no marketing agreement      or government regulations applicable to milk or its products      in any marketing area or jurisdiction shall prohibit or in      any manner limit the marketing in that area of any milk or      product of milk produced in any production area in the United      States.       New section 204(l)(6) mandates that, effective July 1,      1996, the verification program shall supersede any Federal      milk marketing order issued under section 8c of the      Agricultural Adjustment Act, reenacted with amendments by the      Agricultural Marketing Agreement Act of 1937 with respect to      milk or the products of milk.       Subsection (b). Time for issuance       Subsection (b) requires the Secretary to issue final      regulations implementing the verification program not later      than July 1, 1996.       Subsection (c). Process       Subsection (c) provides that the Secretary shall issue      proposed regulations not later than April 1, 1996, and shall      provide for a comment period on the proposed regulations not      to exceed 60 days nor extend past May 31, 1996.     Section 1232.--Verification program to supersede multiple          existing Federal orders       Section 1232 provides that the verification program      established by section 1231 will supersede existing Federal      milk marketing orders by making the following amendments to      the Agricultural Adjustment Act, reenacted with amendments by      the Agricultural Marketing Agreement Act of 1937.       Subsection (a). Termination of milk marketing orders       Subsection (a) terminates existing Federal milk marketing      orders by striking paragraphs (5) and (18) of section 8c.       Subsection (b). Prohibition on subsequent orders regarding            milk       Subsection (b) conforms paragraph (2) of section 8c to      remove milk from the list of commodities for which the      Secretary has general authority to issue marketing orders.       Subsection (c). Conforming amendments       Subsection (c) makes conforming amendments to section 2(3),      8c(6), 8c(7)(B), 8c(11)(B), 8c(13)(A), 8c(17), 8d(2),      10(b)(2), and 11.       Subsection (d). Effective date       Subsection (d) provides that the amendments made by section      1232 are effective on July 1, 1996.

Subsection (a). Extension of price support program       Subsection (a) amends subsections (a)(1), (b)(1), (g)(1),      (g)(2)(A), and (h) of section 108B of the Agricultural Act of      1949 by extending such price support, marketing assessment,      and reporting provisions for quota and additional peanuts      through the 2002 crops of peanuts.       Subsection (b). Changes to price support program       This subsection amends section 108B of the Agricultural Act      of 1949 by making changes in the price support provisions of      such section.       Amended section 108B(a), in paragraph (2), establishes a      national average quota support rate for the 1996 through 2002      crops of quota peanuts at $610 per ton. Section 1301(b)(1)(B)      provides that such amendment does not affect the loan rate in      effect for the 1995 crop of quota peanuts.       Amended section 108B(a), in new paragraph (4), provides      that the Secretary shall reduce the support rate by 15      percent for any producer on a farm who had available to the      producer an offer from a handler to purchase quota peanuts      from the farm at a price equal to or greater than the      applicable quota support rate (and redesignates existing      paragraphs (4) and (5) as paragraphs (5) and (6).       Amended subsection 108B(d)(2) provides that losses in quota      area pools shall be covered using the following sources in      the following order of priority:       (A) the proceeds due any producer from any pool shall be      reduced by the amount of losses incurred on transfers of      peanuts from an additional loan pool to a quota loan pool by      such producer under section 358-1(b)(8) of the Agricultural      Adjustment Act of 1938;       (B) further losses in a quota pool shall be offset by      reducing the gain of any producer in such pool by the amount      of pool gains to the same producer from the sale of      additional peanuts for domestic and export edible use;       (C) the Secretary shall use marketing assessment funds      collected from growers under subsection (g) (except funds      attributable to handlers) to offset further losses in area      quota pools (any such unused assessment funds shall be      transferred to the Treasury);       (D) further losses in area quota pools, other than losses      incurred as a result of transfers from additional loan pools      to quota loan pools under section 358-1(b)(8), shall be      offset by any gains or profits from quota pools in other      production areas (not including separate type pools      established for Valencia peanuts produced in New Mexico) as      the Secretary provides by regulation; and (E) any further      losses in an area quota pool (not covered by subparagraphs A,      B, C and) shall be covered by an increase in the marketing      assessment imposed by the Secretary, but such increase in an assessment      shall only apply to quota peanuts in such pool.       Subsection (c). Extension of national poundage quota       Subsection (c) amends subsections (a)(3), (b)(1)(A),      (b)(1)(B), (b)(2)(A) and (C), (b)(3)(A), and (f) of section      358-1, subsection (c) of section 358b, subsection (d) of      section 358c, and subsection (i) of section 358e of part VI      of subtitle B of title III of the Agricultural Adjustment Act      of 1938 by extending such subsections through the 2002      marketing year.       Subsection (d). Prioritized quota reductions       Subsection (d) amends section 358-1(b)(2)(C) of the      Agricultural Adjustment Act of 1938 Act to provide a priority      method for allocating decreases in poundage quota.       Amended section 358-1(b(2)(C) provides that if the poundage      quota apportioned to a State under section 358-1(a)(3) is      decreased, rather than apply the decrease to all farms in the      State, such decrease shall be first be allocated among farms      in the following order:       (i) farms owned or controlled by municipalities, airport      authorities, schools, colleges, refuges, and other public      entities.       (ii) farms for which the quota holder is not a producer and      resides in another State.       (iii) farms for which the quota-holder, although a resident      of the State, is not a producer.       (iv) other farms described in the first sentence of this      subparagraph.       Subsection (e). Elimination of quota floor       Subsection (e) amends section 358-1(a)(1) of the      Agricultural Adjustment Act of 1938 by eliminating the      1,350,000 ton minimum national poundage quota.       Subsection (f). Spring and fall transfers within a State       Subsection (f) amends section 358b(a)(1) of the      Agricultural Adjustment Act of 1938 relating to farm poundage      quota transfer.       Amended section 358b(a), in paragraph (1), allows farm      poundage quota to be sold or leased, either before or after      the normal planting season, to any other owner or operator of      a farm in the same State. Current provisions requiring 90      percent of a farm's basic quota to be planted or considered      planted before a fall (or after the normal planting season)      transfer is allowed are maintained.       Subsection (g). Transfers in counties with small quota       Subsection (g) amends section 358b(a) of the Agricultural      Adjustment Act of 1938 by adding a new paragraph (4) which      authorizes the sale, lease or other transfer of farm poundage      quota at any time to any other farm within a State if the      county in which the transferring farm is located was less      than 10,000 tons of national poundage quota for the preceding      year's crop. Current authority regarding quota transfers to      other self-owned farms in paragraph 2 and transfers in States      with less than 10,000 tons of quota in paragraph (3) is      maintained.       Subsection (h). Undermarketings       Subsection (h) amends section 358-1(b) of the Agricultural      Adjustment Act of 1938 by deleting paragraphs (8) and (9)      relating to increases in farm poundage quota based on      undermarketings in previous marketing years (and adds      conforming amendments).       Subsection (i). Limitation of payments for disaster            transfer       Section (i) amends section 358-1(b) of the Agricultural      Adjustment Act of 1938 by adding a new paragraph (8) relating      to disaster transfer authority.       Amended section 358-1(b), in a new paragraph (8), provides      that additional peanuts on a farm from which the quota      poundage was not harvested and marketed because of drought,      flood, or any other natural disaster, may be transferred to      the quota loan pool, under certain conditions, except that      such peanuts shall be supported at a total of not more than      70 percent of the quota support rate, for the marketing years      in which such transfers occur, and such transfers shall not      exceed 25 percent of the total farm quota pounds, including      pounds transferred in the fall.       Subsection (j). Temporary quota allocation       Subjection (j) amends section 358-1(b)(2) of the      Agricultural Adjustment Act of 1938 by deleting the current      subparagraph (B) relating to allocation of increased quota in      Texas and inserting a new subparagraph (B) authorizing      temporary increases in quota based on seed use.       Amended section 358-1(b)(2), in subparagraph (B), provides      that, for the 1996 through 2002 marketing years, a temporary      quota allocation for the marketing year only in which the      crop is planted, equal to the number of pounds of seed      peanuts planted for the farm that shall be made to the      producers for the 1996 through 2002 marketing years, in      addition to the normal farm poundage quota established      under section 358-1. Subparagraph (B) also provides that      there is no change in the requirement regarding the use of      quota and additional peanuts established by section      359a(b) of the Agriculture Adjustment Act of 1938. A      conforming amendment deletes the word ``seed'' from      subsection (a)(1) relating to the establishment of      national poundage quotas.       Subsection (k). Suspension of marketing quotas and acreage            allotments       Subsection (k) suspends subsections (a) through (j) of      section 358, subsections (a) through (h) of section 358a,      subsections (a), (b), (d) and (e) of section 358d, part I of      subtitle C of title III, and section 371 of the Agricultural      Adjustment Act of 1938 relating to the suspension of      marketing quotas and acreage allotments for the 1996 through      2002 crops of peanuts.       Subsection (l). Extension of reporting and recordkeeping            requirements       Subsection (l) amends section 373(a) of the Agricultural      Adjustment Act of 1938 by extending the recordkeeping      requirements of such section to the 1996 through 2002 crops      of peanuts.       Subsection (m). Suspension of certain price support            provisions       Subsection (m) suspends section 101 of the Agricultural Act      of 1949 related the authority of the Secretary to provide      price supports for any crop at a level not in excess of 90      per centum of the parity price of the commodity for the 1996      through 2002 crops of peanuts.     Section 1302.--Availability of loans for processor of sugar          cane and sugar beets       Subsection (a). Sugar loans       Subsection (a) amends section 206 of the 1949 Act to      provide loans for the 1996 through 2002 crops of domestically      grown sugarcane and sugar beets.       Amended subsection 206(a) sets the loan rate for raw cane      produced from domestically grown sugarcane crops, subject to      the authority of the Secretary to reduce loans as provided in      subsection (c), at the 1995 level.       Amended subsection 206(b) sets the loan rate for refined      beet sugar produced from domestically grown sugar beet crops,      subject to the authority of the Secretary to reduce loans as      provided in subsection (c), at the 1995 level.       Amended subsection 206(c)(1) requires the Secretary to      reduce the loan rate specified in subsections (a) and (b) if      the Secretary determines that negotiated reductions in export      subsidies provided for sugar of the European Union and other      major sugar exporting countries in the aggregate exceed the      commitments made as part of the Agreement on Agriculture.      Amended subsection 206(c) also provides that the Secretary      shall not reduce the loan rate under subsections (a) and (b)      below a rate that provides domestic sugar a competitive      measure of support to that provided by the European Union and      other sugar exporting countries based on the provisions of      Agreement on Agriculture, section 101(d)(2) of the Uruguay      Round Agreements Act.       Amended subsection 206(d) provides for the Secretary to      carry out the section through the use of recourse loans for      sugar. However, it also provides that during any fiscal year      in which the tariff rate quota (TRQ) for imports of sugar      into the U.S. is set, or increased to, a level that exceeds      the loan modification threshold, the Secretary is directed      to carry out this section by making nonrecourse loans      (previously made recourse loans are to be modified by the      Secretary into nonrecourse loans). The ``loan modification      threshold'', for sugar for purposes of the subsection,      means 1,257,000 short tons raw value for fiscal years 1996      and 1997, and for subsequent fiscal years, 103 percent of      the loan modifications threshold for the previous fiscal      year. If the Secretary is required to make nonrecourse      loans (or modify recourse loans) under this subsection      during a fiscal year, the Secretary is to obtain from      processors adequate assurances that such processors will      provide appropriate minimum payments to producers as set      by the Secretary. Not later than September 1, of each      fiscal year, the Secretary shall announce the loan      modification threshold that shall apply for the subsequent      fiscal year.       Amended 206(e) provides that for three month loans, which      can be extended for additional three-month periods, except      that a loan may not be extended beyond nine months nor      extended beyond the end of the fiscal year (September 30).      Processors may terminate a loan and redeem the collateral at      any time by paying all principal, interest, and any      applicable fees.       Amended subsection 206(f) directs the Secretary to use the      funds, facilities, and authorities of the Commodity Credit      Corporation in carrying out this section.       Amended subsection 206(g) requires first processors of raw      cane sugar to CCC nonrefundable marketing assessment for each      pound of raw cane sugar equal to 1.5 percent of the loan      rate, while first processors of sugar beets are to remit to      CCC a marketing assessment of 1.6083 percent of the loan rate      for raw cane sugar, during fiscal year 1996 through 2003 on      all marketings. Assessments are to be collected on a monthly      basis, except that any inventory which has not been marketed      by September 30 of a fiscal year shall be assessed at that      point, except that the latter sugar shall not be assessed      later when it is marketed. any person who fails to remit the      assessment is liable for a penalty based on the quantity of      the sugar involved in the violation times the applicable loan      rate at the time of violation. ``Market'' is defined in      paragraph (6) to mean to sell or otherwise dispose of in      commerce (including the movement of raw cane sugar into the      refining process in the case of integrated processor and      refiner) and deliver to a buyer.       Amended subsection 206(h) requires processors and refiners      must report such information to the Secretary as is required      in order to administer the program. A penalty applies for      failure to report and the Secretary is required to make      monthly reports on pertinent sugar production, etc. data.       Amended subsection 206(i) requires the Secretary to      estimate, each year on a quarterly basis, the domestic demand      for sugar which shall be equal to domestic consumption, plus      adequate carryover stocks, minus carry-in-stocks. Quarterly      reestimates are to be made by the Secretary at the beginning      of each of the second through fourth quarters.       Amended subsection 206(j) authorizes the Secretary to issue      such regulations as are necessary to implement this section.       Subsection (b). Effect on existing loans for sugar       Subsection (b) provides that the amendments made to section      206 of the Agricultural Act of 1949 by subsection (a), above,      shall not affect loans made before the date of enactment of      this Act for the 1991 through 1995 crops of sugarcane and      sugar beets.       Subsection (c). Termination of marketing quotas and            allotments       Subsection (c) repeals Part VII of subtitle B of title III      of the Agricultural Adjustment Act of 1938 (7 U.S.C. 1359aa-     1359jj) relating to marketing quotas and allotments.     Section 1303.--Repeal of obsolete authority for price support          for cottonseed and cottonseed products       Section 301(b) of the Disaster Assistance Act of 1988 is      amended by striking paragraph (1) and section 420 of the      Agriculture Act of 1949 is repealed.               subtitle d--miscellaneous program changes     Section 1401.--Limitation on assistance under Emergency          Livestock Feed Assistance Program       This section amends section 609 of the Emergency Livestock      Feed Assistance Act of 1988 by striking subsections (c) and      (d) and inserting a new subsection (c) to provide that no      person may receive benefits attributable to lost product of a      fee commodity if catastrophic insurance protection or      noninsured crop disaster assistance is available to the      person under the Federal Crop Insurance Act.     Section 1402.--Conservation Reserve Program       Subsection (a). Limitations on acreage enrollments       Subsection (a) in paragraph (1) amends section 1231(d) of      the Food Security Act of 1985 to limit the total number of      acres authorized to be enrolled in the Conservation Reserve      Program to 36,400,000 acres, and paragraph (2) amends section      727 if the Agriculture, Rural Development, Food and Drug      Administration, and Related Agencies Appropriations Act, 1996      by striking the priviso relating to the enrollment of new      acres beginning in calendar year 1997.       Subsection (b). Optional contract termination by producers       Subsection (b) amends section 1235 of the Food Security Act      of 1985 by adding a new subsection (e).       New subsection (e), in paragraph (1), provides that an      owner or operator of land enrolled under a conservation      reserve contract may terminate the contract upon written      notice to the Secretary.       New subsection (e), in paragraph (2), provides that the      cancellation shall become effective 60 days after the owner      or operator submits written notice under paragraph (1).       New subsection (e), in paragraph (3), provides that when a      contract is terminated before the end of a fiscal year, the      annual payment shall be prorated accordingly.       New subsection (e), in paragraph (4), provides that a      contract termination under this section does not affect the      future eligibility of an owner or operator to submit a      subsequent bid to enroll in the conservation reserve program.       New subsection (e), in paragraph (5), provides that, if      land is returned to production of an agricultural commodity      upon termination of a contract under this section, the      Secretary cannot impose conservation requirements on such      lands which are more onerous than the requirements imposed on      other lands.       Subsection (c) Limitation on rental rates       Subsection (c) amends section 1234(c) of the Food Security      Act of 1985 by adding a new paragraph (5), which limits      rental rates for contracts that are extended, or new      contracts covering land that was previously enrolled in the      conservation reserve program, not to exceed 75 percent of the      annual rental payment under the previous contract.     Section 1403--Crop insurance       Subsection (a). Conversion of catastrophic risk protection            program to voluntary program       Subsection (a) amends section 508(b)(7) of the Federal Crop      Insurance Act by redesignating current subparagraph (B) as      (C) and inserting a new subparagraph (B) that provides that      catastrophic risk protection may be declined, beginning with      the spring-planted 1996 crops and in any subsequent crop      years, and remain eligible for a market transition contract      or marketing assistance loan, the conservation reserve      program or any benefit described in section 371 of the      Consolidated Farm and Rural Development Act as long as the      producer agrees in writing to waive any eligibility for      emergency crop loss assistance with respect to losses for      which the producer declines to obtain catastrophic risk      protection.       Subsection (b). Delivery of voluntary catastrophic            protection       Subsection (b) amends section 508(b)(4) of the Federal Crop      Insurance Act by inserting new subparagraphs (C) and (D).       Amended section 508(b)(4), in new subparagraph (C),      provides that, if mandatory participation is not required,      the Secretary will no longer have the option of delivering      catastrophic risk protection coverage for agricultural crops      and all such risk protection policies written by the      Department prior to that date will be transferred, along with      all fees collected, to the private sector for all service and      loss adjustment functions.       Amended section 508(b)(4), in new subparagraph (D),      provides that the Federal Crop Insurance Corporation (FCIC)      must consult with approved insurance providers in developing      a plan to ensure that each producer of an insured crop has      the option to be served by an approved insurance provider if      insurance is available for that crop in the county, and the      FCIC shall report to the Committee on Agriculture of the      House of Representatives and the Committee on Agriculture,      Nutrition, and Forestry of the Senate by May 1, 1996,      regarding the implementation of such plan.       Subsection (c). Establishment of the Office of Risk            Management       Subsection (c) amends the Department of Agriculture      Reorganization Act of 1994 by inserting after section 226 a      new section 226A.       New section 226A(a) directs the Secretary to establish and      maintain an independent Office of Risk Assessment within the      Department.       New section 226A(b) provides that such office shall have      jurisdiction over:       (1) the supervision of FCIC.       (2) administration and oversight of all aspects of all      programs authorized by the Federal Crop Insurance Act;       (3) any pilot or other programs involving revenue      insurance, risk management, savings accounts, or the use of      the futures market to manage risk and support farm income      that may be established under the FCIC Act or other law; and       (4) such other functions as the Secretary considers      appropriate.       New section 226A(c) provides that the Office shall be      headed by an Administrator who shall be appointed by the      Secretary, and that the Administrator shall also serve as the      Manager of FCIC.       New section 226A(d), in paragraph (1), authorizes the      consolidation of the human resources, public affairs, and      legislative affairs functions of the Office of Risk      Management under the Under Secretary of Agriculture for Farm      and Foreign Agricultural Services.       New section 226A(d), in paragraph (2), directs the      Secretary to provide human and capital resources to the      Office of Risk Management sufficient to enable the Office to      carry out its functions in a timely and efficient manner.       New section 226A(d), in paragraph (3), provides that not      less than $88,500,000 of the fiscal year 1996 appropriation      provided for the salaries and expenses of the Consolidated      Farm Services Agency shall be provided to the Office of Risk      Management for its salaries and expenses.       Subsection (d), Reconfiguration of board of directors       Subsection (d) amends section 505 of the Federal Crop      Insurance Act by making changes in the composition and      functions of the FCIC Board of Directors.

Amended section 505(b)(1) provides that the Board shall      consist of the manager of FCIC, the Under Secretary of      Agriculture for Farm and Foreign Agricultural Services, one      person who is an officer or employee of an approved insurance      provider, one person who is a licensed crop insurance agent,      and one person who is experienced in the reinsurance business      not otherwise employed by the Federal Government, and four      active producers who are not otherwise employed by the      Federal Government. The Secretary shall not serve as a member      of the Board.       Amended section 505(b)(2) provides that in appointing the 4      active producers the Secretary shall ensure that 3 such      members are policyholders from different geographic areas of      the U.S. with diverse agricultural interests. The fourth      active producer may also be a policyholder and shall be a      person who receives a significant portion of crop income from      crops covered by the noninsurance crop disaster assistance      program established in section 519 of the Federal Crop      Insurance Act.       Amended section 505(c) provides for the appointment, terms,      and succession of members of the Board. The Administrator of      the Office of Risk Management shall serve as the Manager of      the FCIC. Terms of office shall be for 3 years except for the      first term which will provide for different expiring terms. A      member may serve after expiration of his or her term until a      successor is appointed.       Amended section 505(d) provides that five of the Board      members in office shall constitute a quorum for the      transaction of business.       Amended section 505(e) provides that the powers of the      Board to execute the functions of FCIC shall be impaired at      any time there are not six members of the Board in office,      which shall also serve to impair the powers of the Manager to      act under any delegation of power provided in subsection (g).       Amended section 505(f)(1) provides that members of the      Board who are employees of USDA shall not be further compensated, but may be allowed travel      and subsistence expenses outside of Washington, D.C.       Amended section 505(f)(2) provides that members of the      Board who are not Federal Government employees shall be      compensated as the Secretary determines, except that such      compensation shall not exceed a level V of the Executive      Schedule under section 5316 of title 5, United States Code.      Actual necessary traveling and subsistence expenses are also      authorized and are to be paid out of the insurance fund      established in section 516(c).       Amended section 505(g) provides that the Manager of FCIC      shall also be its chief executive officer, with such power as      the Board may confer.     Section 1404.--Repeal of the Farmer Owned Reserve Program       Subsection (a). Repeal       Subsection (a) of this section repeals the Farmer Owned      Reserve Program authorized by section 110 of the Agricultural      Act of 1949.       Subsection (b). Effect of repeal on existing loans       Subsection (b) clarifies that the repeal of the Farmer      Owned Reserve Program under this section does not affect the      validity or terms and conditions of any extended price      support loan provided under such program before the date of      enactment of this Act.     Section 1405.--Reduction in funding levels for export          enhancement program       Section 301(e)(1) of the Agricultural Trade Act of 1978 is      amended so as to limit the amount of the CCC funds or      commodities available for the Export Enhancement Program as      follows: $400,000,000 for fiscal years 1996 and 1997;      $500,000,000 for fiscal year 1998; $550,000,000 for fiscal      year 1999, $579,000,000 for fiscal year 2000; and      $478,000,000 for fiscal years 2001 and 2002 (not more than      $500,000 was provided for fiscal year 1995).

Committee Consideration       The Committee on Agriculture met, pursuant to notice, on      September 20, 1995, a quorum being present, to consider      Recommendations to the Budget Committee for Title I--     Committee on Agriculture--with respect to the Reconciliation      Bill for Fiscal Year 1996, and other pending business.       The Chairman called the meeting to order at 9:30 a.m. and      after finishing the first item of business, offered a      statement concerning the Committee's budget reconciliation      responsibilities. Ranking Minority Member de la Garza was      recognized for a statement also.       The Chairman laid before the Committee the Chairman's      recommendation for title I--of what he stated probably would      be the first title of the House Reconciliation Bill--and      stated that such title I would be open for amendment by      subtitle.       Thereafter, the Chairman proposed to take up the two      substitute amendments (de la Garza-Rose-Stenholm, and      Emerson-Combest) before beginning the amendment process.       At that point Mr. de la Garza was recognized to speak on      the de la Garza-Rose-Stenholm amendment in the nature of a      substitute and to control the time for the Minority to speak      on the substitute. A summary was then provided to the      Members.       After considerable discussion on the de la Garza-Rose-     Stenholm Substitute, a vote was requested by Mr. de la Garza.      By a roll call vote of 22 yeas to 25 nays, the de la Garza-     Rose-Stenholm Substitute was not adopted. See Roll Call Vote      No. 1.       Mr. Emerson was then recognized to offer the Emerson-     Combest EnBloc Amendment (also known as a Substitute) and a      summary of the Substitute was provided to the Members.       Mr. Allard asked that the record indicate whether the total      Emerson-Combest package had been scored by CBO. Mr. Combest      noted that the exact number had not been scored, but that      provisions similar to those in the Emerson-Combest bill (H.R.      2330) have received preliminary scores. It was also noted      that whatever final package came from the Committee would      have to receive final scoring from CBO.       Discussion occurred on the parliamentary procedures by      which a reconciliation bill would proceed to the Budget      Committee, the Rules Committee, and to the House Floor.      Chairman Roberts clarified the procedures which would occur      if the Committee did not meet its budget obligations.       Mr. Lewis asked about the tobacco provisions in the      Emerson-Combest Substitute which he had not seen before, and      the Chairman asked for an explanation of the provisions. Mr.      Ewing indicated that there should be some review by the      Subcommittee on Risk Management and Specialty Crops on the      tobacco provisions included in the Substitute.       Discussion also occurred on the dairy provisions of the      Emerson-Combest Substitute. By a recorded vote of 23 yeas to      26 nays, the Emerson-Combest Substitute was not adopted. See      Roll Call Vote No. 2.       Mr. Volkmer was recognized and requested unanimous consent      for all debate on the Volkmer dairy amendment and all      amendments thereto end at 5:00 p.m. Chairman Roberts      indicated he would make every effort to honor the request.       Mr. Volkmer then offered an amendment, the Dairy Policy Act      of 1995, and presented a brief description. After much      discussion, the Volkmer amendment was not adopted by a vote      of 22 yeas to 25 nays and 2 present. See Roll Call Vote No.      3.       Mr. Smith was then recognized to offer and explain an      amendment on behalf of himself and Mr. Lewis, the Dairy Act      of 1995. A summary was provided to Members. Discussion      occurred and by a voice vote, the Smith-Lewis amendment      failed. Mr. Smith requested a roll call vote, but an      insufficient number of Members were in favor of a roll      call vote, so the roll call vote was not ordered.       Mr. Ewing was then recognized to discuss the peanut and      sugar provisions contained in Subtitle C. Brief discussion      occurred, and Mr. Everett was recognized to offer an      amendment concerning peanut temporary quota allocation. Mr.      Ewing indicated that he would accept the amendment.       Chairman Roberts called for a vote on the Everett      amendment, and by a voice vote, the amendment was adopted.       Mr. Foley was then recognized to offer an amendment      regarding sugar that would replace the original five-year      average loan modification threshold with a loan modification      threshold set at 103% of imports for the previous year and      would eliminate provisions to grant import licenses to cane      refiners for imports above the GATT minimum level. After      discussion, the amendment was adopted, by a voice vote.       Mr. Smith was recognized to offer an amendment regarding      the accumulation and storage of sugar by the Federal      Government. Representatives from the Department of      Agriculture addressed what was presently being implemented      regarding the No Net Cost Sugar Provisions and the sugar      price support program using nonrecourse loans. Further      discussion occurred, and without objection, Mr. Smith      withdrew his amendment to pursue the matter at a more      appropriate time.       Mr. Allard was then recognized to offer an amendment      regarding reduction of USDA bureaucracy to signal his      displeasure with the Department for misleading statements      made by Department officials at a hearing held on February 15      relating to State water rights and Departmental policy that      permits the Forest Service to take water allocated for urban,      suburban and rural uses for another purpose.       Chairman Roberts assured Mr. Allard that he had discussed      the matter with Secretary Glickman and that the Secretary had      indicated that he would address the issue. With assurances of      the Chair to work with him in resolving this issue, Mr.      Allard, without objection, withdrew his amendment.       Mr. Dooley was recognized to offer an amendment regarding      recourse marketing loans and marketing deficiency payments      for wheat as market-based alternative to the contract      provisions in the Freedom to Farm Act. Discussion occurred      and by a voice vote the Dooley amendment failed.       Mr. Hostettler was recognized to offer an amendment      concerning crops which may be grown instead of program crops      on what was formerly known as crop base acreage. Discussion      occurred and at the request of the Chairman, Mr. Hostettler,      without objection, withdrew his amendment with the      understanding that the issue would be considered in the farm      bill.       Mr. Barrett was recognized to engage in a colloquy with      Counsel regarding limitations on forage planting relative to      subsection (k) Planning Flexibility of the Chairman's Mark.      After further discussion, Mr. Barrett chose not to offer his      amendment.       Mr. Minge was then recognized and indicated that he had      planned to offer an amendment which would extend the current      program into the 1996 crop year so that farmers could be      assured of what type of program they would have during the      1996 crop year. Chairman Roberts assured Mr. Minge that he      shared his concern and wanted to expedite the process so that      producers would know the government program for the 1996 crop      year.       Mr. Smith was recognized and indicated that he had intended      to offer an amendment regarding limitation on rental rates      under the Conservation Reserve Program, but that he would      just bring it to the attention of the Committee that this      provision may need to be addressed. Mr. Allard and the      Chairman indicated they would work with Mr. Smith during      farm bill deliberations to address his concerns.       Mrs. Clayton was then recognized and indicated that she had      two amendments. One amendment concerned housing assistance to      rural communities, which likely would be ruled out of order,      so she would just raise the issue and not offer the      amendment. The second amendment concerned water and waste      grants and loans for rural communities. Discussion occurred      on the appropriate committee of jurisdiction and      discretionary and mandatory funding accounts. After      discussion, Mrs. Clayton requested a vote, and by a show of      hands 25 yeas to 15 nays, the amendment was adopted However,      the Chairman stated that in his opinion the amendment was      subject to a point-of-order and he would probably object to      its inclusion at the Rules Committee.       Mr. Gunderson moved that the Committee favorably report its      recommendations for title I--Agriculture to the Committee on      the Budget for insertion in the Reconciliation Bill. Mr.      Emerson requested a rollcall vote.      In anticipation of a less than majority vote, Congressman Gunderson      requested that his vote be changed from yea to nay, and by a      recorded vote of 22 yeas to 27 nays, the Gunderson motion was      not adopted. See Roll Call Vote No. 4.       After a brief recess, the Chairman announced that the      Committee had come to no resolution on the Reconciliation      bill and that the meeting was adjourned, subject to the call      of the Chair.       On September 28, 1995, the Committee on Agriculture met to      conclude the Committee's Reconciliation Recommendations.       Chairman Roberts advised the Committee that the motion to      favorably report the Committee on Agriculture's      Reconciliation Recommendations had failed on a vote of 22      yeas to 27 nays, and that he would send a letter to the      Chairman of the Budget Committee and the Speaker advising      them that the Committee had come to no resolution of this      matter as directed in the instructions to this committee      contained in House Concurrent Resolution 67, the Concurrent      Resolution on the Budget for FY 1996.       The Chairman also indicated the authority of the House      Rules Committee in those instances where a standing committee      fails to submit recommended changes to the Committee on the      Budget.       The meeting adjourned, subject to the call of the Chair.                             Rollcall Votes       In compliance with clause 2(l)(2)(B) of rule XI of the      House of Representatives, the Committee sets forth the record      of the following rollcall votes taken with respect to      consideration of the recommendations regarding the      Reconciliation Bill for Fiscal Year 1996:                             rollcall no. 1       Summary: Substitute Amendment.

Budget Act Compliance (Section 308 and Section 403)       The provisions of clause 2(l)(3)(B) of Rule XI of the Rules      of the House of Representatives and section 308(a) of the      Congressional Budget Act of 1974 (relating to estimates of      new budget authority, new spending authority, or new credit      authority, or increased or decreased revenues or tax      expenditures) are not considered applicable. The estimate and      comparison required to be prepared by the Director of the      Congressional Budget Office under clause 2(l)(C)(3) of Rules      XI of the Rules of the House of Representatives and section      403 of the Congressional Budget Act of 1974 submitted to the      staff of the Budget Committee prior to the filing of this      report are as follows:                               memorandum     To: Wayne Struble.     From: Dave Hull and Craig Jagger, Congressional Budget          Office.     Subject: Agriculture reconciliation proposals.       We have determined a preliminary score for the Agriculture      Reconciliation proposals, as contained in the language      drafted on October 12, 1995 (with revisions discussed by      telephone). The estimate is preliminary in that it has not      had full consideration and approval by our managers, normally      accomplished when a formal, signed cost estimate is produced.       The table attached covers changes in direct spending      outlays only.       Two lines may require some explanation. Reimbursements to      nongovernmental employee members of the Board of Directors of      the Federal Crop Insurance Corporation is set to be made from      the Crop Insurance Fund. This constitutes new direct      spending, but is estimated less than $500,000. Also, the      Secretary is directed to offer a Business Interruption      Insurance Program by December 31, 1996. No real limits in      costs are imposed on the initial program (although the 1998-     and-later program is directed to be ``actuarially sound''),      so this program could be implemented in a costly way. It      could also be implemented as a small pilot program, with      premiums carefully set to avoid net costs. We feel we have no      good way of determining the cost of this provision as      currently proposed.       In the dairy sections of the bill, the Secretary is ordered      to carry out certain provisions, but is given the authority      to collect assessments (e.g. for milk marketing verification      studies and audits; promotion referenda; etc.)       The Dairy Indemnity Program is reauthorized, and there are      several studies and commissions ordered by the bill.
