 Mr. President, I rise in opposition to the amendment offered by the Senator from Arizona, Senator McCain. I cannot speak to the value of some of the projects which he has singled out in this amendment, but I can speak to the necessity of providing assistance to the maple sugar producers in northern New England.  Maine and other northern New England States recently endured the ice storm of the century. Part of the result of that ice storm was extensive damage to the forests in Maine. Our maple sugar producers have been severely hurt by the ice storm. Their trees may well take a very long time to recover. These maple sugar producers in northern New England have fallen through the cracks of our traditional disaster assistance programs. They need our assistance. This bill would provide a modest amount of money, $4.48 million in funds, that are desperately needed for these small maple sugar producers to recover from the impact of this devastating storm.  The amendment of the Senator from Arizona also raises important public policy issues. We have more than one branch of government in this country. The idea that the President and the President alone should solely dictate what is in an urgent supplemental bill should give us all cause for alarm. It is inconsistent with the traditions of this noble body and it is contrary to the public interests.  I urge my colleagues in the Senate to vote to table the amendment offered by the Senator from Arizona.  I yield back the remainder of my time.
