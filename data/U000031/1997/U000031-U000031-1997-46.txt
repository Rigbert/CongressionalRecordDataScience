Speaker, it is my sad duty today to report the death of a very good friend of this House, Jonna Lynne Cullen. J.L., as we called her, was a special staff member who served this Nation for many, many years as a staff member to Trent Lott in the Committee on Rules; she worked this House in many different ways. I got to know her when I began to serve at the Office of Management and Budget under President Reagan, where she was the first director of the Office of Legislative Affairs, the first woman director of that office.  Several weeks ago there were a number of Members on both sides of the aisle that held a special tribute to her. They included, the gentleman from Louisiana [Mr. Livingston], the chairman of the Committee on Appropriations, the gentleman from California [Mr. Thomas], the gentleman from Massachusetts [Mr. Moakley], the gentleman from Virginia [Mr. Wolf], the gentleman from Texas [Mr. Thornberry], the gentlewoman from Connecticut [Mrs. Johnson], and myself. A similar tribute was held on the Senate floor. Both Majority Leader Lott, Senator Cochran, Senator Snowe, and Senator Dorgan were involved, with very kind words for a woman with a very distinguished career.  I would like to announce that there will be a special tribute to her this Friday in the Russell caucus room at 11 o'clock for her friends and family. Saturday there will be a service, a memorial service, at the Presbyterian Church in Georgetown at 2 o'clock.  I just want to wish her family well. This was a tremendous loss for this country, for a woman that bridged both sides of the aisle. She was one that many Republicans and Democrats held in special love and grace for the work that she did. We wish to send condolences to her family as well.      Jonna Lynne ``J.L.'' Cullen--A Tribute to a Remarkable Woman       Dear Colleague: As many of you have heard, our dear friend      Jonna Lynne ``J.L.'' Cullen lost her long and courageous      fight with cancer late last week. She served Congress as a      prominent and distinguished staffer from 1967 until 1981. Her      energy, expertise and acts of kindness blessed many lives,      including our own.       Starting her career as a staff assistant on the House Rules      Committee for the late Chairman William Colmer (D-Miss), J.L.      rose through the ranks to ultimately serve as Associate      Minority Counsel for the Republican minority.       In 1981 she served as the first female Director of      Congressional Relations at the Office of Management and      Budget. She contained to be heavily involved in the political      process after leaving the administration, serving on      President Reagan's Bipartisan Commission on Central America.       Beyond her many professional accomplishments, J.L. was one      of those rare and wonderful individuals who relished being a      mentor, role model and always a generous friend.       In her honor, we are pleased to announce two services      allowing all who loved her to attend and pay their respects.       First, a special tribute will be held to celebrate J.L.'s      life on Friday, June 20, l997 at 11:00 a.m. in the Senate      Caucus Room in room 325, Russell Senate Office Building. A      reception with J.L.'s family will be held immediately after.       On Saturday, June 21, 1997 at 2:00 p.m., a Memorial Service      will be held at the Georgetown Presbyterian Church, 3115 P      Street, northwest Washington. A reception at the church will      follow.       Notes of condolences can be sent to her mother, Mrs. Joel      Shipp, 5480 Meadow Oaks Park Drive, Jackson, MS 39211 and her      stepmother Mrs. John Cullen, 490 Stonewall, Memphis, TN      38112.
