  With regard to the point that if someone is not a Federal employee outside the building is killed, fortunately, we passed the Biden crime bill last year, and under title 18, section 2332(A) ``Use of Weapons of Mass Destruction''--I would refer my colleague to that--anyone killed at all, whether sitting across the street drinking a cup of coffee, whether they are riding by in their automobile, whether they are a Federal employee or whether they are an alien, it does not matter; they are subject to the Federal death penalty. So the Senator is missing the point.  Second, we do want universal reform of habeas corpus. Let us do it on a bill that we are supposed to do it on. Let us do it on the crime bill.  And, No. 3, as to the idea that we are somehow going to have two different standards apply, the real issue is under what circumstances does a Federal court have a right to review a State court's judgment. It has nothing to do with terrorism under this provision. It has nothing to do with Oklahoma City. We should deal with it. We should discuss it. We should debate it, not on this bill.  I am prepared, whenever the Senator wants, to move to the tabling of my amendment.
