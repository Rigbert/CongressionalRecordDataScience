  Do we really want to raise taxes on these small businesses that create new jobs and employ two-thirds of all small business workers? With these small businesses already suffering from the credit crunch before the entire country, do we really think it is wise to hit small business again with this double-whammy of a 20 percent increase in marginal tax rates?  As we move forward from the budget process, the President and the congressional Democratic leadership have an opportunity to change course. From my 33 town meetings in Iowa during spring break, they want to change that course. There is a lot of concern about the legacy of debt that we are leaving to children and grandchildren. Both budgets would perpetuate the double whammy of constricted credit and high taxes directed at America's job engine, small business.  So as I close, in the coming months we Republicans will try to persuade our Democratic friends who have all the controls of fiscal policy to change course. One way they can change course is to focus like a laser beam on jump-starting the Nation's job engine--the small businesses of America. We need to reverse the direction of the sharply downward-sloping arrow that you have seen on some of these charts. That is where the President and the Congress agree that we need to get more job growth.  I quoted the President: 70 percent of the new jobs--small business. We in this party agree with that. As we move on from the budget, let's recognize the reality and the importance of small business.  I yield the floor.
