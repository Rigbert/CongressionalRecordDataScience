 President, I come to the floor today to introduce the Low-Income Widows Assistance Act of 2000. Since 1988, Congress has established several programs to help pay the out of pocket medical costs for low-income Medicare beneficiaries. These programs, commonly referred to as Medicare Buy-in or QMB, SLMB, and QI-1, operate as federal-state partnerships and are funded through state Medicaid programs. Depending on an eligible senior's income level, the programs could cover the cost of Medicare Part B premiums, doctor visits, deductibles, and co-payments.  Despite the availability of these programs, many seniors are not aware that they may be eligible to receive these additional benefits. According to a 1998 Families USA study, there are somewhere between 3.3 and 3.8 million seniors in America who are eligible to receive these benefits, but not currently receiving them. In my home state, the same study estimates that there are somewhere between 49,000 and 58,000 Kentucky seniors who may be eligible for one of these assistance programs but are not enrolled. While the actual task of enrolling eligible seniorsis left to the states, there are several important steps the federal government, through the Social Security Administration (SSA), can and should take.  A key component in improving participation in cost-sharing programs is the capacity of federal and state agencies to identify those individuals who experience a reduction in income after they have already enrolled in Social Security and Medicare. One group at particular risk of reduced income in their later years is widowed spouses.  For anyone who has lost a loved one, the experience is often overwhelming both mentally and emotionally. The loss of a spouse leaves many elderly with the difficult task of restructuring their lives in order to regain personal and financial stability. When SSA is informed that a married individual has died, the agency recalculates the benefit to determine the new benefit level. Frequently, the widowed spouse's benefit is lower than the amount the married couple received from Social Security. This sets up a circumstance in which a widow who was not previously eligible to receive QMB/SLMB benefits when she was married, would now be eligible to receive these benefits because her income has fallen.  In an effort to address this serious problem, I am today introducing the Low-Income Widows Assistance Act. This legislation directs Social Security to undertake outreach efforts designed to identify and notify individuals who may be eligible for these expanded benefits. It also addresses the unique challenges facing widowed spouses by requiring that when SSA recalculates the benefits for a recently widowed spouse and finds that he or she might be eligible for these assistance programs, the agency must:  One, notify the beneficiary that he or she may now be eligible for this additional assistance.  Two, notify the beneficiary's state that she may be eligible so that they can begin their own outreach efforts.  In order to help better understand how the Low-Income Widows Assistance Act would work in practical terms, I would like my colleagues to imagine the following scenario. Sally and Bob enjoyed 60 years of marriage, but just last fall, Bob suddenly passed away. Since Bob's death, Sally has been having a hard time making ends meet. She now has a lot of expenses to take care of on her own: making the house payment, buying food and clothes, and paying for doctors' visits and prescriptions--and not to mention the ``extras'' like birthday and Christmas presents for her many grandchildren. While her expenses remain essentially the same, Sally's Social Security survivors benefit is lower than what she and Bob were receiving.  Under the Low-Income Widows Assistance Act, when SSA recalculates Sally's benefit and finds that her monthly Social Security check has fallen below the $855 threshold for SLMB eligibility, the agency would be required to notify Sally that she may be eligible for SLMB benefits. SSA also would be required to notify Sally's state government that she may be eligible for these additional benefits. It is my hope that the states would then use this information to conduct their own outreach efforts to enroll Sally and others like her.  I look forward to working with my colleagues in the Senate, as well as Congressmen Lewis and Fletcher who are introducing similar legislation in the House, to help low-income widows by enacting the Low-Income Widows Assistance Act of 2000.                                 ______                                       By
