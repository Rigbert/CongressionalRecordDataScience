President, today I pay tribute to an outstanding soldier who has, for the last three and one-half years, served as the Army Chief of Staff's primary advisor on matters related to the needs and welfare of all enlisted soldiers and their families.  In January, Sergeant Major of the Army Raymond F. Chandler will retire after 33 years of distinguished service to the Army and the Nation. Throughout his career, he has been an exceptional leader and has personified the values of duty, integrity, and selfless service in all of the missions to which he has contributed.  SMA Chandler was born in Whittier, CA and enlisted in the Army in September 1981. He attended one station unit training at Fort Knox, KY and graduated as a 19E armor crewman.  SMA Chandler has served in every tank crewman position and has had multiple tours as a troop, squadron, and regimental master gunner. He also served as the 19th Commandant of the U.S. Army Sergeants Major Academy, the first enlisted commandant of that academy in its history.  I know that SMA Chandler is looking forward to spending more time with his family, including his twelve grandchildren, and I wish he and his wife Jeanne the very best. On behalf of a grateful nation, I thank Sergeant Major of the Army Chandler and his family for their many years of commitment, sacrifices, and service to our Nation.                          ____________________
