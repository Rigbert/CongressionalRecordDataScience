Speaker, it has come to my attention that on April 18, 1996, the House voting system did not record my vote on rollcall vote 125, final passage of the rule governing debate on the antiterrorism bill.  At the time the vote was held, I was on the floor of the House, having just voted against ordering the previous question.  It was my intent to vote for passage of the rule. Unfortunately, my vote was not properly recorded. I would ask the Record to reflect my presence in the Chamber and my intent to vote for passage of the rule.                          ____________________
