 I heard the distinguished assistant Democratic leader say the time was a problem. Let me try it a different way.  I ask unanimous consent that the pending two amendments be laid aside in order for Senator Bennett and Senator Burns to offer an amendment regarding Internet free speech, and thatfollowing the reporting by the clerk, the amendment be laid aside.  Mr. McCAIN. Reserving the right to object.
