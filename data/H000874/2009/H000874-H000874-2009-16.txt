Minnick. Mr. Minnick is an extraordinarily able Member of this body, and he represents his district and our country well as a Member of the Congress of the United States.  This amendment, I think, has brought up an important discussion on the perspectives that we all have. I am one of those who believes that previous administrations had two very deep failures:  One was fiscal irresponsibility. We did not pay for what we bought, even at times when we said the economy was in good shape. We continued to borrow at record rates, taking a $5.6 trillion surplus and turning it into a $10 trillion deficit.  The other major failure, I think, of the previous administration was regulatory neglect. It had the power, asChairman Frank has just pointed out, in a 1994 bill, to intervene, to try to put a check on two things--number one, on subprime lending. It did not. Mr. Greenspan testified just a couple of years ago that he thought that it was a mistake. He thought people would not take risks beyond that which were appropriate, and therefore, did not step in to regulate the subprime market. As a result, we confronted crisis.  The second big bipartisan mistake was with the Clinton administration and the Republican Congress. The Clinton administration was, obviously, led by President Clinton and Phil Gramm in the Senate. They said, We don't need to look at the derivatives market. The derivatives market will take care of itself. The head of the CFTC advised heavily and tried on her own authority, because she had the authority, to regulate the derivatives market.  The Congress stepped in, and I think I probably voted for the bill. It was an extraordinary mistake on my part. Phil Gramm led the effort which said, No, we don't need to impede this robust market that was apparently making all of us so much money.  Now, Mr. Frank advises me--and I, frankly, am not an expert on it--that most of the employees of which we are talking are going to be transferred employees, not new employees.  On regulatory neglect, I think the administration did this: They said, essentially, The free market left to its own devices will grow the economy and will create jobs, and we ought not to impede that growth and that expansion. As a result of taking the referee off the field, all the little guys got trampled on. That's not unusual. I guarantee you, if you take the referee off the football field, the split end is going to leave a second before the ball is hiked, not because the split end is a bad person but because the split end is in a competitive field and wants to take an advantage. We don't have to cast aspersions here, but people want to take advantage.  The philosophy of the Bush administration was: Don't get in the way. Regulation is bad. It undermines business. It undermines growth. Your no-cost-jobs program at its heart says, Get out of the way. Reduce regulation. We have a real difference on this issue.  Franklin Roosevelt came in and said, The reason we had a stock market crash is because there were no referees. Under his leadership, we created a lot of referees. Very frankly, for 60 or 70 years, they kept this country pretty much on track, but we got way off track. My friends, when you wring your hands about the cost of this referee, which is called the Consumer Financial Protection Agency--and I don't accept the costs that you use, but let's say there is a significant cost. Let's say it's a couple of billion dollars. You say it's $4 billion. Let's just say, for the sake of argument, that it's a couple of billion dollars.                              {time}  1200  It pales into insignificance in the $1.5 trillion that we have borrowed to get this country out of the deep, deep, deep hole caused by the failure to regulate properly. And it wasn't the rich guys on Wall Street that paid that price; it was every one of our taxpayers that paid that price.  So when you talk about cost, the cost of doing nothing, the cost of not having a referee on the field, skews the game so badly that the little guys, the guys who sent us here, the guys who asked us to protect them from those over which they have no power to protect, they said, Protect us.  That is what this debate is about. The administration has sent down and said, Look, the SEC has its responsibility, the FDIC has its responsibility, CFTC has its responsibility, all have responsibility to make sure that our economy can grow, that trading markets can be open, honest, transparent and fair.  They look to the people who are in those markets. Most of the people are not in those markets. They are our people, the little people, the average guy who goes to work, works hard, who tries to pay his mortgage, keep his family fed and clothed and his kids educated.  He doesn't know about what all these guys are doing in the derivatives market. Nobody knew what was going on. The people who were investing in the derivatives market didn't know what was going on. There was no oversight.  Madam Chair, the distinguished lady from Prince George's County, Maryland; Montgomery County, Donna Edwards, as we know, one of the central causes of our economic crisis, as I have said, was abusive consumer lending, signing Americans up for loans that they had no way of paying back. Nobody said, Time out; you're offsides; penalty. Nobody said that.  Why? Because if we did that, that would impede business. That would undermine the growth of this free market economy. That's why we have antitrust laws, so that we don't have some big guy ultimately take it all, because they can underprice and shove out. We saw that with, frankly, our friends in Microsoft who did an extraordinary job in building our economy, but at some point in time said, Time out, you've got to have competitors in this business.  For years, that practice went ignored by Washington regulators. And for a financial sector that placed massive bets on subprime mortgages, the results were eventually and tragically, for our people, catastrophic. The same abusive practices are at work in payday lending, in money transfers, and in many credit card policies, as Chairman Frank has so ably pointed out.  In each case, Americans can wind up trapped in debt. While we do expect responsibility from anyone taking out a loan, we also must ensure that those loans are fair, transparent and written in plain language.  I'm a Georgetown lawyer. I think I'm reasonably bright. I've gone to real estate settlements and we have all gotten these forms and disclosures. I bet there is nobody here who has gone to a settlement who has read all those papers. Period. I think they are way too much paper, because I don't think, even if they read it they would understand it. Very frankly, if they read it, understood it and didn't like paragraph 5, called up their lender and said, I don't like paragraph 5, the lender would say, That's fine, you don't get the money. You sign it or else.  They're counting on us. This is a time when they are counting on us. This is a time when we can respond. That is exactly what the Consumer Financial Protection Agency would do. That is its purpose, to protect them.  I understand there are concerns about it, and I congratulate Mr. Minnick for raising this issue and I appreciate his perspective. I simply disagree. It would take up the oversight responsibility that I think has been abandoned. It would safeguard consumers from exploitation and it would protect our economy from another collapse.  On the face of it, abandoning the CFPA and replacing it with a Consumer Financial Protection Council sounds like a superficial change, but in my opinion it is a very clear substantive change and not one that I would support. The council would be made up of 12 existing regulators who have already demonstrated, not the individuals, but the institutions, that they did not step up to the plate and say, you're offside; there's a penalty.  Rather than concentrating a wide range of oversight functions in a single body as a CFPA would do, the council would be an unwieldy and slow-moving bureaucracy. We talk about bureaucracy, we want somebody to focus and have a singular responsibility of making sure people don't get offsides so the little guys get hurt. It would not enhance, in my opinion, national consumer protection laws. It would undo this bill's expanded protections over the abusive practices that endanger the economic security of millions. Those abusive practices did lasting damage to Americans' lives, and we cannot let them down by watering down this bill.  I want to congratulate Chairman Frank. I want to congratulate the members of the committee on both sides of the aisle. This, I think, is a critical decision that we will make. Americans sent us here to, in effect, be their referee, to call time out, to say we want to make sure the game is fair. We want to make sure that the little guy doesn't get hurt, with all due respect to my friend, who I think does an extraordinary job. On this we disagree.  I ask the Members of this House to reject the Minnick amendment.  The Acting CHAIR. All time for debate has expired.  The question is on the amendment offered by the gentleman from Idaho (Mr. Minnick).  The question was taken; and the Acting Chair announced that the ayes appeared to have it.
