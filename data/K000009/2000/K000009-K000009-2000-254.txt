Speaker, I rise today to pay homage to a veteran political leader of our 9th Congressional District. Arthur Wilkowski, former state legislator and judge, passed from this life on November 30, 1999 at the age of 70 years.  After teaching for many years and eventually earning a law degree from the University of Toledo in 1959, Art began his foray into politics the hard way. He ran unsuccessfully for state representative in 1960 and Toledo City Council in 1963. In 1969, after gaining appointment to the Ohio House Representatives he battled his way to re-election, and held the position until his resignation in 1983. Throughout his tenure in the Ohio General Assembly, and later during brief stints as a federal judge and magistrate, Art was widely regarded as among the finest of orators and his speeches were well known. Former colleague Barney Quilter, Speaker Pro Tempore, recalled ``When he spoke on the floor of the House, everybody listened. They knew they would know more than when the speech started.'' Current Ohio House Minority Leader Jack Ford ``was in awe of the former legislator's talent'' though he did not serve with him. ``He would do everything from a little Shakespeare to language from the Founding Fathers,'' Representative Ford said.  Art Wilkowski championed causes near and dear to him, regardless of controversy or popularity. He worked tirelessly on many different issues, but was most devoted to the creation of the Ohio Civilian Conservation Corp and the development of a high-speed passenger rail system. In his tribute to Art, Mr. Quilter noted, ``He took his ideas and turned them into law in Columbus. He was probably the brightest person I knew in the legislature.'' Perhaps the highest praise comes from long-time consumer advocate and community leader Mike Ferner who commented, ``He was uncommonly courageous. A lot of people will remark on his oratorical skills, but to me, his courage and integrity were more significant.''  Choosing to resign from the Ohio General Assembly in July of 1983, Art wrote that ``public service was the fulfillment of all my boyhood dreams and aspirations, as such related to a productive life.'' Though his presence and skill were sorely missed in the Ohio House of Representatives, he was able to resume his law practice in Toledo's Polish Village taking on more legal work on behalf of clients who could not pay a cent for his brilliant work, serve an appointment to the 6th District Court of Appeals, and write. He was serving on the Lucas County Probate Court as Magistrate at the time of his death.  Art Wilkowski was genuine and generous, and a man committed to his ideals. He will be missed not only by his family, but our community as well. We offer our heartfelt condolences to his children Kathy, Craig, and Keith, grandchildren, and sisters Helen, Wanda, and Olga. May fond memories of the precious gift of Art's life sustain them.                          ____________________
