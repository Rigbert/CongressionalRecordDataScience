President, Senators should expect a series of up to four rollcall votes at 10:30 a.m. tomorrow. The first vote will be on cloture with respect to the DREAM Act. If cloture is not invoked, the next vote would be cloture with respect to don't ask, don't tell. The final two votes will be on confirmation of two judicial nominations.                          ____________________
