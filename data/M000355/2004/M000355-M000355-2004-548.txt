 There will be no rollcall votes on Monday, but Senators are encouraged to come to the floor to deliver morning business statements if they have any.  As a reminder, earlier today the majority leader propounded a unanimous consent request that would have allowed us to take up and begin debate on S. 2207, the Pregnancy and Trauma Care Access Protection Act of 2004. There was an objection to that request, and the majority leader was forced to file cloture on the motion to proceed.  The cloture vote on the motion to proceed to S. 2207 will occur on Wednesday of next week at 2:15, and that vote will be the next rollcall vote.                          ____________________
