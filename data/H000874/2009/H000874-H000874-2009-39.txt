Ackerman, for yielding, and I thank the ranking member, Ms. Ros-Lehtinen, for bringing this resolution to the floor.  Next week, as has been said, President Obama will be hosting the first State dinner of his administration, and the guest of honor, appropriately, will be the Prime Minister of the Republic of India, Dr. Manmohan Singh.  Prime Minister Singh visits America at a time when the relationship between our two nations is as strong as it has ever been. In India we see a vital partner on issues of national security to world trade. We see a nation that confronts many of the threats that challenge America, from terrorism to global warming. We see an emerging economic power with a growing middle class. And though our nations are separated by distance, language, and culture, we recognize in one another the democratic values we share; and of course we have a language in common as well, as well as common values, despite its great size and diversity.  And for those who may not know, India will soon be not only the largest democracy, but the most populous nation in the world.  India has remained a democracy since its independence more than 60 years ago. And this year, Prime Minister Singh was returned to power in the world's largest democratic election. In fact, India made him the first Prime Minister since Nehru to return to office after completing a full term, a truly remarkable accomplishment.  All of us should be proud, and I know we are, to host the leader of one of America's most vital allies. On behalf of the House of Representatives, Speaker Pelosi, and all of us on both sides of the aisle, and Mr. Boehner, I am pleased to have this opportunity to welcome Prime Minister Singh to the United States and rise in strong support of this resolution.
