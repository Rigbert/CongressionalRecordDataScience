Speaker, the Gingrich Republicans are now calling for an end to our national program of free and low-cost school lunches. The message of the Gingrich Republicans to America's hungry children is clear: ``Let them eat the Republican Contract.''  It is sad that our Republican colleagues have not taken the time to meet with teachers, who will tell you that for many of our Nation's kids the school lunch is the only nutritious meal in their day, the only way to help a listless child get ready to learn. Why are the Gingrich Republicans gutting the school lunch program? So that they can give tax breaks to the wealthy, a group well represented by the lobbyists in this town.  Well, America's kids need their lobbyists in Washington, too. America needs to give the Gingrich Republicans a clear message: Stop declaring war on our kids.                          ____________________
