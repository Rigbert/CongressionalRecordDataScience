 percent for student loans and 7.9 percent for PLUS loans. The amendment is fully paid for by a very small--about one-half of 1 percent--surcharge on income over $1 million.  We should do this for students all across the country, and we should do it not only for the students who might be going to college next year but for those who are in high school today and will face, as we know, predictably higher rates.  A young man from Rhode Island wrote a letter to me. He said:       My brother, who is in college, will be paying a lot of      money for college and he's worried he will have a hard time      paying the loan. I'm afraid that by the time I go to college,      loans will be so expensive that I will not be able to pay it      off. My parents help with paying for college but they might      not be able to help with a loan that big. I really want to be      able to go to college.  For those young men and women who are in high school today or who are going to high school, we have to at least vote for this Reed-Warren amendment to make sure interest rates stay at least within the present bounds.  With that, I urge a ``yes'' vote.
