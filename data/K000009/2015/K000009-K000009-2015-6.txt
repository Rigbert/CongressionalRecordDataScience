Twenty years ago, the United States, Ukraine, the Russian Federation, and the United Kingdom came together to sign the Budapest Memorandum.  This agreement reaffirmed the common commitment of those signatory nations ``to respect the independence and sovereignty and the existing borders of Ukraine.'' And in return for that promise of protecting those borders, Ukraine dismantled its vast nuclear weapons complex, the third largest in the world.  With that memorandum in hand, Ukraine did what it promised, but what about the other signatories to that agreement?  Today, the Budapest Memorandum appears to be a hollow promise. It comes as little surprise that Russia would break that promise, but it disappoints me to no end that the free world, led by the United States of America, seems reluctant to honor its promises to take a more effective role as a coalition of nations and civil society organizations to help Ukraine stand on its own in the face of internal carnage perpetrated by Russia.  NATO's Supreme Allied Commander in Europe, General Philip Breedlove, a man who knows an enormous amount about that continent, recently expressed his deep concern that our focus has been pulled away from Russia's proxy invasion of Ukraine. ``Folks have taken their eye off of Ukraine a little bit because of Syria,'' he said.  According to him, the situation is similar to how the world lost focus on the Russian invasion of Crimea, which the United States still considers Ukrainian territory, after Russia invaded eastern Ukraine and triggered the current war.  Fighting in the Donbass region of Ukraine has fluctuated, but skirmishes continue and Ukrainian territory remains under Russian occupation, with no withdrawal in sight.  Congress took initial steps to address Ukraine's need last year, just about a year ago, with the Ukraine Freedom Support Act--legislation we fought hard to pass and which most of our colleagues voted to support. However, conditions continue to worsen.  A report done by the Commissioner for Human Rights of the Council of Europe acknowledges that the fighting in the east, which began in the spring of 2014, has resulted in extensive damage to schools and medical facilities, leaving the local population increasingly dependent on outside aid. Assistance is needed to meet basic needs and access to clean water, which is a problem already for 1.3 million Ukrainians at a minimum.  Two weeks ago, I sent a letter to Assistant Secretary of State Victoria Nuland to call for the United States to work with the Ukrainian Government and Russia to restore access to humanitarian workers and to allow aid to proceed.  In particular, I identified a need for access to--and this is in working with the religious leaders of Ukraine across confessions for these items--winterization activities, including blankets, quilts, kerosene, heating stoves; directfinancial assistance to these religious groups to help them help others; water pumping station equipment to prevent freezing; electrical repair kits and tools; coal; batteries; clothing; and everyday necessities, including medical equipment, basic and specialized medicines, emergency medical kits, shoes, socks, long underwear, coats, mittens, hats; redevelopment assistance, including economic aid and tools as well as equipment to repair homes, bridges, and roads.  They don't even request new material. They just request help. I just think to myself, how much is thrown away in landfills across this country, items that still have good wear and good possibility? How much is thrown away at construction sites? And what we can do to help the people of Ukraine? These items are more than just objects to the people of Ukraine. They are life itself right now.  The people of Ukraine want desperately to stand on their own, access to the European continent, and to govern themselves in the light of liberty. I have seen it in their eyes. Let us help them weather this terrible storm now when they need it most.  My heavens, if the United States of America could lead the Berlin airlift after World War II in those old, tired planes, sending goods to the people of Europe, to the people of Western Europe, and to give them hope and sustenance, you mean to tell me that the America of the 21st century can't figure this out, especially when Congress has put money in the budget of the Department of Defense and the Department of State to carry this out, working in cooperation with organizations across this great land?  Last month, the All-Ukrainian Council of Churches and Religious Organizations, a globally unique coming-together of diverse religious faiths which represent 85 percent of the Ukrainian population, presented President Obama with a letter I referenced earlier, appealing on behalf of the people of Ukraine to help address the humanitarian catastrophe gripping that Nation.  Each is a daily witness to the challenges and needs of the people suffering because of this unnecessary, brutal war, where over 8,000 have already been killed; 17,610 wounded--that was a figure as of October--2.6 million people internally displaced; 5 million in need of aid, including 1.7 million children, and one in five homes of displaced families damaged or destroyed. Surely, the free world can figure this out.  I do have to say a word about this. A few weeks ago, I stood here in Washington with many distinguished Ukrainian leaders, including the First Lady of Ukraine, Maryna Poroshenko; His Holiness, the Patriarch of Kyiv and All Rus'-Ukraine Filaret; and my dear friend and fellow Ukraine Caucus cochair, Congressman Sander Levin of Michigan, to dedicate a memorial here in our Nation's capital to the 1932-1933 Soviet Union's forced starvation of between 2.5 million and 7.5 million Ukrainians whose names are lost to history forever.  I think America should also consider doing this humanitarian lift to Ukraine because, frankly, no place on Earth suffered more in the last century from brutal tyranny than did Ukraine. Perhaps something is owed to those sacrificial people for what they endured and for the spark of liberty that still breathes so strongly in their hearts and minds.  In marking the brutal tragedy of the forced famine, called the Holodomor, I am reminded of the importance of teaching about the cost of liberty, the need to fight for it, and the legacy of that sacrificial people.  Through this memorial, we seek to better guard against any oppressive regime that would seek to rule over any people, for, at that time, our Nation failed to reveal and respond to that ongoing brutality of forced starvation in Ukraine. Had the free world acted then, we might have changed the fate of millions, but that did not happen.  Let us not repeat the blindness of the past. America must act with dispatch to support the freedom-loving people of Ukraine. Time and again, in moments when the world has found itself at a crossroads, American leadership and action has made the difference.  We must be prepared to join with others in this effort to save the children, to save the families, to save the people of Ukraine, and, in doing so, to let liberty march forward. We must do the right thing for our brothers and sisters in liberty. America must act, and we must act as leaders. Ukraine is waiting. The world is waiting.  I call upon the President of the United States and the Obama administration to do what is necessary and achievable to meet the growing humanitarian crisis in Ukraine, to relieve the unnecessary suffering of their people, and to prevent a gigantic refugee crisis from spilling over and impacting European stability.  Mr. Speaker, the gentleman from Pennsylvania (Mr. Costello), who could not be here tonight for this Special Order, supports these efforts. His formal statement includes the important role that the people of southeastern Pennsylvania have played in keeping a focus on Ukraine and this ongoing tragedy and what the United States of America can do at very little cost to the people here by the mobilization of the hearts of the American people to provide humanitarian assistance to help save Ukraine in our own time and day.     President Barack Obama,     The White House, 1600 Pennsylvania Avenue NW., Washington,          DC.       Dear Mr. President: We, the undersigned of the All      Ukrainian Council of Churches and religious organizations,      and representing Ukraine's diverse religious community appeal      to you on behalf of the people of Ukraine to help address the      humanitarian catastrophe gripping our country. The needs are      enormous, ranging from medical supplies to everyday items      such as food, water, and clothing.       While the global news media regularly reports on Russia's      war against Ukraine, government reforms and financial      challenges, there is rarely any mention of the extraordinary      dimensions of the human suffering caused by Moscow's      aggression. While Ukraine certainly needs greater military,      financial and political assistance, our focus here must be on      the humanitarian aspect.       As you know, according to the UN, over 5 million people,      including 1.7 million children are in desperate need of      humanitarian assistance. 8,000 people have died and over      17,000 have been injured and wounded. There are over      1,390,000 displaced people, including 174,000 children. The      challenges of this human tragedy are overwhelming. Even the      most conservative estimates show that over 65% of projected      needs have yet to be met--even on the level of pledges.       As representatives of the interfaith community, we witness      on a daily basis the challenges and the needs of people      suffering because of this war. And with the onset of winter,      an already dire situation will only get worse. We pray for      their lives and for the future of our country.       While we are grateful for the assistance provided by the      United States government to date, we know that the need is so      much greater. Thus, we appeal to you to increase assistance      and to activate the full potential of the National Guard      State Partnership Program and the Partnership for Peace (PfP)      as instruments for alleviating the humanitarian catastrophe.      One of the stated goals of the PfP is to ``provide a      framework for enhanced political and military cooperation for      joint multilateral crisis management activities, such as      humanitarian assistance and peacekeeping.'' Ukraine was the      first post-Soviet country to join the PfP in 1993.       In addition to the assistance provided by the US      government, we, during our travels throughout the United      States, have come to personally witness the great generosity      of the American people expressed through numerous spontaneous      initiatives to ship medical and humanitarian supplies to      Ukraine.       Time is of the essence, Mr. President. The people of      Ukraine need to know that they are not forgotten in their      time for need! The instruments anticipated by the National      Guard State Partnership and Partnership for Peace programs      will allow the American people to more effectively and      rapidly access and deliver already available medical and      humanitarian supplies to Ukraine--literally within days. We      each represent distribution networks that cooperate with each      other; we now ask for the resources to meet the growing human      needs.       We pray that God grant you guidance, wisdom and bless you      and the great American nation. God bless the United States      and Ukraine!           Sincerely,         Antoniuk Valery Stepanovich--Chairman of the Union,            Senior Bishop, All-Ukrainian Union of Churches of            Evangelical Christians--Baptists; Panochko Michael            Stepanovich--President of the Union, Senior Bishop,            All-Ukrainian Union of Christians of the Evangelical            Faith--Pentecostals; Ablaev Emirali--Chairman of the            Spiritual Administration of Muslims of Ukraine, Mufti            Spiritual Administration of Muslims of Crimea; Ahmad            Tamim--Head of the Spiritual Administration of Muslims            of Ukraine, Mufti of Zan-Fabian Alexander--Head of the            Consistory of the SCRC, Bishop, Transcarpathian            Reformed Church; Sergey Mashevskyy--Bishop, German            Evangelical Lutheran           Church of Ukraine; Yaakov Dov Bleich--President of the            Association, Chief Rabbi of Kyiv and Ukraine,            Association of Jewish Religious Organizations of            Ukraine; Peter Malchuk--Head of the Commission on the            Relationship Between State and Church; Raichynets            Vasiliy Fedorovich--Senior Pastor, Union of Free            Churches of Christians of Evangelical Faith of Ukraine;            Macarius (Maletich)--Primate of the Ukrainian            Autocephalous Orthodox Church Metropolitan The            Ukrainian Autocephalous Orthodox Church; Commandant            Grigory Ivanovich--President, Ukrainian Bible Society;            Sviatoslav (Shevchuk)--Archbishop, The Ukrainian Greek            Catholic Church; Marcos (Oganesyan)--Bishop, Ukrainian            Diocese of the Armenian Apostolic Church; Vyacheslav            Horpynchuk--Bishop, Ukrainian Lutheran Church; Onufry            (Berezovsky)--Metropolitan Ukrainian Orthodox Church;            Filaret (Denisenko)--Patriarch Filaret, Patriarch of            Kyiv and All Rus-Ukraine, Ukrainian Orthodox Church            Kiev Patriarchate; Nosov Stanislav Viktorovich--           President, The Ukrainian Union Conference of Seventh-           Day Adventists; Padun Leonid Nikolaevich--Senior            Bishop, Ukrainian Christian Evangelical Church.
