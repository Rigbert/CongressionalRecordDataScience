 President, many Members came to the floor yesterday to debate the Gorsuch nomination. We will have all of next week to continue the debate. I encourage my colleagues to continue discussing this important nomination.  Two months ago today, before Neil Gorsuch had even been nominated, I spoke on the Senate floor about the rhetoric we could expect to hear from the other side after the President's nominee was announced.  I predicted then that we would see many on the left ``[try] to paint whomever is actually nominated in apocalyptic terms.'' It ``doesn't matter who this Republican President nominates,'' I said then. It ``doesn't matter who any Republican President nominates, really,'' I continued. No matter the nominee, I said back before we had the nominee, ``we can expect to hear a lot of end-times rhetoric from the left . . . [and] [i]n fact, we already have.''  I was alluding then to the fact that, sight unseen, we had already begun hearing from those on the far left who vowed to oppose anyone--anyone the President nominated.
