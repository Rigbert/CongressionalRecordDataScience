 I want to thank all of my colleagues. I especially want to thank our staff whohave literally spent weeks and weeks and days and hours on this--Evan Schatz and Mike Spahn and John Righter and the others who are sitting behind us tonight--as well as Senator Sessions and all of his staff.  It is a tribute to their hard work and my lost voice that we are sitting here tonight ready to take the next step to get our country back on a better fiscal path.  I thank the Presiding Officer and yield the floor.
