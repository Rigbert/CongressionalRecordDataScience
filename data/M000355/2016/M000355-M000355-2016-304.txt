 President, reserving the right to object, the Senator from New Jersey and I had a similar exchange a couple of weeks ago. As I pointed out then, the Senate has treated President Obama fairly with respect to his judicial nominations.  As of now, the Senate has already confirmed 329 of President Obama's judicial nominees. That is more judicial nominees confirmed than President Bush had during all of his 8 years. I will be objecting shortly, but we have been entering into agreements to process additional nominees on a bipartisan basis. Our Democratic colleagues objected to the last proposal I made a couple of weeks ago, but I am prepared to offer another one. My proposal includes many of the nominees who were included in the proposal from the junior Senator from New Jersey. It would include a judicial nominee from Tennessee, two nominations from Pennsylvania, and a Utah nomination.  I ask unanimous consent that the Senate proceed to executive session to consider individually the following nominations at a time to be determined by the majority leader in consultation with the Democratic leader: Calendar Nos. 359, 460, 461, and 569; that there be 30 minutes for debate only on each nomination equally divided in the usual form; that upon the use or yielding back of time on the respective nomination, the Senate proceed to vote without intervening action or debate on the nomination, with no other business in order.
