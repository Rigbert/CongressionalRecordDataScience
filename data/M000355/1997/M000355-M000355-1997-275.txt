 President, I commend my friend and colleague from Washington, Senator Gorton, for this amendment. As the Senator knows from previous discussions, I share his view that if we were establishing the parade, the next countries at the front of the parade clearly ought to be the Baltic countries. As a matter of fact, as my friend from Washington knows, we included in the bill $20 million in grants and loans to the three Baltic countries, just as we provided financial assistance last year to Poland, Hungary and the Czech Republic in order to help them upgrade their militaries in order to seek to achieve a level of acceptance for admission to NATO.  So I think the amendment of the Senator from Washington, of which I am a cosponsor, is an excellent addition to this debate, and I completely share his views. The countries are most worthy for admission to NATO. We have recognized their independence throughout the cold war. They are doing an awful lot of things correctly. These countries are making enormous progress, and some have argued that they have done every bit as well as Hungary, Poland and the Czech Republic, if not even better.  So I commend my friend from Washington for his amendment. I think it is an excellent amendment.
