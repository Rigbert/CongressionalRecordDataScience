Speaker, I rise today to pay tribute to the Honorable Carolyn H. Williams, Judge of Probate for the Kalamazoo County 9th Circuit Court, who is approaching the end of a long and distinguished career of public service. A dedicated and committed individual, Judge Williams has served the communities and families of Southwest Michigan for the last 18 years. Through her leadership and enthusiasm to her profession, Judge Williams has helped to make our corner of Michigan an even better and safer place to live and grow.  Judge Williams has long been known for her ability to motivate and inspire young people who for some reason or another end in her court. Her evenhandedness and dedication to fairness have followed her throughout her career. No matter how difficult a case may be, Judge Williams always presents a voice of calm and this ability shines through to the individuals before her.  Judge Williams has been involved in many facets of our local and state community. Over the years she has served as Co-Chair of Kalamazoo Healthy Futures Initiative, President of Michigan Probate Judges Association, Chair of Kalamazoo Children and Family Consortium, and Greater Kalamazoo United Way Board of Directors. She has also received many accolades including, YWCA Woman of Achievement, Kalamazoo Rotary Red Rose Citation, and Glass Ceiling Award of Greater Kalamazoo Network.  Our community is forever in her debt. There is no question that Judge William's passion for the law and betterment of society will be greatly missed. Her contributions to the improvement to our way of life have been immense. I wish Judge Williams and her family all the best in retirement. Although she is leaving the Court, there is no doubt that her life's work of helping and assisting children and families will continue.  On a personal note, I have known Judge Williams and her family for many years. There's never been a time that I haven't been impressed with her style and grace as she has looked to follow the law in making our community a better place. Her legal peers know, they have to be prepared as they enter her courtroom. She is deeply respected by all.                          ____________________[Extensions of Remarks][Page E40]From the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]              TRIBUTE TO THE HONORABLE CAROLYN H.
