President, I rise to introduce legislation with my Republican colleague on the Labor and Human Resources Committee, Senator Susan Collins, as well as Senators Kennedy, Murray, Dodd, Mikulski, Conrad, Levin, Akaka, Kerry, Johnson, Torricelli, Kerrey, and Hollings to reform and reauthorize an important student aid program, the State Student Incentive Grant program or SSIG.  Last fall, I was pleased to join forces with Senator Collins to lead the fight to restore funding for SSIG on an 84 to 4 vote.  This program provides funding on the basis of a dollar for dollar match to help states provide need-based financial aid in the form of grants and community service work study awards to 700,000 students nationwide, and 13,000 students from my home state of Rhode Island. Grants are targeted to the neediest undergraduate and graduate students.  As I noted last fall during the debate on the Labor, Health and Human Services, and Education Appropriations bill, many states would not have established or maintained their need-based financial aid programs without this important federal incentive. Moreover, students, searching for sources of need-based grants to make their higher education dreams a reality, have come to rely on SSIG.  Indeed, the importance of SSIG has increased over the years as skyrocketing college costs have eroded the purchasing power of the Pell Grant, and as the grant-loan imbalance widens. Twenty-three years ago, 80 percent of student aid came in the form of grants and 20 percent in the form of loans. Today the opposite is true, and students face significant debt upon graduation.  In addition, low-income students are still finding it particularly hard to afford higher education. Less than 50% of high school graduates with incomes under $22,000 go to college, while more than 80% of their higher income counterparts pursue education beyond high school.  To address these trends and ensure that needy students have alternatives to borrowing, SSIG must be strengthened during the upcoming reauthorization of the Higher Education Act. The legislation we introduce today, the Leveraging Educational Assistance Partnership (LEAP) Act, does this by reauthorizing and making significant reforms to the SSIG program.  The LEAP Act provides states greater incentives and flexibility to help needy students attend college. Our legislation creates a two-tier grant program. Any funds appropriated over a trigger level of funding--$35 million-- would require an increased state match of two new dollars for every federal dollar. However, states would gain new flexibility to use these funds for activities such as increasing grant amounts or carrying out academic or merit scholarship programs, community service programs, early intervention, mentorship, and career education programs, secondary to postsecondary education transition programs, or scholarship programs for students wishing to enter the teaching profession.  These improvements restore the incentive nature of the program by attracting more state funds for student aid and providing greater flexibility for the use of these funds, while not disenfranchising states that can only match according to the current 1-to-1 requirement.  The LEAP Act is supported by students, educators, and student aid officials, including the National Association of State Student Grant and Aid Programs (NASSGAP), the National Association of Independent Colleges and Universities (NAICU), the American Council on Education (ACE), the American Association of State Colleges and Universities (AASCU), the United States Public Interest Research Group (USPIRG), the United States Student Association (USSA), and the National Association of Graduate-Professional Students.  Mr. President, I believe we should help all our citizens achieve the American Dream and ensure access to higher education, especially for hard working families whose wages have not kept up with inflation. I urge my colleagues to join us in this critical effort to strengthen federal-state student aid partnerships and our commitment to America's students.  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be printed in the Record.  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the Record, as follows:                                S. 1644         Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives      of the United States of America in Congress assembled,     SECTION 1.
