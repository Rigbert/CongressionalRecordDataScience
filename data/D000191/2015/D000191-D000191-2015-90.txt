 The Acting CHAIR. Without objection, the gentleman from Oregon is recognized for 5 minutes.  There was no objection.  Mr. DeFAZIO. Madam Chair, I yield myself such time as I may consume.  I thank the two gentlemen involved for noting this deficiency in the rule. It is inexplicable to me that, although they certainly noted the need in the new design to have a protective housing around the pressure relief valve so they wouldn't shear off in a rollover accident, they did not extend that to retrofitted cars. This amendment ensures that they will meet those stronger standards. I think this amendment has tremendous merit.  I yield such time as he may consume to the gentleman from Illinois (Mr. Lipinski), the Democratic sponsor of the amendment.
