President, the New England Governors recently passed a resolution calling on Congress to adopt legislation to reauthorize the Corporation for National Service this year.  As a strong supporter of national and community service, I am heartened by the New England Governors' enthusiasm for AmeriCorps, the National Senior Service Corps, the Learn and Serve program, and other Corporation for National Service initiatives. It is my hope that the Corporation for National Service reauthorization legislation will be considered by the Senate this year.  Mr. President, I ask that the New England Governors' resolution be printed in the Record.  The resolution follows:                           Resolution No. 140       Whereas, the citizens of New England have benefited in a      variety of ways from the important contribution made by the      service programs of the Corporation for National Service in      partnership with the states of the region; and       Whereas, New England states have profited from the power      and promise of citizen service and traditional volunteers      through the efforts of 90,000 New Englanders who serve our      states each day through AmeriCorps, Learn and Serve America,      and the National Senior Service Corps programs of the      Corporation for National Service; and       Whereas, New England states have been assisted by the      Corporation for National Service programs that use service as      a strategy to improve the quality of life in the region; and       Whereas, AmeriCorps members and National Senior Service      Corps volunteers have improved education achievement,      enhanced our environment, made our neigbhorhoods safer, and      addressed other human needs; and       Whereas, the students in Learn and Serve America have been      afforded the opportunity to serve their communities and      reflect on the meaning of that service; and       Whereas, AmeriCorps and the other programs supported by the      Corporation for National Service have provided critical      resources to our states; and       Whereas, the proposed reauthorization legislation, entitled      the National and Community Service Amendments Act of 1998      will devolve more authority and greater flexibility to states      in the implementation of programs funded by the Corporation      for National Service; and       Whereas, the existing distribution of AmeriCorps grant      funds, two-thirds for AmeriCorps State and one-third for      AmeriCorps National, is retained in the proposed legilation;      and       Whereas, New England has benefited substantially from the      law's existing allocation of state funds which redistribute      one-half through formula and one-half through national      competition; Now, therefore, be it Resolved, That the      Governors of Connecticut, Maine, Massachusetts, New      Hampshire, Rhode Island and Vermont, through their New      England Governors' Conference, Inc., urge their respective      Congressional delegations and the Congress to support the      National Community Service Amendments Act of 1998,      reauthorizing the Corporation for National Service, to      support the bill's devolution provisions that add authority      and flexibility to states and state commissions, to support      the bill's directives that AmeriCorps State funds provide      Governor-appointed state commissions more control over      program selection, and particularly to support the bill's      continuation of the existing 50/50 state funds disitribution      division between formula and nationally competitive      AmeriCorps grant funds.       Adoption certified by the New England Governors'      Conference, Inc. on February 24, 1998.                          ____________________
