That was the problem.  With respect to the budget, do we expect to see a budget next week? It is not on the list, and I know we have been waiting with bated breath for many weeks now for the budget, as has the leader. Can the leader comment on the status of the budget?  Mr. DeLAY. Mr. Speaker, will the gentleman yield?
