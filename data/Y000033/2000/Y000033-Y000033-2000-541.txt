Mr. Speaker, I submit for the benefit of the Members a copy of the cost estimate prepared by the Congressional Budget Office for H.R. 1749, a bill to designate Wilson Creek in Avery and Caldwell Counties, North Carolina, as a component of the National Wild and Scenic Rivers System.                                                    U.S. Congress,                                  Congressional Budget Office,                                Washington, DC, February 29, 2000.     Hon. Don Young,     Chairman, Committee on Resources,     U.S. House of Representatives, Washington, DC.       Dear Mr. Chairman: The Congressional Budget Office has      prepared the enclosed cost estimate for H.R. 1749, a bill to      designate Wilson Creek in Avery and Caldwell counties, North      Carolina, as a component of the National Wild and Scenic      Rivers System.       If you wish further details on this estimate, we will be      pleased to provide them. The CBO staff contact is Deborah      Reis.           Sincerely,                                               Dan L. Crippen,                                                         Director.       Enclosure.          Congressional Budget Office Cost Estimate--H.R. 1749       H.R. 1749 would designate a 23-mile segment of Wilson Creek      in North Carolina as a component of the Wild and Scenic River      System, to be administered by the U.S. Forest Service. Based      on information provided by the Forest Service, administering      the Wilson Creek segment would have no significant impact on      federal spending. The river segment would remain undeveloped.       Because H.R. 1749 would not affect direct spending or      receipts, pay-as-you-go procedures would not apply. The bill      contains no intergovernmental or private-sector mandates as      defined in the Unfunded Mandates Reform Act and would impose      no costs on state, local, or tribal governments.       The CBO staff contact is Deborah Reis, who can be reached      at 226-2860. This estimate was approved by Peter H. Fontaine,      Deputy Assistant Director for Budget Analysis.                               ____________________
