President, so much of the debate here in the Senate is consumed by the seemingly endless war in Iraq. I just left a hearing of the Democratic policy conference. It was the 13th hearing relative to the waste and abuse that took place during the course of this war. To think that we have spent almost $700 billion in the course of this war and how much of it has been wasted. We asked those who were testifying who were actually on the ground a few years ago in charge of allocating equipment and watching conduct.
