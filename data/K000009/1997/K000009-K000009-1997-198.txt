Chairman, if the gentleman will continue to yield, you are protected until such time as that patent is issued, and certainly with the courts and system we have in place, after that patent is granted. What the committee is seeking to do, and why we in this amendment try to protect small business and small inventors, is lessen the time that they have that protection.
