 Speaker, our nation was forever changed on the morning of Sept 11. The goal of Osama bin Laden was to demoralize us, create fear, uncertainty and instability in our country--he failed. Last week Congress met in New York to pay tribute to those who were killed, and I was reminded how strong and resilient our country truly is. Last September 11 we saw amazing displays of heroism and bravery. I will never forget the sight of firemen entering the World Trade Center risking their lives to save others.  We have also learned a great deal since Sept 11. We've learned that we are a vulnerable nation, and that we must lead an international coalition against bigoted, religious fanatics who believe they have the right to kill in order to impose their reactionary ideology on others. Many of us also have learned that in order to be true to American values, we must not undermine the fundamental principles and constitutional rights that our country was founded on.  As an American and a Vermonter, I was enormously proud of how our people responded to this crisis in terms of blood donations, financial contributions and coming together as a community to support the victims and each other. It is my hope that we will continue to show that same sense of community that we demonstrated in the aftermath of the September 11 attacks.                          ____________________
