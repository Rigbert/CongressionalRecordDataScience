 President, as we are all aware, the Internet has revolutionized communication and business. Unfortunately, it also provides a new tool for some very traditional villains: child molesters. While it is already a Federal crime to cross Statelines to sexually molest a minor, in recent years the number of people using the Internet to violate this law has skyrocketed. According to a report issued to Congress last year by the National Center for Missing and Exploited Children, NCMEC, one in five children, aged 10-17, were sexually solicited over the Internet in 1999. And from 1998-2000 alone, the FBI's cybermolester caseload increased by 550 percent.  Unfortunately, loopholes in the current law allow some of these predators to escape without any real consequences. Because most cybermolesters are well-educated, middle-class, and have no previous criminal record, many judges are giving them laughably light sentences. Ironically, the purveyors of child-pornography receive mandatory ten-year sentences, but those who use the Internet to meet children and act out pornographic fantasies often receive no jail time at all.  We need to end the double standard that gives lighter sentences to a special set of privileged criminals. For this reason, last week I re-introduced my Cybermolesters Enforcement Act to ensure that these new on-line molesters are apprehended and brought to justice. Like last year, my bill provides for a five-year mandatory minimum sentence for those who abuse the Internet in an effort to sexually abuse America's children, but it does not change the maximum sentence provided by Federal law.  This year, the bill contains two additional provisions to help the Bureau apprehend these abusers and destroy their disgusting wares. First, my bill would allow law enforcement to obtain a Federal wiretap on those suspected of committing certain child sexual exploitation offenses, such as transmitting computer-generated child pornography, enticing a minor to travel for sexual activity, or transporting a minor for sexual activity. Adding these offenses to the list of crimes for which Federal law enforcement may obtain wiretaps will significantly increase the ability of the authorities to detect and interdict those who use the Internet to send pornography to minors and then arrange to meet them for unlawful sexual activity. As with any other wiretap request, though, the government first must demonstrate probable cause to the satisfaction of a Federal judge in order to use this important tool.  Second, this year my bill would classify child pornography as contraband. Illegal drugs and counterfeit currency are already defined as contraband, and child pornography is at least as dangerous to our society. Classifying child pornography as contraband would enable law enforcement officials to seize it based upon probable cause and destroy it automatically after its use as evidence is no longer needed. Furthermore, treating this odious material as contraband will likely lead to increased cooperation from commercial entities, such as Internet service providers, which are unwittingly used by child pornographers to store and transmit this disgusting material. Because no customer can claim a legitimate property interest in contraband, these entities will be free to seize child pornography, delete its presence on the Internet, and send the images to law enforcement without fear of civil liability from their customers.  The Cybermolesters Enforcement Act addresses a real and chilling threat to our Nation's children. It will support the FBI's ``Innocent Images'' program, which is on the front lines of the battle against on-line pedophiles. Both Ernie Allen, President of the NCMEC, and by John Walsh of ``America's Most Wanted'' have endorsed it. ``Predators are hiding behind the relative anonymity of the Internet to target children,'' said Mr. Allen. ``While we're making enormous progress in addressing this problem, it is clear that too many of these cases are not being viewed in a serious way by the courts. Senator McConnell's bill sends a loud, clear message that enticing children for sexual purposes over the Internet is just as illegal and just as dangerous as doing it in a shopping mall or playground,'' said Allen. And John Walsh notes that ``yesterday's child molesters are today's cybermolesters. Senator McConnell's bill is a comprehensive approach to fighting these despicable crimes. It helps the FBI track down these criminals, allows the Bureau to seize their perverse wares, and makes sure we do not let them escape justice.''  I urge my colleagues to support this initiative, and I ask unanimous consent that this article by George Will outlining the problem of cybermolesters be printed in the Record.  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in the Record as follows:               [From the Washington Post, Jan. 23, 2000]                               Nasty Work                          (By George F. Will)       To visit a crime scene, turn on your computer. Log on to a      list of ``bulletin boards'' or real-time chat rooms, which      come and go rapidly. Look for names like      ``Ilovemuchyoungerf'' (``f'' stands for females) or      ``vryvryvrybrlylegal'' or ``Moms'nsons'' or ``likemyung.''       The Internet, like the telephone and automobile before it,      has created new possibilities for crime. Some people wielding      computers for criminal purposes are being combated by FBI      agents working out of an office park in Calverton, Md.       The FBI operation, named Innocent Images, targets cyber-     stalkers seeking sex with children, and traffickers in child      pornography. As one agent here says, ``Business is good--     unfortunately.'' Criminal sexual activity on the Internet is      a growth industry.       In many homes, children are the most competent computer      users. They are as comfortable on the Internet as their      parents are on the telephone. On the Web, children can be pen      pals with the entire world, instantly and at minimal cost.      But the world contains many bad people. Parents should take      seriously a cartoon that shows two dogs working on computers.      One says to the other, ``When you're online, no one knows      you're a dog.''       A child does not know if the person with whom he or she is      chatting is another child or a much older person with      sinister intentions. The typical person that the agents call      a ``traveler''--someone who will cross state lines hoping to      have a sexual encounter with a child--is a white male age 25-     45. He has above-average education--often an advanced degree,      and he can find his way around the Internet--and above-     average income, enabling him to travel. Many ``travelers''      are married.       But these cyber-stalkers do not know if the person with      whom they are chatting is really, as they think, a young boy      or girl, or an FBI agent. Some ``travelers'' who thought they      had arranged meetings with children have been unpleasantly      surprised, arrested, tried and jailed.       Since the first arrest under Innocent Images in 1995, there      have been 487 arrests of ``travelers'' and pornographers, and      409 convictions. Most of the 78 nonconvictions are in cases      still pending. The conviction rate is above 95 percent.      However, the FBI is distressed by light sentences from some      judges who justify their leniency by the fact that the      offenders are socially upscale and first offenders.      (Actually, probably not: How likely is it that they get      caught the first time they become predators?) Lenient judges      also call the crime ``victimless'' because it is an FBI      agent, not a child, receiving the offender's attention.       Agents are trained to avoid entrapment, and predators      usually initiate talk about sexual encounters. But children      implicitly raise the subject by visiting such chat rooms.      Most children recoil when sexual importunings become overt.      (``When you come to meet me, make sure you're not wearing any      underwear.'') But some importunings, including gifts and      sympathetic conversation about the problems of children, are      cunning, subtle and effective.       Publicity about Innocent Images may deter some predators,      but most are driven to risk-taking by obsessions. America      Online and other service providers look for suspect chat      rooms and close those they spot, but they exist in such      rapidly changing profusion that there are always many      menacing ones open.       Digital cameras, and the plunging price of computer storage      capacity for downloaded photographs, have made this, so to      speak, the golden age of child pornography. The fact that the      mere possession of it is a crime does not deter people from      finding, in the blizzard of Internet activities, like-minded      people to whom they say things like, ``I'm interested in      pictures of boys 6 to 8 having sex with adults.''       A booklet available from any FBI office, ``A Parent's Guide      to Internet Safety,'' lists signs that a child might be at      risk online. These include the child's being online for      protracted periods, particularly at night. Being online like      that is the unenviable duty of FBI agents running Innocent      Images.       Each of the FBI's 56 field offices has an officer trained      to seek cyber-stalkers and traffickers in child pornography.      Ten offices have Innocent Images operations. Agents assigned      to Innocent Images can spend as many as 10 hours a day      monitoring the sexual sewer that is a significant part of the      ``information superhighway.'' So the FBI looks for      ``reluctant volunteers'' who, while working, are given      psychological tests to see that they are not becoming      ``damaged goods.'' Whatever these agents are being paid, they      are underpaid.                          ____________________
