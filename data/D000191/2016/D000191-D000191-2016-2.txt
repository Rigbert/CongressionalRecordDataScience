Speaker, I yield 1 minute to the gentlewoman from Connecticut (Ms. DeLauro).  Ms. DeLAURO. Mr. Speaker, I rise to engage the chairman and ranking member in a brief colloquy on behalf of the Connecticut congressional delegation and Long Island Sound.  The sound is a treasured and integral source, one that generates $9 billion annually through tourism, recreation, and economic activity, so the importance of dredging activities to our State and the larger region cannot be overstated.  Therefore, we seek clarification with the constant intent of section 1189 and the dredging provisions contained in the WIIN Act.  I yield to the gentleman from Connecticut (Mr. Courtney).
