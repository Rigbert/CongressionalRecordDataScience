Speaker, for over 40 years, the Congressional Black Caucus has strengthened and enhanced the work of the people's House. It does so by carrying into this Chamber the voices of millions of Americans who, for too long in our history, were voiceless. It represents millions of our citizens who contribute greatly to building our economy, defending our hard-won freedoms, and fighting for equal justice and equal opportunity for all of our citizens. The Congressional Black Caucus has been rightly known for a long period of time as the conscience of the Congress.  Mr. Speaker, since he arrived here 7 years ago, our colleague and my friend, Emanuel Cleaver, has been the conscience of the CBC. Representative Cleaver, as most of us who served with him know, but many Americans might not know, wears multiple hats. He is not only the former mayor of Kansas City, Missouri, but he is also an ordained Methodist pastor. Pastor Cleaver is frequently called upon for words to deliver at my whip meeting on Thursday mornings. I have said that they are the highlight of our week in many respects.  Emanuel Cleaver speaks to us about humanity, about caring, about respecting each of our colleagues on either side of the aisle, of respecting and honoring our responsibilities to our fellow citizens. In short, Emanuel Cleaver, on a weekly basis, appeals to the best that is within us to reflect the best that is America.  Emanuel Cleaver will shortly be succeeded as president of the CBC by Marcia Fudge from Ohio--like Emanuel Cleaver, a leader of conscience, a leader of great ability, and a leader who will reach out to all of us as well and continue to lead this organization that we know as the conscience of the Congress.  As we talk about creating jobs, as we talk about caring for one another, as we talk about making life better for all Americans, there is no more compelling voice than the Congressional Black Caucus towards that end. There has been no more compelling voice than that of my friend, Emanuel Cleaver.  Emanuel, I expect your leadership to be enhanced as the days go by. You have shown us an example of how one can serve with dignity, with grace, and with effectiveness. Thank you.  Mr. Speaker, for over forty years, the Congressional Black Caucus has strengthened and enhanced the work of the people's house.  It does so by carrying into this Chamber the voices of millions of Americans who for too long in our history were denied a voice.  It represents millions of our citizens who contribute greatly to building our economy, defending our hard-won freedoms, and fighting for equal justice and equal opportunity for all.  The Congressional Black Caucus has long been the conscience of the Congress. And since he arrived here seven years ago, Emanuel Cleaver has been the conscience of the CBC.  Rep. Cleaver--as most of us who serve with him know, but many Americans might not know--wears multiple hats, also being an ordained Methodist pastor.  Pastor Cleaver is frequently called upon to deliver words of wisdom in the weekly meetings Democrats hold for our caucus, and he uses those opportunities to tell us parables intended to teach that behind every bill and every vote is a human story--real lives and real consequences.  Though he will be stepping down as its Chair, I know Rep. Cleaver will continue to do his part to ensure the CBC retains its position as a moral guide in this House.  That we never forget the real people behind the policies we act on here--people struggling to be safe in our cities, pursue educational opportunities, access health care, and find good jobs.  The CBC may be called, in many respects, guardians of our American dream.  And I thank my friend--Rep. Cleaver, Mayor Cleaver, Pastor Cleaver, Chairman Cleaver--for being a steady captain of that guard over the past two years.  He surely leaves large shoes to fill, but I know Rep. Fudge will do a great job at the helm as the CBC's new chair.  And I look forward to working as closely with her as I have with Rep. Cleaver to help extend the promise of the American dream to all our people.                          ____________________
