I am particularly interested. Senator Hatch and I were able to do this a number of years ago for the community health centers that were being priced out of their malpractice coverage. We were able to come up with a solution that has made it possible for thousands and thousands of poor people across the country to get their care and have these clinics covered without extra cost to the taxpayers, simply by working in a bipartisan way. My sense is to get out beyond the blame game, saying it is this interest group's fault or that interest group's fault, and to try to find some common ground here between Democrats and Republicans so we can really deal with a problem that is affecting many of our physicians and affecting our vulnerable patients. My understanding is my colleague from Illinois is open to that kind of bipartisan approach and may even have some ideas he will offer this week.  I wanted to come to the floor because I think this is a real problem. I so often go to meetings and one group says it is the insurance companies' fault and the other group says it is the trial lawyers' fault. I have heard the distinguished Senator from Illinois say he wants to get beyond that and find a solution to a real problem. Perhaps he could address that in whatever time is remaining.
