Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.  I want to thank all of the Members who have participated in this debate, and more importantly, note the work that they did to bring this legislation to fruition.  Let me also point out that the modest sanctions that are in the Trafficking Victims Protection Act have yielded significant new laws throughout the world. In 2004 alone, 39 countries enacted new laws or strengthened existing laws. We know when we put some carrots and sticks, the sticks being the possibility of losing nonhumanitarian foreign aid, security aid for example, and then when we place countries in a ranking system that makes determinations concerning a country's achievement in meeting ``minimum standards''--tier 1, tier 2, tier 3, and tier 3 being the egregious violators with a new watch list, we get their attention. Many countries have taken action and today we work in a partnership to try to end trafficking.  After drugs and weapons, trafficking in human persons is the biggest moneymaker for organized crime. The ILO suggested in a June study approximately $32 billion a year goes into the coffers of those who are committing such nefarious crimes against innocent individuals.  Finally, I would just say we have in this legislation a provision--a study--that seeks to find whether or not there is a nexus between terrorism and trafficking.                              {time}  1800  With that kind of money flowing into trafficking enterprises, these horrific enterprises, we tend to think that there probably is a link with terrorism. We do not know. We want to find out.
