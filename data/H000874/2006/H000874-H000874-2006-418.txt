Leader, I hope that is accurate. I understand that in any conference, the chairman of the conference ought to take the position that unless all things are agreed to the conference is not closed on other issues that might have been tentatively agreed to. But if, frankly, our side of the aisle is not included, does not have the opportunity to put our input into the issues, very frankly, too often, I have been here a long time. You are right, and I have been in a lot of conferences. And those have been real conferences. They have not been conferences that one side has agreed on, comes to the conference and says it's done.  The leader looks at me somewhat disparagingly or at least incredulously that there haven't been such conferences that occurred prior to the leadership of the Republican Party. I understand what he is saying, but this is a pattern, Mr. Leader. We have talked about it on a regular basis. And it is not good for this institution.
