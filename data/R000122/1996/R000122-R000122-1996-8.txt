Speaker, I thank the gentleman from Pennsylvania, and reclaiming my time once again, I do want to commend him for his leadership on the committee and to commend all of my colleagues on the committee, both the members of the minority and majority parties and the staffs who have done an excellent job. I, too, second the chairman's determination that this has been a committee I think marked by collegiality and cooperation, and at times when we did disagree it was done based upon principle, in a very civil and constructive manner, and I thank the chairman for that atmosphere that he has created.  I have no more speakers, Mr. Speaker, and I would reserve the balance of my time pending other comments by the gentleman from Pennsylvania.
