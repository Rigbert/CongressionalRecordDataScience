 President, I am pleased that the Senate has passed House Joint Resolutions 91 and 92 granting the consent of Congress to the Alabama-Coosa-Tallapoosa [ACT] and the Apalachicola-Chattahoochee-Flint [ACF] River Basin Compacts. I would like to thank the majority leader, his staff, and my colleagues from Alabama, Georgia, and Florida for their efforts and leadership in moving these valuable bills.  With the passage of these compacts, the three States now may move forward and begin the difficult task of allocating water resources throughout the region. The compacts set forth the framework for the three States to resolve the critical issue of how our scarce water resources are divided. This partnership will enable the States to determine the best utilization of our shared water supply. These rivers are an invaluable resource to our States--essential to Alabama's economic and personal well-being.  I look forward to continuing to work with Gov. Fob James and the Alabama delegation to assure that Alabama's water needs are met today and in the future.                          ____________________
