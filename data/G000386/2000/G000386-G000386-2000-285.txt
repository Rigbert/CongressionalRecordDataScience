 President, I yield myself 1 minute. And if somebody else wants the remaining 2 minutes, I would be glad to yield it.  I take this opportunity, just before the cloture votes, to clear up a couple things. First of all, the Senator from North Dakota is a very good friend of mine. I work very closely with him. I do not dispute what he said. But I do want to clarify his reaction to my saying that taxes are as high as they have ever been in the history of our country.  The Senator made the point that taxes have gone down for many taxpayers. Of course, that is true. He concentrated on middle-income taxpayers. But it is mostly true because of the tax credit for children that the Republicans promoted and passed in the 1997 tax bill. For a family with two kids, for instance, that means $1,000 that Republicans provided, or about $25 billion a year.  But despite the protests of the Senator from North Dakota, I still stand by my comments that the overall percentage of taxation is at a historical high of near 21 percent of GDP.  Then in response to Senator Robb's comments on the Medicare reserve, it is my understanding that $40 billion was reserved for Medicare and prescription drugs in the conference report. I hope and think that the Senator from Virginia is incorrect.  I yield my remaining time to the Senator from Kansas.
