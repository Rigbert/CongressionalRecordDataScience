 President, reserving the right to object, and I will not object, I would hope to get the majority leader to amend his unanimous consent request. I notified him through floor staff that it would be my hope we could modify the unanimous consent request and not only pass the Wounded Warrior provision, which was regretfully taken down along with the Defense authorization bill last week, but modify that to include the language of section 601 of the Defense authorization bill, which would provide for an increase in military basic pay of all of our uniformed military personnel. So if the majority leader would modify his consent agreement as I have suggested, the bill, in effect, that we would be passing would be Wounded Warrior, plus the military pay raise. That would be my suggestion to the majority leader.  I am not going to object to his unanimous-consent agreement. I agree with him that the Wounded Warrior provisions are extremely important. I was disappointed it was taken down along with the Defense authorization bill last week, but I would respectfully suggest that it be modified to include the pay raise as well.
