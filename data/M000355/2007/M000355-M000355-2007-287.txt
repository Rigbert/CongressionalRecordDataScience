 President, I would add with regard to the appropriations bills, as the majority leader knows, I have said both publicly and to him privately, it is my preference to pass each of the bills. We are running considerably behind the House. We have got a long way to go, but I think there will be a lot of cooperation on our side in trying to get the appropriations bills signed and get them down to the President. We have a recent history of malfunction on both sides. Last year when the majority was in my party, we failed to pass 11 out of 13 appropriations bills. In 2002, when the Democrats were in the majority, they did the same thing. So there is ample opportunity to point fingers at both sides for not completing the appropriations process as we should. But I would predict to the majority leader there will be a great deal of cooperation on our side in getting through that, moving as rapidly as possible so we can function as we should.                          ____________________
