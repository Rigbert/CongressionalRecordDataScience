 President, I rise today as our Nation celebrates the 55th Presidential Inauguration to pay tribute to Mr. Dave Disponett, a fellow Kentuckian who is in Washington, DC to attend his sixth inauguration.  Dave is a dedicated member of the Republican Party--a man I am glad to have on my team. He has been a witness to history with the swearing in of President Richard Nixon in 1969, President Ronald Reagan in 1981 and 1985, President George H.W. Bush in 1989, President George W. Bush in 2001 and again today, January 20, 2005.  Dave is in the Nation's capita1 today with his wife, daughter, son-in-law and 10-year old granddaughter--who is already following in her grandfather's footsteps by attending her second Presidential Inauguration.  Earlier this week USA Today published a story about Dave and his family, ``Kentucky Family Hears Inaugural Call.'' I ask unanimous consent that the full article be included in the Congressional Record.  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in the Record, as follows:                   [From USA Today, January 17, 2005]                  Kentucky Family Hears Inaugural Call                           (By Bill Nichols)       Lawrenceburg, Ky.--When Franklin Roosevelt was sworn in as      president for the third time in 1941 under the shadow of      potential U.S. entry into world war, the program read:      ``Inaugurals take their drama from the temper of the times.''       Dave Disponett, a builder and passionate Republican      activist in this traditionally Democratic city of just under      10,000, agrees.       On Thursday, when President Bush takes the oath of office      for a second term, Disponett, 69, will attend his sixth      inauguration with his wife, daughter, son-in-law and 10-year-     old granddaughter--who is on inauguration No. 2.       The Disponett clan, like thousands of other visitors who      are descending on Washington, are bracing for a very      different inauguration this year. ``I imagine there are going      to be lines everywhere, but what can you do?'' Disponett      says. It is the nation's first since the Sept. 11 attacks,      and extraordinary security precautions are in place.       But as demonstrated by the treasure trove of inaugural      memories and memorabilia--ball tickets, programs and      photographs--that Disponett has saved, this mix of pageantry      and politics always manages, for good or bad, to reflect the      mood of the nation. Spectators seem to come for a party but      end up with a little piece of time.       In 1969, Disponett watched friends climb a light pole on a      Washington street to avoid Vietnam protesters who had      thronged to Richard Nixon's inauguration. The trip marked      Disponett's first time on an airplane; he was 33.       Twelve years later, he was moved to tears as crowds      listened to transistor radios to hear news of the release of      the U.S. hostages in Iran as Ronald Reagan was sworn in 1981.       ``That was the most exciting day of my life,'' Disponett      remembers. His daughter Lois Ann, 47, who attended her first      inauguration at the age of 10, says the experiences she had      were almost impossible to explain to her schoolmates back in      Lawrenceburg. ``Most people couldn't grasp it,'' she says of      the celebrities and dazzling gowns. ``It was just a world      totally beyond their comprehension.'' She felt, she says,      like a real-life Cinderella.                           Security concerns       Inaugural historian Jerry Wallace, retired from the      National Archives, points out that heightened security for      the ceremony is not new. Both of Abraham Lincoln's      inaugurations found troops on Washington's streets, and the      1861 event was held under threat of assassination. Woodrow      Wilson's 1917 inauguration, held as the United States      considered entering the First World War, also was marked by a      show of force.       Wallace worries, however, that precautions for this year's      event could dampen the ability of average Americans to enjoy      the day.       At least 6,000 police officers--some of them heavily      armed--will patrol Washington's streets, searching ticket      holders and onlookers as F-16s, F-15s and military      helicopters patrol the skies.       ``I find all this security just very oppressive,'' Wallace      says. ``The whole dynamic behind an inaugural is not to be      exclusive at all.''       Charlie Brotman, a 77-year-old Washington public relations      executive who has been the Inaugural Parade announcer for the      past 48 years, says security for the presidential viewing      stands on the stretch of Pennsylvania Avenue in front of the      White House will be tighter than any he has experienced.      Brotman believes, however, that earlier stretches of the      parade will still be quite accessible to the public.       Phyllis Clark, school services coordinator for Flowing      Wells School District in Tucson, will be bringing several      dozen eighth-graders to the inauguration for the second time.      She worries that her kids won't be able to tour the White      House because of the security. ``This year I told the kids      that I really don't think we'll get to go in,'' she says.       But Clark also says the event is also an opportunity to      show young people that they have to live their lives to the      fullest, even in an age of terrorism. ``We'll still go. And      if something happens, we'll look after each other and take      care of each other,'' Clark says. ``We can't be so afraid      that we don't go anywhere.''                        Not giving in to terror       The Disponetts couldn't agree more. Last week, they were      busy preparing for their trip to Washington. Ten-year-old      Anna-Marie, the daughter of Lois Ann Disponett and husband      Todd Hyatt, recently found her coveted $80 ball gown on sale      for $20 at a Louisville department store.       Dave Disponett's rising influence as a GOP activist and      fundraiser in Kentucky has given his family increasingly      better inaugural access since their first trip in 1969, which      Dave and his wife, Brenda, believe was their first trip      outside Kentucky. Campaign finance records show Disponett      gave $2,000 to the Bush re-election campaign last year, while      Brenda gave $2,750 to the National Federation of Republican      women.       Disponett's life as a Republican began in 1953, when he      went to register to vote and was told by an Anderson County      clerk that there was no point in registering as a Republican      since no Republican candidates could get elected in      Lawrenceburg. That struck Disponett as not exactly in the      democratic spirit, so he registered Republican. In 1967, he      helped elect Louis Nunn as Kentucky's first Republican      governor in 24 years. That began Disponett's side career as a      Republican Party power broker, which facilitated his family's      ritual of watching a president get sworn in.                             Rich memories       That first year, in 1969, the Disponetts didn't to      Inaugural Balls, because, they recall, they couldn't afford      the $100 tickets. They were also fairly dazzled by the      Washington scene.       The family didn't go attend Nixon's second-term      inauguration in 1973 because of financial reasons, but headed      back in 1981 for Reagan's first inauguration. They remember      the excitement of the crowd when the 52 U.S. hostages were      released by Iran, and that the National Christmas Tree--kept      dark because of the hostage crisis--was turned on at last.      ``I get goose bumps just thinking about it,'' Lois Ann says.       By 1981, Dave Disponett also was on his way to becoming a      GOP insider. He has a signed photograph of Reagan from the      occasion, on the back of which is a note from the late Lee      Atwater, Reagan's political director. In 1985, the Disponetts      were connected enough to have been invited to attend balls,      though Lois Ann says she was surprised that they were so      crowded and featured so little dancing. From George H.W.      Bush's inauguration in 1989, Dave Disponett proudly shows      an unopened commemorative bottle of Korbel champagne,      which he bought for $25. After eight years of Democratic      rule, the family returned to their inaugural haunts in      2001, where they had the pick of events because Sen. Mitch      McConnell, a Kentucky Republican, was a key inaugural      organizer.       That year also marked Anna-Marie's inaugural debut. And      while she fell asleep in her father's arms during President      Bush's inaugural address, the experience does seem to     have had an effect. She recently asked her grandfather how      old he would be in 2030, when she will be 35 and old enough      to run for governor in Kentucky. Dave Disponett now says he      has a compelling reason to live to be 94.       Charlie Brotman, the Inaugural Parade announcer, says that      despite the security and exclusivity now associated with      inaugurations, the event remains a moment of national      ceremony that touches even the most cynical Americans.      ``Fathers and mothers tell me they want to take their      children, so their kids can tell their kids that they were      there. It's all about the memories.''       For the Disponetts, it certainly is. Their job now is to      try to keep Anna-Marie from becoming too nonchalant about      going to the inaugurations. When her mother told her recently      that this year, she'll actually get to dance at a ball, Anna-     Marie answered, ``Well, what else would you do?''                          ____________________[Pages S98-S99]From the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]                       TRIBUTE TO DAVE DISPONETT  Mr. McCONNELL.
