Con. Res. 37       Whereas Iraq continues to experience a self-sustaining      cycle of sectarian violence;       Whereas the ongoing sectarian violence presents a threat to      regional and world peace, and the long-term security      interests of the United States are best served by an Iraq      that is stable, not a haven for terrorists, and not a threat      to its neighbors;       Whereas Iraqis must reach a comprehensive and sustainable      political settlement in order to achieve stability, and the      failure of the Iraqis to reach such a settlement is a primary      cause of increasing violence in Iraq;       Whereas the Key Judgments of the January 2007 National      Intelligence Estimate entitled ``Prospects for Iraq's      Stability: A Challenging Road Ahead'' state, ``A number of     identifiable developments could help to reverse the negative      trends driving Iraq's current trajectory. They include:      Broader Sunni acceptance of the current political structure      and federalism to begin to reduce one of the major sources of      Iraq's instability. . . Significant concessions by Shia and      Kurds to create space for Sunni acceptance of federalism'';       Whereas Article One of the Constitution of Iraq declares      Iraq to be a ``single, independent federal state;''       Whereas Section Five of the Constitution of Iraq declares      that the ``federal system in the Republic of Iraq is made up      of a decentralized capital, regions, and governorates, and      local administrations'' and enumerates the expansive powers      of regions and the limited powers of the central government      and establishes the mechanisms for the creation of new      federal regions;       Whereas the federal system created by the Constitution of      Iraq would give Iraqis local control over their police and      certain laws, including those related to employment,      education, religion, and marriage;       Whereas the Constitution of Iraq recognizes the      administrative role of the Kurdistan Regional Government in 3      northern Iraqi provinces, known also as the Kurdistan Region;       Whereas the Kurdistan region, recognized by the      Constitution of Iraq, is largely stable and peaceful;       Whereas the Iraqi Parliament approved a federalism law on      October 11th, 2006, which establishes procedures for the      creation of new federal regions and will go into effect 18      months after approval;       Whereas Iraqis recognize Baghdad as the capital of Iraq,      and the Constitution of Iraq stipulates that Baghdad may not      merge with any federal region;       Whereas, despite their differences, Iraq's sectarian and      ethnic groups support the unity and territorial integrity of      Iraq; and       Whereas Iraqi Prime Minister Nouri al-Maliki stated on      November 27, 2006, ``The crisis is political, and the ones      who can stop the cycle of aggravation and bloodletting of      innocents are the politicians'': Now, therefore, be it       Resolved by the Senate (the House of Representatives      concurring), That it is the sense of Congress that--       (1) the United States should actively support a political      settlement among Iraq's major factions based upon the      provisions of the Constitution of Iraq that create a federal      system of government and allow for the creation of federal      regions;       (2) the active support referenced in paragraph (1) above      should include--       (A) calling on the international community, including      countries with troops in Iraq, the permanent 5 members of the      United Nations Security Council, members of the Gulf      Cooperation Council, and Iraq's neighbors--       (i) to support an Iraqi political settlement based on      federalism;       (ii) to acknowledge the sovereignty and territorial      integrity of Iraq; and       (iii) to fulfill commitments for the urgent delivery of      significant assistance and debt relief to Iraq, especially      those made by the member states of the Gulf Cooperation      Council;       (B) further calling on Iraq's neighbors to pledge not to      intervene in or destabilize Iraq and to agree to related      verification mechanisms; and       (C) convening a conference for Iraqis to reach an agreement      on a comprehensive political settlement based on the creation      of federal regions within a united Iraq;       (3) the United States should urge the Government of Iraq to      quickly agree upon and implement a law providing for the      equitable distribution of oil revenues, which is a critical      component of a comprehensive political settlement based upon      federalism; and       (4) the steps described in paragraphs (1), (2), and (3)      above could lead to an Iraq that is stable, not a haven for      terrorists, and not a threat to its neighbors.
