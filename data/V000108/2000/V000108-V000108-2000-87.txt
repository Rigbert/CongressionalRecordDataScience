Chairman, I thank the gentleman for yielding time to me. I strongly rise in support of the Hinchey amendment.  Mr. Chairman, the concern I have is that we are seeking knowledge and seeking better ways to do clean-ups with the National Academy studies. On the other hand, we have existing technologies and we have problems that are endangering people's health today.  I think we ought to use the knowledge and technology that is available today to help our fellow citizens in cleaning up these waterways while we continue to seek better ways to do so. I am very concerned about the potential delay.  I have a similar situation in my own district that has been studied for 24years. One of the elements we have incorporated in the project cooperative agreement is a review every 5 years so we can incorporate new technologies as they come online, but I think it would be a mistake today to delay improvements in cleaning up our waterways that today endanger people's health.
