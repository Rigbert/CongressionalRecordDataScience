 President, lately, there has been a lot of talk about Chief Justice Rehnquist's ``Year End Report on the Federal Judiciary.'' As chairman of the Sucommittee on Administrative Oversight and the Courts, I have an added interest in what the Chief Justice has to say. According to some, the Chief Justice's report indicates that the federal judiciary suffers from a partisan produced ``vacancy crisis.'' Indeed, some critics have gone so far as to feverishly conclude that the Senate's Constitutionally mandated confirmation process has become an ``obstruction of justice.'' Caught up in this frenzy, some Democrats have come to the Senate Floor blaming many, if not all, of the judiciary's problems on vacancies. Vacancies, however, are not the source of the problem.  Despite assertions to the contrary, the Chief Justice could not have been more clear on this point: Vacancies are the consequence of what he perceives to be an overburdened judiciary. In fact, the Chief Justice pointed out that it is the judiciary's increased size and expanded jurisdiction that is the major threat to justice in the United States. In his Report, Chief Justice Rehnquist warned that the federal judiciary had become ``so large'' that it was losing ``its traditional character as a distinctive judicial forum of limited jurisdiction.''  Mr. President, in addition to what the Chief Justice said about the size of the judiciary has become ``so large'' that it was losing ``its traditional character as a distinctive judicial forum of limited jurisdiction,'' I ask unanimous consent to have printed in the Record an article by Chief Judge Harvie Wilkinson III of our Circuit Court of Appeals entitled ``We Don't Need More Federal Judges.''  There being no objection, the article was ordered to be printed in the Record, as follows:              [From the Wall Street Journal, Feb. 9, 1998]                   We Don't Need More Federal Judges                      (By J. Harvie Wilkinson III)       The tune is so familiar that most federal court watchers      can whistle it in their sleep. Add more and more judges to      the federal bench, goes the refrain, and all will be well.       Well, Congress has been adding judges for years now, and      somehow each new addition never seems to be enough. The trend      has been dramatic. At midcentury, the number of authorized      federal judgeships stood at approximately 280. Today, the      number of authorized judgeships is 846. And the process shows      no signs of abating. The Judicial Conference of the U.S. has      asked Congress for 17 additional judgeships for the 13      circuits on the U.S. Court of Appeals--12 permanent      judgeships and five ``temporaries.'' Under the conference's      proposal, the Ninth Circuit alone would increase to 37      judgeships from the already unwieldy 28.       The federal judiciary is caught in a spiral of expansion      that must stop. With growth in judgeships comes growth in      federal jurisdiction. And with the expansion of federal      jurisdiction comes the need for additional federal judges to      keep pace. Whether the growth in judges precedes the growth      in jurisdiction or vice versa is anybody's guess. The one      follows the other as the night follows the day.       The process of growth has not been a carefully examined      one. Rather, it is fueled by a mechanical formula that      presupposes that every increase in case filings must be met      not with judicial efficiencies or jurisdictional restrictions      but with additional battalions of judges. The Judicial      Conference has come up with a benchmark of 500 filings per      three-judge panel for requesting an additional judgeship on      the appellate courts.       Nobody knows precisely what is the basis for the 500 figure      except that it is a nice round number; not so long ago the      magic unit was 255. While the figure is intended to be used      in conjunction with other assessments, it remains the major      factor and the one on which a request for additional      judgeships is presumptively justified.       To be sure, there are some hard-pressed courts where the      workload makes it imperative that new judges come on board.      But adding judges to the federal courts is no long-range      answer. In fact, the consequences of this silent revolution      in the size of the judiciary could not be more serious.       Growth in the federal judiciary has three main costs. The      first is that of simple inefficiency. Large circuit courts of      appeals present problems that small ones don't have. There      are more internal conflicts in circuit law. These must be      resolved by more en banc hearings of the full court. If the      en banc court consists, for example, of 20 judges as opposed      to 12 it takes twice the time even to get the decision out.      Judges on a large court     must also spend more time simply keeping abreast of the work      of other panels--time that cannot be spent resolving their      own cases.       The second cost is that of litigiousness. With a smaller      court of appeals, the possible panel combinations of three      judges are less numerous and the law is more coherent. Legal      principles are discernible and judicial outcomes are      predictable. As a court grows, so do the possible panel      combinations, and the law becomes fuzzier and less distinct.      Litigation takes on the properties of a game of chance and      litigants are encouraged to come to court for their roll of      the dice. When legal outcomes are uncertain, cases are      brought for their settlement value and parties lack clear      guideposts for their conduct out of court.       The third cost of judicial growth is that of intrusiveness.      The number of life-tenured federal judges now exceeds the      membership of Congress. The outpouring of federal law from      this expanding establishment touches every local issue and      affects every public official. Local disputes are tossed into      federal court on the assumption that there will always be      plenty of federal judges around to resolve them. In the end,      unrestricted growth in the federal judiciary threatens to      upset the federal-state balance just as much as uncontrolled      growth in the federal budget would. With more federal judges      will come more federal rulings, and with more federal rulings      will come more opportunities for federal judicial      intervention into even the smallest of controversies in our      classrooms, our workplaces, our prisons, our zoning boards,      our city council chambers and the like.       Congress must preserve an independent judiciary without      sanctioning an intrusive one. It can strike this balance by      imposing a ceiling on judicial growth and setting limits      beyond which the size of the federal judiciary may not      expand. A numerical cap would strike a historical blow for      limited government. But it would have other advantages also.      It would allow each party to fill judicial vacancies but only      up to the point of the numerical limit. A cap would force      Congress to think about what is, and what is not, the proper      business of the federal courts.       As for the judiciary, a cap would force courts to adopt      innovative management techniques. In the Fourth Circuit, we      have established a sophisticated tracking system that      requires straightforward appeals to be resolved promptly and      inexpensively. This step would not have been taken if we had      assumed that the addition of new judges was the solution to      our problems.       The alternative to a cap is a federal judiciary that, at      the current pace of growth, will number more than 2,000 well      before the middle of the next century. Judge Jon Newman, a      Carter appointee to the Second Circuit, and Judge Robert      Parker, a Clinton appointee to the Fifth Circuit, have spoken      eloquently of the threat that judicial growth poses to the      collegial functioning of appellate courts, to the stability      of legal precedent and to the historic regional      characteristics of the federal judicial system. Indeed, if      the courts of appeals become much larger, the temptation will      be to break them up into smaller and more parochial units.      With this development, we shall have surrendered a national      and regional perspective on American law.       I have heard it said that those who favor a cap on growth      are nothing more than elitists supporting a small and      exclusive club. The truth is just the opposite. The real      elitists are those who would deprive the American people of      the right to determine their own destiny and would lodge      their collective fate in an overgrown federal judicial      establishment. Federal courts play an important role in the      protection of a uniform law and our fundamental liberties.      But with unrestricted growth it will become an all-important      role. I cannot imagine a more unhealthy development for our      society.
