 Speaker, I thank the gentleman for yielding me this time.  Mr. Speaker, when we talk about welfare reform, I would hope that we would include in that discussion many of the largest corporations in this country who rip off tens of billions of dollars from taxpayers every year in subsidies, loan guaranties and tax breaks, while then moving their factories and bank accounts to China, Mexico or Bermuda.  But that is not what we are talking about today. Today, we are talking about low-income women and children. We are talking about a severe crisis in child care that leaves millions of American families unable to afford quality child care or, in some cases,any child care they can afford. We are talking about child care workers who are grossly underpaid, who are undertrained, and who experience a huge turnover rate to the detriment of American babies. Today, we are talking about a child care situation that is a disgrace and a shame to this Nation, and I want anyone over there to deny that reality.  And how have our Republican friends responded to that situation? In real, inflation-accounted-for dollars, the President has actually cut funding for child care, while the House Republicans have offered a proposal that is totally inadequate. They have provided hundreds of billions of dollars in tax breaks for the richest people in this country, but pennies for babies and for the kids who are the future of America.  I urge a strong no vote on the Republican proposal.
