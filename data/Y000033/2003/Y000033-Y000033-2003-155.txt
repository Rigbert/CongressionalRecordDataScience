Mr. Speaker, I rise today to introduce amendments to the Indian Health Care Improvement Act. I am pleased to be joined in the co-sponsorship of this measure by both Republican and Democratic members of the U.S. House of Representatives.  The Indian Health Care Improvement Act (IHCIA) became Public Law 94-437 in the 94th Congress (September 30, 1976), and was amended by:  P.L. 96-537--December 17, 1980;  P.L. 100-579--October 31, 1988;  P.L. 100-690--November 18, 1988;  P.L. 100-713--November 23, 1988;  P.L. 101-630--November 28, 1990;  P.L. 102-573--October 29, 1992; and  P.L. 104-313--October 19, 1996.  The purpose of the Act is to implement the Federal responsibility for the care and education of the Indian people by improving the services and facilities of Federal Indian health programs and encouraging the maximum participation of American Indians and Alaska Natives in such programs, and other purposes.  The IHCIA provides for health care delivery to over 2 million American Indians and Alaska Natives. Congress enacted a one-year extension to extend the life of the Act through FY 2001 but efforts at further extensions were interrupted due to 9/11/01 events. Appropriations for Indian health have continued through authorization of the Snyder Act, a permanent law authorizing expenditures of funds for a variety of Indian programs, including health. For FY 2003, Congress appropriated $2.9 billion to help provide health care services to American Indians and Alaska Natives. The IHCIA requires Reauthorization this year.  Since 1998, the Indian Health Service (IHS) started the reauthorization process under the IHS's Tribal Consultation Policy by conveyinga Roundtable to begin the discussion of the reauthorization and to give guidance to the consultation process which included all stakeholders, I/T/U (Indian Health Service/Tribes/Urban).  Coordinators from the 12 IHS areas formed workgroups of I/T/U and National Indian Health Board (NIHB) representatives. These meetings were to inform the I/T/U's about the reauthorization process, and provide opportunities to discuss and reach consensus on recommendations for the Act.  Four regional consultation meetings were held to provide further opportunities for I/T/U's to provide input, share recommendations from the 12 IHS Areas, and build consensus among participants for a unified position. The final report entitled ``Speaking with One Voice'' identified areas of consensus and differences.  The IHS Director convened a National Steering Committee (NSC) to be responsible for the final drafting of the report on the IHCIA recommendations. The NSC is composed of one elected and one alternative tribal representative from each of the 12 IHS Areas, a representative from the National Indian Health Board, National Council of Urban Indian Health, and the Self-Governance Advisory Committee. During the course of the 4 meetings, this group's responsibility evolved from compiling a final report of recommendations to the drafting of the actual IHCIA reauthorization bill language.  During the last year and a half, House Resources Committee, Office of Native American and Insular Affairs Committee staff, Cynthia A. Ahwinona, has traveled to ``American Indian and Alaska Natives country'' to observe the work of the NSC of the tribal leaders comprised to propose IHCIA reauthorization revisions to Congress. The draft bill was drafted by dozens of tribal attorneys and had technical, legal citation errors and, in some instances, was drafted very poorly and did not accomplish what was intended by the NSC.  As consensus was arrived, House Resources Committee and several members of the NSC met with House Legislative Counsel, Lisa Daly, Edward Grossman and Pierre Poisson in person and via teleconference to start the redrafting of the bill. Invited participants included both the Republican and Democratic health staff of the House Resources Committee and the Senate Committee on Indian Affairs, a representative from the National Indian Health Board, representatives of the IHS, and tribal attorneys from the NSC.  I want to personally thank Lisa Daly, Edward Grossman and Pierre Poisson of the House Legislative Counsel, Myra Munson of Sonosky, Chambers, Sachse, Endrieson and Perry, LLP. and Carol Barbero of Hobbs, Straus, Dean and Walker for all their efforts in the drafting of this bill. Thank you all, you have done a wonderful job. Attached is brief summary of each Title of the Indian Health Care Improvement Act Reauthorization of FY 03.      Indian Health Care Improvement Act Reauthorization of FY 03       Section 1. Short Title.       Section 2. Findings. Sets forth the national goal of the      U.S. in providing the quantity and quality of health services      to bring the health status of Indians to the highest possible      level.       Section 3. Declaration of Health Objectives. Sets forth 6      Health Status Objectives to be reached by the year 2010.       Section 4. Definitions. States the definitions of terms      used throughout the Act.                    title i. indian health manpower       The purpose of this title is to increase, to the maximum      extent feasible, the number of American Indians and Alaska      natives entering the health professions. It also seeks to      assure an adequate supply of health professionals to the      Service, Indian tribes, tribal organizations, and urban      Indian organizations involved in the delivery of health care      to American Indians and Alaska natives. This title covers      recruitment, scholarships, extern programs, continuing      education, community health representatives, loan repayment,      advanced training and research, nursing, tribal cultural and      history, inmed, health training, incentives, residency,      community health aide for Alaska, and a University of South      Dakota pilot project.                       title ii. health services       The purpose of this title is to establish programs that      respond to the health needs of American Indians and Alaska      natives. For example, American Indians and Alaska natives      have a disproportionately high rate of diabetes (death rate      for this disease is more than 300% of the rate for the U.S.      population generally), so this title has a specific diabetes      provision. It also includes the Indian Health Care      Improvement Fund through which the Appropriation Acts supply      funds to eliminate health deficiencies and disparities in      resources made available to American Indians and Alaska      Native tribes and communities. This title contains      catastrophic health emergency fund; health promotion and      disease prevention services; diabetes prevention, treatment      and control; hospice feasibility; research; mental health;      managed care feasibility; Arizona, North Dakota, South      Dakota, Trenton and California contract health services      programs; mammography; patient travel; epidemiology; school      health education; Indian youth; psychology; tuberculosis;      environmental and nuclear health hazards and women's health.                         title iii. facilities       The purpose of this title relates to the construction of      health facilities, including hospitals, clinics, and health      stations including necessary staff quarters, and of      sanitation facilities for Indian communities and homes. It      also would require the IHS to annually report on Indian      Health Service/Tribes/Urban (ITU's) needs for inpatient,      outpatient and specialized care facilities, including      renovation of existing facilities. It also would require      newly-constructed/renovated facilities, whenever practicable,      to meet the construction standards of any nationally      recognized accrediting bodies. There is also a provision to      waive the Davis-Bacon when a tribe has its own wage law and      performs the construction project instead of IHS.                  title iv. access to health services       The purpose of this title is to address payments to the IHS      and tribes for services covered by Social Security Act Health      Care programs, and to enable Indian health programs to access      reimbursements from third party collections. This title      states that any payments received by a hospital or skilled      nursing facility of the IHS for services provided to American      Indians and Alaska Natives eligible for benefits under the      Social Security Act Health Care programs will not be      considered in determining appropriations for health care of      American Indians or Alaska Natives.       Requires the Secretary to enter into agreements with      tribes, tribal organizations and urban Indian organizations      to assist them in enrolling qualified Indians in Medicare,      Medicaid and SCHIP (State children's health insurance      program), and to enable tribes to pay premiums for coverage.      Authorizes the Secretary to enter into agreements with I/T/     U's for receipt/processing of Medicaid/Medicare/SCHIP      applications. Condition continuing approval of State Medicaid      plan on taking steps to provide for Medicaid enrollment on      reservations, and to obtain input from tribes in the State on      matters relating to impact of changes in the State plan on      Indian health programs. If tribe/tribal organizations      performs outreach, the agreement may provide for 100%      reimbursement of costs and assures that 100% FMAP (Federal      Medical Assistance Payment) continues to apply to Medicaid      and SCHIP services provided by tribes/tribal organizations      who directly bill for the services they provide. Ensures that      insurance companies must reimburse I/T/U's for the services      they provide. Ensure that managed care plans must reimburse      I/T/U's for the services they provide.       Authorize IHS and tribal programs to receive reimbursement      for all Medicare Part B services and eliminates ambiguity      about Medicaid coverage. Authorizes Federal/State/tribal      agreements for tribal operation of Indian SCHIP programs;      places a Medicare-like rate ceiling on hospital services      purchased under the IHS's Contract Health Service program;      directs the Secretary of HHS to study the Medicare and      Medicaid payment methodology for Indian health programs and      report to Congress; and directs the Secretary to establish a      National Indian Technical Advisory Group to assist the      Secretary in identifying and addressing issues regarding the      health care programs under the Social Security Act (including      medicare, medicaid and SCHIP) that have implications for      Indian Health Programs or Urban Indian Organizations.               title v. health services for urban indians       The purpose of this title is to establish programs in urban      centers to make health services more accessible to Indians      who live in urban areas rather than on reservations or Alaska      Native villages. The Secretary through the IHS is authorized      to enter into contracts or grants to urban Indian      organizations to help these agencies with establishing and      administering health programs which meet the requirements of      the IHCIA and will require evaluations renewals. Authorizes      the establishment of an Office of Urban Indian Health which      shall be responsible for carrying out the provisions of this      title, providing central oversight of the programs and      services authorized under this title and, providing technical      assistance to Urban Indian Organizations. The bill would also      extend FTCA (Federal Tort Claims Act) coverage to urban      Indian organizations (Federal law already extends FTCA      coverage to tribally-operated health programs).                 title vi. organizational improvements       This title addresses the establishment of the IHS as an      agency of the PHS(Public Health Service). It covers the      appointment of the Director of IHS by the President and      confirmed by the Senate. This title also authorizes the      Secretary through the Director of IHS to establish an      automated management information system as well as other      duties as assigned by the Secretary for the IHS. Authorizes      appropriations to carry out this title.                 title vii. behavioral health programs       This title is revised from current law (which only      addresses substance abuse programs) in order to focus on      behavioral health. It combines all substance abuse, mental      health and social service programs in one title and      integrates these programs to enhance performance and      efficiency. The title addresses the responsibilities of the      IHS as outlined by the Memorandum of Agreement pursuant to      the section 402 of the Indian Alcohol and Substance Abuse      Prevention and Treatment Act of 1986. The IHS will     determine the scope of the alcohol and substance abuse among      Indian people; they must assess the existing and needed      resources for prevention of alcohol and substance abuse and      the treatment of Indians affected. Finally, IHS must estimate      the funding necessary to adequately support a program of      prevention of alcohol and substance abuse and treatment of      Indians affected. The IHS will also provide a comprehensive      alcohol and substance abuse prevention and treatment      programs, a rehabilitation and aftercare services, IHS youth      program, and training and community education. In this      section demonstration projects are outlined as well as grants      focusing of Fetal Alcohol Syndrome and Fetal Alcohol effect.      It also expands the authorization to establish inpatient      mental health facilities in each Area. Authorizes funding for      development of innovative community-based behavioral health      services. The requirement of matching funds has been      eliminated here. Allows the Fetal Alcohol Disorder programs      to be funded under the ISDEAA (Indian Self-Determination and      Education Assistance Act). Provides for a program to treat      both the victims and the perpetrator of child sexual abuse.      And, has been expanded to allow Indian Tribes and Tribal      Organizations to obtain funding for behavioral health      research.                        title vii. miscellaneous       The purpose of this title is to address various topics      including the President's reporting of the progress made in      meeting the objectives of this Act to Congress at the time of      submitting the budget. It also applies the Negotiated      Rulemaking Act to the development of IHCIA regulations. Other      provisions require the Secretary to develop a plan of      implementation to submit to Congress; describe the      eligibility of California Indians for IHS services and sets      out the conditions for the issue of Indian health funding as      an entitlement.                 amendments to the social security act       Amendments to the Social Security Act appear at the end of      the bill. These provisions are necessary to reflect a number      of the objectives described above in the Title IV summary.                          ____________________
