I thank him for his comments.                              Rules Change  Madam President, I am going to speak as the ranking member of the Senate rules committee, and I am going to speak in regard to the rules changes that have occurred today.  Under the rules of this body, it takes 67 votes to end debate on a rules change. As a continuing body, our rules carry on from one Congress to the next--or at least they used to--and can only be changed pursuant to these rules. Our rules have always ensured a voice for the minority in this body. Unlike the House, where I served, where a simple majority has the power to impose a rule change at any time, in the Senate the minority has always been protected. Here, the rules protect the minority and cannot be changed without their consent--unless, of course, the majority decides it wants to break the rules to change the rules. I am saddened that is what happened today.  The Washington Post reported the other day that President Obama's approval rating has hit a record low; his disapproval rating has hit a record high--the worst of his Presidency. This is obviously the result of the disastrous rollout of ObamaCare which has caused Americans to question both the President's trustworthiness and his basic competence.  In light of these developments, one would think my colleagues on the other side of the aisle might be reconsidering the wisdom of some of their past decisions. One would hope it would occur to them that maybe it was a mistake to pass the health care reform bill on a straight party-line vote. I am one of the few who voted no in the HELP Committee, no in the Finance Committee, and no on the Senate floor on that Christmas Eve night.  One might expect them to have some doubts about the competence of this administration, as most Americans clearly do on this particular issue especially and on a lot of other regulations; that it would dawn on them that maybe now might be the right time to reassert congressional authority to rein in and redirect the administration--the executive, if you will--and use the power of the Senate to move the administration in a different direction. I am sorry that has not happened. Instead, in the face of the obvious failures of this President and his plummeting approval ratings, the majority has decided it would be a really good idea to give him more power. That is right, the majority thinks our biggest problem is that the President can't do whatever he wants to do and we should change our rules to allow him to do that. That is incredible.  The majority has permanently undermined this body, robbed it of a vital tool to check the untrammeled authority of this or any other President, so this sinking ship of an administration can make whatever appointments it wants. What a tragedy.  In Kansas, when you walk old ghost towns you will see buildings where nothing remains but the facade. Literally the entire building is gone and all that is left is the facade. To prevent that facade from collapsing, you may see beams propping it up.  In recent weeks this administration has been exposed as a facade. It still looks nice at first glance--the slick campaign-style appearances go on as usual--but when you look behind it, you see there is nothing there. It cannot perform the most basic tasks. It cannot even fulfill the responsibilities it has assigned to itself. It is collapsing. So now we, the Senate, are going to prop it up. The U.S. Senate, the world's greatest deliberative body, has been reduced to being a prop. We have reduced ourselves to rubberstamps, forfeiting our historical and constitutional authority to subject Presidential appointments to advice and consent so this administration can do whatever it wants. Again, what a tragedy. Never has so much been given for so little.  We have permanently undermined this body--for what? So this President can appoint a few more judges and stack the DC Circuit Court that oversees the constitutionality of Federal regulations? Yes, ObamaCare regulations, IRS regulations, EPA regulations--all of the regulations that come like a waterfall over basically every economic sector we have. This is unbelievable. What happened today will surely lead to complete control of this institution by the majority. I hope not, but that is what has happened in the past, more especially in the House.  Do not listen to those who would seek to minimize the importance of what has been done. The claim that what they have done is limited--applying only to executive nominations--misses the point. The change itself is less important than the manner in which it was imposed. Once you assume the power to write new rules with a simple majority vote, to ignore the existing rules that require a supermajority to achieve such a change, you have put us on a path that will surely lead to total control of this body by the majority.  Before today, there was only one House of Congress where the majority has total control. Now there are two. We have become the House. By its action today, the majority has ensured that for many years to come, Members will not have any rights beyond those which the majority is willing to grant.  When he was in the minority, our current majority leader recognized this. In his book ``The Good Fight,'' Senator Reid wrote about the battle over the nuclear option back in 2005. This is what he wrote:       Once you opened that Pandora's box, it was just a matter of      time before a Senate leader who couldn't get his way on      something moved to eliminate the filibuster for regular      business as well. And that, simply put, would be the end of      the United States Senate.  I repeat, ``the end of the United States Senate.''  Senator Reid further wrote:       . . . there will come a time when we will all be gone, and      the institutions that we now serve will be run by men and      women not yet living, and those institutions will either      function well because we've taken care of them, or they will      be in disarray and someone else's problem to solve.  He described the nuclear option this way then:       In a fit of partisan furry, they were trying to blow up the      Senate. Senate rules can only be changed by a two-thirds vote      of the Senate, or 67 Senators. The Republicans were going to      do it illegally with a simple majority, or 51 . . . future      generations be damned.  If only today the majority leader had recalled his own words. Instead, by his own hand, he has brought on the end of the Senate as we know it. Instead of taking care of this institution, he will leave it in disarray--future generations be damned.  Our former Parliamentarian Bob Dove and Richard Arenberg, a professor and onetime aide to former majority leader George Mitchell, wrote a book on this subject called ``Defending the Filibuster,'' and this is what they said:       If a 51-vote majority is empowered to rewrite the Senate's      rules, the day will come, as it did in the House of      Representatives, when a majority will construct rules that      give it near absolute control over amendments and debate. And      there is no going back from that. No majority in the House of      Representatives has or ever will voluntarily relinquish that      power in order to give the minority a greater voice in      crafting legislation.  Do not be fooled by those who would try to minimize the impact of what happened today. Again, the rule change itself is less important than the manner in which it was imposed. Now that the majority has decided it can set the rules, there is no limit to what it or any future majority might do in the future. There are no constraints. The majority claims these changes are necessary to make the Senate function. If it decides further changes are needed, it will make them. The minority will have no voice, no say, no power. That has never been the case in the Senate--never. Until now.  It saddens me that we have come to this point. It saddens me that the Members on the other side of the aisle who should know better have taken this course. We have done permanent damage to this institution and set a precedent that will surely allow future majorities to further restrict the rights of the minority. That is not a threat; it is just a fact. We have weakened thisbody permanently, undermined it, for the sake of an incompetent administration. What a tragedy.  This is a sad, sad day. When the future generations we have damned by today's actions look back and wonder ``Why are things in such disarray? When did it go wrong? When did the demise of the Senate begin?'' the answer will be today, November 21, 2013.
