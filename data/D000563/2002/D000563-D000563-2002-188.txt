He is a cardiac heart surgeon who is recognized for what he has done before he came to the Senate. I will certainly bow to his educational and professional experience.  Talking about bioequivalency, is it not true that when it comes to the efficacy of a drug that we should also take that into consideration when we are dealing with women, children, or pregnant women? It is my understanding that all of these are relevant to the efficacy of drugs--bioequivalency.  Is it not correct that were it not for the congressional pressure and mandating the same pharmaceutical companies the Senator is speaking of they would not be engaged in clinical trials sufficient to make certain that the efficacy of drugs would be the same for women and men, and dosages for children?  The point I am making is the industry, itself, had to be pushed into a position to find exactly what was better for people in usual circumstances of life. Is that not a fact?
