Speaker, I rise today to honor and pay tribute to an individual whose dedication and contributions to the community of Riverside, CA are exceptional. Riverside has been fortunate to have dynamic and dedicated community members who willingly and unselfishly give their time and talent and make their communities a better place to live and work. Joe Tavaglione, Jr. is one of these individuals. On Saturday, July 12, 2003 Joe will be celebrating his 80th birthday.  Joe has spent most of his life in Riverside, his family moved there in 1927 when he was 3 years old. He is one of eleven siblings who worked together to help there family by operating citrus groves and the Rubidoux winery in the heart of Riverside. Joe attended local schools including Poly High School and Riverside City College.  In 1944 Joe married his high school sweetheart, Jackie, and raised two sons, Jeff and Jay. The two sons would eventually join Joe and his brother Louis in the family business. Joe began his career working as a lumber salesman with Center Lumber Company in Riverside and later moved to the Heers Brothers Construction/Builders. His emphasis was in residential construction, building homes in California and Nevada and 8,000 military units at Fort Ord, CA.  After his success in working for Heers Brothers, Joe and Louis decided to form Tavaglione Construction and Development. They started building residential tracks, then shifted their focus to freestanding commercial buildings, constructing Farrell's Ice Cream Parlors, Chief Auto Parts and over 1,000 7-11 convenience stores in 12 western States.  Joe has also been actively involved in the community, having been selected by two California Governors for statewide positions including Chairman of the California State Contractor's Board and the California Transportation Commission. He also sits on the City of Riverside's Public Utility Board and is the current President of the National Association of Contractors. Joe is also active in the Humane Society.  Joe's tireless work ethic and dedication to community service has contributed immensely to the betterment of the community of Riverside, CA. I am proud to call Joe a fellow community member, American and friend. I know that many community members are grateful for his contributions and salute him on his 80th birthday.                          ____________________
