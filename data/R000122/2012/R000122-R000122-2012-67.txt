In 40 days, as I think many of us recognize, student borrowing rates for college will double unless we act. We have seen both sides of the aisle--colleagues from both sides--come down and say we cannot let this happen. Well, we cannot let it happen. That means we have to take action to prevent the doubling of interest rates on Stafford loans.  Unfortunately, last week we had a series of budget votes, which most of my Republican colleagues supported, which would have, if they had passed, mandated the doubling of the student loan interest rate. So I think we have to move away from this debate and actually pass legislation which would prevent the doubling of student loans by July 1. I hope we can do it promptly, certainly before July 1.  Also, I hope we find an effective offset. What the Republicans have suggested is using the Prevention Fund.
