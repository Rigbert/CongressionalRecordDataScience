Speaker, I thank the gentleman.  Last week, I asked the leader and would ask the gentleman, as we approach next week, assuming that the budget is to be on the floor next week, about the commitment of the majority to allowing the minority, as has historically happened, to have various alternatives. As the gentleman knows, the Congressional Black Caucus has always had the opportunity to offer an alternative that was a thoughtful, persuasive budget. I did not always support it.                              {time}  1330  We have other caucuses who may want to offer alternatives as well, and clearly the gentleman from South Carolina (Mr. Spratt), the ranking member of the Committee on the Budget on our side of the aisle, will want to offer a substitute as well.  Is the gentleman aware of whether or not, as has happened in the past, we will be afforded the opportunity to offer various alternatives to the budget document that will be reported out of committee?  Mr. Speaker, I yield to the gentleman.
