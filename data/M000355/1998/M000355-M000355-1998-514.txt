 The Senator has 12 minutes and 20 seconds.  Mr. McCONNELL. Mr. President, if I may, I want to follow up on some observations by my friend from Utah. The underlying bill seeks to abolish what is pejoratively referred to as ``soft money.'' In fact, as the Senator from Utah and I know, soft money should not be a pejorative term. It is, in fact, everything that isn't hard money. Our two great political parties, of course, are interested in who gets to be Governor in Utah; occasionally, they are interested in who gets to be mayor of Salt Lake City. They are, in fact, Federal parties.  So, in the aftermath of McCain-Feingold, you would have a complete federalization of the American political process, I guess putting the FEC in charge of the city council races in Salt Lake City.
