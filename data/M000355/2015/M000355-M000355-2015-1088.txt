 President, let me just tell everybody what that means. For the information of all Senators, this means that we will be able to process all of the other votes on trade by voice vote, and so there will be no further rollcall votes this week. Having said that, the Senate will be in session tomorrow. There are multiple committee meetings that are going to occur, but no votes will be expected tomorrow.                          ____________________
