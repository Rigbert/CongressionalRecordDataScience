President, I thank the Senator from Vermont for his comments. At this time, I would like to recognize that we have four of the real star freshmen, the new Members of this body, on our committee. One, of course, is the presiding officer from Louisiana who made very clear to us the problem of beach erosion in the State of Louisiana. I appreciate his calling that to our attention. Then, of course, we have the new Senator from South Dakota, Mr. Thune. Senator Thune is also on the committee, and we yield to him at this time.
