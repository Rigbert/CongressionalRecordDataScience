Can you ever recall a bill involving an industry like the pharmaceutical industry, such a grand bill involving a national program, involving that industry, where that industry has been so silent during the course of the entire preparation and deliberation of the bill? I ask the Senator from Iowa, in his vast experience and with his great insight, what does he make of the silence of the pharmaceutical industry about S. 1, the pending bill?
