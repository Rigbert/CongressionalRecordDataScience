Chairman, I rise in opposition to the amendment.  The Acting CHAIR. The gentleman from Oregon is recognized for 5 minutes.  Mr. DeFAZIO. Mr. Chairman, I yield myself such time as I may consume.  Earlier this evening, an amendment was defeated to go to 90,000 pounds. This would go to 95,000. At least the amendment on 90,000 had an additional axle, which made it compliant with the Federal bridge formula that is not causing undue damage every time a truck went over a bridge. This amendment does not require an additional axle and goes even 5,000 pounds higher.                              {time}  1945  So it would violate the Federal Bridge Formula, and Federal Highway says that it has estimated that a truck at this weight with the number of axles they have is currently paying about 43 percent of the cost of the damage they cause to the system, and that is an underpayment of about $6,000 a year. The bill does allow them to be charged another $200 a year, but that is a pretty big deficit with an already substantially deteriorated system.  Raising truck weights is always a very controversial and difficult proposition because we have to look out for the taxpayers in terms of undue wear and tear to an already fragile and deteriorated system. 140,000 bridges, as we mentioned numerous times already, need repair or replacement, and, unfortunately, I believe this would accelerate that problem. So I appreciate the gentleman's advocacy for a significant industry in his district, but I would have to oppose that increase.  I reserve the balance of my time.
