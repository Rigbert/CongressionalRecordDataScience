President, I understand Senator Cochran has expressed the sentiments of some on his side of the aisle. I would like to say for the record that we have made this proposal for several months now. I think those who are trying to move this issue have shown extraordinary patience in trying to reach an accommodation, and this is no reflection on the Senator from Mississippi, who was not involved in this debate, that I know of. It only is a plea to those who are considering the merits of this legislation to try to do so in a timely fashion.  Mr. President, I would like to reiterate what the majority leader said earlier for those following the debate. If there are Members of the Senate of either political party who have pending amendments on the Homeland Security appropriations bill, we encourage you to come to the Senate floor as soon as possible and be prepared to call up your amendment. We are going to stay in session tonight until all amendments are disposed of. We will vote on final passage this evening, whatever time that may be. We hope it will not be a late-night session, but when there are many amendments pending and no Members on the floor, it is a frustrating situation for everyone.  So I hope that those who have amendments they care about will come forward as soon as possible, come to the floor and work to try to resolve those amendments, withdraw these amendments, or bring them to a vote.  I yield the floor, and suggest the absence of a quorum.
