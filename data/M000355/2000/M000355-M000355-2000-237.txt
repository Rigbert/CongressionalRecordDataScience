 President, I listened with great interest to the comments of the junior Senator from Utah, with whom I agree on this issue entirely.  One of the items I would like to engage him on--I certainly didn't cover it in my comments, and in listening to his, neither did he--was the definitional difficulty, in addition to all the other reasons why the Constitution or the first amendment should not be amended for the first time in 200 years, for either one of these proposals.  Focusing on the flag desecration amendment, it leads the Senator from Kentucky to ask the Senator from Utah if he understands what flag desecration is, because I have always had a little difficulty trying to figure out what that was. I remember I took my kids to the beach one time and saw lots of flags on T-shirts. I even saw one on the behind of some blue jeans. There are a variety of ways in which flags are displayed in this country that, it seems to me, might be arguably inappropriate.  I wonder if the Senator from Utah thinks if this amendment were to become part of the Constitution, we would have a definitional problem here as well.
