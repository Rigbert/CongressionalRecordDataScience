Speaker, I thank the gentleman for the schedule and would ask him, on his last point, on the Zika conference, does the gentleman have any information as to what might be the conference agreement? I don't have any information on that. Does the gentleman have any idea exactly where the conference is going and what we might expect?  I yield to the gentleman from California.  Mr. McCARTHY. Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentleman for yielding.  I know they are working very hard. They had met yesterday as well. I am hopeful that, in my conversations with the conferees, they are close to finishing, and I have been explaining to them, as soon as they are finished, we would like to bring it to the floor as soon as possible for passage.  I do want to thank the gentleman for his work on this effort as well.
