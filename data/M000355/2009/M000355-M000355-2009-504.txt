 He did have a pretty good summary of the amendments we are aware of at the moment, all of which are significant. It is good that we will have a chance to get a vote on most or all of those.  During his campaign, the President said he would not sign any non emergency spending until the American people had at least 5 days to review it on the White House Web site.  So there is no reason for us to rush through this Omnibus appropriations bill when the White House has already promised it won't sign it without the requisite 5-day review.  Besides, we have known about the Friday deadline for months so any pressure to rush this bill is completely manufactured.
