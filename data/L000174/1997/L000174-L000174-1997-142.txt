President, I rise today to honor a very special Vermonter. Peter Jennison has devoted much of his life to documenting our wonderful State.  Among his many accomplishments, Peter has authored ``Vermont: An Explorer's Guide,'' ``Roadside History of Vermont,'' numerous Vermont magazine articles and reviews, and also ``Vermont on $500 A Day (More Or Less)''--and for those of you who are lucky enough to have visited Vermont you understand the tongue-in-cheek title of the last book.  His skill and talent for writing and history earned him the Vermont Book Publishers Association Lifetime Achievement Award in 1996. As someone who has enjoyed many of his books and magazine articles, I know that this award is well deserved.  Peter is a longtime special friend of mine as is his wife Jane and I wanted the Senate to know about them.  The Rutland Herald recently ran an excellent piece on Peter Jennison. I ask unanimous consent that the article appear immediately following my statement.             [From the Rutland Daily Herald, July 10, 1997]    A ``Born Again Vermonter'' Reflects on A Life Spent Among Books                         (By Melissa MacKenzie)       At 75 nothing shocks Peter S. Jennison except the prices of      books and hotels.       ``I can remember when a suite at the Plaza cost $10 a      day,'' he said with a chuckle on the morning of his big      birthday, July 2 was celebrated quietly, followed by a family      gathering at the weekend. Jane Jennison, his wife of 51      years, was cheerful but bedridden with emphysema, knee      surgery and two hip replacements. Otherwise life appeared to      be going tolerably well in the 1840 brick cottage on the hill      above the Taftsville General Store.       Jennison, a ``born again'' Vermonter, who grew up in      Swanton and then lived many years in New York only to return      home again, is probably best known to the average reader as      one of the authors of ``Vermont: An Explorer's Guide'' and      the popular ``Roadside History of Vermont.''       Others may recognize him as the dry, accurate and often      humorous reviewer of restaurants and inns for Vermont      Magazine. Or you may have seen his books in libraries,      including two novels set in Vermont, ``The Governor,''      written in 1964, and ``The Mimosa Smokers,'' and a semi-     serious guidebook called ``Vermont on $500 A Day (More or      Less).'' Two of his other books, ``History of Woodstock,      1890-1983,'' and ``Frederick Billings,'' written with Jane      Curtis and Frank Lieberman, reflect his historian side and      his lifelong interest in Vermont history.       An affable observant man known for his quiet wit, Jennison      and his wife, Jane, founded Countryman Press, (now a part of      the giant W.W. Norton Publishing Company), in Woodstock in      1973. Or re-founded, you might say. The Jennisons revived the      imprint, dormant since the 1930s, which had in the past      published such greats as Stephen Vincent Benet and Edgar Lee      Masters, and launched their own version, including a new,      colophon designed by Vermont artist Sabra Field.       Success came quickly, although it was hard work. Peter and      Jane worked from their kitchen table to produce Countryman's      first book, a guidebook called ``Wonderful Woodstock.'' and      only three years later published its first bestseller,      ``Backyard Livestock,'' by Steven Thomas, a book that is      still selling well today. By this time several veteran      editors and marketing people had joined the little      enterprise, among them, the late Keith Jennison, Peter's      brother, author of the humorous ``Yup * * * Nope and Other      Vermont Dialogues'', and three men who would eventually run      the company, Louis Kannenstine, Christopher Lloyd and Carl      Taylor.       The idea was to pay careful attention to the selection of      books, be willing to take a chance on a writer; and to take      pride in the way their books were designed. Said Jennison at      the time, ``Working this way is * * * a much more personal      kind of publishing that is possible elsewhere in the      conglomerate scene.'' It was a philosophy which saw little      Countryman become a David among the Goliaths.       ``Countryman was like a woodstove. You had to keep adding      logs. Bit by bit we grew beyond our expectations. We didn't      have a master plan, it just happened. The more books, the      more momentum,'' Jennison said.       The company operated from the Jennisons' home for the first      four years. Editing, billing and shipping continued to get      done at the kitchen table. Books were ferried to bookstores      in the back of a Toyota pickup truck. Next, Countryman moved      down the hill near the Taftsville General Store, where it      stayed until 1981 when it relocated to Woodstock and      constructed its own building on Route 4. Countryman Press      operated there until 1994. After the sale to W.W. Norton, the      staff relocated to Mt. Tom. The building is presently for      sale for $495,000.       Selling to a big New York City publisher was ``an emotional      wrench, like selling the family farm, but I realized we had,      so to speak, survived the childhood and the adolescence of      the company, and now we had grown up and got married,'' said      Jennison philosophically.       ``For a small publisher it was getting more and more      complicated and expensive to do business. The big wholesalers      and the chains are now dictating the rules of the game,'' he      added.       ``Publishing has gotten to be part of the entertainment      industry. More people are buying more books, but because of      the star system that dominates the industry, a lot of new      writers are being deprived of an audience. There are still a      lot of smaller presses, but they don't have access to the      major markets,'' Jennison said.       Another factor is the reliance of the big players on      computers and the industry's fixation on the bottom line.       ``Unfortunately the buyers at Barnes and Noble and at      Ingram (the largest book distribution company in the U.S.)      are ruled by their computer records; how well an author sold      before, what type of book sold before, etc. I call it the      Bill Gates-is-God mentality,'' he said.       Jennison, however, remains hopeful, ``I am optimistic      enough to think there will always be a large number of people      who would rather curl up with a book than a computer game.      The format of the book will be with us for a long time. It'll      go on,'' he said.       In 1996 the Vermont Book Publishers Association awarded      Jennison a Lifetime Achievement Award for his contributions      to publishing.       A sixth-generation Vermonter, born on a dairy farm in      Swanton, north of St. Albans, Jennison attended a one room      school until his parents packed him off to Philips Academy,      Andover. Next came Middlebury College, interrupted in his      junior year by World War II. Jennison served three years with      the Office of Strategic Services, the forerunner of the CIA,      as a code and ciphers specialist, decoding messages from U.S.      agents behind the lines in Germany, France and Norway,      Returning to Middlebury, he graduated with a degree in      American literature, married Jane, and began what was to      become a lifetime spent with books.       Jennison worked first for ``Publishers Weekly'' as a      reviews editor and feature writer, and then went on to become      Assistant Director of the American Book Publishers Council.      In the 1960s, he served on the National Book Committee, a      non-profit citizens group promoting books and libraries,      similar to the Vermont Center for the Book, but on a national      scale. Under the auspices of the Ford Foundation he also      worked with fledgling publishing companies in Africa, the      Middle East and Asia, as well as serving on the panel for the      National Book Awards.       ``The Natinal Book Awards weren't as high profile in the      sixties. We got a lot of local publicity, though, outside of      New York. Now, it's more like the Academy Awards,'' said      Jennison.       The Jennisons returned to Vermont in 1971. I'd had enough      of New York and I was tired of being held hostage by the New      Haven Railroad,'' recalled Jennison, referring to his years      as a commuter from suburban Westport, Conn.       Christina Tree, co-author of ``Vermont: An Explorer's      Guide,'' remembers the story a little differently. ``The way      I heard it, Peter came home one night after a hard day in the      city, wound up like a clock, and accidentally walked straight      off the patio into the family swimming pool, seersucker suit,      briefcase and all. He got out, sputtering, and yelled, ``That      does it. Jane, we're going back to Vermont.''       Although he is now officially retired, Jennison continues      to write for ``Vermont Magazine'' and will work again with      Tree on the next edition of ``Vermont: An Explorer's Guide.''       Countryman Press's ``The Explorer's Guide series'' started      in 1979. The first book was about Massachusetts, the home      state of Tree, a young travel writer at the Boston Globe.      Said Tree from her home in Cambridge, ``Peter hired me to      write the series. I wrote one on Massachusetts and one on      Maine. But the year I was to begin the one on Vermont, I had      some family difficulties, and Peter so-authored to help me      out.''       The partnership was such a success the two have continued      co-writing the book ever since.       ``We divided up the state,'' said Jennison. ``Now, when      it's time for a new edition, we switch sections and re-visit      old places and add new ones.''       The guidebook is published every two years and has garnered      much praise for its accuracy and attention to historical      detail. The most recent edition came out in May, which means      that come the summer of 1998, Jennison and Tree will again      switch their sections and start trekking for the 1999      edition. Working off the previous edition on their computers,      the pair will meticulously re-check each entry, changing      phone numbers and prices where necessary adding names or      dropping them.       Said Christina Tree, ``The depth of Peter's knowledge of      Vermont is huge. He's seen tremendous changes in the state,      and he's got an interesting perspective, returning to Vermont      at the time he did, after being away for so long. He      personifies a certain kind of aristocratic Vermonter, who's      very sophisticated and also very active and involved. He's      low-key and witty and generous. And of course he's a fabulous      writer. Somebody ought to do an oral biography of him.''                          ____________________
