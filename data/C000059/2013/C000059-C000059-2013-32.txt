Speaker, I rise today to honor and pay tribute to a dear friend of mine, Janet M. Johnson. Janet passed away on Wednesday, April 24, 2013. A resident of Corona since 1968, she was a pillar of the community and will be deeply missed.  Beverly was born in Huntingdon, Pennsylvania, the daughter of Samuel N. and Elsie C. Miller. She attended a one-room schoolhouse until the eighth grade and graduated from Huntingdon High School. In the early 1950s, she and her sister Rachel moved west to Santa Monica, California, where Janet worked as a secretary at General Electric and the University of California, Los Angeles. At a dance at the Avalon Ballroom, she met her futurehusband, Glenn E. Johnson and on November 7, 1953, they were married at the Trinity Baptist Church in Santa Monica. After living in Santa Monica, Janet and Glenn relocated to La Mirada before settling in Corona in 1968.  Janet and Glenn contributed generously to many civic causes, and she always found time for her community. She was active in several organizations, including the Buena Park Lionesses, Women's Improvement Club, Red Hats Society, Republican Women, California Republican Association (CRA), Navy League, Corona Heritage Park, Croquet Club, Model A Club, Packard Club, Ford Retractable Club, Bible Study Fellowship and Joy Bible Study. Janet's faith was important to her and she attended many churches throughout southern California: First Baptist in Buena Park, Riverside Baptist Temple, Faith Baptist in Corona, Pacific Coast Church in San Clemente and finally Crossroads Church in Corona.  Janet is survived by her husband Glenn; four children: Sandra Rowe (Rick), Linda Rither (Ross), Kirk Johnson (Dolly) and Eric Johnson; four grandchildren: Jessica Scautling (Kevin), Becky Cass (Drew), Cody Johnson and Morgan Rither; three great-grandchildren: Kassie Scautling, Kolten Scautling and Derik Cass; and one sister-in-law Louise Miller. She was preceded in death by her parents and four siblings: Dallas Miller, Dorothy Miller, Beulah Rose and Rachel Nagel.  On Thursday, May 9, 2013, a memorial honoring Janet's extraordinary life will be held. Janet will always be remembered for her incredible work ethic, generosity, contributions to the community and love of family. Her dedication to her family, work, and community are a testament to a life lived well and a legacy that will continue. I extend my condolences to Janet's family and friends; although Janet may be gone, the light and goodness she brought to the world remain and will never be forgotten.                          ____________________
