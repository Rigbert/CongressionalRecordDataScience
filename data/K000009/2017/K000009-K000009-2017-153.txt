Speaker, what the gentlewoman from Connecticut is saying is very important because certain States hung in the balance in this past election. Ohio was one of them. Michigan, Pennsylvania, obviously Indiana next door was constant. If you look at each one of those States, those were the ones that actually carried for President Trump in the end because of the jobs and trade issue.  I yield to the gentlewoman from Connecticut.  Ms. DeLAURO. Mr. Speaker, that is absolutely right. That was a central part of the election last November.  Improving our trade policy requires new rules, as I said, not more status quo. We have to push a trade agenda that will create good-paying jobs and that is going to raise wages here at home. And our coalition is going to continue to hold this administration accountable. What we need to do is to try to reshape the trajectory of modern globalization, one that doesn't exacerbate that economic problem that I spoke about people being in jobs that just don't pay them enough money. The NAFTA agreement put people at such grave risk.  I know that the gentlewoman can recall this as well: we both stood on this House floor all those years ago and we said we were going to lose jobs, that we were going to increase the trade deficit, and that this was not an agreement that would benefit the working men and women of this country.  At that time, quite frankly, we were told by the then-Clinton administration that we were thugs, that we did not understand what was happening, that we were protectionist, all kinds of labels against the thinking that we said that this was not going to benefit us.
