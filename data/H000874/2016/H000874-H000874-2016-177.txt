Speaker, I rise to offer my congratulations to Carl Gotzmer of Accokeek, Maryland, in the Fifth District. On June 30, Carl will be receiving his fifty-year pin from the United States Navy in recognition of a half-century of civilian service at the Naval Surface Warfare Center, Indian Head Division.  Carl is one of our nation's leading experts on energetics, the field of study concerning the movement of energy in a system. This field has wide application in defense technologies, and Carl has drawn on his deep knowledge of it to design systems that help seamen protect our homeland and carry out missions overseas in support of our interestsand our allies. He has published more than 100 papers and articles in the field and holds dozens of patents. Furthermore, Carl's analysis of the threat from foreign energetic materials has strengthened our intelligence, and it earned him a Letter of Appreciation from the Office of Naval Intelligence in 2014.  Praised for his ability to translate complex energetics concepts into plain English for policymakers, Carl has been an invaluable asset not only to the Navy but also to the other service branches, as well as to the CIA, FBI, and other national security agencies. In 2013, Secretary Ashton Carter presented him with the Distinguished Civilian Service Award--the Defense Department's highest civilian honor. Over the years, Carl has also received three Meritorious Civilian Service Awards in recognition of his having provided the Navy with solutions to difficult, large-scale problems.  Many of Carl's innovations and discoveries in energetics have subsequently been applied in industry and benefitted America's economy. He developed and named High Temperature Thermal Radiation (HTTR) devices and invented a new class of rocket propellants. Carl has also been a pioneer in the development of undersea explosives and reactive materials. Undoubtedly, his work at Indian Head has saved lives and aided our troops in countless missions around the world.  Before coming to Indian Head in 1966, Carl worked for a year at the U.S. Atomic Energy Commission. He and his wife Kathleen, who also works for the Navy, run a small business in Accokeek that sells their hand-crafted dulcimers to collectors and musicians throughout the country.  On June 30, Carl's family, friends, and colleagues will celebrate his half-century of service at an All-Hands ceremony at the Indian Head Pavilion. Carl has said he intends to continue serving the Navy and our country, with no intention of retiring anytime soon. I congratulate him and wish him continued success in his service to the Navy and to our country.                          ____________________
