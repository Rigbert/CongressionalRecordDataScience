Mr. Speaker, I again want to thank the gentleman from New Jersey (Mr. Pascrell) for his very kind remarks and for his donation to the bill, particularly as it relates to informing our servicemen prior to discharge.  Mr. Speaker, I yield the remaining 2 minutes to the gentleman from Illinois (Mr. Kirk), my good friend and colleague.                              {time}  1445
