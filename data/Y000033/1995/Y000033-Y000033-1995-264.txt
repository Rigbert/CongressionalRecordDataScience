Mr. Chairman, I move to strike the last word.  Mr. Chairman, I reluctantly, but enthusiastically, rise in opposition to the amendment of the gentleman from California [Mr. Miller]. Much of what the gentleman said is true, but let us keep in mind that these properties that we were supposed to be purchasing were set off limits by another Congress.  In fact, if we look at the GAO report, which I requested with the gentleman from California [Mr. Pombo], that was reported in 1995, we purchased in 1993, through the agencies, a little over 203,000 acres of land. The Forest Service purchased 72,000; the LM 27,000; the Fish and Wildlife, 82,000; the National Park Service, 22,000.  What we have done in the past, and I will respectfully say, we have now hopefully addressed that issue with a commission that will look at our parks. We hope to come forth with another recommendation that we do not constantly create these units without proper scientific research and input.  Mr. Chairman, I happen to agree that there is $11 billion in the fund to buy these properties. We have not. We have used them. All administrations, including this one, have used these moneys to balance the budget, or other purposes than what they were collected for.  But more than that, we have stopped drilling off shore too. There is no drilling taking place in the United States, other than in the Mexican gulf. There is a little off of Alaska. There is none around the United States and I do not think anybody here is advocating that. None in Florida. I am not saying that.  What I am saying is that the gentleman from Ohio said that we did on this side, I am saying this for our Members, agreed to a budget target to balance it by a certain time.  So, Mr. Chairman, I am going to request, respectfully, we vote no on the gentleman's amendment, although much of his argument is correct as to how this has been misused. But I do believe if we want to reach that target, we should reject the amendment, support the chairman of the committee, and go forth with our business.                              {time}  1700
