My senior colleague from our great State and I would like to engage you in a brief colloquy about one such project--the improvement of the highway system in northern Maine. The Senate report accompanying the fiscal year 2002 Transportation appropriations bill sets aside $6 million to help us move forward extending Maine's highway system beyond the termination point of Interstate 95 in Houlton. Having been born and raised in northern Maine I can tell you first hand about the critical importance to that region's economy of improving the highway system of Aroostook County.
