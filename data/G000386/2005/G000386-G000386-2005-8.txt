 President, I would like to explain my action today related to S. 1057, a bill to amend the Indian Health Care Improvement Act. I requested that Leader Frist inform me prior to entering into any unanimous consent agreement relating to any amendments, motions, or any other actions relating to consideration of this bill.  This legislation exempts American Indians/Alaskan Natives from being charged a deductible, copayment, or coinsurance for an item or service for which payment may be made under the Medicaid or SCHIP programs in the Social Security Act. I am reluctant to treat one group differently from other groups. In my opinion, this is a precedent setting change. If we start by exempting one group from costsharing, then many other groups may start asking for the same exemption.  This legislation also exempts several types of property from being considered in Medicaid eligibility. We understand that there may be special circumstances that may necessitate the need for these provisions. We have requested additional information from the Indian Affairs Committee to facilitate our understanding of these exemptions. However, we have not yet received the requested information. In my opinion, without further information, these provisions send the message that resources are irrelevant to a determination of Medicaid eligibility. I don't believe that individuals should have significant resources and still be eligible for Medicaid. These provisions would create an imbalance by allowing a loophole solely for one group.  I want to be clear: it is not that I am concerned about making these changes for American Indians/Alaskan Natives, I am concerned about making these changes for any group. I welcome the opportunity to continue to work with the sponsors of this legislation, Senators McCain and Dorgan, and with members of the Indian Affairs Committee on this matter. My staff has been working with staff from the Indian Affairs Committee, but they have not yet resolved my concerns.                          ____________________[Page S14177]From the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]                   INDIAN HEALTH CARE IMPROVEMENT ACT
