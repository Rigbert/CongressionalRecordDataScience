 President, I thank the Senator from Connecticut for agreeing to accept the amendment and say to the Senator from Arizona, when the secretaries of state were asked what is the single most effective thing they could be given to combat fraud and to pare down lists and remove from those lists people who are not supposed to be there, they said the Social Security number. So while the Social Security Administration may have some reservations, the secretaries of state have no reservations.  They think it would be an extraordinary step in the right direction. I commend the Senator from Arizona for offering the amendment. I thank the Senator from Connecticut for accepting it.
