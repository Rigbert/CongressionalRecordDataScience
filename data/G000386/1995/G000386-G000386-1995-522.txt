 President, I am very pleased that the first bill that the 104th Senate will consider is the Congressional Accountability Act. This bill presents the opportunity to show the country that the Senate has listened to the American people. We will demonstrate that the new Senate knows that the American people want us to end business as usual.  I appreciate the leadership that Senator Lieberman has provided on this legislation over the years. He is equally committed to reforming Congress. Our views on this legislation are identical. And I am pleased that the task of congressional coverage has benefited from a bipartisan approach.  I also wish to thank Senator Dole for bringing up this legislation. His commitment to this legislation is outstanding. He is a true reformer in the best sense of the word. And he is committed to ending the injustices that have existed for congressional employees for so many years. The majority leader established a number of working groups to advise him on measures that should be taken in the 104th Senate. Senator Fred Thompson and I cochaired the Working Group on Congressional Coverage. I know that Senator Thompson has worked hard on this legislation, and I appreciate his assistance in this effort. It is an auspicious beginning to his career as a Senator. Other members of the working group included Senators Nickles, Gorton, Smith, Stevens, Abraham, Coats, and Hutchison.  Moreover, our efforts to ensure congressional compliance with the laws it passes benefited from Senator Roth's willingness to let this legislation be brought to the floor immediately. Additionally, Senator Glenn worked on the issue over quite a few years when he chaired the Governmental Affairs Committee. I am also delighted that this bill has dozens of cosponsors, from both parties, all parts of the country, and all across the ideological spectrum.  This bill represents the culmination of an effort that I began several years ago, when I first attempted to offer an amendment to a civil rights bill that would have brought Congress under labor and employment laws. That attempt failed, as did my attempt to amend the Americans With Disabilities Act in 1989. My amendment was accepted by the then-Senate leadership but was rendered ineffective in conference. And I was not even allowed to offer my amendment to the family leave bill when the Senate debated it in 1991.  Congress can no longer refuse to live by the laws it passes. The time is long overdue for Congress to correct this practice, and that is what this bill does. It completes the process begun in 1991 when the Senate passed the Grassley-Mitchell amendment applying the substantive provisions of the civil rights laws to the Senate. As I said back then, it was a good beginning--but only a beginning. So it is with some measure of satisfaction that I find myself speaking in favor of a bill that would finally require Congress to comply with a host of employment laws it has enacted for the private sector.  Mr. President, since the 1930's Congress has passed laws that flowed from the assumption that Washington knew best. Congress set up burdensome statutory requirements on the operation of small businesses in this country. The burdens were increased through regulations issued by executive branch agencies pursuant to the statute.  At the same time, Congress repeatedly exempted itself from the effects of those laws. Laws governed America, but not Congress. Workers were granted rights, but congressional workers were not. Those who made the laws did not live by them. Congress was immune from the excesses of the regulatory state. Congress became removed from the way its work affected everyone else.  In this country, no one is above the law. But just as the Presidency suffered a tremendous loss of public confidence when an individual thought he was above the law, Congress suffered as Members thought they were above the law. Indeed, to me, this was one of the major reasons why Congress lost touch with the people. And it was one of the ways by which Congress displayed arrogance. Millions of Americans complained about the overreach of the Federal Government, but Congress, through its exemption from the law, could not know the depth of feeling from the grassroots. In November, the American people demanded that Congress be affected by the laws it passes. A number of Members who thought Congress should be above the law are no longer Members and no longer above the law.  Let me remind my colleagues of someone who lost an earlier election, former Senator George McGovern. Senator McGovern believes that Congress has enacted unnecessary regulatory burdens that are strangling small business. Senator McGovern admits that he did not feel that way when he was a Member of this body, but he learned the reality of the operation of that legislation when he ran a small business after leaving office. I appreciate that Senator McGovern now says that he would have legislated differently had he known what the actual effects would have been.  But Members of Congress learning of the effects of their votes only after leaving office will not solve the problem. Then, it is too late. Only if Members of Congress live with the consequences of their votes will the problem that Senator McGovern identified be corrected.  I think that President Clinton has this issue exactly right as well. When we send this bill to him, he will sign it. As he stated in a July 1992 interview, ``It's wrong for Congress to be able to put new requirements on American business as employers and then not follow that rule as employers themselves. They exempt themselves, historically, from all kinds of rules that private employers have to follow. And I think that one of the things that happens to people in government is they forget what it's like to be governed. They don't have any idea what it's like to be on the receiving end of a lot of these rules and regulations.''  Of course, the Founding Fathers would be astonished to know that Congress had exempted itself from so many laws that it passed for the private sector. James Madison in Federalist 57 wrote that one of the primary guarantees of the people's liberty came from Congress living by whatever laws it passed. Madison wrote that Congress ``Can pass no law which will not have its full operation on themselves and [[Page S441]] their friends, as well as on the great mass of society. This has always been deemed one of the strongest bonds by which human policy can connect the rulers and the people together. It creates between them the communion of interest * * * of which few governments have furnished examples, but without which every government degenerates into tyranny * * * if this spirit ever be so far debased as to tolerate a law not obligatory on the legislature as well as on the people, the people will be prepared to tolerate anything but liberty.''  Mr. President, Madison was right. Of course, the low esteem in which Congress is currently held reflects the fact that there is no longer congruence of interests between the governors and the governed. The American people will no longer tolerate a law not obligatory on the legislature as well as the people.  Under Madison's principle, because Members of Congress would be careful before they infringed their own liberties, the people's liberties would be zealously protected.  Unfortunately, the corollary to the principle was equally true. Members of Congress who could protect their own liberties while infringing on the liberties of others were much more likely to fail to protect others' liberties. Congress enjoyed privilege through exemption. The time has come to end congressional royalism. The time has come to end the exemptions. Now, Congress must finally live under the same laws it passes for everyone else, to fulfill Madison's promise of the Constitution. And, now, employees of Congress must finally gain the same rights that their counterparts in the private sector enjoy.  Like my colleagues, I take the notion of representative government very seriously. We are not Senators for ourselves. We do not hold this job as a matter of personal privilege. We are here to represent the interests of our constituents, our States and our country, and for no other reason. I think that exemptions from the operation of law interfere with representative government. I wonder how we truly can represent people who live by one set of laws when we live under different laws. Under the current system, our votes on various regulatory issues reflect our interests and not our constituents'. This must change if representative government is truly to function.  When we pass this bill, we begin to restore the American people's faith in Congress. We will do so in five respects. First, we ensure that Members of Congress will know firsthand the burdens that the private sector lives with. By knowing those burdens, Congress may decide that the laws indeed are burdensome. That realization may lead to necessary reform of the underlying legislation. It is true that there will be additional costs imposed on Congress if this legislation passes. However, these are costs that the private sector has had to live with for years. And the Congressional Budget Office has estimated that costs of compliance will be only about $3-to-$4 million. While that is a considerable sum, it represents, for instance, only a fraction of the amount that Congress recently voted for a subway system to connect the Senate office buildings with the Capitol.  The second benefit of requiring that Congress live under the laws it passes for others concerns future social legislation. If Congress knows that it will be bound by what it passes, Congress will be more careful in the future to respect the liberties of others.  Third, passage of the bill will mean that congressional employees will have the civil rights and social legislation that has ensured fair treatment of workers in the private sector. Congress is the last plantation. It is time for the plantation workers to be liberated. Maybe it is more accurate to say that Congress and the judiciary are the last two plantations. Curiously, the only people who do not have to comply with the law are those who make the law and those who decide the cases under those laws. The judiciary has often interpreted legislation to be burdensome, perhaps in some instances, to be more burdensome than even the exempt Congress intended. Of course, an exempt judiciary has no reason to interpret the statute in a way to protect freedom. Under this bill, the judiciary will have to come up with a plan to provide coverage for its employees as well. I look forward to that proposal, and to enactment of legislation to cover the judiciary.  The fourth general result of this legislation will be a public recognition that Congress has again discovered that it is subject to the will of the people, not the other way around. Congress will no longer be above the law. Members of Congress will no longer be first class citizens with unjustifiable special privileges.  And fifth, Members of Congress will learn themselves of the litigation explosion that is choking small business in the country. When they see directly the litigation produced by the laws they pass, Congress will be very careful about creating additional liabilities for the private sector and additional work for the Federal courts. When they see how alternative dispute resolution operates, Members of Congress may appreciate the wisdom of encouraging additional alternative dispute resolution for all sorts of claims brought in the Federal courts.  Every indication from polls, election returns, and the mail that we have received from constituents shows that nothing makes Americans madder than knowing that they have to live by laws that their Representatives in Congress do not. They are well justified in their anger. When we pass this bill, we will show them that we recognize the unfairness of the existing exemptions and the legitimacy of their concerns.  S. 2 is the pending business under unusual circumstances. It has not been considered by any committee in this Congress. Nonetheless, it bears a close resemblance to S. 2071 from the 103d Congress.  That bill was the subject of hearings in the Governmental Affairs Committee, and it was approved by the committee for floor consideration.  Unfortunately, the bill was not able to be considered before the Congress adjourned, despite the fact that the other body had passed similar legislation.  Although the Governmental Affairs Committee did issue a report to accompany S. 2071, this particular bill does not have a committee report. Although S. 2 is quite similar to S. 2071, there have been changes made in consultation with leaders from the other body.  Accordingly, it will be necessary, in lieu of a committee report, for me to first describe the bill generally, and then to detail each aspect of the bill.  S. 2 begins with the basic premise that the laws that govern the private sector should govern Congress unless it can be shown that important differences between Congress and the private sector justify some amount of change. The provisions of S. 2 also flow from a belief that judicial enforcement of the laws against the Congress is vital if those laws are to meaningfully apply.  I strongly disagree with the implications of today's Washington Post article on the congressional coverage bill. That article implies that Congress is already covered under many of these laws and already lives under them, and that all that is changing is the remedies. That analysis misses the point. Let me provide an analogy.  The Soviet Union's Constitution guaranteed the rights to freedom of speech, freedom of assembly, fair trial, and other rights that are similar to the American Constitution. They existed on paper. Any Soviet citizen could pull out that document and see that those rights existed. But of course, the rights guaranteed by the American Constitution are a reality and the rights guaranteed by the Soviet Constitution were an illusion. The reason for the difference: The American Constitution is enforced by an independent judiciary and the Soviet Constitution was not. The Soviet rights were nothing because there was no remedy.  Similar to the Soviet Constitution, it is true that some of the laws this bill will apply to Congress already can be found in the United States Code as applying to Congress. But the remedies to make those rights exist in more than name only do not.  ``The history of liberty is the history of procedures for protecting liberty,'' Justice Frankfurter once wrote, and until this bill is passed, congressional employees lack the remedies necessary to protect liberty.  S. 2 will apply 11 laws to Congress that are either completely or partially [[Page S442]] inapplicable now. Those 11 laws are the Federal Labor Standards Act of 1964, title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964, the Americans With Disabilities Act of 1990, the Age Discrimination in Employment Act of 1967, the Family and Medical Leave Act of 1993, the Occupational Safety and Health Act of 1970, the Federal Service Labor Management Relations Act, the Employee Polygraph Protection Act of 1988, the Worker Adjustment and Retraining Notification Act, the Rehabilitation Act of 1973, and the Veterans Reemployment Act.  The bill provides different mechanisms for enforcement of these laws that correspond to their application to the private sector.  If the underlying law provides for a private right of action in court, one model is followed. If the law would be administratively enforced in the private sector, then it is to be administratively enforced against Congress.  For example, the Civil Rights Act of 1964, the Age Discrimination in Employment Act, the Rehabilitation Act of 1973, title I of the Americans With Disabilities Act of 1990, the Family and Medical Leave Act, the Fair Labor Standards Act, the Employee Polygraph Protection Act, the Worker Adjustment and Retraining Notification Act, and the Veterans Reemployment Act provide for enforcement through a private right of action in court. Under S. 2, any employee who alleges a violation of these statutes may also bring a private action in Federal district court. This represents the first time that this relief has ever been available to congressional employees. Before the employee may sue in court, however, the employee must exhaust administrative remedies available to him or her. These administrative remedies are the counseling and mediation provisions that now govern Senate employees under the Government Employee Rights Act from 1991 that Senator Mitchell and I drafted.  I would now like to generally describe the operation of the legislation, and then detail its individual provisions.  The purpose of S. 2 is to fully apply antidiscrimination and employee protection laws to Congress.  The bill has eight key elements:  First, rights and protections under key antidiscrimination and employment statutes would fully apply to the House of Representatives, the Senate, the Architect of the Capitol, the Congressional Budget Office, and the Office of Technology Assessment.  Second, a new Office of Compliance would be established to handle claims and issue rules. The office would be headed by an independent board of directors, removable only for cause.  Third, for statutes providing a private right of action, an employee who believes there has been a violation could receive counseling and mediation services from the new office.  Fourth, if such an employee's claim is not resolved by counseling or mediation, the employee may file a complaint with the office and receive a trial and decision from an independent hearing officer. This decision may be appealed to the board and to the U.S. Court of Appeals.  Fifth, instead of filing a complaint with the office after counseling and mediation, the employee may choose to file an action in U.S. District court where a private sector employee could also bring a lawsuit in court. A jury trial may be requested under applicable law.  Sixth, for underlying statutes providing for administrative enforcement exclusively, the office will enforce the statutes administratively. The employee could obtain Court review for actions the office brought that were resolved adversely to the employee.  Seventh, since the General Accounting Office, the Government Printing Office, and the Library of Congress are already covered by antidiscrimination and employee protections laws, coverage would be expanded and clarified in certain regards.  Additionally, the Administrative Conference will undertake a study of the application of these laws to the three instrumentalities, and will recommend any improvements in regulations and procedures and for any legislation.  Eighth, to ensure compliance with these laws by the judicial branch, the Judicial Conference will undertake a study to determine how employees of the judiciary will obtain the rights and remedies conferred by these laws.                  background and need for legislation  Current law creates a patchwork of rights and protections for employees of the Senate, the House of Representatives, and the congressional instrumentalities.  Although Congress has made significant progress in extending employment laws to congressional employees, important gaps remain. The remaining exemptions, and significant differences in the manner and extent to which rights under these laws can be enforced, perpetuate the perception, and in at least some cases, the reality--of a double standard of special privilege for the legislative branch. This feeds the growing public cynicism about Congress.       coverage and gaps in coverage of the senate, the house of        representatives, and the congressional instrumentalities.  First, the Senate.--A number of major antidiscrimination and employment laws enacted in this century did not cover one or both Houses of Congress. Several laws, including Fair Labor Standards Act, the Age Discrimination in Employment Act, and the Civil Rights Act Amendments of 1972, were originally enacted without coverage for congressional employees, even while executive branch employees were expressly covered. The Federal Service Labor-Management Relations Statute and section 19 of the Occupational Safety and Health Act established special programs for the executive branch, different from the corresponding programs for the private sector, but, again, Congress did not cover itself.  The Employee Polygraph Protection Act and the Worker Adjustment and Retraining Notification Act did not apply to the Federal Government at all. Veterans reemployment provisions gave employees of Congress a Ramspeck remedy, but did not provide the private right of action and court access that private sector veterans enjoy.  Over the past 15 years or so, and accelerating in the 1990's, Congress has taken considerable steps to apply these laws to itself. As far back as the 94th Congress, 1975-76, the Senate adopted Senate Resolution 534, which prohibited employment discrimination in the Senate on the basis of race, color, religion, sex, national origin, or handicap, and which encouraged the hiring of women and members of minority groups.  With the passage of the Americans with Disabilities Act in 1990, rights as established in the antidiscrimination laws were accorded to Senate employees.  Enforcement, however, was through internal procedures before the Select Committee on Ethics, rather than through executive branch agencies or the courts. This act also obligated the Senate not to discriminate against members of the public on the basis of disability.  Title III of the Civil Rights Act of 1991, also known as the Government Employee Rights Act, reaffirmed the prohibition against all kinds of employment discrimination in the Senate.  The 1991 act also established an Office of Senate Fair Employment Practices [OSFEP] and proved an internal Senate enforcement procedure consisting of: First, counseling, second, mediation, third, formal complaint and hearing before a board of three independent hearing officers, and fourth, review of the decision by the Senate Select Committee on Ethics.  Finally, an appeal may be taken from the Ethics Committee decision to the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit.  Rights and protections under the Family and Medical Leave Act of 1993 have also been extended to Senate employees. These rights are enforceable through the procedures established in the Civil Rights Act of 1991.  Thus, Senate employees enjoy the rights and protections of all of the antidiscrimination laws, as well as the Family and Medical Leave Act, albeit with a different enforcement mechanism than is provided in the private sector or the executive branch. However, the Fair Labor Standards Act and the Equal Pay Act do not apply to the Senate.  [[Page S443]] Also, Senate employees do not have a right to trial in U.S. District Court, but they do have a right to trial before a panel of independent hearing examiners, and judicial review by a U.S. Court of Appeals.  Second, the House of Representatives.--In 1988, the House of Representatives adopted the Fair Employment Practices Resolution, House Resolution 558, 100th Congress, which has been renewed and codified in House rule 51. This rule specifics that personnel actions shall be free from discrimination based on race, color, national origin, religion, sex, disability, or age.  In adoption, the protections of the Fair Labor Standards Act, the Equal Pay Act, and the Family and Medical Leave Act have been made applicable to the House.  The House established an Office of Fair Employment Practices that has a 3-step process to be used by employees alleging discrimination: First, counseling and mediation, second, formal complaint, hearing by a hearing officer, and decision by the office, and third, final review of the decision of the office by an eight-member panel composed of four members of the Committee on House Administration and four officers and employees of the House.  Thus, House employees enjoy rights and protections against discrimination, as well as rights under the Fair Labor Standards Act, the Equal Pay Act, and the Family and Medical Leave Act.  However, the House process of enforcing and redressing these rights and protections is somewhat less independent than that in the Senate, and it affords no judicial review.  Third, the instrumentalities--The various congressional instrumentalities have been made subject to some of these antidiscrimination and employee protection laws, but not to others. Coverage is uneven.  The three largest instrumentalities--the General Accounting Office [GAO], the Government Printing Office [GPO], and the Library of Congress [LOC] are subject to these laws to much the same extent as executive branch agencies, although enforcement mechanisms frequently differ. Thus, the employees of these instrumentalities enjoy most of the rights and protections of the antidiscrimination laws, including the right to bring actions in U.S. District Court.  These employees also have the rights and protections of the Family and Medical Leave Act, the Fair Labor Standards Act, and the Federal Service Labor-Management Relations statute.  These three instrumentalities, as Federal agencies, are also subject to the requirements of section 18 of the Occupational Safety and Health Act, and related provisions of section 7902 of title 5, United States Code, and they each have implemented compliance programs.  However, under statute and established practice, certain of these instrumentalities have internal enforcement or grievance mechanisms where executive branch agencies would be subject to external regulation by other agencies.  The Architect of the Capitol, the Congressional Budget Office, and the Office of Technology Assessment have substantially more limited coverage. Employees of the Architect of the Capitol enjoy rights and protections under the antidiscrimination laws, and were recently authorized to bring claims to the GAO Personnel Appeals Board.  However, these employees have rights under the Fair Labor Standards Act and the Family and Medical Leave Act that are not subject to external enforcement, and they are not covered under any labor-management law. Employees of the CBO have the same rights and protections as House employees, and can bring claims to the House OFEP under House rule 51.  Employees of OTA enjoy the rights and protections of antidiscrimination statutes and the Family and Medical Leave Act, but not the Fair Labor Standards Act. OTA has established its own internal grievance procedure.  Last Congress, significant efforts were undertaken to remove the exemptions Congress has granted itself.  Compliance with Federal laws for the legislative branch was also a major issue for the Joint Committee on the Organization of Congress, which was charged in 1993 with presenting a legislative reorganization plan.  There was a near consensus among the Senators and members of the House of Representatives who testified before the joint committee that congressional exemptions should end.  At hearings before the Governmental Affairs Committee on June 29, 1994, Dr. Norman Ornstein, resident scholar at the American Enterprise Institute, stated:       There is no subject now that inflames the public more, when      it comes to Congress, than this one [congressional coverage].  He therefore urged that Congress get ``caught up with the curve of public opinion,'' or else Congress ``may be forced to take action that is far more destructive of the prerogatives of the institution, and of the taxpayers' purse,'' than the proposals now being considered for enactment.  Members who testified or spoke at the Governmental Affairs Committee's hearing in June and at its meeting to mark up S. 2071 in September, were also nearly unanimous in supporting extension of coverage. Concern was expressed about reported and perceived inadequacies in existing employee rights and protections in the legislative branch.  For example, there was concern about the high rate of workers' compensation claims by employees of the Architect of the Capitol, and about a GAO report documenting apparent inequities in the employment and hiring policies of the Architect.  Also, studies were cited showing that the grievance process provided by the Office of the Architect was underutilized, presumably because of a lack of trust in the process, and that a sizable percentage of House and Senate employees expressed reluctance to use their respective grievance procedures because of a lack of trust.  Additionally, the final report of the Joint Committee on the Organization of Congress stated: ``Witnesses were uniformly dissatisfied with the performance of the House Office of Fair Employment Practices [OFEP], which was established in 1989.'' H. Rep. No 103-413, vol. II, at page 147 (December 1993).  They also expressed concern that an underutilization was caused by lack of employee trust in the process.                          summary of proposal                       A. What laws should apply?  The guiding principle expressed by more than one member of the committee in considering this legislation is that Congress should be subject to the same laws as apply to a business back in a home State. The only exception should be where different rules are necessary to enable Congress to fulfill its constitutional and legislative responsibilities.  This bill would apply 11 key anti-discrimination and employee-protection laws to the Congress. These laws are:  Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964,  The Age Discrimination in Employment Act of 1967,  The Rehabilitation Act of 1973,  The Americans with Disabilities Act of 1990,  The Family and Medical Leave Act of 1993,  The Fair Labor Standards Act of 1938,  The Employee Polygraph Protection Act of 1988,  The Worker Adjustment and Retraining Notification Act,  The Veterans Reemployment Act,  The Occupational Safety and Health Act of 1970, and  The Federal Service Labor-Management Relations Statute.                         B. Bicameral structure  Some Senators believe that to authorize executive branch agencies to enforce antidiscrimination and employment laws against Congress would create a dangerous entanglement between these two branches of Government.  They think the legislative branch must be free from executive branch intimidation, real or perceived, and the enforcing agency must likewise be free of real or imagined intimidation by the legislative branch.  The view has also been expressed that the Constitution requires each House to govern itself, independently of the other House. However, S. 2 creates a Bicameral Office of Compliance. Self-government is an essential constitutional obligation of each House, but establishment of a single office to [[Page S444]] implement these laws jointly for the Senate and House would not infringe on any essential Senate or House prerogative.  Indeed, laws cannot be enforced in a fair and uniform manner--and employees and the public cannot be convinced that the laws are being enforced in a fair and uniform manner--unless Congress establishes a single enforcement mechanism that is independent of each House of Congress.  S. 2 would create a new independent enforcement office within the legislative branch. An independent board of directors would be appointed by the majority and minority leadership of each House, removable only for cause. However, the deputy directors of the office, one for each House, will develop the regulations that govern each House, and forward them to the board for notice and comment procedures. The board would then issue regulations, and the accompanying documentation would detail any departures from the recommendations of the deputy directors.  Ultimately, each body would adopt its own regulations, which, so long as they comported with the terms of this act, could take into account differences between the two bodies. Specifically, the board would be responsible for developing rules to apply the antidiscrimination and employment laws to Congress, and Congress would retain the power to approve these rules.  Regulations would become effective by a vote of the respective body, or by both bodies in the event that the regulations in question covered joint employees.  The regulations would have to be consistent with the rules developed by executive branch agencies, unless the board determined for good cause that a different approach would be more effective for the implementation of the rights and protections conferred by the underlying statutes.  The ultimate responsibility for developing, issuing, and approving the rules would remain within the legislative branch. Regulations could gain the force of law if both Houses approved them and presented them to the President for signature.  Although the validity of the regulations could not be challenged upon their promulgation, they could be challenged collaterally by aggrieved employees during enforcement actions. Regulations adopted with the force of law could be challenged only on the basis of their constitutionality, and also only collaterally.  The bicameral and legislative enforcement approach contained in S. 2 is an effort to accommodate the views of those who adamantly oppose executive branch enforcement of these statutes. Some who oppose the interference of the executive branch claim that the Constitution prohibits the executive branch involvement that the private sector lives with under these laws.  Indeed, some of my colleagues maintain that judicial enforcement of these laws to Congress violates the separation of powers.  I am aware of no case law that establishes that subjecting Congress to the same executive and judicial branch enforcement mechanism that the private sector faces violates the Constitution.  And if it were entirely up to me, I suppose that I would have introduced as S. 2 a one-page bill that simply ended the exemptions and required Congress to live under the same laws that it passes for everyone else. I would have provided the same remedies for enforcement that apply outside Congress.  I would have executive branch enforcement of the laws, such as EEOC enforcement of the civil rights laws and Labor Department enforcement of the minimum wage laws.  However, S. 2 recognizes the strong feelings of the Members who disagree with me.  So long as the legislative branch agency enforcing the laws is not a tool of the Members, and so long as the underlying statutes are expressly incorporated through legislation to apply to Congress, the regulations must conform to the regulations, and the regulations can be challenged in court if they subvert the statutes that must apply to Congress, I am willing to accept legislative enforcement.  But that does not mean that I agree that there would be any constitutional impediment to executive branch enforcement. Indeed, I have always been puzzled by the separation of powers argument in the context of congressional coverage.  The Justice Department enforces the criminal laws against Members of Congress, and the courts hear such claims and render judgment. Surely imprisonment is a much greater intrusion against a Member than is a citation for an OSHA violation.  Nonetheless, in recognition of the strong feelings of some of my colleagues, S. 2 provides for administrative enforcement of these laws by an agency within the legislative branch. That requires that S. 2 be a lengthier bill. An administrative mechanism for enforcing 11 laws and permitting judicial review of the decision cannot be written on 1 piece of paper.                C. Claims procedures and judicial review  The new office would be responsible for handling and adjudicating employee claims where the underlying statute provides for a private right of action. An employee would first receive counseling and mediation services.  If the claim cannot be resolved at this stage, the employee could request that a hearing officer be assigned to conduct a formal administrative hearing on the employee's claim. After the hearing, either party could appeal to the board of directors. If necessary, they could than appeal the decision to the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Federal circuit.  In lieu of a hearing, the employee may bring an action in Federal district court. Allowing access to district courts makes the available remedies more like those available to both private-sector and executive-branch employees. Courts and judges do not have the complex interactions with Congress that executive agencies have, so the risk of intimidation would not arise.  Furthermore, politically motivated claims can be made in other forums, regardless of whether access to district court is allowed.  For claims arising under statutes that do not provide for a private right of action, the employee would proceed to the office to obtain counseling and mediation, as described above.  However, in lieu of the private right of action or executive branch administrative enforcement, the office, if the General Counsel so determined, would pursue the claim itself. The aggrieved party at the end of the administrative process could obtain court review of the decision with the court of appeals for the Federal circuit.                     D. Labor-management relations  In the context of the labor-management relations area, I am concerned that congressional coverage does not create any conflicts of interest. For example, there might be concern if legislative staff belonged to a union, that union might be able to exert undue influence over legislative activities or decisions.  Even if such a conflict of interest between employees' official duties and union membership did not actually occur, the mere appearance of undue influence or access might be very troubling. Furthermore, there is concern that labor actions could delay or disrupt vital legislative activities.  The bill would apply the Federal service labor management relations statute, rather than the private-sector National Labor Relations Act. The Federal service law includes provisions and precedents that address problems of conflict of interest in the governmental context and that prohibit strikes and slowdowns.  Furthermore, as an extra measure of precaution, the reported bill would not apply labor-management law to Members' personal or committee offices or other political offices until the board has conducted a special rulemaking to consider such problems as conflict of interest.  Those rules would also not go into effect until considered and enacted by Congress.                         E. Cost considerations  Some Members expressed concern that application of laws to the legislative branch would impose large and unpredictable costs on the taxpayer.  The Congressional Budget Office disagrees. The CBO cost estimate predicts costs of about $1 million in the first two fiscal years, and $4 to $5 million in subsequent years. However, unlike S. [[Page S445]] 2071, S. 2 does not permit covered employees to be offered compensatory time in lieu of overtime pay. That is the rule that applies to the private sector.  There might be some additional cost of complying with this provision. But with respect to employees whose work schedule is highly irregular because of the irregular Senate and House schedule, the board would develop comparable regulations to those governing private sector workers with irregular work hours.  Since the new leadership has committed itself to a more family hospitable work schedule, the amount of overtime is likely to be less in any event.  There will also be costs that CBO did not take into account because S. 2, unlike S. 2071, requires OSHA inspections.  However, the additional costs are likely to be small in relation to the normal sums Congress spends.                  F. Application to instrumentalities  In an attempt to bring order to the chaos of the way in which the relevant laws apply to congressional instrumentalities, S. 2 divides the instrumentalities into two groups.  The three largest instrumentalities, the General Accounting Office, Library of Congress, and Government Printing Office, already have coverage and enforcement systems that are identical or closely analogous to the executive branch agencies.  Notably, employees in each of these agencies already have the right to seek relief in the Federal courts for violations of the Civil Rights Act of 1964, the Age Discrimination in Employment Act, and the Fair Labor Standards Act, and they are covered under the same provisions of the Family and Medical Leave Act as executive branch employees.  Employees in each of these instrumentalities also already are assured of the right to bargain collectively, with a credible enforcement mechanism to protect that right. For these three instrumentalities, S. 2 clarifies existing coverage in certain respects, and expands coverage under the Americans with Disabilities Act.  It makes few changes with respect to the Government Printing Office because of separation of powers concerns raised by the Department of Justice that GPO is an executive branch agency that should not be under the supervision of a congressional office of compliance.  Additionally, S. 2 directs the administrative conference to study the application of each of these laws to these entities, and to make recommendations for any improvements in such regulations or procedures to ensure they are at least comparable to those required by this act. The board is directed to complete this study within 2 years after passage of this act.  The remaining instrumentalities, including the Architect of the Capitol, the Congressional Budget Office, and the Office of Technology Assessment, are brought within the same new rules, procedures, and remedies as this bill would apply for House of Representatives and Senate employers and employees.  This will allow for a consolidated application and administration of these laws. It will also extend to these employees, for the first time, the right to bargain collectively, and it will provide a means of enforcing compliance with these laws that is independent from the management of these instrumentalities.  For employers of these instrumentalities, by strengthening the enforcement mechanisms, this bill attempts to transform the patchwork of hortatory promises of coverage into a truly enforceable application of these laws.  Dividing the instrumentalities in this manner will reduce the adjudicatory burden on the new office of compliance by excluding from its jurisdiction the approximately 15,000 employees of GAO, GPO, and the Library of Congress.  It also has the advantage of using the apparatus that will already be necessary to apply these laws to the 20,000 employees of the House and Senate to the remaining approximately 3,000 employees of the Architect, Botanic Gardens, CBO, and OTA.  So, Mr. President, the time to act is now, and I urge my colleagues to vote for this bill without any undue delay.  Senator Glenn will probably tell us that years before I came to the Senate, through resolutions he tried to bring and did successfully try to bring attention to this matter on the floor of this body. When I first made that attempt several years ago, it failed, as did my attempt later on in 1989 to end this situation by amending the Americans With Disabilities Act. My amendment at that time was accepted by the then Senate leadership. But in a sense I think they did it because they knew that they would render it ineffective in conference, and it was rendered ineffective in Congress. At a later time I tried to correct this inequity, and I was not even allowed to offer my amendment to the family leave bill when it was first debated in the Senate in 1991.  Congress can no longer refuse to live by the laws that it passes. This bill ends that refusal. The time then is long overdue for Congress to correct that practice of congressional exemption, and this bill does that. It completes the process begun in 1991 when the Senate passed the Grassley-Mitchell amendment applying the substantive provisions of the civil rights law to the Senate. As I said back then, it was a good beginning, but it was only a beginning. So we are back today.  So it is with some measure of satisfaction that I find myself speaking in favor of a bill that would finally require Congress to comply with a host of employment laws that we have exempted ourselves from over four or five decades and that, during that period of time, have been applied to the entire private sector.  Mr. President, since the 1930's, Congress has passed laws that flowed from the assumption that Washington knows best. Congress set up burdensome statutory requirements on the operation of small business in this country. The burdens were increased through regulation issued by executive branch agencies albeit pursuant to the statute. At the same time Congress repeatedly exempted itself from the effects of those laws. Laws govern America but somehow do not apply the same way to employment practices on the Hill. Workers were granted rights but congressional workers were not. Those who made the laws did not have to live by them. Congress was immune from the excesses of the regulatory state. Congress was removed from the way its work affected everyone else. In other words, we, because those laws did not apply to us, did not really know how egregious they were upon the private sector employers of this country.  In this country no one is above the law. But just as the Presidency suffered a tremendous loss of public confidence when an individual thought he was above the law 20 years ago, Congress suffered as Members thought we were above the law by letting these exemptions or lack of applicability apply to us. Indeed, to me this was one of the major reasons why Congress has lost touch with the American people and people are cynical about the process of government, cynical about public servants doing well and intending well and understanding what needs to be done.  Of course, this exemption was one of the ways by which Congress has displayed arrogance. Millions of Americans complained about the overreach of the Federal Government. But Congress, through its exemption from the law, could not know the depth of feeling from the grassroots of America. So in November of every other year, the people have an opportunity to express their view. The American people in November 1994 demanded that Congress be affected by the laws it passed. A number of Members who thought Congress should be above the law are no longer Members, and, of course, no longer above the law.  Let me remind my colleagues of someone who lost an earlier election, former Senator George McGovern, because he has a very good lesson to teach us in regard to the exemption of ourselves from laws that apply to the private sector. Senator McGovern believes that Congress has enacted unnecessary regulatory burdens that are strangling small business. Senator McGovern admits that he did not feel that way when he was a Member of this body, but he learned the reality of the operation of that legislation when he ran a small business after he left public life. I appreciate that Senator McGovern now says that he would have legislated differently had he known what the actual effects would have been as [[Page S446]] he found them to be applicable to his small business.  But Members of Congress' learning of the effects of their votes only after leaving office will not solve our problem because after you leave office it is too late for you as an individual to do anything about it. Those of us who are here today can do something to end this unfair situation because only as Members of Congress live with the consequences of their votes will the problem that Senator McGovern identified be corrected. And I believe that S. 2 corrects that situation.  I think that President Clinton as well has this issue exactly right. When we send this bill to him I believe, based on what he has said in the past, he will sign it because he did state in a July 1992 interview:       It is wrong for Congress to be able to put new requirements      on American businesses, employers, and then not follow that      rule as employers themselves. They exempt themselves      historically from all kinds of rules that private employers      have to follow. And I think that one of the things that      happens to people in government is they forget what it is      like to be governed. They do not have any idea what it is      like to be on the receiving end of a lot of rules and      regulations.  That is President Clinton as Candidate Clinton. He could not have said it any better than any of us who believe this situation is wrong and why it ought to be ended. And I think that is a clear-cut statement that President Clinton would support our efforts today, and supporting those efforts then would sign the legislation that, hopefully, we will pass.  Of course, the Founding Fathers would have been astonished to know that Congress had exempted itself from so many laws that it passed applying to the private sector. James Madison in Federalist Paper 57 wrote about this issue. He wrote that one of the primary guarantees of people's liberty came from Congress having to live under the laws that we apply to the entire Nation. Madison wrote that:       Congress can pass no law which will not have its full      operation on themselves and their friends as well as on the      great mass of society. This has always been deemed one of the      strongest bonds by which human policy can connect the rulers      and the people together. It creates between them the      communion of interest of which few governments have furnished      examples but without which every government degenerates into      tyranny.      If this spirit ever were so debased as to tolerate a law not      obligatory on the legislature as well as on the people,      the people will be prepared to tolerate anything but      liberty.  That is Federalist Paper 57.  Mr. President, Madison was right. Of course, the low esteem in which Congress is currently held reflects the fact that there is no longer congruence of interest between the governors and the governed. The American people will no longer tolerate a law not obligatory on the legislature as well as the people. Under Madison's principle, because Members of Congress would be careful before they infringe their own liberties, the people's liberties would then be zealously protected.  Unfortunately, the corollary to that principle was equally true. Members of Congress who could protect their own liberties while infringing on the liberties of the mass of society were much more likely, then, to fail to protect everyone else's liberties. Congress enjoyed privilege through exemption. The time has come to end congressional royalism. The time has come then to simply say that there will no longer be an environment of two sets of laws in America--one for Pennsylvania Avenue and the other for the rest of the country, in Main Street America. No longer will there be two sets of laws, one for this town and this Hill and one for the rest of the country. One set of American people, one set of laws.  So now Congress must finally live under the same laws that pass for everyone else. We do this to fulfill Madison's promise of what was meant in the Constitution. And, thus, employees of Congress will finally gain the same rights that their counterparts in the private sector enjoy.  Like my colleagues, I take the notion of representative government very seriously. We are not Senators for ourselves. We do not hold this job as a matter of personal privilege. We are here to represent the interests of our constituents in our States and in our country. And we are here for no other reason. I think that exemptions from the operation of the law thus interfere with representative government. I wonder how we truly can represent people who live under one set of laws when we live under another set of laws. Under the current system, our votes on various regulatory issues reflect our interests and not those of our constituents. This must change if representative government is to truly function as intended by Madison.  When we pass this bill, we begin to restore the American people's faith in Congress. We will do so in five respects.  First, we will ensure that Members of Congress know firsthand the burdens that the private sector lives with. By knowing those burdens, Congress may decide that the laws indeed are burdensome. That realization may lead to necessary reform of the underlying legislation. It is true that there will be additional costs imposed on Congress if this legislation passes. However, these are costs that we must realize. We have to be cognizant of the fact that the private sector has to live with these costs and has had to do it in some instances for the last six or seven decades. And as far as the cost of this bill to Congress, the Congressional Budget Office estimated that cost of compliance will be about $3.4 billion. Now, while this is a considerable sum, Mr. President, it represents, for instance, only a fraction of the amount Congress recently voted in for a subway system to connect the Senate office buildings with the Capitol.  The second benefit of requiring that Congress live under the laws it passes for others concerns future social legislation. If Congress knows that it will be bound by what it passes, Congress will be very careful in the future to respect the liberties and rights of others.  Third, passage of the bill will mean that congressional employees will have the civil rights and social legislation that has ensured fair treatment to workers of the private sector. So then Congress thus becomes the last plantation for our workers. It is time for the plantation worker to be liberated. Maybe it is more accurate to say that Congress and the judiciary are the last two plantations. Senator Glenn stated that plantation point of view 20 years ago, so I give him credit for that.  Curiously, the only people who do not have to comply with the laws are those who make the laws and those who decide the cases under the laws, meaning the members of the judiciary. The judiciary has often interpreted legislation to be burdensome, and perhaps in some instances to be more burdensome than even the exempt Congress intended. Of course, an exempt judiciary has no reason to interpret the statute in a way to protect freedom. They will have to come up with a plan to provide coverage for their employees as well. I look forward to that proposal and to the legislation to cover the judiciary, which might then really be the last plantation.  The fourth general result of the legislation will be public recognition that Congress has again discovered that it is subject to the will of the people and not the other way around. Congress will no longer be above the law. Members of Congress will no longer be first-class citizens with unjustifiable special privileges.  Fifth, Members of Congress will learn themselves of the litigation explosion that is choking small business in this country. When Congress sees directly the litigation produced by the laws we pass, Congress will be very careful about creating additional liabilities for the private sector and additional work for the Federal courts. When Congress sees how alternative dispute resolutions operate, maybe Members of Congress will appreciate the wisdom then of encouraging additional alternative dispute resolution for all sorts of claims brought in the Federal courts, to reduce the burden of the Federal court, to have a way of settling disputes in a less adversarial environment and a les costly environment.  Every indication from polls, from election returns, and from our mail is that all of these show that nothing makes Americans more mad than knowing that they have to live by laws that their representatives in Congress do not have to follow. Of course, we believe they are well justified in their anger. When we pass this bill, we will show them that we recognize the unfairness of the existing exemptions and the legitimacy of their concerns.  [[Page S447]] Mr. President, S. 2, as we know, is the pending business, and it is the pending business under somewhat unusual circumstances, because it has not been considered by any committee in this Congress. Nonetheless, I want to say that it bears a very close resemblance to S. 2071 from the last Congress. That bill was the subject of hearings in the Governmental Affairs Committee, and it was approved by the committee before consideration. Unfortunately, it was not possible to consider the bill before Congress adjourned, despite the fact that the other body had overwhelmingly passed a similar piece of legislation.  So, Mr. President, in conclusion of my opening statement, the time is to act now. I hope that my colleagues will vote for this bill without any undue delay or any particular destructive amendments.  Senator Glenn is going to seek the floor in just a moment. As I indicated once before in this debate, when Senator Glenn was a freshman Member of this body he was aware of this inequitable situation. He has worked hard with lots of us and he worked hard before a lot of us came here to bring attention to this inequitable situation, unfair situation. Inequitable in the sense that we as employers do not have the same laws apply to us as private sector employers do, unfair in the sense that congressional employees and Hill employees do not have the same rights as private sector employees have under the employment and discrimination laws and safety laws that affect private--and that assures safety and employment fairness--sector employees.  Senator Glenn studied this issue hard, and I suppose in his early days even had more trouble than I did in trying to get the people to appreciate that this dual standard of law was wrong. But he had some resolutions passed very early. I want to commend him for using that method to try to rectify this situation for employees on the Hill. But most importantly, in the time that I have been in the Senate, I want to say that I have found Senator Glenn very cooperative with my efforts to extend these laws. I appreciate very much his efforts to do that.  I yield the floor.
