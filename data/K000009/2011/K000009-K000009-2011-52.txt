        International Brotherhood of Boilermakers, Iron Ship            Builders, Blacksmiths, Forgers & Helpers,                               Kansas City, KS, December 16, 2010.     House of Representatives,     Washington, DC.       Dear Representative: On behalf of the International      Brotherhood of Boilermakers, Iron Ship Builders, Blacksmiths,      Forgers and Helpers, I write to express our opposition to the      U.S.-Korea Free Trade Agreement (KORUS FTA). This misguided      agreement fails to address the long-standing concerns of      American workers, will result in more lost American      manufacturing jobs, and fails to establish an appropriate      model for sustainable global trade. At a time when so many      Americans are struggling in our weak economy, the KORUS FTA      is the last thing our nation can afford to pursue.       We continue to be disappointed the U.S. Trade      Representative has failed to negotiate positive changes in      core aspects of this agreement. The provisions on investment,      procurement, and services continue to constrain both      governments' ability to regulate in the public interest,      promote domestic job creation through responsible procurement      policies, and provide public services. The agreement's rules      on procurement have the potential to restrict policy goals of      vital importance to our union, including domestic sourcing      requirements. It is inappropriate for trade agreements to      restrict the ability of governments to invest tax dollars in      domestic job creation and promote legitimate social      objectives. In addition, the investment provisions of the      agreement include provisions that allow foreign investors to      claim rights above and beyond those granted to domestic      investors.       With respect to the labor chapter, no effort was made to      improve and strengthen the labor provisions with the Korean      Government. Contrary to popular belief, Korean labor laws      fail to conform to norms established by the International      Labor Organization (ILO). In fact, dozens of trade unionists      have been imprisoned for exercising basic labor rights.      Further, the Korean Government passed legislation several      years ago weakening basic labor protections, contrary to the      recommendations of the ILO.       This trade agreement--the most significant in over a      decade--fails to live up to the standards workers in both      countries deserve. During the 2008 Presidential campaign,      then candidate Obama promised to renegotiate the North      American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA). Instead, two years      later, the Obama administration is asking American workers to      once again turn a blind eye to yet another unfair and      unbalanced trade agreement. It is time to abandon the flawed      model on which the KORUS FTA is based, and move toward a new      policy that creates good jobs, benefits the U.S. economy as a      whole, and protects fundamental rights.       Thank you for your consideration of our views on this      important matter.           Sincerely,                                                  Newton B. Jones,                                          International President.
