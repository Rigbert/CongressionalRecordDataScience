President, Arlington Heights, IL, is known as the City of Good Neighbors--and if you ask people there who best embodies that spirit, there's a pretty good chance they'll answer: Mayor Arlene Mulder.  After 20 years as mayor and more than three decades serving her community, Mayor Mulder is retiring from public life in just a few weeks. I would like to personally acknowledge Arlene's significant contributions to the people of Arlington Heights, thank her for her good work, and wish her every success in the coming years.  Both in public service and private life, Mayor Mulder was always a good neighbor. She worked to reduce aircraft noise, improve air quality and quality of life for residents, and to redevelop Arlington Heights' downtown district.  Even outside her role as mayor, she always advocated for the people and businesses of Arlington Heights. As a member of the board of directors of Metra, Northeast Illinois' commuter rail system, Arlene worked to improve the region's transportation network because she understood that when cities and suburbs work together, everyone benefits.  Those who know her well have nothing but good things to say about her. She practices an inclusive brand of leadership to bring people together and get results, genuinely cares about her community, and she really listens to their needs.  I always knew that Arlene would aspire to the highest levels of professionalism in her work. She managed to conduct her work with a smile--which you could see often at any of the daily public appearances around town for which she is well known.  While Mayor Mulder is ending her career in public life to spend more time with her husband, children, and grandchildren, I know she'll continue to be a good neighbor to the Arlington Heights community. This is what she has always done. That is just who she is.                          ____________________
