I remember so well back when we had the proposal by the President to have Government take over a system that has been run well but needed some improvements, we committed ourselves at that time to incremental improvements.  I think the bill that is before us today is good. But I also think that the amendments that will be offered, some of the provisions of which the Senatorhas talked about, are going to make it better.
