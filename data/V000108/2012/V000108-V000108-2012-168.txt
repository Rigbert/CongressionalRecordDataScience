Speaker, it is with sincere respect that I rise to congratulate Reverend R.T. Mitchell, Pastor of New Revelation Missionary Baptist Church in Gary, Indiana, and his wife, Mrs. Irene Robinson Mitchell, on the occasion of their 50th wedding anniversary. The members of New Revelation will be honoring Reverend and Mrs. Mitchell with a celebration of their anniversary and the renewal of their marriage vows on Saturday, February 25, 2012, at The Chateau in Merrillville, Indiana.  Reverend Mitchell was born in Pittsview, Alabama, and graduated from Glenville High School. He continued his education at Moody Bible Institute and Indiana Christian Bible College, graduating with a degree in External Bible Study. The Pastor also holds a Bachelor of Theology degree and has pursued significant additional Evangelical studies.  Reverend Mitchell was called into the ministry in May 1975 before being ordained on April 6, 1977. On January 22, 1978, Reverend Mitchell became the Pastor of New Revelation Missionary Baptist Church and has served in that capacity for the past thirty-four years. During his time at New Revelation, Pastor Mitchell has taken on many responsibilities and had much success. He has served as President of the Baptist Ministers' Conference of Gary and Vicinity and as President of the Martin Luther King, Jr. Memorial Baptist State Convention of Indiana. Reverend Mitchell has also served on numerous boards and committees for organizations in Gary and throughout Northwest Indiana including: the Northwest Indiana Food Bank, the Thelma Marshall Children's Home, the Second Chance Foundation of Gary, and the Calumet Project. He currently serves on the City of Gary Zoning Board, and he has served as President of the Interfaith Federation Clergy Caucus and as a Chaplain of the Gary Police Department. Throughout the years, Reverend Mitchell has also been heavily involved with ministering to the incarcerated in his community. For his outstanding contributions to the community and his commitment to civil rights, in 2010, Reverend Mitchell was honored with the prestigious Drum Major Award by the Gary Frontiers Service Club at its annual Martin Luther King, Jr. Memorial Breakfast.  Mrs. Irene Mitchell, was born and raised in East Chicago, Indiana. As the youngest child of Albert Ervin and Mary Jane Robinson, she was born into a family that loved the Lord and served Him with joy. As a young person, Irene was a member of Ebenezer Baptist Church, where she participated in various organizations. Later on, she went on to serve as the President of the Gospel Chorus and was involved in Sunday School and with the Nurses.  Education has always been important to Mrs. Mitchell. Following her graduation from East Chicago Roosevelt High School, Mrs. Mitchell later attended Indiana University through its extension located in East Chicago and has earned her Certificate of Completion from Moody Bible Institute. Additionally, Mrs. Mitchell's devout faith and eagerness to learn has since led her to participate in numerous seminars and religious classes.  Mrs. Mitchell has served as President of the Minister Wives Coterie of Gary and as Secretary of the Martin Luther King, Jr. Memorial Baptist State Convention of Indiana, Women's Department. At New Revelation, she has also served as President of the General Mission and as Chairperson of New Revelation Youth Ministry, and she has also been involved with the Men and Women Day Service and One Church One School. In addition to various ministries in the community, Mrs. Mitchell is currently the Sunday School teacher at New Revelation and is a member of Ruth Circle and Christian Education.  Reverend and Mrs. Mitchell are the proud parents of two daughters, Arlene and Artice, and six adoring grandchildren: Robert, Jerrel, Jeremy, Christian, Ashton, and Isaiah.  My colleagues, Pastor and Mrs. Mitchell have led lives dedicated to Our Lord, to each other, and to their family. They have tirelessly ministered to their congregation and have selflessly given of themselves, their time, and their talents to the greater community of Northwest Indiana. Few remain untouched by their generous natures and limitless devotion to be of service. I am very fortunate and proud to consider them friends.  Mr. Speaker, I am proud to consider Reverend R.T. Mitchell and his wonderful life companion, Irene, as my friends. At this time I ask that you and my other distinguished colleagues join me in congratulating Reverend and Mrs. Mitchell as they celebrate their 50th wedding anniversary. Their unselfish and lifelong dedication to their church, their community, and to each other, is worthy of our admiration, and I wish them many more happy years to come.                          ____________________
