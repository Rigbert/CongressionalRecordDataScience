Chairman, I rise in opposition to the amendments offered by the gentleman from New York. Quite simply, they threaten our long-term future. This amendment will transfer $344 million out of NASA's Human Space Flight account and put it in HUD's Section 8 program.  The space program is part of our national science and technology enterprise. We all know that our current economy owes much of its success to forty years of federal investments in science and technology. That federal effort generates the pre-competitive breakthroughs in science and technology that make day-to-day applications possible in the future. Because that benefit is long-term, most of us will not be in this Chamber to see the benefits of the decisions we make today, just as the Members who nurtured our science and technology program forty years ago have left this body to enjoy the political benefits of their support for the space program. Thus, there's little political payoff in advocating science and technology.  That's why science and technology demand statesmanship and long-term vision. Federal investments serve the good of the country and the future of our grandchildren. Fortunately, this Chamber has repeatedly demonstrated the long-term vision needed for our nation's science and technology programs in space. It did so last year by rejecting similar amendments and preserving funding for the space program. It should do so again this year, by maintaining the space program as a high priority and voting against the Nadler amendment.
