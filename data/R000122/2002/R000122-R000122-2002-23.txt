President, Rhode Island has lost a valiant son, the Nation has lost a heroic Marine and thousands of my neighbors have lost a true and faithful friend.  On September 13, 2002, Harry Kizirian died. His name in Rhode Island is synonymous with selfless service, love of country, commitment to family and unshakeable loyalty to his faith and to his friends.  Harry was born on July 13, 1925 at 134 Chad Brown Street in Providence, RI. He was the proud son of Armenian immigrants. His father and mother, Toros and Horopig Kizirian, came to Americato seek a better life for themselves and their family. They had endured the horror of the Armenian genocide, each losing their spouse and many in their families. In America, they hoped to find the opportunity and the tolerance that is so rare in the world. In their son, Harry, they would see the fulfillment of the great promise that America offers to the brave and the noble of heart.  Harry's youth in the vibrant Armenian community of Chad Brown Street was profoundly changed when, at the age of 15, his father died. Harry became the man of the house. While he continued his education at Mount Pleasant High School, he worked lugging beef and unloading freight cars at a meat packing plant on Canal Street. Despite his long hours of work, he still threw the hammer and put the shot for Mount Pleasant High School and captained the football team to boot.  A high school football referee, impressed with Harry's dedication and demeanor, suggested that he seek work at the Providence post office. Harry secured a temporary position sweeping floors as he finished his last two years of high school.  Harry Kizirian came of age as America faced the danger and challenge of World War II. Like so many of his generation, Harry did not hesitate to serve. He joined the United States Marine Corps the day after he graduated from high school.  After his training, Harry found himself in the first assault wave attacking Okinawa. He was 19 years old. While leading a fire team in the assault, he charged an enemy position that was pinning down a Marine platoon. He received multiple fragmentation wounds in the arms and shoulders but continued to press the attack. Eventually, he was evacuated for treatment. A month later, he returned to action.  And, he would see fearsome action in the climatic battles to secure Okinawa.  In June of 1945, Harry's unit moved to attack entrenched Japanese soldiers along a ridgeline. Corporal Kizirian observed six Marine stretcher bearers pinned down by enemy fire as they were trying to evacuate a wounded Marine. With utter disregard for his own safety, Harry placed himself in the line of fire and single-handedly attacked the enemy emplacement. Although wounded in the leg and groin, he continued the attack by dragging his body along by his elbows. He overwhelmed the position and killed the 12 enemy defenders.  For his service and sacrifice on Okinawa, Harry Kizirian was awarded the Navy Cross, two Purple Hearts, the Bronze Star with V device for Valor, the Presidential Unit Citation, the Navy Unit Citation and the Rhode Island Cross, the State's highest award for valor.  Harry was discharged from the Marine Corps in 1946 and returned to Rhode Island and to the post office. But he still bore the scars of battle. For 4 years after his discharge, Harry was in and out of Veteran's Hospitals for treatment of his wounds.  Harry's return to civilian ranks gave him a chance to meet the love of his life, Hazel Serabian. Hazel tells the story that, the first time she saw Harry, he was staring at her from the cover of The New York Times Sunday Magazine. He was featured as one of the young heroes of the Pacific battles. She later met this handsome Marine as he stopped in her hometown en route to visit the family of a fellow Marine who had died in combat. In my humble opinion, it was love at first sight and love for evermore.  Their love produced a family of wonderful sons and daughters: Tom and Richard, Joanne, Shakay and Janice. They continue the proud tradition of Harry and Hazel as public-spirited citizens in their own right. And the newest generation of Kizirians includes eight grandchildren who grew under the watchful eye and enormous love of their grandfather.  Harry, with a young family to feed, applied himself with his characteristic sincerity and diligence at the post office. But he brought something else and something special to his job: a joy of working with the men and women of the Postal Service and of helping to serve the people of Rhode Island.  Harry became the Postmaster in Providence in 1961 and led the Postal Service in Rhode Island at a time of great change. Rhode Island was one of the first postal districts in the country to build a central, automated postal facility. Harry was the key individual in opening this facility and making it work.  His leadership style was hands-on and personal. He knew the Providence post office's thousand employees by their first names. He patrolled the facility in his customary attire of suit and running shoes as he made sure that the work was done and the workers were recognized. His co-workers were a larger extension of his own family, and he followed their ups and downs with the same interest and involvement that he lavished on his own family. He established a bond of trust and love that still today is unique and enduring.  In 1986, the Postal Service announced that Harry would be ``reorganized'' out of the job. The announcement led to a flurry of activity by Senator John Chafee and Senator Claiborne Pell but to no avail. The Postal Service did not relent. The announcement was greeted by his co-workers with weeping. They weren't losing just an admired boss; they were losing a friend.  In October of 1986, two thousand of his friends and co-workers honored him at a testimonial.  One of his dearest friends, Senator John O. Pastore, paid him a special tribute. Forty years before, then Governor John O. Pastore pinned the Rhode Island Cross on Harry Kizirian. In earlier remarks, Senator Postore said simply, ``I have never met in my life anyone who has had a bad word to say about Harry Kizirian,'' And Senator Pastore's words were and are beyond reproach.  I was honored to be appointed to West Point by Senator Pastore. Both Harry and I shared a profound respect for this great man who served with extraordinary distinction in the Senate.  Harry's departure from the Postal Service merely redirected his great passion for public service to numerous other civic endeavors, including Big Brothers, the Veterans Home in Bristol, RI and the Heart Association.  When asked once about his extraordinary generosity and public service, Harry said, ``You know, the track is short; when you can help people, do it.''  I really got to know Harry in 1990 when I campaigned for my first term in Congress.  I knew about the legendary Harry Kizirian; everyone in Rhode Island knew about and admired Harry. I met him several times at meetings of postal workers. He still stayed close to his co-workers. By this time, Harry's sight was impaired. He would sit at the table and you would approach him for a word. He grasped your hand with authority and his voice was strong, but his whole demeanor was one of gentleness and consideration.  I will never forget at one of these meetings days before the election. As postal worker after postal worker approached him to thank him for countless kindnesses and asked what they could do for him, Harry said, ``if you want to do something for me, vote for this kid, Reed.''  I have never received a greater or more meaningful endorsement. His faith in me gave me great faith in myself. But, after all, that is what Harry did all of his life. He made us stronger and better because he was behind us and shared with us his strength and his decency.  In May of 1996, Rhode Islanders had a chance to honor Harry. On that day, the central Post Office in Providence, the ``house that Harry built'', was dedicated as the ``Harry Kizirian Post Office Building.'' Senator John H. Chafee sponsored the legislation in the Senate, and I sponsored the legislation in the House.  We were honored to have General Chuck Krulak, the Commandant of the Marine Corps, as a principal speaker. General Krulak captured the essence of Harry Kizirian when he said ``Harry was motivated by a selfless desire to help his fellow countrymen.'' General Krulak added a sentiment that we all felt. ``It is impossible not to admire, to respect and yes, coming from this tough Marine, to love Harry Kizirian. You have made a difference.''  A few days after I learned of Harry's death, I was attending the Fall Harvest Festival in my hometown of Cranston, Rhode Island. I encountered a gentleman and we began to talk. He quickly told me that we had both lost a goodfriend, Harry Kizirian. The gentleman was a postal worker who had spent many years working for Harry. With gestures more than words, he expressed the sense of loss tempered by love and admiration that we all felt; a fitting epitaph, the unadorned and heartfelt words and sentiments of one of his workers, more poignant and profound then any sermon or speech.  When our colleague John Chafee died, I recalled these lines from the Irish poet, William Butler Yeats, fitting words for another Marine who goes to his rest.     The man is gone who guided ye, unweary, through the long            bitter way.     Ye by the waves that close in our sad nation,     Be full of sudden fears,     The man is gone for his lonely station . . .     Mourn--and then onward, there is no returning     He guides ye from the tomb;     His memory now is a tall pillar, burning     Before us in the gloom!  Harry's memory warms our heart and lights our way.  He was a man who saw hard times, but refused to allow them to extinguish his generous spirit. He was a man who saw war in all its horror, but refused to surrender his soul to its brutality. He was a strong man, not for the sake of intimidation, but because he knew that true strength allows a man to be truly compassionate. He was humble. His greatest source of pride was the success of others, particularly his family. His memory, his example, sustains us and inspires us.  I close with the words of a song that I am sure Harry knew.     If the Army and the Navy     Ever look on Heaven's scenes     They will find the streets are guarded by     United States Marines  Harry Kizirian, United States Marine Corps, has joined that Heavenly guard mount.  Mr. President, I yield the floor.
