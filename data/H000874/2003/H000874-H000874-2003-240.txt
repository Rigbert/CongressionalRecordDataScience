Chairman, I rise to talk about the Obey amendment which will be offered shortly. The Obey amendment puts before the Congress of the United States, before our Republican colleagues and before our Democrat colleagues, the question of what options do we want to pursue. The gentleman from California (Mr. Cox) has said that the most important objective is keeping our homeland secure, keeping America and Americans safe.  The Obey amendment says do you care more about giving tax cuts to those at the very upper ranks of taxpayers, or do you care about keeping ports, airports, bridges and roads secure? It is a very simple question. It is a question, though, all of us must answer; and we must answer them with the responsibility to the American public that we have uppermost in our minds.  Mr. Chairman, I urge my colleagues, I urge this House to allow the gentleman from Wisconsin (Mr. Obey) to offer this amendment and to support this amendment and to say to America, we are prepared to protect you.
