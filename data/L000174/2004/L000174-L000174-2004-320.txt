President, I am pleased to cosponsor the Koby Mandell Act of 2003. This bill is intended to ensure that all terrorists who commit violent acts against American citizens overseas are punished to the full extent of the law. I have already been working to ensure that the Koby Mandell Act is considered by the Senate and, I expect passed into law.  Three years ago, Koby Mandell was beaten to death in a cave near the Jewish settlement of Tekoa on the West Bank in Israel. Koby Mandell was 13 years old. No one was caught or charged with responsibility for this murder. This tragic story is only one among dozens in which U.S. citizens have been harmed by terrorists, and the U.S. Government has been hindered in its ability to hunt down and prosecute the criminals.  The bill would establish within the Department of Justice an office to ensure that all American citizens who are killed or injured by terrorists operating overseas receive equal treatment by the U.S. Government in its efforts to solve the crime and bring the perpetrators to justice. There would be no difference among cases based on the origin of the terrorists or where they carry out their heinous acts. The investigators and prosecutors associated with this new DOJ office could investigate each incident aggressively, whether the victim is a diplomat, a volunteer teacher like Ted Burgon of Oregon, who was killed in Indonesia in 2002, or a child like Koby Mandell.  Specifically, this bill will create the Office of Justice for Victims of Overseas Terrorism. The Office will ensure that rewards are offered for the capture of terrorists involved in attacks that harm American citizens. It will advertise such rewards and publicize the names and photos of suspects. The Office will establish a notification system to keep victims' families updated on the status of investigations and efforts to capture suspects in each case. It will seek to ensure that suspects are not able to obtain visas to travel to the U.S. In addition, the Office will seek to determine if terrorist suspects who are believed to have participated in attacks on American citizens are employed by local or national police forces. If it finds that suspects are so employed, the Office will seek to curtail any American foreign assistance to those forces. Finally, the Office will undertake a comprehensive assessment of indictments and prosecutions by the U.S. Government against suspected terrorists. It will seek to identify any patterns that would determine the reasons for the absence of indictments in certain cases or in certain countries. This assessment will be conveyed to the Attorney General with recommendations for correcting any shortcomings in attempts to pursue, capture, and prosecute suspects.  Just as we must do all we can to prevent terrorist attacks from occurring on our soil, we must take additional steps to protect our citizens from attack overseas. Where they are targeted and harmed, it is the duty of the U.S. Government to pursue each case of murder or injury vigorously until every terrorist knows that he or she will not escape justice. The Koby Mandell Act is a step toward honoring those who have been lost or harmed, and a step toward deterring future attacks. I am honored to join Senator Smith, Senator Wyden, and the other sponsors of this measure as a cosponsor.                          ____________________
