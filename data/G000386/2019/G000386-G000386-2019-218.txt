 The men and women of law enforcement make sacrifices every day to protect their families and fellow citizens. We are indebted to their dedication.  I want to express my appreciation for each and every police officer, firefighter, first responder, and other law enforcement officers who work diligently to protect our friends and families.  All of those visiting Washington this week to commemorate National Police Week, if you get a chance to see them on the streets of Washington, DC, thank them for their service.  I yield the floor.  I suggest the absence of a quorum.
