 Mr. DeLAY. Mr. Speaker, I thank the distinguished whip for yielding to me.  Mr. Speaker, next week the House will convene on Tuesday at 12:30 p.m. for morning hour and 2 p.m. for legislative business. We will consider severalmeasures under suspension of rules. A final list of these bills will be sent to Members' offices by the end of this week. Any votes called on these measures will be rolled until 6:30 p.m. on Tuesday.  On Wednesday and Thursday, the House will convene at 10 a.m. We plan to consider H.R. 4181, which would permanently remove the marriage tax penalty from the Internal Revenue Code. In addition, we expect to consider a short-term extension of the highway bill, as the current extension expires at the end of this month.  Finally, I would like to remind all Members that we do not plan to have votes next Friday, April 30.
