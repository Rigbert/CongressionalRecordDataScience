We are now 9\1/2\ months into pursuing that objective and it has not happened yet, but perhaps it will.  But let me ask the gentleman more pointedly, I suppose, as it relates to the length of the CR, it is my understanding that there was some expression from the highest junctures of leadership in his party that a lame duck session was not particularly favored by the leadership but we hear rumors about possibly having a lame duck, that possibly being sometime in mid-November when his organization and probably ours will be scheduled. Can the gentleman shed any light on his current thinking, in light of the fact we have 15 days left to go in the fiscal year and about, I suppose, another 20 or 25 days left before we presumably will recess or adjourn prior to the elections, as to whether or not there is a substantial probability or possibility of a lame duck session?
