 President, I am deeply troubled by new information reported in the New York Times and elsewhere linking the CIA to those responsible for the murders of United States citizen Michael DeVine and Efrain Bamaca Velasquez, the Guatemalan husband of United States citizen Jennifer Harbury. At this point, we do not have all the facts necessary to get a full picture of what occurred, but these preliminary reports raise serious questions.  For most of the last 30 years, systematic human rights violations have been committed with impunity against Guatemalan civilians. The political repression and deplorable practices of the Guatemalan military--extrajudicial killings, political kidnappings, and death threats--have taken the lives of at least 100,000 citizens since the early 1980's.  It is because of Guatemala's miserable human rights record that I have closely followed the cases involving U.S. citizens, including the case of Jennifer Harbury's husband and Michael Devine. Over the last 2 years, I have taken several steps to find information regarding the whereabouts and status of Mr. Bamaca, Mr. DeVine and others who have disappeared or been murdered in Guatemala. I have written letters or inquiry to the President, the National Security Council, and to the President of Guatemala, Ramiro De Leon Carpio, expressing my concern with these cases. Last year, I also introduced legislation urging the need for greater protection of human rights in Guatemala.  Throughout these efforts, and specifically on the case of Jennifer Harbury, I have been told that every attempt was being made to investigate her case, so that she could finally know the fate of her husband. Likewise, Congress has pressed time and again to resolve the questions surrounding the killing of Michael DeVine, an American innkeeper who was brutally murdered in Guatemala in 1990.  And now it is being reported that a Guatemalan Army colonel linked to the deaths of Michael Devine and Jennifer Harbury's husband was, in fact, employed by the CIA and twice trained by the United States Army.  According to Thomas Stroock, who served as United States Ambassador to Guatemala from 1989 til 1992, our Embassy, having investigated Mr. DeVine's murder, came to the conclusion that Col. Julio Roberto Alpirez was behind it. Reportedly, Ambassador Stroock then told his staff at the Embassy that they were to have nothing more to do with the colonel. Nonetheless, reports indicate that the CIA station chief in Guatemala keep Col. Alpirez on the payroll for nearly 2 more years. The reports go on to indicate that much later the CIA, in 1992, paid Alpirez a lump sum of $44,000 for intelligence work done for the Agency, nearly 46 times the average yearly income in Guatemala. If these reports are true, it is difficult to understand how and why the policy carried out by the CIA was so clearly at odds with the policy established years earlier by the U.S. Ambassador. How could the CIA justify providing U.S. taxpayer dollars to this criminal? And whom did the CIA station chief answer to, if not the U.S. Ambassador?  The Clinton administration must continue to push the Guatemalan Government to prosecute Alpirez and any others who were involved in these murders. And if the reports I have described here are true, the CIA must be held accountable for their deeply troubling involvement.  It is equally of concern to me that Col. Alpirez evidently oversaw the killing of Michael DeVine just 6 months after Alpirez had graduated from an elite course for senior officers at the School of the Americas, a U.S. Army School in Fort Benning, GA. It was the second time that U.S. taxpayers paid to train Col. Alpirez, who evidently then went on to thank this country by ordering the murder of one of our own citizens.  [[Page S4756]] It remains unclear how long and for what reasons the CIA knew information related to the fate of Jennifer Harbury's husband, and withheld it from those within the administration who had explicitly sought it.  Serious questions have been raised about the CIA's involvement in both of these cases, and a full accounting is in order. Congressman Torricelli, in making information related to these cases public, has said, ``This is the single worst example of the intelligence community being beyond civilian control and operating against our national interest.''  A central United States objective in Guatemala is to contribute to an improved human rights environment in that troubled nation. If the reports of recent days are true, then clearly the CIA has failed to embrace this goal and may, in fact, be part of the problem in Guatemala. Mr. President, Congress and the taxpayers deserve answers to all of these questions.                          ____________________
