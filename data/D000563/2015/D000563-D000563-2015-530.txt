If the Senator acknowledges--and I believe she does--that the President had the authority in 2012 to issue an Executive order under DACA and to spell out the criteria, which includes, at the very bottom of her chart, that the person is not above the age of 30, why does the Senator disagree with this situation: someone who was 29 years old in June 2012, eligible for DACA, the Executive order, and now it is 2\1/2\ years later, and the President tried to amend in November 2014 that last line to expand it so that those who have aged out would still have a chance because Congress has not acted otherwise. Why would the Senator from Maine draw that distinction saying that the President has the authority to write this order but not the authority to amend this order?
