Speaker, I rise today to honor and pay tribute to Geraldo ``Jerry'' Puga, who passed away in California on Saturday, July 7, 2018. Jerry was a small business owner in the City of Corona, an active member of our community, and he will be deeply missed.  As a young child, Jerry's family lived in Alberhill where his father worked in clay products manufacturing. The Pug as moved to Corona when Jerry was 10. When he was finished with school, he followed his father into clay manufacturing. Later, Jerry began his career in floor coverings at Larry Graebner's Furniture in Corona. In 1960, Jerry and his partner, the late Frank Addleman, opened the doors to Jerry & Frank's Carpets in Corona. For over 50 years, Jerry spent his professional life in the carpet/floor covering business.  While conducting business at a local bank, Jerry met Andrea Martinez, whom he married in 1970. They became business partners, with Andrea instituting home decorating. The business changed its name to Jerry Carpets & Interiors and opened in the Corona Mall. Jerry was an active member of the Corona Rotary and participated in numerous local charitable causes. After serving customers in six decades, Jerry retired in 2008. The Corona Chamber of Commerce honored Jerry in January 2018 with its Lifetime Achievement Award.  I extend my heartfelt condolences to Andrea Puga, the entire Puga family, his friends, and everyone fortunate enough to know Jerry. Although Jerry may be gone, the many contributions he made to our community will have a lasting impact.                          ____________________
