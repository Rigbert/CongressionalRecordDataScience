 This from a follow constituent of ours who writes:       My father began his Kentucky Fried Chicken business with      the colonel himself, and with the colonel's family. We      proudly served Colonel Sander's original recipe for 40 years.      It saddens me, however well intentioned, that this law will      undermine my ability to provide employment. It will deplete      resources that could otherwise be used to grow my business.  The Senator and I both have heard from a lot of Kentucky business people indicating, as this KFC franchisee underscores, the impact of this on the private sector.
