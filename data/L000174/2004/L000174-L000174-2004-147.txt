President, we are talking about people who attempt to discover and prevent immigration fraud, prevent dangerous people from abusing the immigration system. This is inherently governmental. We have kept inherently governmental things like law enforcement within the Government. We should do it here with these 1,200 immigration information officers who contact representatives around the Nation. We have an inherent body of expertise that we need in this fight against terrorism.  I yield back my remaining time and ask for the yeas and nays.
