President, last night, the National Museum of Women in the Arts hosted a screening of the documentary entitled, Crisis: Behind a Presidential Commitment. As we prepare to observe the 50th Anniversary of the March on Washington, this important film focuses on four individuals who will forever be connected with the battle for racial equality and the pursuit of Dr. Martin Luther King's dream. I want to recognize one of those individuals, Vivian Malone Jones.  Ms. Malone was one of two brave African-American students to enroll at the University of Alabama in 1963, despite the threat of Alabama Governor George C. Wallace to stop integration at ``the schoolhouse door.'' The picture of Ms. Malone walking into the University of Alabama, flanked by National Guard troops, is an iconic image that is forever etched in our Nation's memory.  Ms. Malone grew up in the racially segregated city of Mobile, AL. She was just 12 years old when the Supreme Court ruled segregation unconstitutional in Brown v. Board of Education. The historic decision inspired Ms. Malone, who as a National Honor Society student in high school committed herself to efforts ending segregation. She went on to become one of the most important civil rights figures in our country's history.  In her lifetime, Ms. Malone personified dignity and strength. She also lived history. The day after she and classmate James Hood were escorted into the University's Foster Auditorium by the National Guard and Deputy Attorney General Nicholas Katzenbach, seeking to enroll in classes, civil rights leader Medgar Evers was shot and killed in Mississippi. This only made Ms. Malone more determined. She once said that she ``decided not to show any fear and went to class that day.'' While an undergraduate student, she found a community of support andfriendship among fellow members of Delta Sigma Theta Sorority--the Nation's largest predominately African-American women's organization. And in 1965, she became the first African American to graduate from the University of Alabama, earning a degree in Business Management.  Ms. Malone was not just a symbol of courage; she also set an example of forgiveness. In 1996 Governor Wallace, who 3 decades earlier stood in the entryway to the university's auditorium, flanked by State troopers, to prevent Ms. Malone from enrolling, awarded her with the first Lurleen B. Wallace Award for Courage. Later recalling their conversation, Ms. Malone said that she simply spoke with Governor Wallace about forgiveness.  Throughout her life, Ms. Malone was dedicated to the preservation and enforcement of our civil rights laws. After graduation, she worked for the U.S. Department of Justice in the Civil Rights Division. In 1977, she took over as Executive Director for the Voter Education Project following the resignation of another civil rights legend, Congressman John Lewis. Eventually, Ms. Malone rose to become a Director of Civil Rights and Urban Affairs for the Environmental Protection Agency in Atlanta, GA, before retiring there in 1996.  In 2000, she gave the commencement address at the University of Alabama and advised the new graduates: ``If there is any lesson for the graduates to take from my experience, it is that you must always be ready to seize the moment.'' Ms. Malone passed away on October 15, 2005, but her legacy continues. It lives on through her children, grandchildren, and siblings. It also lives on through the important work of her brother-in-law, Attorney General Eric Holder. He has done so much in the past 5 years to return the Civil Rights Division to its core mission. I have no doubt that his sense of purpose is informed by the proud history of the Malone family including his sister-in-law, Vivian, and his wife, Dr. Sharon Malone.  As we honor our Nation's civil rights heroes in preparation for next month's momentous anniversary of Dr. King's ``I Have a Dream'' speech and the historic March on Washington, let us honor another courageous icon who told those University of Alabama graduates in 2000, ``You may not live in a time of great social change as I did, but you will just as certainly face moral choices.'' I hope Ms. Malone's courage, determination, and forgiveness will serve as a guiding light for generations to come, and to make the right moral choices in our own lives.                          ____________________
