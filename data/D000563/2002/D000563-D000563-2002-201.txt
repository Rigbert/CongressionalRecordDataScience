But is it not true that a drug such asClaritin, made by Schering-Plough, which is for allergies, widely advertised across the United States, when the patent on that drug expires, other drug companies can make the Claritin formula and sell it? It is exactly the same as the prescription drug that has been sold under patent for years and years, and that what you are talking about is making certain that kind of drug, generic drug, at a lower cost, is available to consumers across America so they can cut their drug bills and still have the same drug, which, under patent for years and years, was advertised as the very best for allergies and problems such as that?
