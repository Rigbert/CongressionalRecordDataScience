President, the economists Linda Bilmes and Joseph Stiglitz recently produced an illuminating analysis of the real costs of the war in Iraq, which was published last Sunday in The Washington Post.  As the war grinds on toward its fifth year, and as the war continues to warp our Nation's priorities at home and abroad, this is an analysis that every American deserves to see. I also commend it to the attention of the Members of the Senate.  I ask unanimous consent it be printed in the Record.  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in the Record, as follows:                [From the Washington Post, Mar. 9, 2008]          The Iraq War Will Cost Us $3 Trillion, and Much More              (By Linda J. Bilmes and Joseph E. Stiglitz)       There is no such thing as a free lunch, and there is no      such thing as a free war. The Iraq adventure has seriously      weakened the U.S. economy, whose woes now go far beyond loose      mortgage lending. You can't spend $3 trillion--yes, $3      trillion--on a failed war abroad and not feel the pain at      home.       Some people will scoff at that number, but we've done the      math. Senior Bush administration aides certainly pooh-poohed      worrisome estimates in the run-up to the war. Former White      House economic adviser Lawrence Lindsey reckoned that the      conflict would cost $100 billion to $200 billion; Defense      Secretary Donald H. Rumsfeld later called his estimate      ``baloney.'' Administration officials insisted that the costs      would be more like $50 billion to $60 billion. In April 2003,      Andrew S. Natsios, the thoughtful head of the U.S. Agency for      International Development, said on ``Nightline'' that      reconstructing Iraq would cost the American taxpayer just      $1.7 billion. Ted Koppel, in disbelief, pressed Natsios on      the question, but Natsios stuck to his guns. Others in the      administration, such as Deputy Defense Secretary Paul D.      Wolfowitz, hoped that U.S. partners would chip in, as they      had in the 1991 Persian Gulf War, or that Iraq's oil would      pay for the damages.       The end result of all this wishful thinking? As we approach      the fifth anniversary of the invasion, Iraq is not only the      second longest war in U.S. history (after Vietnam), it is      also the second most costly--surpassed only by World War II.       Why doesn't the public understand the staggering scale of      our expenditures? In part because the administration talks      only about the upfront costs, which are mostly handled     by emergency appropriations. (Iraq funding is apparently      still an emergency five years after the war began.) These      costs, by our calculations, are now running at $12 billion a      month--$16 billion if you include Afghanistan. By the time      you add in the costs hidden in the defense budget, the money      we'll have to spend to help future veterans, and money to      refurbish a military whose equipment and materiel have been      greatly depleted, the total tab to the federal government      will almost surely exceed $1.5 trillion.       But the costs to our society and economy are far greater.      When a young soldier is killed in Iraq or Afghanistan, his or      her family will receive a U.S. government check for just      $500,000 (combining life insurance with a ``death      gratuity'')--far less than the typical amount paid by      insurance companies for the death of a young person in a car      accident. The stark ``budgetary cost'' of $500,000 is clearly      only a fraction of the total cost society pays for the loss      of life--and no one can ever really compensate the families.      Moreover, disability pay seldom provides adequate      compensation for wounded troops or their families. Indeed, in      one out of five cases of seriously injured soldiers, someone      in their family has to give up a job to take care of them.       But beyond this is the cost to the already sputtering U.S.      economy. All told, the bill for the Iraq war is likely to top      $3 trillion. And that's a conservative estimate.       President Bush tried to sell the American people on the      idea that we could have a war with little or no economic      sacrifice. Even after the United States went to war, Bush and      Congress cut taxes, especially on the rich--even though the      United States already had a massive deficit. So the war had      to be funded by more borrowing. By the end of the Bush      administration, the cost of the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan,      plus the cumulative interest on the increased borrowing used      to fund them, will have added about $1 trillion to the      national debt.       The long-term burden of paying for the conflicts will      curtail the country's ability to tackle other urgent      problems, no matter who wins the presidency in November. Our      vast and growing indebtedness inevitably makes it harder to      afford new health-care plans, make large-scale repairs to      crumbling roads and bridges, or build better-equipped      schools. Already, the escalating cost of the wars has crowded      out spending on virtually all other discretionary federal      programs, including the National Institutes of Health, the      Food and Drug Administration, the Environmental Protection      Agency, and federal aid to states and cities, all of which      have been scaled back significantly since the invasion of      Iraq.       To make matters worse, the U.S. economy is facing a      recession. But our ability to implement a truly effective      economic-stimulus package is crimped by expenditures of close      to $200 billion on the two wars this year alone and by a      skyrocketing national debt.       The United States is a rich and strong country, but even      rich and strong countries squander trillions of dollars at      their peril. Think what a difference $3 trillion could make      for so many of the United States'--or the world's--problems.      We could have had a Marshall Plan to help desperately poor      countries, winning the hearts and maybe the minds of Muslim      nations now gripped by anti-Americanism. In a world with      millions of illiterate children, we could have achieved      literacy for all--for less than the price of a month's combat      in Iraq. We worry about China's growing influence in Africa,      but the upfront cost of a month of fighting in Iraq would pay      for more than doubling our annual current aid spending on      Africa.       Closer to home, we could have funded countless schools to      give children locked in the underclass a shot at decent      lives. Or we could have tackled the massive problem of Social      Security, which Bush began his second term hoping to address;      for far, far less than the cost of the war, we could have      ensured the solvency of Social Security for the next half a      century or more.       Economists used to think that wars were good for the      economy, a notion born out of memories of how the massive      spending of World War II helped bring the United States and      the world out of the Great Depression. But we now know far      better ways to stimulate an economy--ways that quickly      improve citizens' well-being and lay the foundations for      future growth. But money spent paying Nepalese workers in      Iraq (or even Iraqi ones) doesn't stimulate the U.S. economy      the way that money spent at home would--and it certainly      doesn't provide the basis for long-term growth the way      investments in research, education or infrastructure would.       Another worry: This war has been particularly hard on the      economy because it led to a spike in oil prices. Before the      2003 invasion, oil cost less than $25 a barrel, and futures      markets expected it to remain around there. (Yes, China and      India were growing by leaps and bounds, but cheap supplies      from the Middle East were expected to meet their demands.)      The war changed that equation, and oil prices recently topped      $100 per barrel.       While Washington has been spending well beyond its means,      others have been saving--including the oil-rich countries      that, like the oil companies, have been among the few winners      of this war. No wonder, then, that China, Singapore and many      Persian Gulf emirates have become lenders of last resort for      troubled Wall Street banks, plowing in billions of dollars to      shore up Citigroup, Merrill Lynch and other firms that burned      their fingers on subprime mortgages. How long will it be      before the huge sovereign wealth funds controlled by these      countries begin buying up large shares of other U.S. assets?       The Bush team, then, is not merely handing over the war to      the next administration; it is also bequeathing deep economic      problems that have been seriously exacerbated by reckless war      financing. We face an economic downturn that's likely to be      the worst in more than a quarter-century.       Until recently, many marveled at the way the United States      could spend hundreds of billions of dollars on oil and blow      through hundreds of billions more in Iraq with what seemed to      be strikingly little short-run impact on the economy. But      there's no great mystery here. The economy's weaknesses were      concealed by the Federal Reserve, which pumped in liquidity,      and by regulators that looked away as loans were handed out      well beyond borrowers' ability to repay them. Meanwhile,      banks and credit-rating agencies pretended that financial      alchemy could convert bad mortgages into AAA assets, and the      Fed looked the other way as the U.S. household-savings rate      plummeted to zero.       It's a bleak picture. The total loss from this economic      downturn--measured by the disparity between the economy's      actual output and its potential output--is likely to be the      greatest since the Great Depression. That total, itself well      in excess of $1 trillion, is not included in our estimated $3      trillion cost of the war.       Others will have to work out the geopolitics, but the      economics here are clear. Ending the war, or at least moving      rapidly to wind it down, would yield major economic      dividends.       As we head toward November, opinion polls say that voters'      main worry is now the economy, not the war. But there's no      way to disentangle the two. The United States will be paying      the price of Iraq for decades to come. The price tag will be      all the greater because we tried to ignore the laws of      economics--and the cost will grow the longer we remain.                          ____________________
