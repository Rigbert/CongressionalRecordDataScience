Chairman, I rise in strong opposition to this amendment which limits the use of funds for the acceptance and processing of mineral patent applications or the issuance of such patents by the Secretary of the Interior.  Mr. Chairman, I am the chairman of the authorizing subcommittee of jurisdiction over the mining law of 1872, as amended. I am also the lead cosponsor of H.R. 1580, the Mining Law Reform Act of 1995. If the amendment to the appropriations bill before us now is adopted, we will have repeated the mistake of the 103d Congress in its attempt to change the mining law.  The real objective of this amendment is to derail attempts to bring about reasonable changes to the 1872 act. The deadlocked end to the conference committee on mining law reform last September 28 followed just 2 days after Congress adopted the fiscal year 1995 conference report which included a mineral patent moratorium for the first time. Was this mere happenstance? Absolutely not.  H.R. 1580 retains the right to receive a patent, after demonstration that a valuable mineral deposit has been discovered, but only upon payment of the appraised fair market value of the land within the claim. The sponsors of this amendment would eliminate patenting altogether without substituting any other provision for making secure the opportunity to mine one's claims. If you want a real solution, vote against this misguided amendment.                              {time}  1515
