We expect there to be up to three rollcall votes beginning around 11:15 a.m., two votes after the recess for the caucus luncheons. Upon disposition of H.R. 3082, there will be up to 1 hour for debate prior to a cloture vote on the nomination of David Hamilton to be U.S. circuit judge for the Seventh Circuit.                          ____________________
