S. Senate. Senator Helms is retiring after 30 years in the Senate and I wish him and his wife, Dot, all the best.  Senator Helms and I have not always agreed on the issues. But any disagreements we may have had has never gotten in the way of a constructive and cordial working relationship. We served together on the Senate Foreign Relations Committee for several years and currently serve together on the Rules and Administration Committee.  I have admired his dedication to his views, though I may strongly disagree with them, and his commitment to his constituents in North Carolina. There were certainly several occasions when I wished I had Senator Helms fighting on my side.  When the battle was done, there were no hard feelings. As several of my colleagues here today have mentioned, you would be hard pressed to find a nicer man in the U.S. Senate. Whether you are a page, maintenance worker, staffer, Senator, President, Republican or Democrat, Senator Helms treats you with the same amount of respect and courtesy. That is a fitting tribute to a man who has dedicated himself to a life of public service.  Again, I thank Senator Helms for his time in the Senate. This body will certainly not be the same without him.
