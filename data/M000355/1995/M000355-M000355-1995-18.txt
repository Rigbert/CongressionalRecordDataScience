 LEVIN. To the contrary, foreign-sponsored travel is treated like any other travel: so long as it is in connection with the duties of the Member, officer, or employee; it is not substantially recreational in nature; it is not provided by a registered lobbyist or foreign agent; and it is properly disclosed, and authorized, in the case of an employee, reimbursement for expenses connected with such travel may be accepted.  Mr. McCONNELL. I appreciate the clarification.  Section 1(c)(9) of the new gift rule creates an exception from the gift limitation for informational material sent to a Senate office. The current practice in the Senate also permits the receipt of informational material with some limitations. First, the material must be provided by the person or entity which produces, publishes, or creates the informational material. Second, current practice also permits those who produce, publish, or create the material to provide a set of books, tapes, or discs. For example, several years ago PBS provided each Senator with a set of video tapes of its series, ``The Civil War.'' However, the Senate does not permit a Senator to accept a collection of materials, such as a specialized reporting service or other collections issues periodically. For example, a Member could not receive a set of encyclopedias, or the U.S. Code Annotated. Is it the intent to incorporate these limitations within the new gift rule?
