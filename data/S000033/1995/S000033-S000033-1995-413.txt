 Speaker, I say to the gentleman   from Oregon, [Mr. DeFazio], what especially distresses me, as the gentleman knows, in this last election only 38 percent of the American people bothered to vote. I think the reason for that is so many people are just shaking their heads and shaking their hands and they are saying, ``Hey, I really have no power. I have no authority.''  With this whole business, what this whole business indicates is that we can understand why people are giving up on the democratic process, because here we have, for once in a very long time, the Congress of the United States actually doing the right thing and saying no to the bailout, and yet we still cannot win.  So next time when we run for reelection and we go back home, people are going to say, ``What difference does it make? You are trying to do a good job but they are going to go around you anyhow. You do not have enough power to represent ordinary people.''  I think that is a very sad thing at a time when many of us, I know the three of us, are reaching out. We want working people and we want poor people and we want the elderly to get involved in the political process.  This action on the part of the President just discourages, I think, millions of people who say, ``Hey, it does not make a difference. Wall Street has made a demand and the President has succumbed to it, and it does not matter what ordinary people think about it.''  Mr. DeFAZIO. Mr. Speaker, I yield to the gentlewoman from Ohio.
