 President, today I rise to introduce legislation to achieve one of my primary objectives as chairman of the Special Committee on Aging: to help workers and retirees achieve a secure retirement.  As with any discussion about retirement planning, it is the norm to point to the ``three-legged stool'' of retirement--Social Security, personal savings, and a pension. Unfortunately, the legs of the stool may be getting warped.  This legislation is the result of a hearing held by the Aging Committee in the 105th Congress. The Aging Committee confronted an issue that is affecting hundreds of thousands of workers and retirees--miscalculation of their hard-earned pensions. This hearing was intended to raise consumer awareness about the need to be pro-active about policing your pension. As one of our witnesses said, ``never assume your pension is error-free.''  While it is impossible to know how many pension payments and lump sum distributions may be miscalculated, we know the number is on the rise. An audit conducted last Congress by the Pension Benefit Guaranty Corporation--focused on plans that were voluntarily terminated--showed that the number of people underpaid has increased from 2.8 to 8.2 percent. Anecdotal evidence suggests that the number of people receiving lump sum distributions who end up getting shortchanged could be 15 to 20 percent. Those numbers are very disturbing. The practical impact is that retirees, and young and old workers alike, are losing dollars that they have earned.  Workers and retirees need to be aware that they are at risk. They can help themselves by knowing how their benefits are calculated, that they should keep all the documents their employer gives them, and to start asking questions at a young age--don't wait until the eve of retirement.  Unfortunately, policing your pension is not easy. Employers are trying to do a good job but they are confronted with one of the most complex regulatory schemes in the Federal Government. Pensions operate in a complex universe of laws, rules, and regulations. Over the last 20 years, 16 laws have been enacted that require employers to amend their pension plans and then notify their workers of changes. It is not a simple task. If employers have problems trying to comply with Federal requirements, it is understandable that workers and retirees are having trouble getting a grasp on how their pension works.  Trying to educate yourself about pensions implies that someone is out there providing information to those who need it. That is where the legislation that I am introducing today comes in. People who are concerned about their pensions--whether it's an unintentional mistake or outright fraud--often don't have anywhere to go for expert advice.  Fortunately, there is an answer. Already authorized by the Older Americans Act, seven pension counseling projects have assisted thousands of people around this country with their pension problems. These projects provide information and counseling to retirees, and young and old workers in a very cost-effective manner.  Each project received $75,000 of Federal assistance over a 17-month period. As is normal for other programs under the Older Americans Act, these dollars were supplemented by money raised from private sources. During their operation, the projects recovered nearly $2 million in pension benefits and payments. That is a return of $4 for every $1 spent.  My legislation contains three key provisions: first, it updates the Older Americans Act to encourage the creation of more pension counseling projects. While 10 projects in 15 states currently exist, they are not enough to reach the 80 million people who are covered by pensions in this country. Hopefully, more counseling projects can be established to provide more regionally comprehensive assistance.  Second, the legislation would create an 800 number that people could call for one-stop advice on where to get assistance. Jurisdiction over pension issues is spread across three government agencies--none of which are focused on helping individuals with individual problems--especially if the problem does not seem to be a clear fiduciary breach or indicate that there may be criminal wrongdoing. An 800 number linking people to assistance will help close that gap.  Finally, the legislation would transfer authority for the demonstrationprojects to Title VII of the Older Americans Act in order to make them permanent in nature. They provide a much needed service to workers and retirees. These demonstration projects have existed since 1992 and have proven to be very successful. However, they have outgrown their pilot-project beginnings and should become a permanent fixture.  I want to thank Senator Breaux for his support of this legislation. Furthermore, I encourage all of my colleagues to support these projects and show their support by co-sponsoring this legislation.                                 ______                                       By
