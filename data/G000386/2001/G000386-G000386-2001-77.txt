 President, I rise today to discuss the need to revisit an unfortunate chapter in the FBI's history: the investigation of the FBI's actions at Ruby Ridge.  While there have been a number of internal investigations of the FBI's actions at Ruby Ridge, the most recent investigation, sponsored by the Justice Management Division of the Department of Justice, was completed in 1999. The results of this investigation have raised serious questions about the integrity of the previous joint investigation by the Department of Justice and the FBI, which was completed in 1993. Among these questions is whether FBI supervisors who headed that previous investigation were personal friends of some of the senior executives they were investigating. These questions, and many others, were raised in the testimony of four FBI Agents who appeared at a Judiciary Committee Hearing on FBI Oversight, chaired by Senator Leahy, last month. These exemplary Agents exposed the double standard that has existed in how rank and file FBI Agents are punished versus FBI Senior Officials.  So, you might think that the Justice Management Division's report would have cleared this matter up. Well, you'd be wrong. As a matter of fact, most of us didn't even realize the existence of this report until it was brought to light by the testimony of these Agents. It was also then that we found that Justice Management sat on this report for two years before releasing it internally in January of this year. And, despite clear and convincing evidence of irregularities in how FBI officials have been punished in this matter, Justice Management division has ruled that no new discipline would be imposed against any FBI personnel. One of the FBI Agents testifying at the hearing described this decision as ``outrageous'' and ``alarming.''  Three weeks ago, I joined Chairman Leahy and Senator Specter in requesting documents relating to the Justice Management Division's report. While the Department of Justice was responsive in providing the requested materials, many of these documents were subject to protection under the privacy act and our staffs could only review them for a short period of time.  Once again, Senator Specter and I have joined Chairman Leahy, along with Ranking Member Hatch, and Senator Kohl, to request that these documents be provided again, this time with appropriate redactions to comply with Privacy act concerns. I ask that this letter be made part of the Record.  Less than twenty-four hours ago we confirmed the nomination of Robert Mueller to head the Federal Bureau of Investigation. In his testimony before the Senate Judiciary Committee, Mr. Mueller stated, as their new Director, the FBI would be honest and forthright about mistakes. While, I understand that the mistakes of Ruby Ridge did not occur on Mr. Mueller's watch I truly believe that the FBI will never truly make a clean break with the past unless matters such as these are resolved.  There being no objection, the letter was ordered to be printed in the Record, as follows:                                                      U.S. Senate,                                   Committee on the Judiciary,                                    Washington, DC, July 27, 2001.     Hon. John Ashcroft,     Attorney General, Department of Justice, Washington, DC.       Dear General Ashcroft: As you are aware, the Senate      Judiciary Committee is conducting oversight hearings on the      Federal Bureau of Investigation. At our hearing last week,      three present FBI agents and one former agent testified that      there is a widespread perception among FBI agents that a      ``double standard'' has been applied in FBI internal      disciplinary decisions, with members of the FBI's senior      executive service receiving far lighter punishment than line      agents for similar infractions.       As a case in point, the witnesses cited the various      internal investigations that the FBI conducted into the 1992      incident at Ruby Ridge. A 1993 investigation conducted by a      DOJ/FBI task force led to the imposition of discipline      against 12 FBI employees in 1995. However, information that      subsequently came to light has called into question the      integrity of that internal investigation. It was alleged for      example, that FBI supervisors who headed the internal      investigation were personal friends of some of the senior      executives they were investigating and that they failed to      take basic investigative steps that would have uncovered      significant new evidence on questions such as who had      approved the FBI's rules of engagement during the Ruby Ridge      siege. Based upon this new information, the Office of      Professional Responsibility for the Department of Justice and      a Task Force of the Justice Management Division recommended      in 1999 that two FBI senior executives be suspended and that      the FBI Director and one other FBI agent be censured. They      also recommended that discipline imposed in 1995 on three FBI      agents be rescinded because of procedural irregularities in      their disciplinary proceedings as well as exculpatory      evidence that had subsequently been developed. However, in      January of 2001, the outgoing Assistant Attorney General for      the Justice Management Division ruled that no new discipline      would be imposed against any FBI agents and that no      previously-imposed discipline would be rescinded. One of the      agents at our hearing described this decision as      ``outrageous'' and ``alarming.''       In order to evaluate these issues, we requested the      production of documents relating to the Justice Management      Division's disciplinary decision. The Department of Justice's      Office of Legislative Affairs provided our Committee with      outstanding cooperation and managed to pull together the      requested material in a short period of time. However,      because the material contained information that was subject      to protection under the Privacy Act, we agreed to return      all of the material, with the exception of one document,      at the conclusion of the hearing. We have requested,      however, that the Office of Legislative Affairs provide us      with copies of these documents with appropriate redactions      to comply with Privacy Act concerns.       Although our review of this material has necessarily been      limited by time constraints, what we have seen thus far has      confirmed that this material is relevant to the issues that      our Committee is examining, including the Justice Management      Division's January 2001 decision. It appears that the former      Assistant Attorney General's decision was based entirely upon      an April 17, 2000 memorandum by two Deputy Assistant      Attorneys General. That memorandum contains some surprising      conclusions. For example, the memorandum appears to conclude      that the FBI's rules of engagement at Ruby Ridge were not      contrary to any established Department of Justice policy. As      you may know, the Senate Subcommittee on Terrorism,      Technology and Government Information, after conducting      extensive hearings on the Ruby Ridge incident in 1995,      concluded that the rules of engagement were clearly      unconstitutional and contrary to the FBI's policy on the use      of deadly force. Indeed, the illegality of the rules of      engagement was conceded in testimony before the Subcommittee      by former Deputy Attorney General Gorelick and former FBI      Director Louis Freeh. Further, two FBI agents were      disciplined in 1995 for their part in promulgating the rules      of engagement, precisely because the rules were inconsistent      with established FBI policy on the use of deadly force. It is      therefore mystifying how anyone could still believe that the      rules of engagement were lawful.       The April 17 memorandum raises other troubling issues. For      example, the authors concluded that no discipline was      appropriate for senior FBI executives who conducted      incomplete investigations into the Ruby Ridge matter because      there was insufficient proof that their failures were the      result of intentional misconduct. However, under the      precedents employed by both the Department of Justice's and      the FBI's OPR, intentional misconduct has, in our view, never      been a prerequisite for imposing internal discipline; rather,      it has been sufficient that an FBI employee acted in reckless      disregard of an obligation or standard imposed by law,      applicable rule of professional conduct, or Department      regulation or policy. For example, according to other      documents we have reviewed, it appears that an FBI Inspector      who prepared the Ruby Ridge shooting incident report in      September 1992 was suspended for five days because Director      Freeh found that his analysis of the justification for the      shootings was incorrect and incomplete and because his report      showed ``inattention to detail'' in referring, for example,      to Vicki Weaver as ``Vicki Harris.'' It is difficult to      square the suspension imposed on this lower-level FBI      employee with the ruling of the Justice Management Division      that no discipline may be imposed on senior FBI executives in      the absence of proof of intentional misconduct.       We, of course, understand that none of thee matters      occurred under your watch. However, we believe that it is      important for our Committee to review carefully how decisions      on matters of internal discipline are made within the FBI. As      we are sure you can appreciate, the poisonous perception that      there is a double standard being applied threatens to      undermine FBI morale as well as public confidence. We would      therefore appreciate your providing us with appropriately-     redacted copies of the documents previously produced to our      Committee as soon as possible. In its report on Ruby Ridge      filed in December of 1995, the Subcommittee on Terrorism,      Technology and Government Information noted that allegations      of a cover-up in Ruby Ridge were then under investigation by      the Department of Justice, but that ``a full public airing of      this matter must eventually be undertaken'' and that ``the      Subcommittee will consider additional hearings to deal with      the cover-up allegations.'' (p. 1124). We intend to pursue      these matters     within the Committee to ensure that Congress, and the public,      are fully informed as to how the FBI handled these important      investigations.           Sincerely,     Patrick J. Leahy,       Chairman,     Charles E. Grassley,       Senator,     Arlen Specter,       Senator,     Orrin G. Hatch,       Ranking Republican Member,     Herb Kohl,       Senator.                          ____________________
