President, since coming to the Senate and assuming the Chairmanship of the Permanent Subcommittee on Investigations, one of my top priorities has been the seemingly never-ending fight to ferret out and eliminate waste, fraud and abuse in federal government programs. We've all heard the horror stories of $500 hammers and roads built to nowhere. The waste of scarce federal resources not only picks the pockets of the taxpayers but also places severe financial pressures on already overburdened programs, forcing cutbacks in the delivery of vital government services.  Over the past year, I have seen this waste first-hand as the Subcommittee put a spotlight on massive fraud in the Medicare program. To cite just one example, the Subcommittee's investigation revealed that the federal government had been sending Medicare checks to 14 health care companies whose address, if they had existed, was in the middle of the runway of the Miami International Airport. That fraud cost the taxpayers millions of dollars, diverting scarce resources from the elderly and legitimate health care providers.  This example and others like it were uncovered by my Subcommittee working hand-in-hand with the Inspector General's Office, whose mission is to identify the eliminate waste, fraud and abuse in federal programs. In many ways, the Inspectors General are the eyes and ears of the Permanent Subcommittee on Investigations, in particular, and the Congress, in general, as we strive to detect and prevent waste, fraud, abuse, and mismanagement in federal programs.  Mr. President, this year marks the 20th anniversary of the Inspector General Act, the law that the Congress passed to create these guardians of the public purse. As we recognize this anniversary, it is important for Congress to take a close look at the IG system.  During the past 20 years, the Inspector General community has grown from 12 in 1978 to 57 Inspectors General today. These offices receive more than $1 billion in annual funding and employ over 10,000 auditors, criminal investigators, and support personnel. The Office of Inspector General is charged with tremendous responsibilities and is given considerable authority to uncover waste and abuse within the government.  By and large, the IG community has done an outstanding job. They have made thousands of recommendations to Congress, ultimately saving taxpayers literally billions of dollars. Investigations by Inspectors General have also resulted in the recovery of billions of dollars from companies and individuals who defrauded the federal government. These investigations have been the basis for thousands of criminal prosecutions, debarments, exclusions and suspensions.  The Inspectors General have a demonstrated record of success over the past 20 years, but as with any government program, we must be vigilant to ensure that the program is well managed, accountable, and effective. With this goal in mind and drawing on my work with the Inspectors General over the past year and a half, I am introducing the ``Inspector General Act Amendments of 1998,'' a bill to improve the accountability and efficiency of the Inspectors General program. I am pleased to have my colleague from Iowa, Senator Grassley, as a cosponsor.  The bill is designed to increase the accountability and independence of Inspectors General. It establishes a renewable nine-year term of office for each of the 26 Inspectors General who are appointed by the President and confirmed by the Senate. This provision will also encourage Inspectors General to serve for longer periods of time so that their experience and judgment can be used to fight waste, fraud and abuse.  This bill also takes steps to streamline the IG Offices themselves--making them more efficient and flexible--by consolidating existing offices and by reducing the volume of the inspectors general reporting requirements.  The number of OIGs has increased more than four-fold in twenty years, and many of these are small offices with just a handful of employees. These small OIGs can be made far more efficient and effective by transferring their functions to larger, department-wide IG offices. For example, my bill consolidates the current stand-alone office of the Peace Corps, with just 15 employees, into the State Department--eliminating unnecessary overhead and bureaucracy but continuing thorough audit and oversight of the Peace Corps. Under this proposal, seven existing small IG offices are consolidated into the IG offices of major departments.  Currently, Offices of Inspectors General are required by law to provide semi-annual reports to Congress. My bill would increase the value of the report process by reducing the requirement to a single annual report and streamlining the information required for each report. For example, the new reporting requirement would require the IGs to identify areas within their jurisdiction which are at highest risk for waste, fraud and abuse. In that way, the Congress can attack those weak areas before they get worse and before the problems become more difficult to solve.  The Inspectors General have made valuable contributions to the efficient operation of the federal government, but their record is not without blemish. For example, this successful record was recently tarnished by the activities of the Treasury Department's Office of Inspector General. After an extensive investigation, my Subcommittee found that this office violated federal laws in the award of two sole-source contracts, which wasted thousands of dollars. It was disturbing to find that this one Inspector General's Office was itself guilty of wasting resources--the very office charged with preventing fraud and abuse. At the conclusion of that investigation, the Subcommittee asked the question: who is watching the watchdogs?  Let me stress that, in my view, problems like the ones in the Treasury Inspector General's office are not widespread in the Inspector General community. However, an Inspector General is not like any other government manager. Inspectors General are the very officials in government responsible for combating waste, fraud and abuse in Federal programs. And as such, Inspectors General should be held to a higher standard. To do their job effectively, Inspectors General must be above reproach, must set an example for other government managers to follow, and must not create situations where there is even the appearance of impropriety. Credibility and effectiveness are lost when the office charged with combating waste and abuse engages in the kind of activity that the Inspector General is responsible for deterring.  To increase accountability, my bill requires independent external reviews of the Inspector General offices every three years. It gives each office the flexibility to choose the most efficient method of review, but it does require that the watchdogs themselves submit to oversight by a qualified third party. This provision will help ensure public confidence in the management and efficiency of the IG offices.  Finally, Mr. President, one provision that is not included in this bill, but that deserves careful consideration, is the grant of statutory law enforcement authority for the Inspector General of the Department of Health and Human Services. The Medicare fraud investigation conducted by my Subcommittee revealed the dangers faced by HHS-IG Special Agents when they work with the FBI and others to investigate some cases of health care fraud. These agents work side by side with other federal law enforcement professionals, and the Congress should carefully examine the best way to provide them with tools necessary for them to do their jobs effectively.  Mr. President, the bill I introduce today represents the first step in the process to improve the effectiveness, efficiency and accountability of the Inspector General program. These officesprovide valuable assistance to the Congress so that we can exercise our duty to oversee the operation of the federal government and to make sure that the taxpayer's money is well spent and not wasted. I urge my colleagues to join me in this effort to strengthen and improve the Inspectors General program into the next century.                                 ______                                       By
