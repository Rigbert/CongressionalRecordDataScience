 President, I rise today to pay tribute to a friend of mine and a great friend to the Bluegrass State and the University of Kentucky, Mr. Bill Schweri. Bill recently retired from the University of Kentucky after dedicating over 40 years to working at the university, the last two decades of which were spent as the director of Federal relations.  It has been Bill's job to serve as a liaison between the university and its faculty and the executive and legislative branches of State and Federal Government. I am a proud graduate of UK's College of Law, and Bill has represented my alma mater exceedingly well over the years.  Bill has been a staunch advocate for new research initiatives at the university in fields as varied as agriculture, biotechnology, clean coal technology, energy, engineering, and transportation. He has helped transform UK into one of the most prominent economic drivers in the State.  He has been instrumental in bringing about such UK achievements as the Marty Driesler Cancer Project, the expansion of a teaching space in the College of Nursing, the creation of a bioinformatics core in the university's medical center, and Fedtrak, a project with the Transportation Security Administration to track sensitive material shipments.  Bill also played a key role in UK's Markey Cancer Center being awarded a National Cancer Institute designation. With NCI designation, UK is better positioned to recruit researchers, receive grants, and to develop new breakthrough treatments to lead the fight against cancer. This means that fewer Kentuckians will have to travel out of State to find the most advanced care and clinical trials, and instead will be able to find it within the Commonwealth, which is critical as Kentucky suffers from the highest combined cancer mortality rate in the country.  Bill has worked actively to help maintain congressional support for student financial aid, which is so important to many Kentucky students. He has worked tirelessly to ensure his school's visibility here in Washington, DC and to fight for legislation that is important to UK. And he is fiercely loyal to the University of Kentucky.  Bill is not just an employee of UK, he's also an alumnus. Bill earned his bachelor's degree in anthropology from the University of Kentucky in 1969 and his master's degree, also in anthropology, from UK in 1978.  In his youth he served in the Peace Corps in Guatemala, and he also served as the past president of the Society of Research Administrators, International from 1997 to 1998. Bill previously served as UK's director of sponsored program development in the 1980s and '90s before becoming the director of Federal relations in July of 1994.  Bill has been a leader in the Science Coalition, a nonprofit, nonpartisan organization of more than 50 of the Nation's leading research universities dedicated to sustaining the Federal Government's investment in scientific research. He has also been actively involved in the Council on Governmental Affairs of the Association of Public and Land Grant Universities.  Bill is well known and highly respected among his colleagues in Federal relations at other research universities, just as he is throughout the Commonwealth of Kentucky. I wish to personally thank Bill for his service to the University of Kentucky and to our State. Although his retirement is well earned, he will certainly be missed, by me, by my staff, and by the many people across Kentucky who have benefited from his efforts. I ask my U.S. Senate colleagues to join me in bidding a fond farewell to Mr. Bill Schweri.                          ____________________
