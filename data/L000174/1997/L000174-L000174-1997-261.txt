With that clarification, I am prepared to support this bill.  I join in supporting S. 476 to provide authority to expand Boys and Girls Clubs across the country, including both urban and rural areas. When we passed similar legislation last year, we did it as part of a legislative package that included the National Information Infrastructure Protection Act that Senator Kyl and I authored and that I helped push through during the closing days of the last Congress.  Most important to me, the revised language should serve to expand the availability of Boys and Girls Clubs in rural areas. The original language was more restrictive, requiring the grants to be used only for the purpose of establishing Boys and Girls Clubs in public housing projects and other distressed areas. I have worked with the Boys and Girls and know that they understand that rural areas as well as urban can qualify as distressed areas.  Nonetheless, the new language is more expansive and will give girls and boys in rural areas greater opportunities to share in Boys and Girls Clubs and their programs. The revised statute will authorize grants for establishing and extending facilities where needed. Particular emphasis continues to be given to housing projects, where Boys and Girls Clubs have proven effective in preventing youth crime, and to distressed areas, rural or urban. But the where needed language should help make expansion into rural areas a greater priority.  Likewise, the removal of the language concerning contracts with HUD should streamline the expansion process and help make clear that such expansions are not limited to public housing projects.  The changes made to that program by this bill also permit up to five percent of the grant funds to be used to establish a role model speakers' program. Anyone who has seen the Boys and Girls Clubs of America commercial with Denzel Washington and his coach will know the kinds of outstanding role models that we are seeking to promote to encourage and motivate young people to be involved, productive citizens.  I have seen the outstanding results at the Boys and Girls Club in Burlington, VT, under the direction of Bob Robinson. The role models they provide include the outstanding instructors and volunteers who work in the club's many programs. I have also witnessed the outstanding results of the Kids `N Kops Program at the University of Vermont with the cooperation of local law enforcement.  Expansions are proceeding and over 200 new clubs serving 180,000 youth were opened as a result of last year's legislation. I know that the Burlington Boys and Girls club received $100,000 to help enhance that Club's outreach efforts. I was glad to receive a letter from the Boys and Girls Clubs of America indicating that they are in the planning stages for the development of a new club in Rutland and researching the feasibility of a club in Essex Junction, as well. I would hope that with the continuation of this initiative they will look for opportunities to serve young people in St. Albans, Brattleboro, St. Johnsbury, Montpelier, and other Vermont locations, as well. I would be delighted for a sizeable portion of the 1 million additional young people who we hope will be served by the end of this century to come from the 145,000 young people in Vermont and those in other rural areas.  In supporting this bill, I encourage the Boys and Girls Clubs as one example of a successful youth-oriented program that can help make a difference in young people's lives and prevent crime and delinquency. I also support the work of others who are effective with young people, including our outstanding 4-H programs. In working for the passage of this measure I have received assurances that other members will join with me in supporting these other fine programs, as well.  It is nice to see Republican Members support juvenile crime prevention programs. Only a short time ago Republicans tried to stop passage of the President's 1994 Violent Crime Control and Law Enforcement Act and contended that crime prevention programs were ``pork'' or a waste of funds.  In the juvenile crime bill I sponsored this year, S. 15, we include a number of initiatives to prevent juvenile crime and youth drug abuse. I hope that we can expect bipartisan support for those juvenile crime prevention provisions as we move forward in this Congress so that we can enact a comprehensive approach to the problem of youth crime. This measure should not become an excuse for anyone not to join with us to to bolster comprehensive drug education and prevention for all elementary and high school students. We should proceed to help create after school safe havens where children are protected from drugs, gangs, and crime with activities including drug prevention education, academic tutoring, mentoring, and abstinence training. This bill is a step but should not be the end of our efforts to support programs that help prevent juvenile delinquency, crime, and drug abuse.  I ask unanimous consent that a copy of a letter I just received from the Boys and Girls Clubs of America be printed in the Record.  There being no objection, the letter was ordered to be printed in the Record, as follows:                                              Boys and Girls Clubs                                                   of America,                                       Rockville, MD, May 8, 1997.     Hon. Patrick J. Leahy,     U.S. Senate, Washington, DC.       Dear Senator Leahy: Last week when the Judiciary Committee      discussed S. 476 I heard your concerns, and if possible, I      would like to clarify what we are trying to do with this Bill      and what we have done with previous appropriations.       Our goal within the state of Vermont is to strengthen the      youth development services currently being provided. In      addition, we are working to increase both the number of local      Boys & Girls Club facilities and youth being served      throughout the state.       Just this past year, we passed $100,000 through to the Boys      & Girls Clubs of Burlington, VT, to enhance the Club's      outreach efforts. Today, we are in the planning stages for      the development of a Boys & Girls Club in Rutland, VT, and      are researching the feasibility of a Club in Essex Junction,      VT. I     give you every assurance that these efforts will remain a      priority.       Nationally, with Boys & Girls Clubs of America's 1996      appropriation, we opened 208 Boys & Girls Clubs and served      180,000 new boys and girls. All told, Boys & Girls Clubs now      serve some 2.6 million young people throughout America,      including many in rural and semi-rural communities. Our      planned growth for 1997, with the assistance of our current      appropriation, will continue at this same pace.       Upon passage and successful implementation of S. 476, we      plan on serving 1,000,000 new boys and girls throughout the      United States. Many of the children in Vermont who are not      currently being served--will be.       Senator Leahy, you have been a friend to Boys & Girls Clubs      and to many youth organizations over the years. We hope that      you can now help us pass S. 476 and help us reach 1,000,000      new boys and girls.       Thank you and we look forward to working with you on this      and other issues that help America's children and families.           Sincerely,     Robbie Callaway,       Senior Vice President.
