Today, Senate Republicans have agreed to vote on just one of those nominees. I want to commend Senator Harkin for working with Senator Grassley and the Majority Leader to get this vote on the nomination of Stephanie Rose of Iowa. I urge votes on the other nominees, as well, without further delay.  There are currently 78 Federal judicial vacancies. Judicial vacancies during the last few years have been at historically high levels and have remained near or above 80 for nearly the entire first term of the President. Nearly one out of every 11 Federal judgeships is currently vacant. Vacancies on the Federal courts are more than two and one half times as many as they were on this date during the first term of President Bush. One key reason for these numerous vacancies and for the extensive backlog of nominees is that Senate Republicans allowed votes on just one district court nominee per week for the last seven weeks before the August recess. This unnecessarily slow pace of consideration of judicial nominees has disserved the American people and should not continue.  The across-the-board obstruction and foot dragging from Senate Republicans since day one of President Obama's tenure means that we are likely to complete his first term with more judicial vacancies than when he took office. The partisan obstruction from Senate Republicans has been particularly damaging with respect to Federal trial courts. In a sharp departure from the past, Senate Republicans have stalled Senate approval of district court nominees, including those Republican home state Senators support.  Before the American people elected Barack Obama as our President, district court nominees were generally confirmed within a couple of weeks of being reported by the Judiciary Committee. This was true of those nominated by Republican Presidents and Democratic Presidents. Deference was traditionally afforded to home State Senators and district court nominees supported by home State Senators were almost always confirmed unanimously. During the 18 months that I was chairman of the Judiciary Committee in 2001 and 2002, we confirmed 83 of President Bush's district court nominees, and only one of them received any votes in opposition. Even though some Senate Democrats opposed the nominee, we nevertheless scheduled a vote for him just 11 days after he was reported by the Judiciary Committee.  Indeed, only five district court nominees received any votes in opposition in all 8 years of the previous Republican presidency, and none was a party-line vote. Among those nominees was one so extreme that he had announced that ``concern for rape victims is a red herring because conceptions from rape occur with approximately the same frequency as snowfall in Miami.'' That observation was much like the outrageous recent comments about rape by a Republican House member and Senate candidate.  In all, the Senate confirmed 264 of President Bush's district court nominees, and only five of them received any votes in opposition. Senate Democrats were willing to work with a very conservative Republican President to fill vacancies on our Federal trial courts. We recognized that filling vacancies on district courts is essential to ensuring that the American people have functioning courts to serve them and provide access to justice. We know that it is unacceptable for hardworking Americans who turn to their courts for justice to suffer unnecessary delays. When an injured plaintiff sues to help cover the cost of his or her medical expenses, that plaintiff should not have to wait 3 years before a judge hears thecase. When two small business owners disagree over a contract, they should not have to wait years for a court to resolve their dispute.  In The Atlantic Andrew Cohen has written recently about the ``Human Costs of Judicial Confirmation Delays.'' In that article, the Chief Judge of the Middle District of Pennsylvania describes the costs of vacancies on individuals in Pennsylvania and the pervasive and harmful delays they are suffering because there are not enough judges.  At this point in President Bush's first term, Senate Democrats had worked with Republicans to confirm 165 of his district court nominees. Despite the fact that President Obama has worked with home state Senators of both parties to select moderate, superbly-qualified judicial nominees, Senate Republicans have engaged in unprecedented obstruction of Federal trial court nominees for the last four years.  As Carl Tobias noted last month in a letter to the New York Times:       Republican senators have created and applied practices that      substantially depart from procedures employed in prior      administrations, even as recently as that of President George      W. Bush. The most important change is the refusal by the      G.O.P. leadership to enter voting agreements on well-     qualified, uncontroversial district court nominees, so they      languish for months on the Senate floor.  Professor Tobias is correct, and the result is that at this point in his first term President Obama's district court nominees have had to wait nearly three times longer for a Senate vote and the Senate has confirmed more than three dozen fewer.  Senate Republicans have made a habit of delaying and opposing President Obama's district court nominees, voting against more than a quarter of them--36 out of 127 to be precise. And they stall confirmations for months of noncontroversial nominees including those supported by home state Republican Senators who are eventually confirmed overwhelmingly.  This extreme partisanship has not just resulted in persistently high vacancies--Supreme Court Justice Anthony Kennedy recently observed that it is also ``bad for the legal system'' as a whole. He indicated: ``It makes the judiciary look politicized when it is not, and it has to stop.'' District courts in particular should not be politicized. The 18 district court nominees currently pending before the Senate were not chosen based on some ideological litmus test. They were selected for their legal excellence, whether as practicing attorneys or sitting judges.  Recently, the Republican Senator from Pennsylvania signaled his newfound willingness to abandon the unprecedented delays and obstruction that his caucus has employed against President Obama's trial court nominees. I only wish he had done so 2 years ago. What Senate Republicans have been doing is wrong and hurts all Americans seeking justice in our Federal courts.  Today, the Senate will vote on the nomination of Stephanie Rose to fill a judicial vacancy on the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of Iowa. She was rated unanimously well qualified by the ABA Standing Committee on the Federal Judiciary, the highest possible rating. She has the bipartisan support of her home state Senators. I worked with Senator Harkin and Senator Grassley to ensure prompt Judiciary Committee consideration of her nomination, which was reported with a virtually unanimous voice vote by the Judiciary Committee nearly five months ago. The only objection came as a protest on another issue by Senator Lee.  Stephanie Rose currently serves as the first woman U.S. Attorney for the Northern District of Iowa, where she has been serving since 2009. Ms. Rose has devoted her entire career to public service, having served for 15 years as a Federal prosecutor and having been promoted to Deputy Criminal Chief in 2008. In her tenure as a Federal prosecutor, she has tried 33 cases to verdict. When confirmed, she will be the first woman to serve as a Federal judge in the Southern District of Iowa and only the second woman to serve on the Federal bench in Iowa's history.  With the elections approaching, the Senate will recess, again, in just a few weeks. When the Senate recessed in 2009, 10 judicial nominees were left without a final confirmation vote. When the Senate recessed in 2010, 19 judicial nominees were left pending without a final confirmation vote. When the Senate recessed last year, in 2011, 19 judicial nominees were left pending without a final vote. I urge Senate Republicans not to continue their practice of stalling qualified nominees from confirmation. I urge them to agree to schedule debate and votes on the 18 district court nominees from California, Connecticut, Florida, Illinois, Maryland, Michigan, New York, Oklahoma, Pennsylvania and Utah who, like Stephanie Rose, could be confirmed with strong bipartisan support and without further delay. A dozen of those nominees would fill judicial emergency vacancies.  Let us act on these nominations. There is no doubt that recent precedent shows we can do this even in September of a Presidential election year. In 2008, the final year of President Bush's presidency, Senate Democrats were willing to confirm 10 of his district court nominees in a single day, all by unanimous consent. It took only a few seconds. Earlier in that Republican presidency, and again with a Democratic Majority, the Senate confirmed 18 judicial nominees in just one day and vacancies went down to 60 throughout the country, on the way down to 28. If we confirm all of the district nominees ready for final Senate action today, we can similarly reduce vacancies back down to 60.  I hope that Senate Republicans will not extend their wrongheaded application of the ``Thurmond Rule'' and further stall confirmation of consensus, well-qualified district court nominees. Given our overburdened Federal courts and the need to provide all Americans with prompt justice, the Senate should be working in a bipartisan fashion to confirm these nominees without further delay.  I ask unanimous consent the article to which I referred be printed in the Record.  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in the Record, as follows:                          [From the Atlantic]    In Pennsylvania, the Human Costs of Judicial Confirmation Delays                           (By Andrew Cohen)       The William J. Nealon courthouse in Scranton, Pennsylvania.      (Wikimedia Commons) Daniel Wasserman had seen enough. An      Orthodox rabbi affiliated with Shaare Torah Synagogue in a      suburb of Pittsburgh, Wasserman had grown tired of state      interference with Jewish funeral rituals, ancient and      eternal, which require burial within 24 hours and which      prohibit embalming. He resented the threats of fines and      penalties he was receiving from state officials trying to      enforce a 19th-century funeral director's law. He believed he      was being singled out for the practice of his religious      beliefs.       And so Rabbi Wasserman did what many people do in America      when they believe their constitutional rights--their First      Amendment rights, their rights to religious freedom--are      being infringed by state action. He sued the state. On August      6th, in federal district court in Scranton, in the Middle      District of Pennsylvania, Rabbi Wasserman's lawyers sought an      injunction to preclude state officials from continuing to      threaten him for what he considers to be the lawful exercise      of his religious beliefs. The lawsuit, his attorneys allege,      is designed to: preserve and restore the historical right of      clergy to conduct religious burial and funeral rites free      from interference and harassment by the Commonwealth of      Pennsylvania and professional, secular funeral directors who      serve no health or safety interest.       But justice won't come quickly for Rabbi Wasserman--if it      comes at all. There simply aren't enough federal judges in      the Middle District of Pennsylvania to handle his case. U.S.      District Judge John Jones, the well-regarded jurist to whom      the Rabbi's case was assigned, couldn't get the urgent      injunction hearing onto his schedule until late September.      The timing didn't discourage the Rabbi but it clearly      frustrated the judge. ``Obviously when you receive something      like this you have to move with some alacrity,'' Judge Jones      told me late last month. ``But you can only land so many      planes in one hour.''                              the district       Boundary-wise, the Middle District of Pennsylvania is the      largest federal judicial district in the state. It covers the      state capital of Harrisburg, which means it is the chief      venue for litigation against the state of Pennsylvania. It      comprises no fewer than 32 counties, up and down the center      of the state, from Adams County to York County, from the      state's northern border to New York to its southern border      with Maryland, the Mason-Dixon line. There are four      courthouses in the district, including one in Williamsport,      which is several hours drive away from either Harrisburg or      Scranton.       All of this volume and distance would be manageable if the      Middle District were fully staffed with federal trial judges.      It is not--and it hasn't been for years. ``We are down a      third of our active court,'' Judge Jones says. In March 2009,      the first vacancy in the Middle District was created when      Judge Richard Caputo (more on him later) took senior status.      Another vacancy was created in April 2010, when the Senate      confirmed the appellate nomination of U.S. District Judge      Thomas I. Vanaskie. Two long years later, just this past May,      President Obama nominated two men to fill those posts.       Both Middle District nominees--Malachy E. Mannion and      Matthew W. Brann--were quickly endorsed by the Senate      Judiciary Committee by voice vote, which means there were no      substantive objections raised by Republican members of that      Committee. Both nominees also have the support of the state's      two senators, Democrat Bob Casey and Republican Pat Toomey,      who have publicly lobbied their Republican colleagues this      year to allow the nominations to come to a vote on the Senate      floor. So far, those efforts have failed. But the Senate is      expected to take up new judicial nominations in the next week      or so.                               the judges       While the Senate fiddles, what's life like for the current      judges of the Middle District? Very difficult. Judges      frequently have to drive three hours or more a day to handle      cases in Williamsport. The aforementioned Judge Caputo, who      is in his early 70s, carries the most cases of any of the      judges--more than 500 civil and criminal combined--despite      his senior status. ``He's hanging in because he feels like he      is letting the court down if it doesn't,'' Judge Jones says      of his colleague. ``Because of the judge he is he won't      relent.'' But compared to some of his other colleagues in the      Middle District, however, Judge Caputo is practically a kid.       Sitting in senior status, picking up the slack for the      empty full-time benches, are Judge Edwin M. Kosic, Judge      William J. Nealon, Judge Richard P. Conaboy and Judge William      W. Caldwell--all of these men are at least 86 years old. Two      other Middle District Judges in senior status--Judge Sylvia      H. Rambo and Judge James M. Munley--are both over 76 years      old. ``All have a substantial case load,'' Judge Jones says,      ``but we've created this absurdity where we are leaning on      aging'' and perhaps frail senior judges. Judge Nealon, for      example, a remarkable jurist by any standard, has more than      150 cases--at age 89.       The Middle District today is so understaffed, its current      judges so overwhelmed by their relentless workload, that the      Chief Judge of the 3rd U.S. Circuit, the federal appeals      panel which covers Pennsylvania and other mid-Atlantic      states, has authorized trial judges from the Eastern District      of Pennsylvania to cross over and help their colleagues in      the Middle District. But it's not like the Eastern District      has it much better. There are now six judicial vacancies      there (five judges have in the past few years taken senior      status). President Obama has yet nominated no one--no one--to      replace those Eastern District trial judges.                              the problem       Washington talks ceaselessly about the slow pace of      judicial nominations. But few advocates are able to cite      specific examples of what judicial vacancies mean for the      American people, for litigants like Rabbi Wasserman, who look      to the courts to resolve disputes. Part of the reason for      this is prudence--current litigants I spoke with for this      article were reluctant to publicly complain about how long it      is taking their federal civil cases to be resolved. No one      wants to tick off their judge. But that doesn't mean such      delays aren't real--and pervasive. I ended up asking a      federal judge himself to detail the cost of judicial      vacancies.       ``Inevitably, what it leads to is extra time to decide      almost any motion that is filed,'' Judge Jones told me. `` .      . . [T]he federal courts are stacked up with motions to      dismiss and motions for summary judgment which are very fact      specific and require a great deal of time. When you have      fewer judges, and the judges who are in service have more      motions, everything is delayed.'' The judge calls it the      ``justice delayed syndrome'' and it impacts individuals like      the rabbi as well as large corporations who must factor into      their business plans the ``uncertainty'' inherent in long,      drawn-out litigation.       Rebecca Kourlis, a former justice of the Colorado Supreme      Court and now executive director of the Institute for the      Advancement of the American Legal System, is even more blunt.      ``Vacancies in the judiciary create holes in the judicial      system,'' Kourlis told me last week, ``and civil cases are      the most likely to fall through those holes. What this means      is that civil cases suffer increased continuances and delays      and the possibilities of changing judges in mid-stream. For      civil litigants, this means untenable disruptions to their      lives and businesses, the possibility of increased costs, and      overall, a breach of the promise of access to justice.''                              the politics       For this piece, I picked the ``judicial emergency'' in the      Middle District of Pennsylvania to make a point. Although I      have been a strident critic (see accompanying box) of the      Republican use of the Senate filibuster to keep bipartisan-     approved nominees off the bench, there is no denying that the      Obama Administration has in many cases made a bad situation      worse by failing to quickly nominate judges when vacancies      occur. There is simply no excuse, for example, for the length      of time it took the White House to appoint Mannion and Brann      to help fill the void in the Middle District. None.       Sen. Toomey, the Pennsylvania Republican, refused comment      for this story. His Democratic counterpart, Sen. Bob Casey,      would say only that both sides ``need to come together to      fill these critical positions'' and that ``the real-life      consequences of delay are unacceptable.'' Both men, it is      fair to say, don't want to say anything publicly to tick off      the Republican leadership in the Senate, leadership which      already has announced to the world that it intends to confirm      no more of President Obama's federal appellate nominees by      invoking what's become known as the ``Thurmond Rule.''       The story of the Middle District is one of basic      governance. It's about the executive branch and the      legislative branch failing to perform its constitutional      function of ensuring a viable judicial branch. It's about      politicians in Washington failing or refusing to provide to      the American people--in the Middle District of Pennsylvania,      for example--one of the most elemental services a government      can provide to the governed--functioning courts of law. It's      a disgrace that those old judges in Pennsylvania have to work      like that. It's even more of a disgrace that Congress and the      White House can't timely agree on their replacements.
