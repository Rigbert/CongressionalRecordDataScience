Speaker, I am honored to join Mr. Garamendi and Mr. Tonko, and I want to place in the Record, since both of you have talked so eloquently about the Affordable Care Act, you know how you will be walking through your district, maybe at a parade or some public event, and someone will break from the crowd and run toward you. I am thinking about one particular woman who came up to me in one of my smaller communities. She was in tears. This was during the summertime. She has cerebral palsy, and she never was able to get care. I don't know why she didn't qualify for insurance, I don't know all of that, but she hugged me and thanked me.  And then around the corner from where we live, there is a little produce market that I go into all the time. I am friends with one of the women who works there. This little business couldn't afford insurance, so their employees, when the Affordable Care Act passed, went to the private marketplace to get a plan. This particular woman who works long hours and lost her husband to cancer told me: Marcy, why are people complaining about the Affordable Care Act? Guess what, now I have cancer.  She said: I was able to go and get all of the tests, and now they have me on chemotherapy.  So, with cancer, this woman is working. She was only able to get insurance through the Affordable Care Act. Multiply that times 10,000, 20,000, 1 million, 20 million, whatever the number is. Think about the number of people in our country who were without insurance. Sometimes I am speechless when I meet these citizens because I think: Where were you hiding before? Where were you?  Another place I was, a woman was mixing up. She said: Well, I have health insurance, right? I pay car insurance.  I said: No. Car insurance doesn't cover health insurance.  People sometimes don't act in their own self-interest. She didn't even know that because she had auto insurance, that didn't cover health insurance. Can you believe that? So she was in a job where, with the Affordable Care Act, she could go out to the exchange and buy a plan.  It is amazing to me some of the things that have happened and how I see the Affordable Care Act off to a very good start.  As Mr. Tonko said, don't just repeal it until you have something to replace it with. You cannot pull the rug out from under these people's lives. It would be unconscionable to do that.  We have several Christians, several other denominations in this House. It would be very unChristian to do that, for those who are Christian. And for those of other denominations--pick your denomination--I just think it would be very cruel.  I thank the gentleman for allowing us to speak out this evening on behalf of citizens who can't speak for themselves and to try to help perfect what we as a Republic can do for our citizenry.                              {time}  2015
