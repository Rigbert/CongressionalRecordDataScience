 I also reserve the right to object here, and in the proper time, I will object.  If my colleagues are interested in supporting legislation here today that helps the people who are impacted by the 2019 storms and legislation that can actually be signed into law, then, I would say they should vote to invoke cloture on my amendment No. 201 today.  I am afraid they are not going to do that, but I will speak on my amendment in greater detail shortly, if I am permitted to.  At the moment, I object to the unanimous consent request offered by the distinguished Senator from Vermont.
