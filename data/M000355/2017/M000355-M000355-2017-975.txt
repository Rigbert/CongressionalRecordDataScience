 President, the legislation I just laid down is called the Health Care Freedom Act, and it restores freedom to Americans that ObamaCare took away. It does so in a number of ways.  First, the Health Care Freedom Act repeals the core pillars of ObamaCare. It eliminates the so-called individual mandate that forces many Americans to buy ObamaCare insurance they don't want, can't afford, or can't use, and taxes those who don't. It also repeals the employer mandate that cuts hours, take-home pay, and job opportunities for workers.  Second, the Health Care Freedom Act provides significant new flexibility to States. The Health Care Freedom Act gives States just the kind of flexibility they need to implement reforms that provide more options for consumers to buy the health insurance they actually want. These reforms also help make insurance more affordable and flexible so it is something Americans actually want to buy.  Finally, the Health Care Freedom Act frees Americans from ObamaCare in several other ways too. It provides 3 years of relief from the medical device tax, which increases costs, hurts innovation, and has drawn significant criticism from both sides of the aisle. It expands, for 3 years, the contribution limits to health savings accounts so Americans can better manage their health costs and pay down more of their medical expenses like prescriptions with pretax dollars.  Also, the legislation will prioritize funding for women's health through community health centers instead of large abortion providers and political organizations.  The American people have suffered under ObamaCare for too long. It is time to end the failed status quo. It is time to send legislation to the President which will finally move our country beyond the failures of ObamaCare. Passing this legislation will allow us to work with our colleagues in the House toward a final bill that could go to the President, repeal ObamaCare, and undo its damage.  I urge everyone to support it.  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that Senator Murray or her designee be recognized to offer a motion to commit; further, that the remaining time be equally divided between the managers or their designees.  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Kennedy). Is there objection?  Without objection, it is so ordered.  The Senator from Washington.                            Motion to Commit
