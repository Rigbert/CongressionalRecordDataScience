Speaker, I rise today to applaud my colleagues for passing by overwhelming majority nine separate bills assailing China's human rights record, its weapons sales, its treatment of religious minorities, its support of compulsory abortion, and its relationship with Taiwan. Virtually all Americans share the same goals with regard to ending China's oppressive practices, but many disagree on the means necessary to accomplish those goals. These bills strongly show the anger and frustration of this Congress toward the Communist Chinese regime.  As former President Ronald Reagan did with the ``Evil Empire,'' I believe the United States must continue to maintain firm dialog with its adversaries, contain them militarily, and saturate them with Western, pro-freedom influences. I believe a similar combination will work on China. I am tough on China and any country that allows human rights abuses and religious persecutions.  As a subcommittee chairman, I denied President Clinton's ill-thought plan for a $50 million coal plant for China. I also recently took part in an event sponsored by the Congressional Human Rights Caucus and ``adopted'' Gyaltsen Choezom, a Tibetan nun, and Qin Musheng, and evangelical pastor, who are imprisoned by the Chinese Government for the peaceful expression of their political beliefs or the practice of their religion. I will join other colleagues in advocating for the release of their adopted prisoners with the Chinese Government. I am committed to improving human rights and establishing true religious freedom for all of the people of China.                          ____________________
