I thank the gentleman and ask the distinguished chairman of the Armed Services Committee if he agrees with me that section 811 was not intended to be a cap or bar on sole-source awards above $20 million, and to also ask if he is concerned about the growing number of reports that agencies are treating the threshold requiring sole-source justification as a prohibition on such awards.  Mr. McKEON. Will the gentleman yield?
