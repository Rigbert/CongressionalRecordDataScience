 President, the answer is yes.  The reason I have counseled my friend from Michigan not to go yet is that the key staff people who know this issue very well, who will also want to be available to Senator Hatch as well as to me, are the very people negotiating this other item which is very close.  Apparently, we are now ready to go. We will be able to move right away to Senator Levin. We may be able to dispose of this right now. Apparently, we have reached our agreement.
