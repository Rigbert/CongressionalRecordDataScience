The Federal standard applicable to the disposal of dredged material from Federal projectsis found in the Code of Federal Regulations at 33 C.F.R., section 335.7. That regulation requires that the method of disposal must be the least costly alternative that is consistent with sound engineering practices and environmentally protective, as provided under the guidelines established by EPA under section 404(b)(l) of the Clean Water Act. EPA's guidelines are found in the Code of Federal Regulations at 40 C.F.R., part 230.  Under EPA's guidelines, ``No discharge of dredged or fill material shall be permitted if it: (1) Causes or contributes, after consideration of disposal site dilution and dispersion, to violations of any applicable State water quality standard.'' S. 2848 does not change this requirement.
