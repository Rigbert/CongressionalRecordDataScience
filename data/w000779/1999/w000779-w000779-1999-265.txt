President, twenty-five years after enactment of the Clean Water Act, we still have not achieved the law's original goal that all our nation's lakes, rivers and streams would be safe for fishing and swimming.  After 25 years, it's time for the next generation of strategies to solve our remaining water quality problems. We need to give States new tools to overcome the new water quality challenges they are now facing.  The money that has been invested in controlling water pollution from factories and upgrading sewage treatment plants has gone a long way to controlling these urban pollution sources. In most cases, the remaining water quality problems are no longer caused by pollution spewing out of factory pipes. Instead, they are caused by runoff from a myriad of sources ranging from farm fields to city streets and parking lots.  In my home State of Oregon, more than half of our streams don't fully meet water quality standards. And the largest problems are contamination form runoff and meeting the standards for water temperatures.  In many cases, conventional approaches will not solve these problems. But we can achieve water temperature standards and obtain other water quality benefits by enhancing stream flows and improving runoff controls.  A major problem for many streams in Oregon and in many other areas of the Western United States is that water supplies are fully appropriated or over-appropriated. There is currently no extra water to spare for increased stream flows.  We can't create new water to fill the gap. But we can make more water available for this use through increased water conservation and more efficient use of existing water supplies.  The key to achieving this would be to create incentives to reduce wasteful water use.  In the Western United States, irrigated agriculture is the single largest user of water. Studies indicate that substantial quantities of water diverted for irrigation do not make it to the fields, with a significant portion lost to evaporation or leakage fro irrigation canals.  In Oregon and other States that recognize rights to conserved water for those who conserve it, irrigators and other water users could gain rights to use conserved water while also increasing the amount of water available for other uses by implementing conservation and efficiency measures to reduce water loss.  The Federal government can play a role in helping meet our nation's changing water needs. In many Western States, supply problems can be addressed by providing financial incentives to help water users implement cost effective water conservation and efficiency measures consistent with State water law.  And, we can improve water quality throughout the nation by giving greater flexibility to States to use Clean Water Act funds to control polluted runoff, if that's where the money is needed most.  Today, I am pleased to be joined by my colleague, Senator Burns, in introducing legislation to authorize the Clean Water State Revolving Fund program to provide loans to water users to fund conservation measures or runoff controls. States would be authorized, but not required, to use their SRF funds for these purposes. Participation by water users, farmers, ranchers and other eligible loan recipients would also be entirely voluntary.  The conservation program would be structured to allow participating users to receive a share of the water saved through conservation or more efficient use, which they could use in accordance with State law. This type of approach would create a win/win situation with more water available for both the conservers and for instream flows. And, by using the SRF program, the Federal seed money would be repaid over time and gradually become available to fund conservation or other measures to solve water quality problems in other areas.  My proposal has the support of the Farm Bureau, Oregon water users, the Environmental Defense Fund and the Oregon Water Trust.  I urge my colleagues to support giving States greater flexibility to use their Clean Water funds for water conservation or runoff control when the State decides that is the best way to solve water quality problems and the water users voluntarily agree to participate.  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be printed in the Record.  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the Record, as follows:                                 S. 188       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of      the United States of America in Congress assembled,     SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.       This Act may be cited as the ``Water Conservation and      Quality Incentives Act''.     SEC. 2. FINDINGS.       Congress finds that--       (1) in many parts of the United States, water supplies are      insufficient to meet current or expected future demand during      certain times of the year;       (2) a number of factors (including growing populations,      increased demands for food and fiber production, and new      environmental demands for water) are placing increased      demands on existing water supply sources;       (3) increased water conservation, water quality      enhancement, and more efficient use of water supplies could      help meet increased demands on water sources;       (4) in States that recognize rights to conserved water for      persons who conserve it, irrigation suppliers, farmers,      ranchers, and other users could gain rights to use conserved      water while also increasing the quantity of water available      for other beneficial uses by implementing measures to reduce      water loss during transport to, or application on, the      fields;       (5) reducing the quantity of water lost during transport to      the fields and improving water quality can help areas better      meet changing population and economic needs; and       (6) the role of the Federal Government in helping meet      those changing water needs should be to provide financial      assistance to help irrigators, farmers, and ranchers      implement practical, cost-effective water quality and      conservation measures.     SEC. 3. USE OF STATE REVOLVING LOAN FUNDS FOR WATER                    CONSERVATION IMPROVEMENTS.
