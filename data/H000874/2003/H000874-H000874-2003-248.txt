Leader, we understand that, but everybody on this floor, every Member, perhaps not the American public, but every Member knows that the majority, when it needs a waiver of the rules to present something on the floor that it wants to present, waives those rules.                              {time}  1715  So when I said something that the minority wants to offer, I meant that, very frankly, if the democratic process is going to operate openly and effectively so that there can be different alternatives considered, alternatives that we believe are appropriate, as well as, obviously, the majority can present the alternatives it deems to be appropriate. Clearly, if one fashions a bill so that the alternative we believe is appropriate is not consistent with those rules and will not give us a waiver, you effectively have precluded us from offering that substitute or those amendments. I mentioned the substitute, but I also would hope that there would be a willingness to make in order numerous amendments from the minority side of the House.  As I have pointed out, Mr. Leader, we represent approximately 140 million Americans on this side; you represent approximately 150 million Americans. That is pretty close. The Americans who sent us here obviously would want to see their alternatives considered by the full House. And if they are rejected, so be it. But I would urge the leader, particularly on a bill as important as this, as controversial as this, having such ramifications to 40 million Americans on Medicare, that you would be, you and the Speaker and the whip on your side, would urge the gentleman from California (Mr. Dreier) and the Committee on Rules to be as broad in their approval of alternatives as they could be.  I see the gentleman from California (Mr. Dreier) is on the floor. I carry around with me, as he knows, quotes. I do not know how many people carry around quotes of the gentleman from California, but I carry around quotes of the gentleman from California in my pocket. From time to time I bring them out. He made the point as a minority Member that a Member ought to be given the ability to offer alternatives; and if they lose, they lose. But in a democratic institution that prides itself on being the people's House, all of the people's representatives ought to be given an option to offer their alternatives.
