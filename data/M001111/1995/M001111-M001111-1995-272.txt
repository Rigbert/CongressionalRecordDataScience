 President, I have serious concerns about S. 565 and cannot support passage of this legislation. I urge my colleagues to think long and hard about consumer health and safety, their individual State's autonomy in determining its own tort laws, as well as the potential impact of this bill on women.  I believe this bill tilts the scales of justice far too dramatically in favor of corporate profits. It is our job to do all we can to assure the families we represent that the products they use are safe, and that they will have recourse if they are harmed.  Mr. President, this bill hurts the little guy. Is it not time we all stepped back, and remembered the adage--there but for the grace of God go I.
