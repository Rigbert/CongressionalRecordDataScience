 President, I rise this afternoon to offer an amendment that would help make our communities and our Nation's ports safer and more secure.  I ask unanimous consent to add the following Senators as cosponsors to my amendment: Senators Bill Nelson, Clinton, Schumer, Mikulski, Kennedy, Boxer, Cantwell, Graham, and Landrieu.
