 President, this is becoming overly complicated. The chairman of the Armed Services Committee and I are talking about what comes next after we finish the healthcare debate. As we discussed in my office a few moments ago, the chairman would like to turn to NDAA next. Healthcare, whether our friends on the other side like it or not, will come to a conclusion here at some point. The issue is what comes next.  As the chairman of the Armed Services Committee has pointed out, this is a totally separate issue and, as he pointed out, a bill that came out of his committee 27 to 0. As we all know, he is available to manage that bill this week.  What I am saying to our colleagues on both sides of the aisle is when wefinish healthcare either the way I would like to finish it or the way our Democratic friends would like to finish it, we are going to try to turn to NDAA and accommodate the chairman's schedule and give him an opportunity to finish that bill while he is here. That is the issue.  So I hope we will be able to work our way toward that when we finish healthcare. I will ask unanimous consent--not now, but I will be asking for unanimous consent to turn to the National Defense Authorization Act.  I yield the floor.
