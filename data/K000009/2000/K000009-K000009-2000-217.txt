Speaker, I wanted to thank my very able colleague, the gentlewoman from Michigan (Ms. Stabenow), for taking out this special order tonight on the important issue of prescription drugs. I would like to lend my verbal support and moral support to everything she is trying to do in taking on this great leadership challenge for our Nation.  This past weekend I visited one of my dear friends back home who was denied coverage for prescription drugs, and was told that if he were to try to save his life in a cancer treatment, he and his wife would have to cough up $1,500 a week. How would Members like to have to face that decision as they are trying to save their lives, and their family is surrounding them at one of the most difficult times it has ever faced?  So I am with the gentlewoman in her efforts here to do what is right for our senior citizens as well as our families. The people in the room in the hospital were from all ages, all the relatives. Here they had to contend with these insurance companies and all these prescription drug problems when they were trying to deal with a life and death situation.  I thank the gentlewoman from Michigan. We admire the gentlewoman's work and she has our support.  Mr. Speaker, I rise tonight to advise my colleagues about one more reason that this Congress should not approve a blank check that will be before us in about 5 weeks called ``Approving Permanent Normal Trade Status for the People's Republic of China.''  I want Members to know, and I am placing in the Record the story of another one of my constituents from near Toledo, Ohio, in the village of White House. I hope the message I give tonight will reach the White House here in Washington.                              {time}  1915  This is the story of Ciping Huang, a Chinese American at the University of Toledo, married to a gentleman from my community. She has been harassed, detained, interrogated, and expelled from China because of her association as a member of the Independent Federation of Chinese Students and Scholars in our Nation. She has been refused reentry into China to visit her ill father who is suffering from cancer, and I can think of no better example of the callous disregard for human rights exhibited daily by the government of the People's Republic of China than her story. I will read her letter to you, and I hope to bring her to Washington as this debate ensues.  She says, ``Dear Congresswoman, my name is Ciping Huang and I am a council member of the Independent Federation of Chinese Students and Scholars in the United States.''  She has been an elected officer in that organization, which was established in 1989, after the Tiananmen Square massacre.  ``Unfortunately,'' she writes, ``our involvement, our association's involvement, in democracy and freedom for China has resulted in harsh treatment by the Chinese Communist government, in particular on our student members as they try to return to their homeland. Whether a Chinese citizen oran American citizen, our members can be harassed, detained, threatened or kicked out of China because of our activities. And what are our activities? Consistent delivery of overseas donations to the June 4 massacre victims and families from Tiananmen Square.       We support and have supported conditional yearly renewal of      the most favored nation trade status for China, and because      we lobby the United States Congress to provide protection for      Chinese students and scholars from punishment by the Chinese      Government due to their roles in fighting for democracy since      1989.  She says, ``Take my story as an example. In 1998, while I went home to visit my aging parents in China, I was taken away by the secret police for interrogation on many details related to our student association and the activities of other Chinese Democratic groups and organizations.       For several days, they tried to force me to do things I did      not want to do, including signing a confession letter. On the      fifth day I was given 20 minutes to pack my luggage and say      good-bye to my scared parents and was forced into Hong Kong.      Still, the secret police told me they had treated me      leniently because I am married to an American.       He had contacted his congressional representative, the      gentlewoman from Ohio (Ms. Kaptur), in order to protect me.      The government told me I must cooperate with them afterwards      and do what they wanted me to do if I ever wanted to return      home to visit my parents again.       Last September, I learned my father had a 102 degree fever      for several days and was diagnosed with cancer. I decided to      take a trip back home immediately. However, about 20 police      stopped me at the Shanghai International Airport. They      searched my luggage and would not let me make phone calls or      even go to the bathroom.       In the airport I asked them to respect the United Nations      Universal Declaration of Human Rights, which the Chinese      President had just signed, and let me go visit my ill father,      but my plea was simply ignored. I was put on the airplane      back to Tokyo, even though they knew that the hospital had      sent us a critical condition notice which stated that my      father could die any minute.       In Tokyo, I repeatedly appealed to the Chinese authorities      to allow me into China for basic humanitarian reasons but to      no avail. Up until this day, I still have not been able to      visit my poor father.  ``For a long time,'' she says,       I have viewed America, its people and its government as the      ones who hold the moral flags high who would be willing to      help and sometimes sacrifice themselves for the people in the      rest of the world to gain their basic human rights and      dignity, and for humanitarian reasons.       Now for this permanent normal trade status, as well as      admission to the WTO, the World Trade Organization, I wish      you could prove that again. I wish you could answer this      question correctly: Is business more important than the      principles we live by? Do we care about the human rights      condition of more than 1.2 billion human lives  In the past, the annual congressional conditional renewal of most favored nation to China was able to provide some leverage for Chinese human rights improvement, such as the release of some political prisoners and the relaxation of the political atmosphere within China. Unfortunately, as you all know, without the attachment of the human rights improvement, conditions in China have deteriorated in the last few years.  Mr. Speaker, at this point I would like to insert the remainder of this letter in the Record, and I will come to the floor again to read the conclusion.       The Chinese Communist government has not and will not learn      democracy and respect human dignity from the PNTR. They would      only take its passage as an advantage and signal that it is      OK to continue their miserable, poor record on human rights      and democracy.       But, if America could care less about people far away (look      at what they have done to FaLun Gong members and Taiwan      recently), I hope you do realize that the PNTR would do no      more benefit for American workers, especially those in the      trade Unions where people earn a living wage with health and      retirement benefits. In China, there are no real workers      unions; thus, it puts American workers in a much more      disadvantaged position to compete with.       Let me stress, I wish that America will protect the human      rights of its own people. Furthermore, America should help to      protect the human rights of its own people by helping to      protect the human rights of the people in the other      countries. Only when these countries have human rights and      democracy, shall the world be in peace. And I wish we could      hold morality above money, but not the other way around. And      I wish none of us, including our democratic government, would      have to kneel in front of a dictatorial government for money,      or mercy, or the human rights we deserve to have. And      finally, with all of your conscience and help, I wish that in      the near future, I would be able to visit my ill father in my      homeland.       Thank you all.           Sincerely,     Ciping Huang.                          ____________________
