President, I believe I actually had the floor anyway, and I am glad to yield the floor, which I will do to my colleague from Michigan. But I want to make sure I am clear in the statement I made in that I don't disagree and that my colleague doesn't disagree with the statements I made.  We have a commitment to do everything we can to ensure this is in the WRDA bill. I tried to explain the difference in jurisdiction, which makes it impossible for them to do it over there within the T&I Committee. They have jurisdiction over WRDA but not these particular provisions.  I have a lot of things in the CR I am really wanting to get done. I mentioned the military end, but on the Zika funding, I have given speeches on the floor saying how important this is because I happen to have a grandniece in Florida who is pregnant right now. So I am really interested in getting this thing done, and it is going to get done. It is going to be a part of the ultimate CR.  I just wanted to say--and I listened to the statement by the ranking member of the committee that I chair, and I don't think she disagrees with anything I am saying in terms of our commitment to getting it done. I understand where she is coming from, and I will yield the floor.
