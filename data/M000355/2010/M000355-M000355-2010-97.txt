 President, sometime today the majority leader will file cloture on the motion to proceed to the Defense authorization bill, setting up a vote for next week on this important legislation. Under ordinary circumstances, this would be a straightforward, noncontroversial vote that could unite the two parties on a matter related to our common defense. But not this year.  This year, Democrats would rather use this bill to manufacture controversy. Worse still, in their determination to meet their own campaign promises ahead of the upcoming election, Democrats have decided to put their own political interests ahead ofthe collective judgment of our military service chiefs who are still in the midst of a study about whether don't ask, don't tell can be repealed without hurting combat readiness. But this should not surprise anyone. For nearly 2 years now, Democrats have done their own thing. Americans have been asking Democrats for nearly 2 years to focus on the economy and jobs, and what they have gotten instead is one costly government-driven job after another that kills jobs and hurts the economy.  When it comes to matters of national defense, Democrats in Washington have established a clear pattern of making political decisions first and then analyzing the problem later. Whether it was the decision to close Gitmo before figuring out what to do with the terrorists who were housed there, to deny our intelligence community the ability to interrogate terrorists, an artificial timeline for withdrawal in Afghanistan or this latest decision to use a Defense authorization bill to move ahead with repeal of don't ask, don't tell before hearing back from the service chiefs, Democrats have shot first and asked questions later. In other words, they put their own ideological goals ahead of everything else.  I remind my colleagues we are fighting two wars and that our volunteer force doesn't ask for much.
