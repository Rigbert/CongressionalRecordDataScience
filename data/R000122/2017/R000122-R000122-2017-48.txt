President, first, let me once again commend the chairman for working collaboratively and cooperatively to include in this legislation over 100 amendments that have improved a very good piece of legislation. It also represents the input of the vast majority of our colleagues in the Senate. But I think, too, that we should have opportunities to debate and vote, which was typical in previous considerations of the National Defense Authorization Act. We are still considering the possibility of such votes, and I hope we can reach an appropriate conclusion to have votes and debates. But to this point, again, let me thank the chairman for his leadership and take his wise advice to think seriously about how we proceed forward with this legislation.  Mr. President, I yield back.
