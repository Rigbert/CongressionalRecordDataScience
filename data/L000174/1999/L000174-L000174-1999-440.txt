President, I salute a longtime Vermont businesswoman, and a fixture on Burlington's Church Street Marketplace, Mrs. Lois Bodoky.  Lois is affectionately known in Burlington as the ``Hot Dog Lady'', for she recently celebrated the 25th anniversary of her business running a hot dog cart in downtown Burlington.  Lois went into the hot dog business not long after her hair salon was lost in a fire, and at the same time I was running my first campaign for U.S. Senator. Back then, Church Street was a typical Vermont downtown, and Lois operated her cart on the sidewalk as cars and buses passed on the street. Now, her cart is in a prime spot on Church Street Marketplace, which became a pedestrian mall in the early 1980's, and is one of Vermont's prime shopping areas.  Since Lois went into business, downtown Burlington has seen many changes, but the ``Hot Dog Lady's'' cart has remained a fixture, even in some of Vermont's coldest months. She is truly a Burlington institution and is most reliable to members of the downtown crowd who cannot let a lunch hour pass without a lunch from Lois.                          ____________________
