 President, it is always a pleasure to listen to the Senator from Minnesota because whether he is right or wrong, he always speaks with a great deal of passion. I want people who have ideas to have passion for those ideas. Senator Wellstone is a person who speaks with a great deal of passion and conviction.  I disagree with a lot of the points he has made; otherwise, we would not have this legislation before us. On the other hand, on the subject of concentration, which he brought up, I have some sympathy for what he has said. The solution to the concentration problem is we should get this administration to vigorously enforce the antitrust laws both within the Justice Department and the Federal Trade Commission. There is a general feeling among people about whether the marketplace is working adequately and, consequently, support the antitrust laws. The antitrust laws are well written and have withstood a period of time, but enforcement is very much an issue.  We are not talking about concentration, and we are not talking about enforcement of the antitrust laws when we deal with bankruptcy. We have a very real problem. We have seen a dramatic increase in bankruptcies over the last 6 or 7 years. In 1993, we had 875,202 bankruptcies, and in 1998, it shot up to 1,442,549.  We have seen this dramatic increase in the number of bankruptcies during one of the most prosperous times in the history of our country. It has been the most prosperous for several reasons: One, information technology is helping to expand our economy and make it more efficient than ever before.  The globalization of our economy has also reduced consumer costs, giving consumers more money to expend on other things. We have seen Congress balance the budget in the last 3 years, and it worked toward that for the last 6 years and made considerable progress. Now we are paying down the national debt for the third year in a row. All that has contributed to it.  We are in the 18th year of economic expansion, which started in the second year of Ronald Reagan's administration. We had a turnaround in the economy after the stagflation of the seventies, and except for a 6-month period of time in 1992, we have had 18 years of economic expansion. During that period of economic expansion, we have had this very dramatic increase in bankruptcies.  Why? I wish I could say there is just one reason, as the Senator from Minnesota seems to imply; that it is credit being extended too easily, too many credit cards. I agree that is a reason, but that is only one of the reasons.  Another reason is we have a bankruptcy bar that has, quite frankly, encouraged bankruptcies. We have shown during previous debates on this bill where bankruptcy lawyers in California advertise in the media how to get out of paying alimony and child support by going into bankruptcy. These types of practices, obviously, are not ethical but are still being used.  We also have the bad example set by the Federal Government of 30 years of deficit spending. If Uncle Sam can borrow money into the trillions of dollars over a period of 30 years, isn't it all right for Mary Smith and Tom Jones or the people who are working in Anywhere USA to go into debt as well? Uncle Sam did not set a very good example. Congress, doing the fiscal policy for Uncle Sam, did not set a very good example. It says to others: Yes, it's OK for you to go in debt.  The Federal Government has turned that around in 3 years by balancing the budget and paying down some of the national debt and is on the road to paying down the national debt very dramatically over the next 10 to 15 years.  We also have a situation where somehow financial responsibility is not considered a personal responsibility anymore. In other words, it is OK to go into debt and not pay your bills. There used to be a certain amount of shame connected with bankruptcy that does not seem to be there now.  I gave four reasons--and there may be a lot more--of why we are probably in this situation where we have had 18 years of economic expansion since the second year of the Reagan administration and yet have a historically high number of bankruptcies, and during the best years of our economy, we have seen bankruptcies almost double in a period of 6 or 7 years.  Consequently, we have this legislation before us. I do not disregard the words of the Senator from Minnesota that there are some people who are vulnerable and for whom we need to be concerned, but I say to the Senator from Minnesota, we are not extinguishing the principle that has been a part of the bankruptcy law for the last 102 years, permanent bankruptcy legislation. There are segments of our population in bad financial trouble, through no fault of their own, who need the help of bankruptcy. That could be death, divorce, a lot of medical expenses, a natural disaster, for instance, if you are a farmer or some other small businessperson, or maybe even a homeowner who had a natural disaster that was not properly insured.  Our code says there are select groups of people who are in a bad financial situation, through no fault of their own, who should have a fresh start. I say to the Senator from Minnesota and all the other Senators who question this legislation, we keep that principle, but we also say this Congress has to send a clear signal to the 270 million people in this country that if you have the ability to repay some or all of your debt, you are not going to get off scot-free. There are large numbers of people who are getting off scot-free, albeit they may be a minority, but they are a significant minority, and it does not set a very good example for some people to be able to use the bankruptcy code as part of financial planning.  We are saying to those who can repay that they have to repay, but we are also sending a signal through this legislation to credit card companies that are willy-nilly sending out credit cards that encourage bankruptcy or even a lack of personal responsibility.  We are saying it has to be a new day. We want to discourage those people who maybe are low income, who should not have gotten, through their own fault, into debt, and are not in the classification of people who I say are entitled to a fresh start--that somehow they should think again about going into bankruptcy and only use bankruptcy as a last resort.  We find that the 1978 law, obviously, has contributed some to the big increase in bankruptcies. This legislation passed by a very wide margin. So I do not think it was intended that the 1978 law ought to make it easier to go into bankruptcy. But, obviously, it sent that signal to a lot of people in America, as we have seen that the number of bankruptcies in 1980 was only 331,000 and now 18 years later, in 1998, the figures are 1,442,000.  Something has happened recently. Again, I do not pretend to stand before the American people, or my colleagues in the Senate, and say passing a law is going to solve all these problems. I wish it would. It is going to be a combination of several things: the credit card companies or credit-granting companies to be more careful in who they grant credit to; a Congress to be financially responsible and, hence, set a good example for every taxpayer and citizen in this country that debt isn't OK; the bankruptcy bar to be a little more careful about encouraging people to go into bankruptcy and not to advertise that bankruptcy is OK as a way out; and then the law itself, by discouraging people who can repay to use the bankruptcy code for financial planning.  In this whole process, I hope we then enhance personal responsibility. By enhancing personal responsibility, then we can reduce these numbers of bankruptcies and then reduce the economic problem we have--because we are not talking about something that does not make an impact upon everybody.  Some people have put this at a $40 billion problem--$40 billion owed by those who go into bankruptcy and do not pay. Then every other consumer in America picks up part of that tab. We have no doubt about it, if you are shoplifting, the honest consumer, who does not shoplift, is going to pay the cost of shoplifting. This is somewhat the same. If you are a businessperson, and somebody does not pay their bills by declaring bankruptcy, the honest person buying goods from that same business is going to pick up the tab. And $400, on average, for a family of four, is what we pay for other people who do not pay.  We hope to enhance personal responsibility. We hope to help the economy in the process. But most importantly, this is something that must be dealt with, and I think this legislation deals with it.  That is the background for this legislation. I think it is necessary to give some of that background, as I respond to some of the specific issues that the Senator from Minnesota brought up.  First of all, he mentioned the point that there has been some decline in the rate of growth of bankruptcies in recent years. We think that is true. It is a little bit too early to make that judgment. I hope it is true. I think it is a direct result of Congress talking about this horrible economic problem we have of $40 billion and the lack of personal responsibility which goes with that economic problem. Perhaps it is sending signals to some of the consumers to think twice about whether bankruptcy is the right direction to go in. Maybe it sent a signal to some of the bankruptcy lawyers in America to counsel people not to go into bankruptcy.  I hope the leadership of this Congress over the last 3 years, in discussing this legislation--actually having passed it in the last Congress in both Houses, but not getting the final product to the President in time before adjournment--has done some good.  So we have had a very modest decline in bankruptcies in 1999 as compared to 1998. But if you take the historical look--and I have referred to some of those figures since 1980--Senator Wellstone's point that the bankruptcy crisis is going away turns out to be false. I have referred to the 330,000 bankruptcies we had in 1980, the year the new code went into effect. But that has gone up to just under 1.4 million in 1999. Unlike the Senator from Minnesota, I think 1.4 million bankruptcies per year is a real crisis.  In the past, in the middle 1980s, and even once during the 1990s, we have had some minor dips in the bankruptcy filings; but since then, as I have referred to, we have had this dramatic increase, almost doubling, in the last 6 or 7 years.  I ask unanimous consent to have printed in the Record a table of the total filings, business filings, nonbusiness filings, and the percentage of consumer filings of total filings.  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in the Record, as follows:                    U.S. BANKRUPTCY FILINGS 1980-1998                     [Business, Non-Business, Total]------------------------------------------------------------------------                                                               Consumer                                                              filings as                           Totals     Business      Non-          a          Year             filings     filings    business    percentage                                                   filings     of total                                                               filings------------------------------------------------------------------------1980                        331,264      43,694     287,570        86.811981                        363,943      48,125     315,818        86.781982                        380,251      69,300     310,951        81.781983                        348,880      62,436     286,444        82.101984                        348,521      64,004     284,517        81.641985                        412,510      71,277     341,233        82.721986                        530,438      81,235     449,203        84.691987                        577,999      82,446     495,553        85.741988                        613,465      63,853     549,612        89.591989                        679,461      63,235     616,226        90.691990                        782,960      64,853     718,107        91.721991                        943,987      71,549     872,438        92.421992                        971,517      70,643     900,874        92.731993                        875,202      62,304     812,898        92.881994                        832,829      52,374     780,455        93.711995                        926,601      51,959     874,642        94.391996                      1,178,555      53,549   1,125,006        95.461997                      1,404,145      54,027   1,350,118        96.151998                      1,442,549      44,367   1,398,182        96.92------------------------------------------------------------------------
