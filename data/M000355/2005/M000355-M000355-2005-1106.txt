  While many may know of the horrors committed in Burma by the illegitimate State Peace and Development Council, SPDC, and the courage, dignity and determination of Suu Kyi and her compatriots in the face of this repression, some people may be unaware that June 19 marks Suu Kyi's 60th birthday.  I would like nothing more than to pick up the telephone and call her in Rangoon to give her best wishes on her birthday. However, I cannot. Nor can anyone else. Suu Kyi remains under house arrest by the SPDC.  In addition to my colleagues in the Unofficial Burma Caucus in the Senate--Senators Feinstein, McCain, Frist and Lugar to name but a few--it is important to recognize the expressions of support for Suu Kyi and democracy in Burma by other stalwarts of freedom, including Georgian President Mikheil Saakashvili, Mongolian Prime Minister Elbegdorj Tskahiagiin, former Czech Republic President Vaclav Havel, former Malaysian Deputy Prime Minister Anwar Ibrahim, and a litany of fellow Nobel Peace Prize recipients. I ask that statements by President Saakashvili and Prime Minister Elbegdorj be printed in the Record following my remarks.
