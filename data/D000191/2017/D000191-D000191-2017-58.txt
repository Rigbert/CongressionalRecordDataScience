Speaker, I will vote against H.R. 1301, the Fiscal Year 2017 Department of Defense (DOD) Appropriations Act.  The legislation includes several provisions that I strongly support, including giving service men and women a well-deserved raise of 2.1 percent. The bill provides much-needed funding to address traumatic brain injuries, PTSD, sexual assault and suicide prevention, and vital cancer research. It also includes funding for Ukraine and Eastern Europe security initiatives to counter Russia's heightened military provocations and annexation of Crimea.  However, H.R. 1301 funds provisions I do not support, including $61.8 billion to the Overseas Contingency Operations (OCO) fund, an account which is not subject to the budgetary caps imposed on all other discretionary programs, and is used as a slush fund by the Pentagon.  Unlike every other federal agency, the DOD has been unable to complete a financial audit to inform taxpayers how the biggest bureaucracy in the federal government spends their money. In fact, a shocking report released last December exposed $125 billion in administrative waste that the Pentagon tried to bury from being viewed by the public. I refuse to support increased bureaucratic waste at the expense of American taxpayers. A more accountable and transparent department would ensure more taxpayer money is directed towards the needs of our troops and the benefits they deserve rather than buying unnecessary weapon systems, sustaining a Cold War era military force, and giving the President a blank check to fund wars Congress hasn't authorized.  Along with bloated defense spending, the bill prohibits the closing of Guantanamo Bay, which costs more than $100 million each year and has been used as a top recruiting tool by terrorists. Frankly, the prison at Guantanamo Bay has been a black eye for the United States. It has eroded relationships with our allies, undermined U.S. missions abroad, and put U.S. citizens and our troops at risk of retaliation in places where the Geneva Conventions are not followed.  Congress can make responsible cuts to the DOD budget without jeopardizing the safety of our troops or undermining our national security.                          ____________________
