 President, I am pleased to introduce today, along with Senator Inouye, the distinguished Senator from Hawaii, the PACE Provider Act of 1997. PACE, the Program of All-Inclusive Care for the Elderly, is a unique system of integrated care for the frail elderly. This Act increases the number of PACE sites authorized to provide comprehensive, community-based services to frail, elderly persons.  As our population ages, we must continue to place a high priority on long-term care services. Giving our seniors alternatives to nursing home care and expanding the choices available, is not only cost effective, but will also improve the quality of life for older Americans.  PACE programs achieve this goal. PACE enables the frail elderly to remain as healthy as possible, at home in their communities. By doing so, elderly individuals maintain their independence, dignity and quality of life.  Each PACE participant receives a comprehensive care package, including all Medicare and Medicaid services, as well as community-based long-term care services. Each individual is cared for by an interdisciplinary team consisting of a primary care physician, nurse, social worker, rehabilitation therapist, home health worker, and others. Because care providers on the PACE team work together, they are able to successfully accommodate the complex medical and social needs of the elderly person in fragile health.  What's more, PACE provides high-quality care at a lower cost to Medicare and Medicaid, relative to their payments in the traditional system. Studies show a 5-15 percent reduction in Medicare and Medicaid spending for individuals in PACE.  The potential savings to Medicare and Medicaid is significant. PACE programs provide services for one of our most vulnerable, and costly, population: frail, elderly adults who are eligible for Medicare and Medicaid. In many cases, these ``dually eligible'' individuals have complex, chronic care needs and require ongoing, long-term care services. The current structure of Medicare and Medicaid does not encourage coordination of these services. The result is fragmented and costly care for our nation's most vulnerable population.  The PACE Provider Act does not alter the criteria for eligibility for PACE participation in any way. Instead, it makes PACE programs more available to individuals already eligible for nursing home care, because of their poor health status. PACE is a preferable, and less costly, alternative. Specifically, this Act increases the number of PACE programs authorized from 15 to 40, with an additional 20 to be added each year, and affords regular ``provider'' status to existing sites.  The PACE Provider Act allows the success of PACE programs to be replicated throughout the country. And, with an emphasis on preventative and supportive services, PACE services can substantially reduce the high-costs associated with emergency room visits and extended nursing home stays often needed by the frail elderly in the traditional Medicare and Medicaid programs.  My sponsorship of this bill grows out of my Aging Committee hearing on April 29, Torn Between Two Systems: Improving Chronic Care in Medicare and Medicaid. The plight of the dual eligibles is unacceptable. This bill is an immediate and positive step in the right direction.  I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be printed in the Record.  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the Record, as follows:                                 S. 720       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of      the United States of America in Congress assembled,     SECTION 1.
