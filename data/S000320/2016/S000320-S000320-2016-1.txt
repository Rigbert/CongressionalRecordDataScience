 President, I will take just a few minutes. I rise to call up for consideration H.R. 3394, the CAPTIVE Act. I have long advocated for the Senate to pass the CAPTIVE Act, which passed the House by unanimous consent in July.  In 2003, a group of Department of Defense contractors were on a counternarcotics mission in Colombia when their plane crash-landed. These Americans were captured by members of the Revolutionary Armed Forces of Colombia, which we know as FARC, which is a violent guerrilla group that is heavily involved in drug trafficking.  My fellow Alabamian Thomas J. Janis, the pilot of the plane, tragically lost his life at the hands of these terrorists on February 13, 2003. The threeother Americans abroad the flight were kidnapped, held hostage, and tortured for more than 5 years until they were finally rescued by the Colombia military. These heroes are now seeking justice for themselves and their families against those who carried out unthinkable acts of violence.  The CAPTIVE Act is simple. It would make it easier for all U.S. victims of terrorism to recover court-awarded damages. I believe that the family of Tom Janis and all of the victims of terror deserve nothing less than for the Senate to swiftly pass the CAPTIVE Act. I urge my colleagues to join me in supporting that.  I ask unanimous consent that the Senate proceed to the immediate consideration of H.R. 3394, which was received from the House; I further ask that the bill be considered read a third time and passed and the motion to reconsider be considered made and laid upon the table.  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mrs. Ernst). Is there objection?  The Senator from Ohio.
