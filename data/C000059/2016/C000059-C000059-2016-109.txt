The power plant rule that was mentioned earlier is a regulatory program.  What DERA does is replace old technology with the new technology that is up to 90 percent cleaner than the old trucks, old diesel engines that we are presently using. This is working.  I am not in favor of programs and continuous studies and other oppressive methods by EPA that don't produce clean air. This does. It was mentioned that our air is getting cleaner. It is getting cleaner because of programs like DERA that actually work. It is measurable in the South Coast Air Quality Management District and other areas throughout the United States.  They have been able to take these dirty, old trucks off the road. You have all seen them. You have been on the freeway and you see an old diesel truck that is putting out more emissions than virtually everything else around them. You take that truck off the road and it has immediate results.  So let's not get rid of something that works. Let's work against these regulatory programs that oppress the economy and don't have any results.  I might point out, too, the administration has been opposed to DERA. Most of the environmental folks have been opposed because they don't want any carbon in the economy. So they don't want us to clean up diesel because they want to have electric vehicles or zero emission vehicles, which do not have the horsepower or the ability to deliver the goods that we need to have in this Nation.  So, I would urge a ``no'' vote on this amendment.  Madam Chair, I reserve the balance of my time.
