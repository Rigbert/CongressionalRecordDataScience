President, today is a day which can be historic. Important items will be discussed on the floor of the Senate, including health insurance for literally millions of American kids. At the same time, there is a debate that has been started in New York at the United Nations Security Council. It is a debate about a genocide.  It is, thank goodness, rare that we have to address the issue of genocide in this world, but today we must. We are talking of a genocide today, in New York, at the Security Council, that has caused untold human misery, mass murder, dislocation, torture, rape, and the torching of entire villages. For 4 years the world has watched this tragedy. That's right, for 4 years.  Haven't we learned our lesson when it comes to letting genocide continue without taking action?
