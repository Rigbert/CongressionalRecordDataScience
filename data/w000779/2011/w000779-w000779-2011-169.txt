President, recently, the president of the University of Oregon, Richard Lariviere, came to meet with me in my office. The University of Oregon is my law school alma mater, and I was commiserating with President Lariviere about the Ducks' narrow loss in the BCS national championship football game. President Lariviere told me about a wonderful speech that Coach Chip Kelly gave to his players after the game. I asked President Lariviere to share the story with me in writing; and with his permission and that of Coach Kelly, I would like now to share that story with my colleagues:       Recollections of President Lariviere:       On January 10, 2011 when the final whistle ended the BCS      national championship football championship game, the      University of Oregon was behind by three points--three points      scored by our friends from Auburn in the final two seconds of      the game.       The UO players made their way to the locker room,      disappointed needless-to-say. Coach Chip Kelly talked to his      players, and his remarks were just what any university      president would want to hear from a head coach, made more      remarkable and emotional because of the magnitude and      unprecedented nature of the moment.       With the team gathered around him, Coach Kelly told these      student athletes that they had played a great game, that he      was proud of them, and that he could not have asked for more.      Then he said this:       ``In ten minutes the media will come in here and they're      going to ask you how you feel. They're going to tell you that      this is a defining moment in your lives. I want you to know      that this is not a defining moment in your lives. You are      young men who play football, but football does not define      you. A defining moment will be when you graduate, when you      marry, when you have children. Those are the moments that      define your lives.''       Then Coach Kelly turned to each of the seniors and reminded      them of the promise they made to him that they would      graduate.       In that locker room with a team that accomplished what no      other Oregon football team had ever done, Coach Chip Kelly      represented the very best values that have come to be      associated with the University of Oregon: bold and audacious,      hard working and high achieving, and a focus on what really      matters.
