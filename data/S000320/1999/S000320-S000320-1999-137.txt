 I will read it to you, the language, on page 15, whereit says: ``Federal-Aid Highways, (Liquidation of Contract Authorization), Highway Trust Fund).''       For carrying out the provisions of title 23, United States      Code, that are attributable to Federal-aid highways,      including the National Scenic and Recreational Highway as      authorized by 23 U.S.C. 148, not otherwise provided,      including reimbursement for sums expended pursuant to the      provisions of 23 U.S.C. 308, $26,125,000,000 or so much      thereof as may be available in and derived from the Highway      Trust Fund, to remain available until expended.  That is the provision.
