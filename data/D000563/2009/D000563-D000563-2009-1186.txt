FINDINGS.       The Congress finds that--       (1) Dr. Muhammad Yunus is recognized in the United States      and throughout the world as a leading figure in the fight      against poverty and the effort to promote economic and social      change;       (2) Muhammad Yunus is the recognized developer of the      concept of microcredit, and Grameen Bank, which he founded,      has created a model of lending that has been emulated across      the globe;       (3) Muhammad Yunus launched this global movement to create      economic and social development from below, beginning in      1976, with a loan of $27 from his own pocket to 42 crafts      persons in a small village in Bangladesh;       (4) Muhammad Yunus has demonstrated the life-changing      potential of extending very small loans (at competitive      interest rates) to the very poor and the economic feasibility      of microcredit and other microfinance and microenterprise      practices and services;       (5) Dr. Yunus's work has had a particularly strong impact      on improving the economic prospects of women, and on their      families, as over 95 percent of microcredit borrowers are      women;       (6) Dr. Yunus has pioneered a movement with the potential      to assist a significant number of the more than 1,400,000,000      people, mostly women and children, who live on less than      $1.25 a day, and the 2,600,000,000 people who live on less      than $2 a day, and which has already reached 155,000,000, by      one estimate;       (7) there are now an estimated 24,000,000 microenterprises      in the United States accounting for approximately 18 percent      of private (nonfarm) employment and 87 percent of all      business in the United States, and the Small Business      Administration has made over $318,000,000 in microloans to      entrepreneurs since 1992;       (8) Dr. Yunus, along with the Grameen Bank, was awarded the      Nobel Peace Prize in 2006 for his efforts to promote economic      and social opportunity and out of recognition that lasting      peace cannot be achieved unless large population groups find      the means, such as microcredit, to break out of poverty; and       (9) the microcredit ideas developed and put into practice      by Muhammad Yunus, along with other bold initiatives, can      make a historical breakthrough in the fight against poverty.
