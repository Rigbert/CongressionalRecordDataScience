 President, today I am pleased to be joined by Senators Collins, Mikulski, Cantwell, Cochran, and Chafee in introducing the Access to Innovation for Medicare Patients Act of 2001. This legislation will give Medicare patients access to innovative medical treatments that are convenient and affordable and will remove a bureaucratic burden to promising new drugs.  For many years, patients with diseases like rheumatoid arthritis, multiple sclerosis, hepatitis C and deep vein thrombosis could only get effective treatments in a doctor's office. This method of drug delivery puts a great burden on patients with limited mobility.  Fortunately, in recent years, new medical technologies have created promising drug treatments that patients can use in their own homes. These drugs don't have to be administered by a doctor. Patients can inject the drugs themselves. So instead of traveling to a doctor's office several times a week, patients can now get the same treatments in their own homes. These new treatments, known as self-injectible biologics, mean patients can save time and have a better quality of life.  Biologics are genetically-engineered proteins that must be infused or injected into a patient to be effective. If swallowed orally, biologics simply pass through the body during the digestion process and are not absorbed into the system. These drugs represent a major breakthrough in disease treatment and management.  Today, many patients with private insurance and those on Medicaid have coverage for many self-injectible biologics. Unfortunately, patients on Medicare do not. Today, Medicare discriminates against these effective medical treatments and patients are feeling the impact.  The time has come to remove this unfair burden and give Medicare patients access to self-injectible biologics. As sponsors of this bill, we believe that Medicare should not discriminate against patients who are treated with the same drugs either in a doctor's office or at home. The bill we are introducing today will correct this mistake and ensure that Medicare patients have access to safe, promising drugs.  Our legislation has been endorsed by the Arthritis Foundation, the American Public Health Association, National Association of Retired Federal Employees, National Council on the Aging, National Farmers Union, National Hispanic Council on Aging, Association of Jewish Aging Services and the Visiting Nurses Associations of America.  I want my colleagues to understand that this bill does not address the broader need for prescription drug coverage overall. Congress still must address that hole in the Medicare system. But this bill does correct a clear mistake in Medicare's payment rules for self-injectible biologics.  This unfair policy has several consequences. First, it prevents patients from getting the treatments they need. The FDA has recently approved several new self injected biologics to treat rheumatoid arthritis, multiple sclerosis, hepatitis C and deep vein thrombosis. Medicare beneficiaries should have immediate access to these new treatments without delay. Many of these diseases hinder a patient's mobility and quality of life. It is difficult to explain to these patients that in order to have treatments covered they must travel to their physicians office once, twice or even three times a week. Many of these patients are disabled and depend on family or friends for transportation. Patients in rural areas are particularly hurt by this policy, where their doctor may be many miles away. These patients might have to drive 50 or 60 miles a week. For individuals living on fixed income, this policy is especially difficult.  This outdated policy hits women the hardest. As many of my colleagues know, more women are covered by Medicare, and women are twice as likely as men to live with a disabling, chronic condition. Women are also twice as likely as men to live in poverty after age 65. Older women or disabled women simply do not have the same economic resources as men. In addition, many of the illnesses that could be treated with self injected biologics strike women in larger numbers. Rheumatoid arthritis and multiple sclerosis most often affect women. Any policy that limits access to new innovative treatments for rheumatoid arthritis and multiple sclerosis places women at a severe disadvantage.  In addition to the impact this policy has on patients, it also affect drug development. This practice discourages drug companies from offering patients new drugs that are self-injectible. That can hinder innovations and developments in biotechnology research. In the future, companies may choose not to develop self injected biologics. Our policies should promote new drug development, not discourage it.  As you know, the U.S. Senate has voted overwhelmingly to doubling NIH funding to encourage more research. it's one of my top priorities, and we are on track. However, I am troubled that patients on Medicare might not benefit from our efforts. It is counterproductive to invest in medical research, but then deny Medicare beneficiaries the fruits of that investment.  I would like to briefly mention one particular new self-injected biologic treatment that has literally changed the lives of hundreds of RA patients. This particular treatment, Enbrel, took well over 10 years to develop and bring to patients. Since its introduction, however, it has dramatically improved the lives of RA suffers. I have heard from many patients about how Enbrel has allowed them to remain productive and how it has dramatically reduced their daily pain and suffering. Since RA can and does lead to disability, preventing or delaying the disabled effects of this disease means huge economic savings for all of us. Medicare should not discriminate against this new, patient-friendly therapy simply because it is self-injected.  I urge my colleagues to carefully review this legislation and to talk to patients and health providers about how an outdated policy hinders access and discourages innovation and how the measure we are introducing today can give Medicare patients access to innovative drugs.                                 ______                                       By
