We submitted this resolution, S. Res. 211, on February 15.  Read Across America Day is an annual reading motivation and awareness program begun by the National Education Association, and supported by more than 40 national non-profit and association partners, including the American Library Association, American Association of School Librarians, Boys and Girls Clubs of America, Girl Scouts of the USA, International Reading Association, Learning First Alliance, the Library of Congress--Center for the Book National Institute for Literacy, National PTA, Reading Is Fundamental, and YMCA of the USA. The celebration includes activities in schools, libraries, and communities across the nation that bring reading excitement to children of all ages.  March 2nd is a fitting day for such a celebration of reading, since it is the birthday of Theodore Geisel, otherwise known as Dr. Seuss, the beloved children's author and illustrator. His books have inspired, and continue to inspire, generations of children to discover the joy of reading. Moreover, Dr. Seuss' inventive use of rhyme make his books an enormously effective tool for teaching basic reading skills to children.  According to the latest results of the National Assessment of Educational Progress (NAEP), from 1992 to 2000 the reading scores of fourth graders remained flat. What is most alarming is that the gap between the highest and lowest achieving students is widening--the average score for top students increased, while the average score for bottom students declined even more significantly.  These results indicate that our students need a great deal of help to learn to read and achieve. Addressing the reading deficiency of our Nation's students is essential, and clearly an area where Federal resources and support can bring about positive change.  This is why I was pleased to join Senator Collins in supporting the inclusion of the Reading First and Early Reading First programs in the No Child Left Behind Act signed into law earlier this year. These programs provide professional development for teachers to improve reading instruction and support reading initiatives for younger children. Coupled with resources for up-to-date and engaging school library books through the Improving Literacy Through School Libraries program, which I authored and offered with Senator Collins as an amendment to the No Child Left Behind Act, we are taking steps to boost children's reading skills and love for reading.  I urge my colleagues to join us in supporting this resolution in order to show our commitment to the importance of literacy and to celebrate the joy of reading.                          ____________________
