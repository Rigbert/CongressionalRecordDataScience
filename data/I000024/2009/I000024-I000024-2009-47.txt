President, back in August of 2008 there was a directive that we should try to privatize as many of the Army Corps as possible. All this does is say, before any more are privatized, the Army should have to certify that--two things--it would not increase the cost or negatively impact national security. It has been cleared on both sides. I urge its adoption.
