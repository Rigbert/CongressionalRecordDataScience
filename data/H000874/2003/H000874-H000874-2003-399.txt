 Mr. DeLAY. Mr. Speaker, I appreciate the gentleman yielding to me, and I also appreciate being found.  As the gentleman and Members know, a very important conference committee is meeting on the war supplemental. Very intensive discussions are going on. We anticipate, hopefully anticipate that the conference can be wrapped up later on this evening, but there is absolutely no way that we can assure the Members that we can vote on that bill today. We will have no more votes this afternoon, and anticipate coming back to consider the war supplemental tomorrow at noon.
