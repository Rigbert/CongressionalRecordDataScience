They would have sort of a single line to follow the bouncing ball. Most of the other Members here are not old enough to remember those cartoons. But in effect this bill has been like a bouncing ball going back and forth. The distinguished chairman can correct me if I am wrong, but I believe we had 193 items in disagreement in conference that lasted until after midnight. We resolved 192. Both bodies have voted on those. It is time now to realize that the last matter is at an impasse. Let us get the basic bill passed and sent on to the President for his signature and allow this part, at least, of our foreign policy to go forward.  So I support the distinguished chairman in this. I see the superchairman, the overall chairman, on the floor. So I yield the floor.
