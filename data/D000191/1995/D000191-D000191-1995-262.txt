Chairman, I am going by the four statutes referenced by the gentleman from Louisiana [Mr. Tauzin]. If it was one tree on the 1 acre, on the 100 acres, and I could not harvest that tree because of Federal restriction, if I lost, if by being required to have that tree stand, I would lose 10 percent or more of the value, I would be compensated for that one tree?                              {time}  1230
