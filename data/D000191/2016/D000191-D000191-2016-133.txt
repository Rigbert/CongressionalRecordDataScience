Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.  I would like to refer back to the chairman's trip down memory lane. If he recalls the circumstance, we had not yet seen the revised rule. The initial rule, many of us had objected to, and we hadn't seen the revised rule. The majority wanted to stop the revised rule, again, sticking us with the Bush-era guidance. I guess they are in love with the Bush-era guidance, which everybody from the Farm Bureau to Natural Resources Defense Council hates and says doesn't work. The gentleman from Louisiana just referenced that.  In the interim, we will be under these really contradictory and unworkable rules of the Bush era. Congress should act to update the Clean Water Act, and then we can have a vigorous debate over what areas we want to cover and what areas we don't want to cover and perhaps get a little more clarity.  Today we are here because they have promulgated a rule. It is substantially different from the draft rule, and they made clear that many of the things that were discussed in the interim--it is going to regulate my bird bath, my pond on my farm, the puddles on my farm, the ditches on my farm; it is going to preempt land use--all of those things are specifically addressed in the final rule, which we want to override, and they are exempt.                              {time}  1000  It does not change exemptions for agriculture. It doesn't regulate erosional features.  I am not going to read all the specific language, but it is all right here. The ditch issue in the urban area we heard about earlier is solved under this, but it is still a problem today under the Bush-era rule, which is still the law of the land because the new rule was stayed by the courts. And now we want to kill it.  So we don't want to fix the ditch issue, I guess, and live forever under the Bush-era rule. It doesn't regulate land use. If it did the things the people on the other side were saying, I think you would find 85, 90 percent of the Members of this House would be voting for this resolution of disapproval. The fact is it doesn't do those things and we have very specific references to demonstrate that.  And then, on this issue of the illegal actions, again, I was getting emails and phone calls from people saying, my bird bath; my pond; my puddles; my roadside ditches. The forest industry is saying our roadside ditches.  Well, those things are all exempt now. But these things were out there, and the EPA was trying to educate people and say: Here is what is in. Here is what is out. And they find the weeniest of little, stupid violations.  This isn't like lawbreaking. They used Thunderclap to actually tell people a few things about this rule. They forgot to put on a disclaimer. Oh, someone should go to jail for that. The right-wing nuts occupying the Malheur National Wildlife Refuge and Cliven Bundy violating Federal law, owing us a million dollars and not paying for grazing like other people, they shouldn't be prosecuted. In fact, the chairman referenced those nuts earlier.  I find it offensive and insulting to say that there is some sort of protest that relates to this discussion on the floor of the House by right-wing extremists who have taken over illegally and are destroying Federal property in my State.  And then, secondly, they had another violation beyond using Thunderclap. They had a link that went to someone else's site. And on that someone else's site, they were advocating for the rule. Wow. These are lawbreakers. These are the lawbreakers we want to go after.  This administration doesn't go after any lawbreakers, from Wall Street criminals under the collapse or these right-wing extremists in the West. I discussed that earlier in a 1-minute speech on the floor.  But the point here is that we have much better clarification now. The courts are going to rule whether this is adequate or inadequate, whether Congress needs to act further, whether the rule needs to be revised.  We should let that process go forward. That would give us some direction because we don't seem to be able to initiate on our own a reauthorization of the Clean Water Act and have a fair debate over what we want to cover and not cover. But the default action--repealing this rule, doing nothing--binds us to the Bush-era rule indefinitely.  Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.
