 President, today I am joined with my colleague, Senator Cantwell, to recognize the employees of Aerojet-General Corporation's Redmond, WA, research, development and production facility. Aerojet-Redmond has recently been selected by the United Space Alliance to receive the Space Flight Awareness Supplier Award for Aerojet's sustained superior performance as a key supplier on NASA's space shuttle program over the course of nearly 30 years. This most significant achievement will be commemorated with a presentation from United Space Alliance and celebration ceremony held at Aerojet's facility in Redmond, WA, on Thursday, July 8, 2010.  Aerojet is a world-recognized aerospace and defense leader principally serving the space and missile propulsion, defense and armaments markets. Aerojet Redmond propulsion has been on every NASA manned space flight mission and has enabled the United States to visit every planet in the solar system. The Space Flight Awareness Supplier Award is a very prestigious award bestowed upon United Space Alliance supplier companies--from among over 2,000 active suppliers located throughout the United States--that have performed extraordinary work that added to safety, mission success, schedule compliance, and enhanced flight capability. Aerojet's Redmond Operations will be only the 21st company to receive this highly selective award.  Aerojet-Redmond is the world leader in the in-space propulsion market and as such is the manufacturer of the 38 primary and 6 vernier reaction control thrusters used on every space shuttle mission. The shuttle's reaction control system is used to position the space shuttle during flight operations such as payload insertions and International Space Station docking.  On the occasion of this most significant milestone, Senator Cantwell andI are proud to join together and lend our voices to congratulate and honor the more than 425 Aerojet workers in Redmond, WA, on a job well-done. You have served our State and our Nation admirably for more than 40 years.                          ____________________
