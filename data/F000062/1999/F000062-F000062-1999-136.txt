 President, if this definition, the definitions we have been debating on what is medical necessity--if the Republican definitions were supported by medical organizations, I might think they are pretty good. But there is virtually no physician-oriented organization anywhere in the United States that I know of that supports this particular definition of medical necessity. Every single one of them supports the definition in the Daschle bill.  I think the Senator from Rhode Island and the Senator from North Carolina spoke eloquently as to why. Since the Senator from North Carolina remains on the floor, I would like to ask him this question. The Senator from Rhode Island read the definition from a particular insurer. Let me reread it:       [This company] will have the sole discretion to determine      whether care is medically necessary. The fact that care has      been recommended, provided, prescribed or approved by a      physician or other provider will not establish that the care      is medically necessary.  Then, in view of that, if you read on the top of page 180, in the bill, which sets out the guidelines for the standard of review for the independent reviewer, at the top of the page and the bottom of page 179:       The independent reviewer will take into consideration      appropriate and available information including any evidence-     based decisionmaking or clinical practice guidelines used by      the group health plan or insurance issuer.  How would an independent reviewer make a decision?
