 President, today Senator D'Amato, Senator Ford and I are introducing a bill to require health insurance plans to cover the length of hospital stay for any procedure or illness as determined by the attending physician, in consultation with the patient, to be medically appropriate.  This bill will return medical decision-making to medical professionals because it is time to stop insurance plans' interference into this important area of physician decision-making.  It is endorsed by the American Medical Association, the American College of Surgeons, the American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists, the American Academy of Neurology and the American Psychological Association. Only a physician, taking care of the patient who understands the patient's history, medical condition and needs, can make a decision on how much hospital care a person needs. Physicians are trained to evaluate all the unique needs and problems of each individual patient. Every patient is different and the course of illness has great variation.  Lengths of stay should not be determined by insurance company clerks, actuaries or non-medical personnel. It is the attending physician, not a physician or other representative of an insurance company, that should decide when to admit and discharge someone.  Professional physician organizations develop practice guidelines that guide them in determining medical necessity. These are intended as guidance and are medical judgments made by qualified medical people. Physicians know what medical necessity and generally accepted medical practice are.  We are introducing this bill because we have had a virtual parade of doctors come to us and in essence say, ``We are fed up. We spend too much of our time trying to justify our decisions on medical necessity to insurance companies. Insurance company rules have supplanted doctor decision making.''  Donna Damico, a nurse in a Maryland psychiatric unit of a hospital, told National Public Radio on October 1, 1997:       I spend my days watching the care on my unit be directed by      faceless people from insurance companies on the other end of      the phone. My hospital employs a full-time nurse whose entire      job is to talk to insurance reviewers. . . . The reviewer's      background can     range anywhere from high school graduate to nurse, social      worker or even actual physicians.  A number of examples have come to my attention:  In 1996, we addressed the problem of ``drive-through'' baby deliveries, insurance plans covering minimal hospital stays for newborns and their mothers because of examples like this: One California new mother was readmitted after a Caesarean section because of severe anemia from excessive blood loss. She didn't know how much blood loss was normal after a delivery. Two California women were readmitted after vaginal deliveries with endometritis, an infection of the uterus.  We've had examples of ``drive-through'' mastectomies, insurance plans shoving women out the door to deal on their own with drainage tubes, pain and disfigurement. S. 249, which I introduced with Senator D'Amato last year, addresses that abuse and we are trying to get it passed.  A California pediatrician told us of a child with very bad asthma. The insurance plan authorized 3 days in the hospital; the doctor wanted 4-5 days. He told us about a baby with infant botulism (poisoning), a baby with a toxin that had spread from the intestine to the nervous system so that the child could not breathe. The doctor thought a 10-14 day hospital stay was medically necessary for the baby; the insurance plan insisted on one week.  A California neurologist told us about a seven-year-old girl with an ear infection who went to the doctor feverish. When her illness developed into pneumonia, she was admitted to the hospital. After two days she was sent home, but she then returned to the hospital three times because her insurance plan only covered a certain number of days. The third time she returned she had meningitis which can be life threatening. The doctor said that if this girl had stayed in the hospital the first time for five to seven days, the antibiotics would have killed the infection and the meningitis would never have developed.  A 27-year-old man from central California had a heart transplant and was forced out of the hospital after 4 days because his HMO would not pay for more days. He died.  Nurses in St. Luke's Hospital, San Francisco, say that women are being sent home after only two nights after a hysterectomy and two nights for a Caesarean section delivery, both of which are major abdominal surgeries, even though physicians think the women are not ready to go home..  Just last week Lisa Breakey, a San Jose speech pathologist, came to my office and told us that she is providing home healthcare for stroke patients she used to see in the hospital. She sees patients in their homes who have G tubes in their stomachs for feeding and trach tubes in their throats for breathing. The trach tubes have an inflated balloon or cuff which a family members must deflate and inflate by using a needle. Family members are supposed to suction the patient's mouth and throat before they deflate the cuff. Families, she stressed, are providing intensive care, for which they are unprepared and untrained. Bedrooms have become hospital rooms.  Another California physician told us about a patient who needed total hip replacement because her hip had failed. The doctor believed a seven-day stay was warranted; the plan authorized five.  Rep. Greg Ganske, a physician serving in the House, told the story of a six-year-old child who nearly drowned. The child was put on a ventilator and it appeared that he would not live. The hospital got a call from the insurance company, asking if the doctor had considered sending the boy home because home ventilation is cheaper.  These cases can be summarized in the comments of a Chico, California, maternity ward nurse: ``People's treatment depends on the type of insurance they have rather than what's best for them.''  As these cases illustrate, premature discharges can increase readmissions and medical complications. During the ``drive-through delivery'' debate, we heard about babies who were jaundiced and dehydrated and had to come back to the hospital.  Similarly, as reported in American Medical News on March 23, 1998, according to Dr. David Phillips, ``a shift toward outpatient treatment actually has come at quite a high price . . . an increased loss of lives.'' This University of California study found that medication errors are 3 times higher among outpatients than inpatients; that medications side effects provides limited oversight by medical personnel and that the patient-physician relationships is compromised.  Ms. Damico said, ``Patients return to us in acute states because their insurance will no longer pay the same amount for their outpatient treatment . . . [They] deteriorate to the point of suicidal thoughts or attempts and need to return to the hospital.'' She cited the example of a suicidal woman whose plan denied a hospital admission requested by her physician. After the doctor told her of the denial, she took twenty 50-milligram tabs of Benadryl, was then admitted, and the plan then had to pay for hospital care, an ambulance and emergency room fees.  So not only do premature discharges compromise health, they ultimately cost the insurer more.  Physicians say they battle daily with insurance companies to give patients the hospital care they need and to justify their decisions on medical necessity.  An American Medical Association review of a managed care contract (Aetna US Healthcare) found that the contract gives ``the company the unilateral authority to change material terms of the contract and to make determinations of medical necessity . . . without regard to physician determinations or scientific or clinical protocols . . . .,'' according to the January 19, 1998 American Medical News.  A study by the American College of Surgeons found that guidelines published by Milliman and Robertson and used by many insurers represent a minimum length of stay, compared with surgeons' estimates.  A study by the American Academy of Neurology found that the Milliman and Robertson guidelines on length of stay are ``extraordinarily short in comparison to a large National Library of Medicine database . .. And that [the guidelines] do not relate to anything resembling the average hospital patient or attending physician . . . .'' The neurologists found that these guidelines were ``statistically developed,'' not scientifically sound or clinically relevant.  A study in the April 1997 Bulletin of the American College of Surgeons found that surgeons stated that the appropriate length of stay for an appendectomy is zero to five days, while insurance industry guidelines set a specific coverage limit of one day.  According to 134 interviews reported in the March 15, 1998 Washington Post, 7 in 10 physicians said, in dealing with managed care plans, they have exaggerated the severity of an patient's condition to ``prevent him or her from being sent home from a hospital prematurely.'' Dr. David Schriger, at UCLA Medical Center in Los Angeles, said that he routinely has patients, such as a frail, elderly woman with the flu, who is not in imminent danger, but could encounter serious problems if she is sent home during the night. He told the Post, ``At this point I have to figure out a way to put her in the hospital. . . And typically, I'll come up with a reason acceptable to the insurer,'' and orders a blood test and chest x-ray, to justify admission.  The Post article also cited Kaiser Permanente's Texas division which ``warned doctors in urgent care centers not to tell patients they required hospitalization, as one Kaiser administrator recalled. ``We basically said [to] the UCC doctors, `If you value your job, you won't say anything about hospitalization. All you'll say is, I think you need further evaluation . . . .'''  Ms. Damico, the psychiatric nurse interviewed on NPR said, ``Our utilization review nurse gives all of us, including the doctors, good advice on how to chart so that our patients' care will be covered . . . We all conspire quietly to make certain the charts look and sound bad enough.''  The American College of Surgeons wrote: ``We believe very strongly that any health care system or plan that removes the surgeon and the patient from the medical decision-making process only undermines the quality of that patient's care and his or her health and well being . . . . specific, single numbers [of days] cannot and should not be used to represent alength of stay for a given procedure.'' (April 24, 1997) ACS on March 5 wrote, ``We believe very strongly that any health care system or plan that removes the surgeon and the patient from the medical decision making process only undermines the quality of that patient's care and his or her health and well being.''  The American Medical Association wrote on May 20, 1998, ``We are gratified that this bill would promote the fundamental concept, which the AMA has always endorsed that medical decisions should be made by patients and their physicians, rather than by insurers or legislators . . . We appreciate your initiative and ongoing efforts to protect patients by ensuring that physicians may identify medically appropriate lengths of stay, unfettered by third party payers.''  The American Psychological Association, on March 4, 1998 wrote me, ``We are pleased to support this legislation, which will require all health plans to follow the best judgment of the patient and attending provider when determining length of stay for inpatient treatment.''  Americans' faith in their medical system has plummeted as almost daily we hear of more horror stories of care denied and HMO hassles. Arbitrary insurance company rules cannot address the subtleties of medical care. A March 1998 U.S. News and Kaiser Family Foundation survey found that three in four Americans are worried about their health care coverage and half say they are worried that doctors are basing treatment decisions strictly on what insurance plans will pay for.  The bill we introduce today begins to address some of these problems. I am also a cosponsor of the Patient Bills of Rights (S. 1890) and the Patient Access to Responsible Care Act (S. 644), bills proposing comprehensive reforms.  I hope these initiatives will send a strong message to the health insurance industry and return medical decision-making to those medical professionals trained to make those decisions.  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that a summary of the bill and letters in support be printed in the Record.  There being no objection, the items were ordered to be printed in the Record, as follows:           Summary of the Hospital Length of Stay Act of 1998       Requires plans to cover hospital lengths of stay for all      illnesses and conditions as determined by the physician, in      consultation with the patient, to be medically appropriate.       Prohibits plans from requiring providers (physicians) to      obtain a plan's prior authorization for a hospital length of      stay.       Prohibits plans from denying eligibility or renewal for the      purpose of avoiding these requirements.       Prohibits plans from penalizing or otherwise reducing or      limiting reimbursement of the attending physician because the      physician provided care in accordance with the requirements      of the bill.       Prohibits plans from providing monetary or other incentives      to induce a physician to provide care inconsistent with these      requirements.       Includes language clarifying that--nothing in the bill      requires individuals to stay in the hospital for a fixed      period of time for any procedure; plans may require      copayments but copayments for a hospital stay determined by      the physician cannot exceed copayments for any preceding      portion of the stay.       Does not pre-empt state laws that provide greater      protection.       Applies to private insurance plans, Medicare, Medicaid and      Medigap.                                  ____                                 American Medical Association,                                                     May 20, 1998.     Hon. Dianne Feinstein,     U.S. Senate, Washington, DC.       Dear Senator Feinstein: On behalf of the American Medical      Association (AMA), we would like to express our support for      your draft legislation the ``Hospital Length of Stay Act of      1998''. We hope you introduce this legislation that would      require coverage of an inpatient's hospital stay to the      extent determined medically appropriate by the attending      physician in consultation with the patient.       We are gratified that this bill would promote the      fundamental concept, which the AMA has always endorsed, that      medical decisions should be made by patients and their      physicians rather than by insurers or legislators. As you may      know, on several occasions the AMA has supported legislative      initiatives that would require coverage on a diagnosis by      diagnosis basis for medically appropriate minimum lengths of      stay. While those bills have moved us in the right direction,      this legislation would take us where we want to be.       We appreciate your initiative and ongoing efforts to      protect patients by ensuring that physicians may identify      medically appropriate lengths of stay, unfettered by third      party payors. We offer you our assistance in helping to enact      this legislation.           Sincerely,                                                   Lynn E. Jensen,     Interim Executive Vice President.                                  ____                                 American College of Surgeons,                                                    July 15, 1998.           Statement: Postoperative Lengths of Hospital Stay     Edward R. Laws, Jr., MD, FACS,     Member of the Board of Regents,     American College of Surgeons.       On behalf of the American College of Surgeons, I would like      to commend Senator Feinstein for her continuing concern for      high-quality patient care. In particular, I want to praise      her and her cosponsor, Senator D'Amato, for their most recent      effort to protect patients by introducing legislation to ban      the practice of imposing arbitrary coverage limits on      hospital length of stay--a practice that is currently being      used by some third-party payers.       The issue of ``drive-through'' maternity care, followed      more recently by the issue of outpatient mastectomy      operations, clearly illustrate the patient care problems that      are created when third-party payers set a specific number of      days as the appropriate length of stay for a given procedure.      For some maternity and breast cancer patients, the outpatient      setting may well be medically appropriate and personally      preferred, but for many others this certainly is not the      case. As many state and federal legislators have come to      realize, each of these patients has her own set of unique      medical problems and related issues, and it is inappropriate      to expect them to conform to cost containment goals that were      designed with the ``optimum'' patient in mind.       What few people seem to recognize, however, is that these      problems are not limited to new mothers and breast cancer      patients. Indeed, thousands of patients whose illnesses do      not occupy a high profile on the nation's health care agenda      face the same dilemma. A variety of factors--such coexisting      illnesses, the optimum treatment method selected,      complications arising during the operation, and differences      in response to the treatment--can vary significantly among      individual patients, making it impossible to accurately or      precisely predict the appropriate length of stay for a given      procedure. Such factors may also determine the appropriate      site for performing a particular operation or procedure.      Despite these important considerations, efforts to restrain      growth in spending for health care services, although a      legitimate concern, are coming into conflict with individual      patient needs.       We need to view the issue of length-of-stay coverage limits      from a broader perspective than we have in the past.      Congress, state legislatures, and the managed care industry      have acted on a procedure-specific basis in response to      concerns raised about coverage limits placed on maternity      care and mastectomy operations. But, it is time to take the      next step.       Senator Feinstein's legislation, the ``Hospital Length of      Stay Act'' would take this step by proposing to protect      medical decisionmaking on behalf of all patients. The      legislation specifies that decisions about the medical      appropriateness of a hospital length of stay should be      determined by the attending physician, in consultation with      the patient. Further, the legislation would prohibit health      plans from penalizing patients, physicians, or hospitals for      following through on these medical decisions.       The American College of Surgeons believes strongly that,      for all surgical patients, the responsibility for making the      decisions to operate, what type of operation the patient      should have, and how long the patient stays in the hospital      following the operation must rest with the surgeon and the      patient. The College has always encouraged its members to      keep their patients' length of stay as short as possible.      However, we do believe very strongly that any health care      system or plan that removes the surgeon and the patient from      the medical decision-making process only undermines the      quality of that patient's care and his or her health and      well-being.       Once again, we congratulate Senator Feinstein and Senator      D'Amato for their courageous efforts on behalf of quality      patient care. The College looks forward to working closely      with them and their colleagues in the House of      Representatives, including Congressman Tom Coburn and      Congresswoman Rosa DeLauro, to ensure swift passage of this      important legislation.       The American College of Surgeons is a scientific and      educational organization of surgeons that was founded in 1913      to raise the standards of surgical practice and to improve      the care of the surgical patient. The College is dedicated to      the ethical and competent practice of surgery. Its      achievements have significantly influenced the course of      scientific surgery in America, and have established it as an      important advocate for all surgical patients. The College has      more than 62,000 members and is the largest organization of      surgeons in the world.                                  ____                                   American College of Surgeons,                                                    March 5, 1998.     Hon. Dianne Feinstein,     U.S. Senate, Washington, DC.       Dear Senator Feinstein: On behalf of the 62,000 Fellows of      the American College of     Surgeons, I want to commend you for introducing the      ``Hospital Length of Stay Act of 1998.'' Your legislation      will contribute significantly to the effort to educate      Congress and the public about the practice of imposing      arbitrary coverage limits on hospital length of stay that do      not take into account an individual patient's unique health      care needs.       For all surgical patients, the responsibility for making      the decision to operate, the type of operation, and how long      the patient stays in the hospital following the operation      must rest with the surgeon and the patient. The College has      always encouraged its members to keep their patients' length      of stay as short as possible. However, we believe very      strongly that any health care system or plan that removes the      surgeon and the patient from the medical decisionmaking      process only undermines the quality of that patient's care      and his or health and well being.       Once again, we appreciate your continuing concern, and      congratulate you on introducing legislation that acknowledges      the importance of preserving the surgeon-patient relationship      and ensuring that they are able to exercise their      responsibility for making medical treatment decisions.           Sincerely,                                                    Paul A. Ebert,     Director.                                  ____                    American Academy of Neurology',                                                   April 22, 1998.     Hon. Dianne Feinstein,     Attn: Glenda Booth and Ann Garcia, Washington, DC.       Dear Senator Feinstein: The American Academy of Neurology,      an association of over 15,000 neurologists, has been in the      forefront of discussions and debate concerning the necessary      protections that should be afforded our patients in a health      care environment increasingly dominated by corporate and      managed care structures. We believe that it is imperative      that patients, who often feel powerless in today's health      care environment, be protected through the implementation of      basic health care standards including such protections as      appropriate health plan disclosure, adequate choice of plans      and providers, and appropriate grievance processes.       Your bill, the Hospital Length of Stay Act of 1998,      contains many of the elements that we deem important,      especially its fundamental premise to protect and preserve      the patient and provider relationship. Physicians need to be      allowed to exercise their decision-making without obstruction      when they consult with their patients concerning the      appropriate treatment or care for their health care      condition.       A survey by the National Coalition on Health Care found      that 80% of Americans believe that their quality of care is      often compromised to save money. Many Americans feel insecure      about their health care plan and question whether or not the      plan will take care of them when they really need it such as      when they become hospitalized. It is out of this demonstrated      national concern that the President of the United States as      well as several leading medical societies, such as the      Academy, are now calling on members of Congress to implement      national health care standards or more commonly known as      consumer ``bill of rights''.       The Academy applauds and endorses your bill as a bill of      rights component and we hope that this is one of many steps      that will be taken by you and your colleagues in helping us      to be able to confidently tell our patients that their health      care plan will take care of them when they are sick or are in      need of health care.       I have included a copy of the Academy's patient protection      statement that I hope you will review and consider as the      debate on this important issue continues throughout this      legislative session.           Sincerely,                                                 Steven P. Ringel,     President.                                  ____                           American Psychological Association,                                                    March 4, 1998.     Senator Dianne Feinstein,     Washington, DC.       Dear Senator Feinstein: On behalf of the American      Psychological Association, I am writing to thank you for your      sponsorship of the Hospital Length of Stay Act of 1998. We      are pleased to support this legislation, which will require      all health plans to follow the best judgment of the patient      and attending provider when determining length of stay for      inpatient treatment.       We appreciate your sensitivity to our concerns over the      reality that psychologists in many states are attending      providers under their state license and scope of practice.      Accordingly, your bill extends this quality of care      protection to the patients of psychologists as well as      ``physicians'', as did the Coburn-Strickland amendment to the      House Commerce Committee version of the Balanced Budget Act      last year.       There is obviously enormous public interest in having      Congress act this year to pass enforceable federal standards      of consumer protection in managed care. Our members are also      supportive of a bill that you have cosponsored, the Patient      Access to Responsible Care Act (S. 644), and we are very      appreciative of your visible involvement in this issue. The      Hospital Length to Stay Act addresses another important issue      that should be addressed in this debate and we commend you      for taking it on.           Sincerely,                                          Marilyn S. Richmond,                                  Assistant Executive Director for                                             Government Relations.                                 ______                                       By Mr. McConnell (for himself and Mr. DeWine):       S. 2316. A bill to require the Secretary of Energy to      submit to Congress a plan to ensure that all amounts accrued      on the books of the United States Enrichment Corporation for      the disposition of depleted uranium hexafluoride will be used      to treat and recycle depleted uranium hexafluoride; read the      first time.           united states enrichment corporation privatization  Mr. McCONNELL. Mr. President, I rise today to introduce a must-pass piece of legislation to ensure that the Department of Energy is not stuck with a massive unfunded mandate as a result of privatizing the United States Enrichment Corporation. I am pleased to be joined by Senator DeWine who is an original cosponsor of this legislation.  Last month, the administration, the Department of Energy, and the USEC Board came to a decision on how they intend to privatize the USEC. This deal, which was struck in secret, is a complicated and confusing matter that I am only just beginning to understand. The facts, I have discovered, are not welcome news to the communities of Paducah, Kentucky, and Portsmouth, Ohio, where the two USEC gaseous diffusion plants are located. These facilities employ approximately 4,000 people, making them the largest employers in those regions.  The most discouraging aspect of this privatization proposal is the impact this deal will have on jobs. The administration has tried to put a positive spin on things by claiming that only 600 jobs would be lost over the next 2 years. Unfortunately, this may be the tip of the iceberg, because after the first 2 years, the administration has made no guarantees on the number of jobs that might be lost. In fact, after reading the fine print of this agreement, union and community leaders feel that closure of one of the two plants is a very real possibility. This could result in the loss of nearly 2,000 jobs. Without some efforts to mitigate the job losses, these communities will be economically devastated.  The second item of concern is that the Department of Energy--and taxpayers--will be stuck with an unfunded environmental liability. As you may know, under the terms of the USEC Privatization Act of 1996, the responsibility for the treatment and disposal of the uranium waste will be transferred from USEC to the Department of Energy. To prepare for this reality, USEC has collected nearly $385 million from its customers for the specific purpose of cleaning up their environmental liability. Unfortunately, the administration's proposal only provides $50 million of that total to be used to address this problem, while the remaining $335 million is due to be deposited into the General Treasury.  Mr. President, there are two problems with this scenario. First, I fail to see the logic behind the decision to use only one-eighth of the money which has been collected for the purpose of addressing the nuclear waste at the USEC plants. Second, the administration's plan calls for the $50 million to be given to USEC, Inc.--the private corporation. Why should we, as legislators, allow the government to give a $50 million handout to a private corporation to clean up a Federal entity's mess when $385 million is already available for environmental clean up? What is worse, the administration's plan will add to the tens of thousands of canisters of depleted uranium hexafluoride already stored at the plants, further expanding the environmental problems of the plants and the cost to clean up this site for the Department of Energy.  Mr. President, I am not one to look a gift horse in the mouth, but this deal is not good for Kentucky and is an abrogation of the Federal Government's responsibility to clean up this nuclear mess. We need to ensure that the taxpayers and the workers at these facilities get a better deal than what is being offered. That is why I have introduced this legislation to ensure that all the funds raised and earmarked for the clean up of USEC's environmental legacy will remain available for that purpsoe--and that purpose only. This bill mandates that the administration hold these earmarked funds until the Secretary of Energy submits a plan andlegislation to implement and operate a facility to cleanup the nuclear waste at Paducah and Portsmouth. Once this plan is submitted, then the funding can flow to clean up this environmental nightmare.  This bill will ensure that taxpayers aren't stuck with an unfunded mandate and makes a commitment to the communities that this toxic hazard will be disposed of in a timely manner. Unlike the administration's plan to simply store additional uranium waste, my bill will create many more jobs to construct and operate this facility. The new facility will convert the depleted uranium from an unstable and toxic hexaflouride form to a stable and non-threatening oxide. During this process many useful commercial by-products can also be recovered and sold.  Mr. President, I have here a letter from the Governors of Kentucky, Ohio, and Tennessee urging Secretary Pena to take immediate steps to convert the toxic uranium hexafluoride into a more stable, non-threatening oxide form. The Governors urge the Secretary to seek the necessary funding to begin this process and they specifically identified the funding I have identified in my amendment. I ask unanimous consent that the letter signed by Governors Patton, Sunquist, and Voinovich be printed in the Record.  There being no objection, the letter was ordered to be printed in the Record, as follows:                                                   April 27, 1998.     Hon. Federico Pena,     Secretary, Department of Energy, Washington, DC.     Re ``Draft PEIS for Alternative Strategies for the Long-Term      Management and Use of Depleted Uranium Hexafluoride,'' DOE/     EIS-0269 dated December 1997.       Dear Secretary Pena: More than forty years ago the U.S.      Department of Energy began the uranium enhancement initiative      that created a common link between Ohio, Kentucky, and      Tennessee. This commonality includes the U.S. Department of      Energy's legacy of waste, a significant portion of which is      made up of depleted uranium hexafluoride. Today, our three      states are working together in order to recommend the      selection of an appropriate and lawful alternative for the      long-term management and use of depleted uranium      hexafluoride. We believe that such an alternative must      minimize impacts on human health and the environment, as well      as benefit the overall mission of our states and the U.S.      Department of Energy (``DOE'').       Ohio, Kentucky, and Tennessee have the following      significant concerns regarding the above-referenced document:       DOE should consider the immediate conversion of all      depleted uranium hexafluoride (DUF6) to the less hazardous      uranium oxide (U308) and provide above ground storage of the      U308. We do not believe that waiting for possible market      demands for the DUF6 is justification for delaying this      project. It is incumbent upon DOE to immediately begin      seeking funds from Congress for this conversion. We urge DOE      to complete conversion by the year 2018 or earlier and reduce      the mortgage of maintaining the cylinders.       A long-term strategy for DUF6 must include DOE's entire      cylinder inventory, including heel and small cylinders. The      10,000+ cylinders of DUF6 generated by the United States      Enrichment Corporation (USEC), which will revert to DOE      ownership upon privatization of USEC, must also be considered      in any plans.       An estimated $480 million has been accrued by USEC since      1993 in order to offset the cost of the future conversion of      DUF6 generated by USEC. DOE should work with Congress now to      ensure this fund is not diverted into the federal treasury      for an unrelated use. In addition, DOE might consider      partnering with the future owner of USEC in a long-term      strategy for managing and converting DUF6, in order to avoid      redundancy of efforts. Any partnering effort, however, must      not slow progress toward conversion.       Natural phenomena events or accidents may not have been      adequately considered in the PEIS. DOE must identify the      ``worse-case'' cylinder conditions and explicitly use this      information in the hazard modeling descriptions.       In order for states to effectively evaluate the potential      impact of the preferred alternative DOE must provide      information on the location of the sites where conversion      would occur and how wastes generated from this process will      be managed. In order to avoid the undue risk of transporting      deteriorating cylinders, we recommend that DOE evaluate the      feasibility of on-site conversion plants.       DOE must ensure that funding for safe storage and      maintenance of DUF6 cylinders and storage yards is at an      adequate level to protect human health and the environment.       The States welcome the opportunity to work closely with the      Department of Energy in addressing these complex issues and      moving rapidly toward an alternative that will well serve the      public and the environment. In addition we urge DOE to      carefully consider the more detailed comments being submitted      by each of our states environmental regulatory agencies.           Sincerely,     Governor Paul E. Patton,     Governor George V. Voinovich,     Governor Don Sundquis.  Mr. McCONNELL. Mr. President, I also have a letter from the Oil, Chemical and Atomic Workers Union, which represents 2,200 hourly workers at the Paducah and Portsmouth uranium enrichment facilities. They have also advocated for the use of those funds to begin the clean up of this toxic material. I ask unanimous consent that this letter also be printed in the record.  There being no objection, the letter was ordered to be printed in the Record, as follows:         Oil, Chemical and Atomic Workers International, Union,            AFL-CIO,                                                     Lakewood, CO,                                                    July 14, 1998.     Senator Mitch McConnell,     U.S. Senate,     Washington, DC.       Dear Senator McConnell: On June 29, 1998 the Administration      announced that it will soon privatize the United States      Enrichment Corporation (USEC), which operates the two uranium      enrichment plants owned by the Department of Energy in      Portsmouth, Ohio and Paducah, Kentucky. Coinciding with this      announcement, USEC declared that:       (1) ``to the extent commercially practicable'' it will      eliminate no more than 600 jobs during over the next two      years, consistent with an undisclosed USEC ``Strategic      Plan'', and       (2) it will transfer thousands of canisters of its depleted      uranium hexaflouride waste to the Department of Energy who      will inherit the disposition responsibility for wastes that      were created by USEC between July 1, 1993 and the date of      privatization. USEC has accrued approximately $400 million on      its balance sheet to cover the disposition costs of this      waste.       Approximately $1.2 billion is presently in a revolving fund      account in USEC's name at the Treasury Department--a fund      which was created pursuant to Section 1308 of the Energy      Policy Act of 1992. Of that amount, $400 million represents      the funds collected from utility customers for enrichment      services to cover the costs for disposition of these wastes.      The Administration has advised us that, absent legislation,      these funds will be swept out of this revolving fund      immediately after privatization.       To date, Treasury Department officials have been unwilling      to secure these funds for the purpose of which they were      reserved; to threat the massive quantities of waste left by      USEC for the government to clean up. If the funds accrued on      USEC's pre-privatization balance sheet were transferred into      a dedicated fund at the Department of Energy, these extremely      corrosive radioactive wastes would not sit untreated and      approximately 240 displaced workers could be re-employed      preforming waste treatment activity at Paducah and      Portsmouth.       We understand that you are planning legislation which will      secure the $400 million in USEC's account at Treasury for the      purpose for which it was reserved: to treat waste      generated by USEC. Your legislation will fence these funds      until the Administration submits a waste treatment plan to      Congress with its FY 2000 budget request. The plan will      include the construction of two treatment plants--one in      Ohio and one in Kentucky. This approach will reduce the      hazards associated with the transport of radioactive      wastes.       In April of this year the Governors from Kentucky, Ohio and      Tennessee wrote to Secretary of Energy Federico Pena      endorsing the concept of using the funds from USEC's balance      sheet for the treatment and disposition of the depleted      uranium hexaflouride tails.       The Oil, Chemical & Atomic Workers Union (OCAW), which      represents 2,200 hourly workers at the two gaseous diffusion      plants in Paducah and Portsmouth, applauds your efforts to      pass legislation which will fence these funds prior to the      privatization of USEC.       As you deliberate this legislation, we urge you to ensure      that the Department of Energy will require the cleanup      contractor(s) to provide a right of first refusal to      displaced workers from the gaseous diffusion plants, and to      require the contractor(s) to minimize the social and economic      impacts by bridging health and pension benefits. Such an      arrangement is consistent with the amendment you proposed to      offer as part of the FY 99 Energy and Water Development      Appropriations Act.       We look forward to working with you and other members to      ensure swift passage of this legislation in the House and      Senate prior to the privatization date.           Sincerely,                                                   Richard Miller,                                                   Policy Analyst.  Mr. McCONNELL. Mr. President, I have also cleared this bill with Chairman Murkowski of the Energy Committee and Senator Domenici, who is the chairman of the relevant subcommittee on the Appropriations Committee. Neither Senator has any objection to the immediate passage of thislegislation. Finally, I have cleared this proposal with the Congressional Budget Office and they have scored this bill as having zero budget impact.  Mr. President, we need to ensure that the people, economies and environment of Western Kentucky and Southeastern Ohio are not sacrificed to make a quick buck off the sale of the uranium enrichment facilities, especially when funding is available. I urge my colleagues to approve this legislation and protect taxpayers from paying an additional cost for clean up.  Mr. DeWINE. Mr. President, I rise in strong support of the legislation offered by our distinguished friend from Kentucky, Senator McConnell, to ensure that the Energy Department has the resources to address an important public health issue and is not saddled with a massive unfunded mandate in the wake of the privatization of the United States Enrichment Corporation (USEC).  This privatization will entail the purchase of nuclear material from the Russians--material which it is clearly in our national security interest to have removed from the international market. There is currently a fund within USEC which deals with the ``disposition of depleted uranium hexafluoride''--and this fund contains an estimated $400 million. If no changes are made, this money will go to the U.S. Treasury when the Initial Public Offering occurs, possibly as soon as next week.  This fund was created explicitly to handle the disposition of this kind of material. But if the law isn't changed, the Department of Energy (DOE) would have to find new funding sources in order to treat the material--and it may not be able to come up with the money.  This would be a vary undesirable result. The material under discussion is highly toxic--and disposing of it is and should remain an important national security priority. That $400 million is needed to stabilize this material, and to process it so that parts of it can be recycled and other parts can be safely secured.  This bill would provide that, ``the Secretary of Energy shall prepare, and the President shall include in the budget request for fiscal 2000, a plan and proposed legislation to ensure that all amounts accrued on the books of the United States Enrichment Corporation for the disposition of depleted uranium hexafluoride will be used to commence construction of, not later than January 31, 2004, and to operate, an onsite facility at each of the gaseous diffusion plants at Paducah, Kentucky, and Portsmouth, Ohio, to treat and recycle depleted uranium hexafluoride.''  The bill will address this key challenge. And it will also prevent a major economic dislocation in two communities--Portsmouth, OH (whose USEC plant has 2,400 employees) and Paducah, KY (whose USEC plant has 2,000 employees). This bill will support new decontamination and decommissioning jobs at these plants, which may experience limited job loss through the privatization.  It is an important investment in these two communities--and in a sensible toxic-materials disposal policy for America. I thank Senator McConnell for his leadership on this legislation, and I am proud to be an original cosponsor of this effort.                          ____________________
