Helms, Mr. Robb, and Mr. Abraham) submitted the following concurrent resolution; which was referred to the Committee on Foreign Relations:                            S. Con. Res. 110       Whereas the United States had never recognized the forcible      incorporation of the Baltic states of Estonia, Latvia, and      Lithuania into the former Soviet Union;       Whereas the declaration on May 4, 1990, of the      reestablishment of full sovereignty and independence of the      Republic of Latvia furthered the disintegration of the former      Soviet Union;       Whereas Latvia since then has successfully built democracy,      passed legislation on human and minority rights that conform      to European and international norms, ensured the rule of law,      developed a free market economy, and consistently pursued a      course of integration into the community of free and      democratic nations by seeking membership in the European      Union and the North Atlantic Treaty Organization; and       Whereas Latvia, as a result of the progress of its      political and economic reforms, has made, and continues to      make, a significant contribution toward the maintenance of      international peace and stability by, among other actions,      its participation in NATO-led peacekeeping operations in      Bosnia and Kosovo: Now, therefore, be it       Resolved by the Senate (the House of Representatives      concurring), That Congress hereby--       (1) congratulates Latvia on the occasion of the tenth      anniversary of the reestablishment of its independence and      the role it played in the disintegration of the former Soviet      Union; and       (2) commends Latvia for its success in implementing      political and economic reforms, which may further speed the      process of that country's integration into European and      Western institutions.
