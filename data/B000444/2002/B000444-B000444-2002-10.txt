 President, today I am introducing the ``Nuclear and Radiological Terrorism Threat Reduction Act of 2002.'' This is a bill to strengthen the efforts of the world community to gain control over the vast amounts of radioactive materials that, left uncontrolled, could cause economic disruption and sow terror in American cities.  In the Senate Foreign Relations Committee's hearing on March 6 of this year, experts testified that an amount of ground up radioactive cobalt-60 the size of the ball in your ball point pen could contaminate an area of Manhattan greater than the footprint of the World Trade Center. The damage and risk would be so great that buildings in the affected area might have to be abandoned, destroyed, and trucked away as radioactive waste.  We learned that if a terrorist dispersed a few hundred curies of radioactive material, the resulting public panic could make much of downtown Washington, DC uninhabitable without a difficult and expensive clean-up. Decontamination is a serious and poorly understood problem because many of the radioactive isotopes a terrorist might choose will bind chemically to construction materials such as marble and stone used in our most precious buildings.  One curie of radioactive cesium-137, strontium-90, cobalt-60 or iridium-192 poses a significant risk. But sources as strong as several hundred curies are used every day in world-wide commerce. They serve to estimate the oil in active oil wells, to provide a compact and convenient source of x-rays to check the quality of welds in the field, and to provide pencil beams of radiation to measure the amount of soda or beer in an aluminum can.  Hospitals, primarily in poorer countries, but also in the United States, use cesium-137 or cobalt-60 sources as strong as several thousand curies to provide radiation therapy in cancer treatment. Some of these sources are used in Southern California in mobile treatment centers mounted in trucks. These rolling radioactive sources move on the highways and through the streets of our country and perhaps of other countries, where they are vulnerable to accident or foul play.  Each year many radioactive sources, world wide, are abandoned or stolen and leak out of the existing control system. They become ``orphan'' sources, unwanted and with nobody to care for them or keep them out of trouble. Sometimes industrial sources are abandoned in place when their owners go out of business. They can then find their way into the scrap metal pool, and may arrive on the doorstep of a steel mill.  That happened shortly before our March 6 hearing. A 2-curie cesium-137 source turned up on the conveyor belt of the Nucor Steel Mill in Hertford, NC. Caught just before it would have gone into the furnace, it was identified, removed, and taken into safe custody by the North Carolina radiation protection authorities. Where did it come from? A bankrupt chemical company in the Baltimore area whose equipment was sold for scrap. But when the records were traced it was found that the company had bought not one, but four, such sources. Fortunately, two more were traced and recovered, but one of those ``gauge sources'' still is missing.  If the source found at Nucor had gone into the molten steel, the clean-up would have cost the company millions of dollars. If it had gotten into thehands of a terrorist who could disperse it with high explosives, it could have contaminated many square blocks of an American city and the recovery might have run into the billions.  Far more intense radioactive sources turn up in strange places from time to time.  In 1987, two junk collectors in Brazil broke open an abandoned gamma ray cancer treatment machine containing 1,400 curies of Cesium-137. Inside they found about 2/3 of an ounce of softly glowing powder. Several people were delighted at the idea of glowing in the dark and they rubbed the powder on their bodies. They contaminated not only themselves, but their homes and families. The toll: 5 people dead, 21 requiring intensive care, 49 requiring some hospitalization, 249 contaminated, and 111,800 people tested in improvised medical facilities at a local soccer stadium.  And that was an accident. A deliberate attack using the same 20 grams of material could have had far greater consequences, as our witnesses told the Committee.  ``Dirty bombs'' do not even need to explode. Murders have been committed by the simple act of inserting a small radioactive source in the victim's desk chair and simply waiting until radiation sickness and death followed. If a terrorist is willing to die, he could merely fling finely powdered material from the window of a tall building and allow the wind to spread his poison.  Finally, I worry that other terrorist groups, not just Al Qaeda, could make a radiological dispersion device. Radioactive material is out there for the taking, especially in the former Soviet Union.  In January of this year, three hunters gathering firewood in a forest in the former Soviet republic of Georgia found two abandoned cans of strontium-90, each containing 40,000 curies of material. Because the heat from these sources melted the snow for yards around, the hunters were delighted to find free warmth for their tent. They picked up and carried off the sources in their backpacks. All three woodsmen were critically injured, but since they did not break open the two cans, environmental contamination was limited.  A team from the government of Georgia, assisted by the International Atomic Energy Agency, recovered the sources, but several more are apparently missing and unaccounted for. The nuclear industry of the former Soviet Union made hundreds of similar devices.  In fact, 40,000 curies of strontium-90 represents a small source by Soviet standards. A string of 131 arctic sites in Russia is powered by radioisotope thermal generators--portable power plants that draw energy from the heat liberated by the decay of radioactive nuclei. Each site uses a 300,000-curie source. That raises the maximum damage that a terrorist dirty bomb could do by a factor of ten beyond anything the Committee heard at our March hearing.  There once were 136 sites in this chain, but the Norwegian government replaced five with solar-powered installations. The remaining 131 should be replaced as soon as possible so as to remove a potential source of truly destructive dirty bombs.  We must, and we can, raise significant and sensible barriers to protect against terrorists who would use the power of the atom to do us harm. To that end, Senators Lugar, Domenici, Clinton, Gregg and Schumer join me today in introducing the ``Nuclear and Radiological Terrorism Threat Reduction Act of 2002.''  The bill's principal cosponsors, Senators Lugar and Domenici, have been among the Senate's long-time leaders in the causes of non-proliferation, threat reduction and counter-terrorism, and I welcome their support. Senator Gregg's position on the Appropriations Committee has sensitized him to the need to protect our embassies. And both of the Senators from New York, Mr. Schumer and Mrs. Clinton, attended the Foreign Relations Committee's classified session where we learned some of the specifics regarding the threat of nuclear and radiological terrorism.  Our bill takes the initiative in several significant areas:  One, it creates a new program to establish a network of five regional shelters around the globe to provide secure, temporary storage of unwanted, unused, obsolete and orphaned radioactive sources. The bill authorizes $5 million to get started in Fiscal Year 2003, and up to $20 million a year for construction and operation of the facilities in the future. We envision accomplishing our goals through bilateral negotiations with the host nations or, when advantageous to the United States, through special contributions to the International Atomic Energy Agency, the IAEA. Regional storage facilities can remove some of the most dangerous material from circulation.  Two, to round up the sources to be stored in the regional facilities, we propose an accelerated program--in cooperation with the IAEA--to discover, inventory, and recover unwanted radioactive material from around the world. This would be similar to the Department of Energy's Off-site Source Recovery Program, but aimed at material outside our borders. This bill will make a modest start by authorizing $5 million a year in special voluntary contributions to the IAEA.  Three, recognizing the threat posed by the very intense radioactive sources packaged by the former Soviet Union to provide electric power to very remote locations, such as lighthouses, weather stations, communications nets, and other measuring equipment, the bill authorizes funding to replace that equipment with non-nuclear technologies. We believe that $10 million a year over the next three years should not merely make a dent in this problem; it should largely solve it.  Four, other bills this year have provided funding to train American first responders to handle a radiological emergency. The bill we introduce today authorizes $5 million a year for the next three years to train responders abroad. This is a matter of self-protection for the United States: we have diplomatic missions at risk around the world, and we will be funding the construction and operation of temporary storage sites for radioactive material. Should accidents or incidents occur, we would like to be able to rely upon competent responses by our host countries.  Five, this bill requires the Secretary of State to conduct a global assessment of the radiological threat to U.S. missions overseas and to provide the results to the appropriate committees of the Congress in an unclassified form, but with a classified annex giving details if he deems necessary. We hope the Secretary will take into account the locations of the interim storage facilities and also the results of this threat assessment in choosing where first to provide the overseas first responder training authorized by this bill.  Six, the Customs Service is charged with preventing illicit shipments of radioactive material and fissile material from reaching our shores. Inspection of today's large cargo containers for fissile material, in particular, is a technologically challenging task, one performed most safely and easily before the containers are loaded aboard ship. Customs has agreements to permit U.S. inspectors to do their jobs in ports of embarkation. In order to assist the Service, the Nuclear and Radiological Threat Prevention Act establishes a special representative with the rank of ambassador within the State Department for negotiation of international agreements that ensure inspection of cargoes of nuclear material at ports of embarkation. This special representative will work in close cooperation with the Customs Service to make certain that the agreements meet the Service's needs.  Seven, we could diminish the threat of Dirty bombs by reducing use of radioactive material where other technologies could be substituted. This bill mandates a study by the National Academy of Sciences to tell us how and where safe sources of radiation can replace dangerous ones. Some substitutions are well known: for many applications, X-ray machines powered by the electric grid are almost as convenient as the gamma ray ``cameras'' that use intense iridium-178 sources. Powered radiation sources can replace radioactive sources in some oil well logging work. Linear accelerators are replacing radioactive cobalt and cesium in cancer therapy. All of the substitute sources have one thing in common: a switch. When that switch is turned ``off,'' the radiation source is safe. There may be many more applicationsin which a switchable source can replace a radioactive one and be at least as economical, particularly when the risks of dirty bombs are accounted for properly.  Fissile material is the indispensable element of a true nuclear weapon. At our March 6, 2002, hearing experts from the Department of Energy weapons laboratories told the Committee that terrorists in possession of highly enriched uranium or plutonium could assemble a crude ``improvised nuclear device'' with a yield large enough to smash Washington from the White House to the Capitol. Such an improvised nuclear device would not require a Manhattan Project. In a study done in the 1970s, the Congressional Office of Technology Assessment wrote that a group of two or three technically competent individuals in possession of enriched uranium or weapons-grade plutonium could probably build a one-kiloton device in a few months.  For that reason, one provision of this bill deals specifically with developing the tools to guard against illicit traffic in highly enriched uranium and plutonium.  Last summer, a meeting in Washington to discuss ``nuclear science and Homeland Security'' was sponsored by the Department of Energy, the National Science Foundation, NSF, and other Federal science funding agencies. It brought together some of the best scientists in our universities and colleges, all of whom were willing to put aside their normal research to help strengthen our security at home. But few of those scientists can use the research money they already have for this work. Research support given for one purpose usually may not be channeled into other uses.  Therefore, this bill establishes a small program within the NSF to support researchers at colleges and universities who will work on the detection of fissile materials--the hardest and most critical task or on real-time identification of radioisotopes and decontamination of buildings after a dirty bomb goes off.  The Department of Energy has a special role to play in this program: we expect that Department and its national laboratories to work in cooperation with NSF to transition laboratory apparatus into field-ready operational hardware. This bill authorizes $10 million a year for research funded by the NSF and an additional $5 million a year for the Department of Energy to accomplish the transition.  The threat of radiological terrorism, and even of true nuclear terror attacks, is real. We know that most radiological attacks will kill few Americans, but there is little doubt they will lead to economic crimes of the greatest consequence. The radioactive source that killed only a few people in Brazil cost hundreds of millions of dollars to clean up. And nobody tried to cause that destruction.  We must do something to head off the nuclear and radiological terrorist threat where it will most likely first appear: in foreign countries.  The ``Nuclear and Radiological Terrorism Threat Reduction Act'' gives us a good start at doing just that.  I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be printed in the Record.  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the Record, as follows:                                S. 3121       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of      the United States of America in Congress assembled,     SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.       This Act may be cited as the ``Nuclear and Radiological      Terrorism Threat Reduction Act of 2002''.     SEC. 2. FINDINGS.       Congress makes the following findings:       (1) It is feasible for terrorists to obtain and to      disseminate radioactive material using a radiological      dispersion device (RDD), or by emplacing discrete radioactive      sources in major public places.       (2) It is not difficult for terrorists to improvise a      nuclear explosive device of significant yield once they have      acquired the fissile material, highly enriched uranium, or      plutonium, to fuel the weapon.       (3) An attack by terrorists using a radiological dispersion      device, lumped radioactive sources, an improvised nuclear      device (IND), or a stolen nuclear weapon is a plausible      event.       (4) Such an attack could cause catastrophic economic and      social damage and could kill large numbers of Americans.       (5) The first line of defense against both nuclear and      radiological terrorism is preventing the acquisition of      radioactive sources, special nuclear material, or nuclear      weapons by terrorists.
