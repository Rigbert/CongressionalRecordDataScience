 What is common to all the attacks is that they were undertaken by terrorists who coordinated with radical Islamic extremists, were inspired by them or by those who shared their views. The listed attacks should serve as a reminder that we must always be vigilant. We must never forget that radical Islamic extremists are waging war against us. We must always be prepared to fight this battle and to defend against their attacks.  I am grateful this Thanksgiving season for the people in this country who do the difficult work of protecting us from terrorists every day. We must continually strengthen our country's ability to win this war. We must ensure that our military and Special Forces have the ability to take the fight to the terrorists overseas, wherever they are lurking. We must ensure that our intelligence agencies have the tools needed to identify terrorists and their plots, while preserving the civil liberties that make our country very special. And we must ensure that law enforcement is able to use the lawful tools provided by Congress, consistent with our Constitution and approved by our courts, to help stop these terrorist attacks.
