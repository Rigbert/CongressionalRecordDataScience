Please let us see if it raises a blue slip issue, which we mentioned earlier, which is a procedural issue, which means if it has a revenue measure in it initiated in the Senate, it would be subject to a blockage or objection in the House, which we are trying to avoid.  This is a measure Senator Enzi worked on for 12 years. I have worked on it for several years. We would like to get this measure up for a vote and for approval in the House. If the Senator from Oklahoma is offering a measure that would not jeopardize that, I am at least going to entertain that idea, and I will talk to my staff about it.
