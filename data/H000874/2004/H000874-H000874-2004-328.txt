Leader, but I am not surprised that the chairman of the committee feels it would not be necessary to go to the committee to ask for approval to have something passed out of that committee. We Democrats particularly know that that is the case.  Mr. Leader, we have information that leads us to believe that on subsequent weeks we are going to be considering the child care tax credit, the 10 percent tax bracket and possibly AMT. Is that information accurate?  Mr. DeLAY. If the gentleman will yield further, as the gentleman knows, when we passed the Jobs and Economic Growth Tax Act last year, we accelerated several important provisions from the 2001 tax bill. Our goal was to allow more families and more businesses to keep more of their money, thereby encouraging private sector investment and consumer spending. These investments are driving, we feel, the economy forward. They are helping create more than half a million jobs in this year alone.  Over the next few weeks, I expect the House to continue those efforts by considering legislation, as the gentleman has outlined, that will ensure that families do not face a tax increase next year by extending marriage penalty relief, continuing the new low 10 percent bracket, extending the $1,000-per-child tax credit, and I believe the Committee on Ways and Means is considering an AMT reform. That will be done over the next several weeks.
