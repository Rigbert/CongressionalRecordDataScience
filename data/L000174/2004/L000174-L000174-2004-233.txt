President, I rise today to express my strong support for the amendment offered by Senator Feingold.  Senator Feingold's amendment, which I am proud to cosponsor, would allow the work of the Inspector General of the Coalition Provisional Authority, CPA-IG, to continue its work uninterrupted after the June 30 handover.  This is critical. Congress provided more than $18 billion to rebuild Iraq, roughly the same amount that we spend on the rest of the world combined. Congress jammed through the Iraq supplemental appropriations bill in an extremely short time, without a sufficient number of hearings, into a very chaotic environment without the usual financial controls.  Recognizing this reality, Congress created a strong, independent inspector general to help police these funds.  In the months that followed passage of the Iraq supplemental, we heard numerous reports of waste, fraud, and abuse. If anything, this should have sent a clear signal to the administration and Congress that we need more--not less--oversight of these funds.  It defies logic then that the State Department is now proposing to weaken the one entity that Congress specifically tasked with keeping track of these tax dollars.  The State Department's plan could undermine the independence of this inspector general and disrupt this important work, reducing Congress's ability to account for these funds. It is unlocking the vault to those who want to cheat us.  The State Department also has told the Appropriations Committee that it will have to create 25 new positions to handle the work in Iraq.  Let me get this straight. We want to close down an IG that has about 60 people in place, which are actively conducting audits and rooting out waste, fraud, and abuse.  After the administration is finished closing down that office, they will turn around and hire 25 new people to do the same work--only through at a lower level office at the State Department.  Why on Earth would we want to do this? At a time when we are hearing weekly reports of abuse by Halliburton and others, why would we want to reinvent the wheel? Why would we downgrade the status of the CPA-IG and undermine its independence? It just does not make any sense.  This is why the amendment offered by the Senator from Wisconsin is so important.  This is why I support his amendment.  Last year Senator Feingold and I offered an amendment to the supplemental bill for Iraq and Afghanistan that established an inspector general for the Coalition Provisional Authority so that there would be one auditing body completely focused on ensuring taxpayer dollars are spent wisely and efficiently, and that this effort is free of waste, fraud, and abuse.  Today the CPA, as we all know, is phasing out, but the reconstruction effort has only just begun. According to the Congressional Research Service, as of May 18, only $4.2 billion of the $18.4 billion Congress appropriated for reconstruction in November had even been obligated. This amendment would ensure that the inspector general's office can continue its important work even after June 30 rather than being compelled to start wrapping up and shutting down while so much important work remains to be done.  It renames the Office of the CPA IG, changing it to Special Inspector General for Iraq Reconstruction. The amendment establishes that this inspector general shall continue operating until the lion's share of the money Congress has appropriated to date for the Iraq relief and reconstruction fund has been obligated.  American taxpayers have been asked to shoulder a tremendous burden when it comes to the reconstruction of Iraq. Over 20 billion taxpayer dollars have been appropriated for the Iraq relief and reconstruction fund. That is more than the entire fiscal year 2004 Foreign Operations annual appropriation. It is more than the entire fiscal year 2004 Foreign Operations annual appropriation. This is a tremendous sum to devote to one country.  We all agreed last year that it required an entity on the ground, exclusively focused on this effort, to ensureadequate funding and oversight. We agreed that we need a qualified, independent watchdog with all the powers and the authorities that accrue to inspectors general under the Inspector General Act of 1978. We agreed that business as usual whereby individual agency IG's attempt to oversee this mammoth effort in addition to everything else the agency does it simply not appropriate in this case.  There is nothing ordinary about the nature of the U.S. taxpayer investment in Iraq. Ordinary measures will not suffice.  This amendment modifies the legislation creating this IG to ensure that it does not disappear along with the CPA, but instead continues to operate until the amount of reconstruction spending in Iraq more closely resembles other large bilateral foreign assistance programs, which are overseen by existing agency inspectors general. Specifically, to phases out the special IG after 80 percent of the Iraq Relief and Reconstruction Fund appropriated to date is obligated. If that fund grows substantially in the next calendar, then Congress can consider the wisdom of adjusting this mandate accordingly.  Let there be no confusion, this inspector general is only tasked with overseeing how U.S. taxpayer dollars are spent. It does not have a mandate to oversee Iraqi resources. That is not what this is about. So there is nothing at all in continuing this operation that is inconsistent with the transfer of sovereignty on June 30.  Because the Department of Defense has responsibility for what is happening to some reconstruction dollars and the Department of State will have responsibility going forward, it makes good sense to have a focused IG on the ground who is able to see the entire picture at once--not being completely required to just focus on the State Department position or just focus on the Department of Defense portion. This amendment is in no way hostile to the reconstruction effort. This amendment is about trying to get it right.  Suggesting that a special inspector general's office continues to be in order in Iraq is hardly revolutionary. As I have mentioned, the reconstruction budget for Iraq is bigger than the entire fiscal year 2004 Foreign Operations Appropriations bill. Yet five different inspectors general--at USAID, at the State Department, at the Defense Department, at the Treasury, and at the Export-Import Bank--are charged with overseeing portions of that account. In fact, currently some 41 Federal establishments and designated Federal entities with annual budgets less than $21 billion have their own, independent, statutorily mandated inspector general, from the Railroad Retirement Board to the Smithsonian Institution. We ask for focused accountability when taxpayer dollars are a stake in these situations. We must demand the same in Iraq.  Obviously, when you are talking about $20 billion just for this Iraq situation, we have to do the same thing. We must demand the same in Iraq.  To date, the Inspector General for the Coalition Provisional Authority has made important progress, and has some 30 active investigations and 19 audits underway. A whistleblower hotline established by the inspector general has received hundreds of calls. This is clearly not the time to pull the plug on his important effort.  I urge my colleagues to support this amendment. This is the critical point: To oppose this amendment is to vote for less oversight of the reconstruction effort in Iraq than we have today. It is a step backward if we don't. We cannot abdicate our oversight responsibility. The stakes are far too high for that.                      Amendment No. 3400 Withdrawn
