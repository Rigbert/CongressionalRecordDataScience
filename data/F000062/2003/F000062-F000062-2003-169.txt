 It has been a great pleasure for me to work with him. I really appreciate it.  I have just been alerted that the Mayor is here. I understand the Mayor of the District of Columbia can come on the floor of the Senate. I believe very strongly, because mayors run their cities, they are responsible. Yet, in education, it is very often so frustrating because they do not have control. This is the Mayor who wants to leave a legacy of an improved education system for the District.  Those of us who read the Washington Post this morning, and the Mayor's comments addressed, I guess, to the editorial board of the Washington Post, understand the frustration. I have always been one who had a great appreciation for Dick Daley, of Chicago, who went to the State legislature and said: Give me control of appointment of the school board. And they did. He appointed some of his people to the school board and turned around the Chicago public schools. I think in a way that has set a real pattern for public education in America. I had the privilege of visiting those schools and spending a day in Chicago.  I ask consent that the Mayor be allowed to come on the floor of the Senate?
