 President, let me just quote from the letter. The Senators said in that letter:       We are concerned that the communique issued at the end of      the summit compromises prospects to advance negotiations with      the new, democratically elected government of Israel. We      believe that limiting or conditioning options for peace      discussions with the newly elected government of Israel      before its policies have been officially formulated damages      prospects for peace. Threats from countries of the Arab      League to ``reconsider steps taken in the context of the      peace process, in relation to Israel'' do little to enhance      successful negotiations. . .  The letter went on:.       We are especially troubled that a leader of your stature      created a forum, including Libya and Sudan, which question      Israel's right to exist.  Inviting Libya and Sudan to Cairo to condemn Israel is not the kind of initiative which serves peace or, for that matter, should be rewarded with another $3 billion.  The July Cairo summit was followed in late September 1996 by an escalation in tension between Israelis and Palestinians over the so-called tunnel crisis. When violence erupted in the streets, President Clinton called upon Prime Minister Netanyahu, Chairman Arafat, King Hussein, and President Mubarak to come to Washington to negotiate a solution. Every leader came except Mubarak. Every leader had as much to gain and certainly a great deal to lose if the discussions failed. Every leader knew there were costs associated with a high-profile summit which might not relieve tensions.  Only President Mubarak decided it was not worth his time or effort to continue a crucial dialogue with the simple objective of salvaging the peace process. After refusing to participate in this summit, President Mubarak decided to convene another Arab round-table. In March of this year, he called together the Arab League in Cairo where the foreign ministers passed a resolution which is worth taking a look at. The text read:       The Council recommends as follows: (1) stopping all      normalization steps which have been taken with Israel in the      framework of the current peace process, and halting all      dealings with it, including closing offices and missions. .      .and (2) Suspending Arab participation in the multilateral      talks and continuing to maintain the primary Arab boycott and      reactivating it against Israel.  Mr. President, this is not a resolution of peace. We should see this just for what it was as described by the Arab League's Secretary General, ``binding'' and an open declaration of hostility.  This summit was followed by a crisis in negotiations over the redeployment of Israeli troops in Hebron. There is no question that the Egyptian leadership consistently and actively worked against a resolution of each contentious issue. From hot pursuit to the use of the Shuhada Road, the message from Cairo was provocative and counterproductive.  Finally, and of most alarm, is Egypt's relationship with Libya. I mentioned the invitation to the Cairo summit. That is just the tip of the iceberg. President Mubarak ended a recent visit to Tripoli announcing the goal of establishing $1 billion in annual trade and a free trade zone, a goal made all the more interesting when contrasted with the current level of $82 million in annual trade with Israel. $1 billion in trade with Libya, $82 million in trade with Israel.  Let us remember that Libya is the target of tough U.N. sanctions which imposed an air, arms, and diplomatic embargo in 1992 when Qadhafi failed to extradite two terrorists linked to the Pan Am bombing which killed 270 people. The sanctions were extended when Libya failed to cooperate in the investigation into the bombing of a French airliner which killed 171 passengers.  Sanctions against Libya are not the peculiar position of the United States; they are a matter of international consensus--international consensus--that is, with the exception of Egypt.  In May, President Mubarak denounced the embargo because, in his words, it has ``gone on for too long.'' He also challenged international charges that Libya has a chemical weapons capability. Not so, says Mubarak.  As recently as January, when I joined Senator Stevens and a number of other Members on a trip to the Middle East, we heard the Defense Minister describe Libya as a country undergoing economic reforms and political liberalization and a key security ally. This was the Egyptian Defense Minister discussing Libya.  This Egypt-Libya relationship is probably why families of Pan Am 103 victims have called my office to express their support for removing Egypt's $3 billion earmark.  Mr. President, I have chronicled the collapse of Egypt's role in the peace process not to incite but to invite change. We have had a successful partnership with Egypt which has certainly endured difficulties and setbacks, but they have been on the whole temporary and intermittent.  For 18 months we have seen a significant shift in the wrong direction in Egyptian policies. We have moved from a road of periodic bumps into a long, deep policy ditch, which we must find our way out of.  Eliminating the earmark was intended to send the signal that our support will not continue no matter what choices Egypt makes. We will not sustain an ally, and advocate of Libya. It makes no sense to offer assistance to opponents of the peace process.  I am convinced the message has been heard. Coincidental with the Senate action, we have seen senior Egyptian officials resume constructive and active efforts to advance the peace process. I am satisfied, as I am sure the Israeli leadership is, that Cairo has resumed the crucial role we know it has, and can play to stabilize the region and secure a durable peace.  Because I believe good faith is being restored, and the goals of the Camp David agreement are once again being served, I will be supporting an amendment, which in fact I have already offered, which will earmark the requested level of funds for Egypt.  But let me just repeat, Mr. President, our assistance to the countries abroad is not an entitlement. This is not something you get every year based upon having gotten it last year. American assistance is geared to behavior. It is my hope that the Egyptians are back on track and willing to resume being a constructive partner in the Middle East peace process. Clearly, Mr. President, that is the key to continued U.S. assistance to Egypt.                               Exhibit 1                                                  U.S. Senate,                                    Washington, DC, July 26, 1996.     His Excellency, Mohammad Hosni Mubarak,     President of the Arab Republic of Egypt.       Dear President Mubarak: We are writing to express our deep      dismay about the communique issued at the Cairo summit.       It had been our hope that heads of state and      representatives of Arab countries attending the June 21, 1996      Cairo summit would refrain from statements directed against      the new Israeli government that might create an atmosphere in      the region unfavorable to a continuation of the peace      process.       We are concerned that the communique issued at the end of      the summit compromises prospects to advance negotiations with      the new, democratically elected government of Israel. We      believe that limiting or conditioning options for peace      discussions with the newly elected government of Israel      before its policies have ever been officially formulated      damages the prospects for peace. Threats from countries of      the Arab League to ``reconsider steps taken in the context of      the peace process, in relation to Israel'' do little to      enhance successful negotiations, and instead may undermine      efforts to reach a comprehensive peace in the region.       We are especially troubled that a leader of your stature      created a forum for Arab League countries, including Libya      and the Sudan, which question Israel's right to exist. In      light of the past leadership role the Egyptian government has      played, we had hoped that Egypt would reach out to the new,      democratically elected government in a way that would advance      the peace process.       Peace in the Middle East Peace can only be expanded if the      Arab countries remain engaged with Israel in the pursuit. We      urge the government of Egypt and other members of the Arab      League to work toward that goal.           Sincerely,         Mitch McConnell, Barbara A. Mikulski, James Inhofe, Carol            Moseley-Braun, Frank R. Lautenberg, Alfonse M. D'Amato,            Daniel K. Inouye, Bob Smith, Don Nickles, Joseph I.

Hatch, Rod Grams,            Christopher S. Bond, Arlen Specter, Jon Kyl, Thad            Cochran, Olympia J. Snowe.                                                                    ____              Partial Text of Final Arab Summit Statement       Cairo, June 23.--Following is a partial text of the final      statement issued by the Arab summit which ended in Cairo on      Sunday.       In response to the kind invitation of his excellency      President Mohamed Hosni Mubarak, President of the Arab      Republic of Egypt, their majesties, excellencies, highnesses,      presidents and emirs of Arab states convened a summit      conference in Cairo in the period Safar 5 to 7, 1417, which      coincided with June 21 to 23, 1996.       With pan-Arab responsibility as their starting point, the      Arab leaders affirmed that achieving comprehensive and just      peace in the Middle East requires that Israel withdrew from      all occupied Palestinian land, including Arab Jerusalem, and      enable the Palestinian people to exercise their right to      self-determination and set up an independent Palestinian      state with Arab Jerusalem as its     capital, considering that the Palestinian question is the      essence of the Arab-Israeli conflict. The Arab leaders also      demanded complete Israeli withdrawal from the Syrian Golan to      the line of June 4, 1967, and complete and unconditional      Israeli withdrawal from south Lebanon and the western Bekaa      to the internationally recognized borders, in implementation      of Security Council resolutions 242, 338 and 425, and the      principle of land for peace. On this basis they call for the      resumption of negotiations on all the tracks.       ``The commitment of the Arab states to pursue the peace      process to achieve just and comprehensive peace is a goal and      strategic choice to the achieved under the umbrella of      international legitimacy and it requires a reciprocal      commitment, confirmed by Israel seriously and without      ambiguity, and action to complete the course of peace,      restoring rights and occupied land and guaranteeing balanced      and equal security for all the states in the region, in      accordance with the principles agreed at the Madrid      conference, especially the principle of land for peace and      the assurances submitted to the parties. The Arab leaders      assert that any violation on Israel's part of these      principles and the fundamentals on which the peace process      started, or backtracking on commitments, undertakings and      agreements which have been reached in the framework of this      process, or procrastination in implementing them would lead      to a setback in the peace process, with all the dangers and      repercussions that this implies, taking the region back to      the cycle of tension, which would force all the Arab states      to reconsider the steps that have been taken towards Israel      in the framework of the peace process, full responsibility      for which Israel alone would bear.                           *   *   *   *   *       In order to make the peace process succeed on the Syrian,      Lebanese and Palestinian tracks, the Arab leaders call on the      sponsors of the peace process, the European Union, Japan, the      non-aligned states, other interested states, the United      Nations and international organisations and institutions to      work to ensure that Israel does not violate the fundamentals      of the peace process, fulfills the undertakings to which it      has given a commitment, whether related to the agreements on      the transitional stage or to the final status negotiations *      * * and to continue to provide the necessary political and      economic support to the Palestinian people and their National      Authority. In this context the Arab leaders said the Israeli      blockade imposed on the Palestinian people must be ended.                           *   *   *   *   *       The Arab leaders affirm their support for Lebanon as it      faces constant Israeli attacks on its territory, peace and      sovereignty and asked the international community to ensure      an immediate and unconditional cessation of these attacks.                           *   *   *   *   *       The Arab leaders affirm that Israel must join the Nuclear      non-proliferation Treaty and submit all its nuclear      installations to the system of international inspection.                           *   *   *   *   *       The Arab leaders express their solidarity with the sisterly      state of Bahrain and their complete support for the measures      it has taken to strengthen security and stability. They      expressed their strong condemnation of interference in the      internal affairs of the state of Bahrain, affirmed that they      stand with it against any threatening attempts from any party      whatsoever and call on Iran to respect the sovereignty of      the state of Bahrain, in the framework of mutual respect      and good neighbourly relations, by preventing any acts of      sabotage which target the state of Bahrain, in the      interests of security and stability in the region.                           *   *   *   *   *       The Arab leaders expressed their hope that the traditional      Arab-Turkish relations and joint interests will continue, and      in this context they expressed their concern at the Turkish-     Israeli military agreement and call on Turkey to reconsider      this agreement to avoid anything that would affect the      security of Arab states.                           *   *   *   *   *       The Arab leaders reaffirm their commitment to the need to      preserve the unity of Iraq and their opposition to any      policies or measures which affect its territorial integrity      and threaten its borders and national unity. They demand that      the Iraqi government commit itself not to adopt any      aggressive policies designed to provoke its Arab neighbors      and to finish implementing all the relevant Security Council      resolutions * * *       All this is the right way to bring an end to the sanctions      imposed on Iraq and create the right atmosphere for it to      regain its role in the Arab regional system.                           *   *   *   *   *       The Arab leaders believe that the Arab League's proposal to      hold an impartial and just trial of the two (Lockberbie)      suspects by Scottish judges under Scottish law in The Hague,      with the necessary guarantees for them * * * represents an      appropriate practical solution leading to an end to the      crisis. They call on the three Western states to take a      positive attitude towards this proposal * * *                           *   *   *   *   *       At the same time as the Arab leaders condemn attempts to      pin the charge of terrorism on legitimate national      resistance, they condemn all forms of acts of terrorism,      sabotage and anarchy of which a number of states are victim.                           *   *   *   *   *       It was agreed that:       His Excellency President Mohamed Hosni Mubarak, President      of the Arab Republic of Egypt, as chairman of the present      summit, will carry out the necessary contacts and      consultations with the Arab leaders and the Secretary General      of the League of Arab States to follow up and agree on      holding the next summit.  Mr. McCONNELL. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that Senator Abraham be added as a cosponsor to the Egypt amendment which I was just discussing, which is No. 885.
