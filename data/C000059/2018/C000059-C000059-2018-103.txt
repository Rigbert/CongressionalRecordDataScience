Chairman, I thank the gentleman for yielding.  Mr. Chairman, I certainly support this amendment. Mr. Ruiz and I represent the same area. Volunteer firefighters are extremely important, especially in our rural areas, and this is something we all should support.  Mr. Chairman, I am happy to accept the amendment.
