Speaker, I thank the gentleman for his observation. I share his delight that the Senate is moving bills. I would observe that they appear to be moving them in a bipartisan fashion, which I think is positive for an outcome on the appropriations process.  In that vein, I know we are in conference on the MILCON and Legislative Branch minibus. Does the gentleman have any idea when that might conclude and we might be considering that conference?  I yield to my friend.  Mr. McCARTHY. Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentleman for yielding.  I do not know at this time. I know they are continuing to work. As soon as they get their work done, I will advise the Members. I will bring it to the floor then.                              {time}  1115
