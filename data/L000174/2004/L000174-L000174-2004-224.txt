President, I thank the distinguished Senator from Alaska and the distinguished Senator from Hawaii.  I am going to shortly speak for about 20 minutes on one of these nominees. First, if I might, I am going to ask that we go into a quorum call. It will be a matter of a minute or two. When we come out of the quorum call, I ask unanimous consent that I be recognized to speak regarding the nomination of Peter Hall.
