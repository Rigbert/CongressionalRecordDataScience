 President, I rise on behalf of myself and Senator Jeffords to acknowledge and celebrate World Population Awareness Week.  World population stands today at more than 5.9 billion and increases by more than 80 million per year, with virtually all of this growth in the least developed countries.  A total of 1.3 billion people--more than the combined population of Europe and North Africa--live in absolute poverty on the equivalent of one United States dollar or less a day; 1.5 billion people--nearly one-quarter of the world's population--lack an adequate supply of clean drinking water or sanitation; more than 840 million people--one-fifth of the entire population of the developing world--are hungry or malnourished.  Demographic studies and surveys indicate that in the developing world there are at least 120 million women who want more control over their fertility but lack access to family planning. This unmet need for family planning is projected to result in 1.2 billion unintended births.  The 1994 International Conference on Population and Development in Cairo determined that a combination of political commitment and appropriate programs designed to provide universal access to voluntary family planning information, education and services can ensure world population stabilization at 8 billion or less rather than 12 billion or more.  We are pleased to support the week of October 24-31, 1998 as World Population Awareness Week.                          ____________________
