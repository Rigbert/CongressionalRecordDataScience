 President, now on an entirely different matter, this will be a busy day for the Senate. Today, Senator Thune and our colleagues on the Commerce Committee will continue their hearings on rebuilding America's infrastructure.  Notably, five Cabinet Secretaries will testify: Secretaries of Labor, Commerce, Energy, Agriculture, and Transportation will all share the administration's ideas for cutting redtape, streamlining permitting, and aligning Federal resources with local needs.  I am grateful for the Trump administration's commitment to this issue, and I hope this week's hearings, along with the ongoing work of our colleagues on Environment and Public Works, Appropriations, and other committees, will keep building momentum.  Bipartisan results are achievable this year, starting with billions of added funding for infrastructure improvements in the budget agreement, and extending to the work of many committees in the months ahead.                          ____________________
