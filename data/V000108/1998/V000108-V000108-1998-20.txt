Speaker, I offer this question of privilege to bring attention to a catastrophic situation facing this Nation. The trade laws that the Congress has enacted over the last 60 years are designed to ensure that American workers are not hurt by unfair and illegal trade practices. Congressional intent, as represented by the Trade and Tariff Act of 1930, is being ignored at the present time.                              {time}  1250  The U.S. steel industry and its workers are suffering because the Asian and Russian financial crises have led those countries to dump their steel on our market. The U.S. has been reluctant to stop this illegal practice. Steel that was formerly produced for domestic consumption in Asia is now being shipped to the United States where it is sold at prices below the cost of production. Steel prices in the United States have fallen 20 percent in the last 3 months alone.  The European Union has protected itself and its steel industry against dumping by erecting temporary barriers to steel imports during the crisis. Their steel industry is weathering the storm. In America, the demand for domestic steel has decreased dramatically in mills in Alabama, West Virginia, Utah, Ohio, Iowa, Indiana, and workers have been laid off because of the decreased demand for American steel. American workers should not have to pay the price of the administration's refusal to enforce trade laws which the Congress has enacted and supports. This impinges on the integrity of this House.  American steel workers, the most efficient in the world, cannot continue to be besieged by foreign steel products while waiting indefinitely for trade cases to be settled. Damage to the American steel industry is extensive, severe and rapidly growing. We need to protect our American steel workers by stemming the tide of illegally dumped steel, and the administration's failure to act again directly impinges on the integrity of this House.
