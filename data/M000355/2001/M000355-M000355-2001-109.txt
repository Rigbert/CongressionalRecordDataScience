 President, last Thursday, Senator Lieberman and I introduced S. 865, the ``Small Business Liability Reform Act,'' which aims to restore common sense to the way our civil litigation system treats small businesses. In our legal system, small businesses, which form the backbone of America's economy, are often forced to defend themselves in court for actions that they did not commit and to pay damages to remedy harms they did not cause. These businesses also frequently find themselves faced with extraordinarily high punitive damages awards. These unfortunate realities threaten the very existence of many small businesses, and when American small businesses go under, our economy is harmed as new products are not developed, produced, or sold, and employers cannot retain employees or hire new ones.  Small businesses, those with 25 or fewer full-time employees, employ almost 60 percent of the American workforce. Because the majority of small business owners earn less than $50,000 a year, they often lack the resources to fight unfair lawsuits which could put them out of business. When faced with such a lawsuit, many of these entrepreneurs must either risk a lengthy battle in court, in which they may be subjected to large damage awards, or settle the dispute out of court for a significant amount even though they did not cause the harm in the first place. Either way, our current system jeopardizes the livelihood and futures of small business owners and their employees.  The Small Business Liability Reform Act remedies these ills with three common-sense solutions, all of which protect our nation's entrepreneurs from unfair lawsuits and excessive damage awards. First, it would award punitive damages against small business only upon clear and convincing evidence, rather than upon a simple preponderance of evidence, and would set reasonable limits, three times the total of all damages or $250,000, whichever is less, on the amount of punitive damages that can be awarded.  Second, our bill would restore basic fairness to the law by eliminating joint and several liability for small businesses for non-economic damages, such as pain and suffering, so a small defendant is not forced to pay for harm he did not cause. Under the current joint and several liability, small businesses, when found liable with other defendants, may be forced to pay a disproportionate amount of the damages if they are found to have ``deep pockets'' relative to the other responsible parties. For example, a small business who was found responsible for only 10 percent of the harm may have to pay half, two-thirds, or even all of the damages if his co-defendants cannot pay. Again, without altering a small business's joint and several liability for economic damages, such as medical expenses, the Small Business Liability Reform Act provides that small businesses are responsible for only the portion of the non-economics damages they caused. Thus, the bill partially relieves a situation where a small business is left holding the bag with respect to injuries it did not inflict.  Third and finally, our bill addresses some of the iniquities facing non-manufacturing product sellers. Currently, a person who had nothing to do with a defective and harmful product other than selling it can be sued along with the manufacturer. Under the reforms in the Small Business Liability Reform Act, a product seller can only be heldliable for harms caused by his own negligence, intentional wrongdoing, or breach of his own warranty.  This bill provides much needed protection and relief to both small business owners and consumers. By making our legal system reasonable and fair to small businesses, we will remove one of the greatest barriers to the market, the threat of crippling, excessive lawsuits, that prevent entrepreneurs from starting a small business. That means increased competition, better goods, and more jobs at a time when the health of America's economy and job market appear uncertain. And by injecting common sense into these laws, we will remove the excessive litigation costs that drive up the cost of goods and services for all Americans. The Small Business Liability Reform Act is a win for America's entrepreneurs, consumers, and workers, and it is my hope that the Senate will enact this bi-partisan bill. Finally, I would ask unanimous consent that letters in support of this bill from the National Federation of Independent Business and the Small Business Legal Reform Coalition be placed in the Record.                                                    Small Business                                       Legal Reform Coalition,                                                     May 10, 2001.     Hon. Mitch McConnell,     U.S. Senate,     Washington, DC.       Dear Senator McConnell: On behalf of the Small Business      Legal Reform Coalition, we are writing to applaud your      sponsorship of the Small Business Liability Reform Act of      2001 and express our strong support for its passage. We      commend you for your efforts to restore common sense to our      civil justice system--one that takes a particularly heavy      toll on the smallest of America's businesses.       The frequency and high cost of litigation is a matter of      growing concern to small businesses across the country.      Today's civil justice system presents a significant      disincentive to business start-ups and continued operations.      If sued, business owners know they have to choose between a      long and costly trial or an expensive settlement. Business      owners across the nation risk losing their livelihood, their      employees and their future every time they are confronted      with an unnecessary lawsuit.       This legislation would make two reforms that have topped      the small business community's agenda for years: cap punitive      damages and abolish joint liability for non-economic damages      for those with fewer than 25 employees. These reforms have      been among the recommendations of the White House Conference      on Small Business since the early 1980s--and the time has      come to protect the smallest of small businesses from      excessive damage awards and frivolous suits.       This bill would also hold non-manufacturing product sellers      liable in product liability cases when their own wrongful      conduct is responsible for the harm and thus reduce the      exposure of innocent product sellers, lessors and renters to      lawsuits when they are simply present in a product's chain of      distribution or solely due to product ownership. Should the      manufacturer be judgment-proof, the product seller would be      responsible for any damage award, ensuring that deserving      claimants recover fully for their injuries.       In the end, we believe that enactment of the Small Business      Liability Reform Act will inject more fairness into the legal      system and reduce unnecessary litigation and legal costs. We      also believe that it protects the rights of those with      legitimate claims. We thank you again for your support of      these common sense reforms and look forward to working with      you to ensure the success of this important legislation.
