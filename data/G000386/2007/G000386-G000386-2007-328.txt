 President, today I take a few minutes to honor a great man of faith. Pastor Rhio Cleigh dedicated the past 25 years to serving his community through the church. The last 15 of those years have been at my home church--Prairie Lakes Church in Cedar Falls, IA.  The work of a pastor is not always easy but, much like my work, it is very rewarding. As a minister in our church, Rhio was responsible for counseling individuals through difficult times, visiting the sick in the hospital, and ministering to the senior citizens of our congregation.  This Sunday our membership will honor Pastor Cleigh as he retires from the ministry. Rhio plans to spend his retirement enjoying time with his wife Patti, his 6 children, 10 grandchildren, and 1 great-grandchild. He also hopes to have a little more time for some of his hobbies--things like woodworking, camping, fishing, and gardening.  Barbara joins me in sincere appreciation to Rhio for his contributions to our church and community. Together we wish him a long and happy retirement.                          ____________________
