Chairman, I thank the gentleman for yielding me this time, and I think that perhaps I still look like a student because I need a haircut, thanks to the gentleman from Texas [Mr. Armey], with the schedule we have been on. We have not been able to see folks otherwise we would like to see.  Mr. Chairman, I do remember well when I was a student, and I remember well paying into this fund, and you know what, I did not like it, and I could not get my money back, and that is wrong. That is wrong to force us to contribute to an organization that we may not be willing to support.  As I understand it, this amendment provides a voluntary checkoff so that the student, he or she, can decide what they want and what they do not want. I think that is the fair way to go, and that is why I rise in support of this student-friendly amendment.
