President, I add my commendation to the leaders' commendation of COL Michael Barbero.  Colonel Barbero is an extraordinary soldier, a family man, someone who has dedicated his whole life to the service of this Nation in the uniform of the U.S. Army. He has done it with distinction. He has done it with fidelity to the basic ideals of this country. He has demonstrated not only great competence but extraordinary character in doing that.  Mike graduated from West Point in 1982. I was teaching his class. Fortunately for Mike, he avoided my class and therefore prospered as a soldier and as a scholar. He later himself went on to the Georgia Institute of Technology to receive a master's degree. He returned to West Point and taught as a professor in the Department of Systems Engineering.  His military career began as an armor officer. He qualified as a U.S. Army Ranger. He served in a succession of demanding responsibilities as an armor officer, a troop commander, a battalion staff officer, with serious contributions as an armor officer in the U.S. Army.  His career represents a continued commitment to excellence as a professional and someone who has maintained the highest standards of a military officer.  I first got to know Mike when he assisted me on several trips overseas. Not only was he extraordinarily competent and well organized, he was a decent, cheerful, innovative, and enthusiastic colleague on these trips. He made them all work.
