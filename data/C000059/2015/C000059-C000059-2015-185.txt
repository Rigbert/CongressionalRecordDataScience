Chairman, as the gentleman knows, I am a westerner. As was pointed out by Mr. Poe, a significant amount of the West is in BLM control. In dealing with the BLM over the years, they have a lot of land mass that they deal with, and they also work with the Native American tribes and others dealing with really a restricted number of law enforcement.  We have commented and criticized about how well they operate, but I would hope that we didn't have to do this because there is a considerable need for some law enforcement in those vast areas in which the Federal Government owns throughout the Western United States.
