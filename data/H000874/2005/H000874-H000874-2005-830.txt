Speaker, I would like to recognize the success of the first ever Recording Arts Day on Capitol Hill, which was held on September 7, 2005. This grassroots advocacy day for music was organized by The Recording Academy, in conjunction with the Recording Arts and Sciences Congressional Caucus, of which I am proud to co-Chair with Representative Mary Bono.  Recording Arts Day brought 20 music associations and more than 100 music professionals to the Hill to discuss a variety of issues with Members of Congress, including protecting intellectual property rights, bolstering music education and emphasizing the importance of music preservation. Musicians, songwriters, singers, producers and other key members of the music community shared their experiences and raised awareness of the important role that the recording arts play in our culture and economy.  Music is one of our country's greatest and largest exports, in addition to touching millions of lives around the world. Recording Arts Day seeks to ensure that the private and public sectors are working together on these causes in order to nurture future artists and support music.  Mr. Speaker, I would once again like to recognize Recording Arts Day and thank The Recording Academy, and its president Neil Portnow, for organizing this great event.                          ____________________[Extensions of Remarks][Page E2229]From the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]          IN RECOGNITION OF RECORDING ARTS DAY ON CAPITOL HILL                                 ______                                                           HON.
