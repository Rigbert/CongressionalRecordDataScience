It is an outrage, it is an outrage to this Congress and to the new leadership in this place that they would try to muscle the minds, not just of the people here, but also of the American people and not permit them to know what this is all about when they have to foot the bill.  It is absolutely outrageous. You have, to me, a special right to be a part of those hearings. I think you would make a positive contribution to putting Mexico on a sounding footing toward the future.  I personally do not believe this is the way to do it, because you cannot have free trade without free countries. I think Mexico needs a good dose of democracy as a basis for economic growth in the future. I know the time of our special order has expired, and we thank all of those who have been a part of this this evening, especially the gentleman from New York [Mr. LaFalce], the gentleman from Illinois [Mr. Lipinski], the gentleman from Vermont [Mr. Sanders], those who joined us to inform the American people.                          ____________________
