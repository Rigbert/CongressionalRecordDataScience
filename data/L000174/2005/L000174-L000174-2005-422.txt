President, I would be willing to yield back my time, if the others are, to accommodate the chairman of the subcommittee.  Mr. McCONNELL. Under the unanimous consent agreement, I believe we immediately move to debate on the Dorgan amendment as soon as time expires on the Coburn-Boxer amendment. Am I hearing that all of the remaining time might be yielded back?
