President, I am pleased that the Senate today is passing S. 2272, the Strengthening Abuse and Neglect Courts Act, SANCA. I strongly support this legislation, which will provide much needed dollars to the Nation's overburdened abuse and neglect courts. We added to their burdens in 1997, by passing the Adoption and Safe Families Act, ASFA, without providing adequate funding to assure effective implementation. Courts nationwide are struggling to meet the accelerated timelines and other requirements of that legislation, which was intended to expedite the process of securing safe, permanent, and loving homes for abused and neglected children.  SANCA will help ease the pressure, by making available to State and local courts some Federal funding to assure timely court hearings and reduce the case backlogs created by the ASFA. Both the Conference of Chief Justices and the Conference of State Court Administrators have adopted resolutions in support of SANCA. It is without doubt a good idea.  This legislation authorizes $10 million over five years to assist state and local courts to develop and implement automated case tracking systems for abuse and neglect proceeding. It authorizes another $10 million to reduce existing backlogs of abuse and neglect cases, plus $5 million to expand the Court-Appointed Special Advocate, CASA, program in underserved areas. That is a total of $25 million that would help address a very real problem that we in Congress helped to create.  In my own State of Vermont, the courts are committed to implementing the ASFA and reducing the amount of time spent by children in foster care settings. But they are having trouble meeting the Federal law's tight deadlines and procedural requirements.  My only concern with S. 2272 is the competitive grant method that it adopts for allocating grant money. By contrast, the model for S. 2272--the Court Improvement Project, or CIP--allocates money by formula. Congress created the CIP grant program in 1993, to assist State courts in improving their handling of child abuse and neglect cases. On an annual basis, each State is awarded $85,000, and the remainder of the funds are distributed by formula based on the proportionate population of children in the States. This has been a highly successful program. States have combined CIP funds with State and local dollars to make sweeping changes in the way they handle child abuse and neglect cases.  Under SANCA, State and local courts would compete against each other for a relatively small number of grants, and many will get no help at all, even if their needs are great. I understand that there is companion legislation, the ``Training and Knowledge Ensure Children a Risk-Free Environment, TAKE CARE, Act,'' S. 2271, which would authorize increased assistance for every State to help improve the quality and availability of training for judges, attorneys, and volunteers working in the Nation's abuse and neglect courts. That bill was referred to the Committee on Finance, which has yet to consider it. It is my hope that the Senate will take up and pass S. 2271 before the end of this legislative session.  Many other important bills remain pending before this body as we head into the final weeks of the 106th Congress. I want to highlight one bill, which I introduced with Senators DeWine and Robb this summer, and which the Judiciary Committee reported by unanimous consent last week. The Computer Crime Enforcement Act, S. 1314, would authorize a $25 million Department of Justice grant program to help states prevent and prosecute computer crime. Grants under our bipartisan bill may be used to provide education, training, and enforcement programs for local law enforcement officers and prosecutors in the rapidly growing field of computer criminal justice. Our legislation has been endorsed by the Information Technology Association of America and Fraternal Order of Police. I hope all Senators can join us in our bipartisan effort to provide our state and local partners in crime fighting with the resources they need in the battle against computer crime.  I commend Senator DeWine and Senator Rockefeller for their leadership on the SANCA legislation and urge its speedy passage into law.                           Amendment No. 4209
