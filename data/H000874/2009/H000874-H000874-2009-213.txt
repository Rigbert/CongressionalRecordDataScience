And very frankly, I think that process was not one which was optimal. I would prefer not to repeat that process. Obviously we were driven by the fact that we were at the end of the session. We wanted to complete the bill so that people would have an opportunity, as we moved forward, to have plenty of time to work on the health care bill, which we knew was coming. But I must say that about half of that manager's amendment was the so-called GREEN Act which had been introduced literally I think months before but certainly weeks before and was available for review.  But the gentleman has a good point. I want him to know that the Speaker and I both are committed to making sure that we have at least a couple of days--we think it will be more--but a minimum of 2 days, a full 2 days to review both the bill and any amendments that might be attached to a manager's amendment. Obviously that may not be the case. Other amendments might be offered on the floor.
