 President, today I rise to express concern about recent events in Ethiopia. On May 15, 2005, 90 percent of registered Ethiopian voters went to the polls in the country's third election under its current constitution. Unfortunately, this historic election was marred by a disputed outcome. Because of the controversy over the election, civil unrest ensued. In responding to protests by opposition parties, the Government of Ethiopia acted with excessive force, killing 36 protestors and arresting large numbers of demonstrators.  Final results of the May election were due to be completed by the National Electoral Board first by June 8, then by July 8, and are still ongoing. Interim certified results from the Electoral Board indicate that approximately 40 percent of the vote is either still under investigation or in need of review, with one region of the country still to cast its ballots.  Let me be crystal clear that the Government of Ethiopia must respect theneutrality of the Electoral Board and permit it to go about its work in a fair and impartial manner. I also call upon Kemal Bedri Kelo, chairman of the Electoral Board, to conduct the board's proceedings in a transparent, fair and evenhanded fashion in order to ensure that the board's ultimate decision is respected by all sides.  Ethiopia is an ally of the United States. But that friendship could be strained by failure of the Ethiopian Government to observe international norms in its elections, failure by the Government to abide by the rule of law or failure by opposition groups to avoid overheated rhetoric. As chairman of the State/Foreign Operations subcommittee, I will be keeping a close eye on events in Ethiopia as they continue to unfold.                          ____________________[Pages S8204-S8205]From the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov].
