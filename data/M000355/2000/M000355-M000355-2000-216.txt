 President, I rise today to congratulate students at Ohio County High School for their First Place finish in the Kentucky competition of the ``We the People . . . The Citizen and the Constitution'' program and for their advancement to the national competition.  I am proud to share with my colleagues that the class from Ohio County High School in Hartford, Kentucky will represent our State in the national competition of ``We the People . . . The Citizen and the Constitution'' program. These young scholars have worked diligently to reach the national finals and through their hands-on experience have gained knowledge and understanding of the fundamental principles and values of our constitutional democracy.  I wish to acknowledge each of the winning students: Amber Albin, Kyle Allen, Rebecca Ashby, Susanna Ashby, Jamie Barnard, Nicole Bellamy, Brian Canty, Susan Fields, Sam Ford, Amanda Gilstrap, Crystal Goff, Chris Hunt, Leslie Johnson, Andrea Leach, Jason Martin, Jason Mayes, Lacey Patterson, Sarah Phillips, Dexter Reneer, Ann Shrewsbury, Luke Sims, Keegan Smith, Erika Underwood, Tara Ward, Michelle Westerfield.  I also would like to recognize and thank their teacher, John Stofer, who taught these students and provided the leadership which brought them to the final competition of this year's program.  The ``We the People . . .'' program is designed to educate young people about the Constitution and the Bill of Rights. During the final competition, the students will be challenged in a three-day program modeled after Congressional hearings. The students will make oral presentations and testify as constitutional experts to a panel of adult judges, and then will be questioned and judged on their knowledge and grasp of the Constitution. As a strong advocate for the Constitutional rights of all Americans, I applaud the efforts of these young people to understand and apply Constitutional law to real-life situations.  My colleagues and I congratulate these Ohio County High School students in their Kentucky victory, and wish them all the best in their upcoming competition May 6-8, 2000, in Washington, D.C.                          ____________________
