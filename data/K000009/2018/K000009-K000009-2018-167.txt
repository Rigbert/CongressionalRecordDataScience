Speaker, I rise today to recognize the life of Tom Spiess, of Fayette, Ohio. Tom passed from this life on Friday, March 16, 2018 and today his family, friends and community gather to celebrate his homegoing.  Tom Spiess was an outstanding community leader. His life's work was as an art teacher at Gorham Fayette Schools, where he founded the art club and the golf team. After thirty years as teacher and mentor, Tom retired from teaching in 2000. He then began a new career in ``retirement'' as the Village of Fayette Administrator, a position he held for six years. A local history buff, Tom also found time to host Civil War reenactments in his backyard.  All the while, Tom was involved in many civic activities. He served on the Ohio Arts Council; was a founding member and executive director of the Fayette Community Fine Arts Council; was integrally involved in the acquisition and restoration of the Fayette Opera House; served as chairman of Fulton County United Way; was president of the Gorham Fayette Teachers Association; president of the Fulton County Improvement Corporation; and was a member of the Fayette Chamber of Commerce. A true servant leader, Tom was an elder and board president at his Disciples of Christ Church, where he also taught Sunday school. Turning his grief into community help, Tom founded the Jon P. Spiess Memorial Golf Tournament in memory of his son.  Tom was feted by his community as Fayette Citizen of the Year. He also received a Defiance College Alumni Achievement Award. These recognitions by his community were most deserved and well earned.  Born to George and Marjorie Spiess in Wauseon, Ohio, Tom was a graduate of Delta High School. He went on to earn his undergraduate degree from Defiance College and his Master's degree from Sienna Heights College. Tom and his wife Cherrie were married on December 28, 1968 and together raised four children. In addition to their son, Jon, their children include Matthew, Mark and Elizabeth.  We offer our sincere condolences to his wife and children, grandchildren, brother, in-laws and friends. May they find some small comfort in their memories of this remarkable man and the gift of his life. Surely he will be greeted as in Matthew 25:23 ``Well done, good and faithful servant.''  Tom's generous, life giving spirit embraced his family, his community, and our nation. He was always building others. He cherished learning as fundamental to liberty and devoted himself to building an educated, engaged citizenry. His creativity and genius will continue to flower in all his good works. Truly, he has endowed a legacy to his family, community and country.                          ____________________
