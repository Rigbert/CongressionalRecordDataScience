President, the administration's justification materials for the $20 billion in reconstruction funds for Iraq, which we received just last week, contains broad categories of projects with no supporting details about how the administration arrived at the expected costs of those projects.  For example, they want $400 million for two prisons, at a cost of $50,000 per bed. How is that possible? Are we going to ship the cement over there?
