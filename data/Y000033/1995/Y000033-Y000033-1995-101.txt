Mr. Chairman, I move to strike the last word.  Mr. Chairman, I support the gentleman's amendment to eliminate transferability of individual quota shares. While I do not like the ITQ's, I want everybody to understand, I have supported and continue to support the regional councils in their role as managers of our Nation's fishery resources.  In fact, the gentleman from California, I am going to tell him now, I had an amendment to his amendment, and I probably will not offer it, because my worthwhile staff reminded me I have always said not to interfere with the council's role in this. But this is a good amendment.  ITQ's have been very controversial both in practice and from a policy perspective. One aspect that has caused a great deal of concern is the recipients of ITQ shares receive a windfall by being the only users of a public resource.  I believe this amendment addresses the concern that fishermen are receiving windfall profits by selling their ITQ shares, while the general public receives nothing from the allocation of this public resource.  I have heard from many fishermen that ITQ's give a few individuals a local on a public resource. The gentlemen's amendment makes sure that those who receive shares must fish them or lose them. If the shares are not fished by the fisherman for 3 or more years, they would revert back to the Secretary, who would then reallocate the share through an auction or other comparable bidding process. This reallocation will allow those who did not get an adequate share, or those who have fished, but did not qualify for shares, to bid on shares.  This amendment eliminates the incentive to enact ITQ systems rather than other limited access options, because some fishermen believe they will reap a monetary windfall from the quota shares they receive.  I want to again stress one of the biggest problems is the possibility of the acquisition of shares by, may I say those that may not be totally 100 percent American, and in controlling what I fought to do with the gentleman from Massachusetts [Mr. Studds] in 1976, and that was to Americanize our fleet and to protect our stock and to have a sustained yield. What we find in many areas around the Nation is this is not occurring.  So this really is, with the original language in the bill, a further attempt to make sure that we are looking at the management concept of the fisheries and not just a monetary concept of the fisheries.                              {time}  1045  Now, I am all in favor of everybody making large profits. I am all in favor of everybody making a return on their investments. But, I am not in favor of a locked system. And the IDQ's do create a locked system.  Now, if I understood the gentleman correctly, we are only talking about prospective IDQ's, not those that have already been issued. Because one of the things that I have resented in this Congress is that sometimes we become retroactive in tax laws and other laws and people that try to follow the laws that Congress has passed find themselves caught in an untenable position.  Mr. Chairman, I do support the gentleman's amendment. I think it is a correct one to further make sure that we have the management tools that are necessary for the fisheries and they are not depleted to the point they were prior to 1976.  The CHAIRMAN pro tempore (Mr. Bunning). The question is on the amendment offered by the gentleman from California [Mr. Miller].  The amendment was agreed to.  The CHAIRMAN pro tempore. Are there further amendments?                     Amendment Offered by Mr. Farr
