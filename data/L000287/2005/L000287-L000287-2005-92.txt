Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentlewoman very much for the time.  I very much apologize being as late as I am. I meant to be here earlier, but I am glad I walked in as my colleague the gentleman from California (Mr. George Miller) was making his remarks, for the emotion that we could feel in his very presence and voice is a reflection of how all of us feel, and I join in this celebration of our friend Bob Matsui.  All of us who care about public affairs and the Congress absolutely know that fundamental to our success in solving people's problems involves our understanding of just how important people are to our entire process.  The gentleman from California (Mr. George Miller) and I got to know each other first in Sacramento, and at that very time, overlapping our service, our friend Bob Matsui was serving on the city council. I learned to get to know Bob in a different venue, however, for he and I were elected in 1978 and came here as freshman, not so long ago.  Bob Matsui, as you have heard from many a person, is a fabulous, fabulous reflection of the best of public affairs.  I would like my colleagues to know that while we all believe public policy is what we should really be about, looking for the solutions to problems that the people care about, looking for alternative avenues for making a difference, when it comes to it in the final analysis we are all in this together.                              {time}  2030  The American public has grown tired of that rhetoric that we hear all too often that reflects the fringe of our dialogue; and far from that fringe but rather right in the heart of the best of us was a personality we have been discussing today, Robert Matsui of Sacramento, of the Committee on Ways and Means, a wonderful, wonderful human being, who was willing to look you in the eye, tell you what he thought when he disagreed with you. All too often, and much more, he was putting his arm around you and telling you what you did well and what he thought of you on the positive side.  If we could take the extreme from our rhetoric and the dialogue around here and remember Bob Matsui suddenly because of that, this House, great as it is, would indeed be an even better place.  I am pleased to take just a moment to express to Doris, their family, all their friends in Sacramento, how much we will miss them and how much we pain for especially his personal family. Our own friends in Sacramento who remain have talked often about the greatness of this man. We only had a chance by getting to know that by having the privilege of serving with him here.  With that, let me bid Bob adieu and join with all of his dear friends here in expressing our love and prayers for not just his family, but the future, the future of those he served, and know that we will all miss his service.
