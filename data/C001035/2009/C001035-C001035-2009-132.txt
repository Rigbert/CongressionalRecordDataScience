President, I rise today to introduce two bills that will improve the lives of our Nation's fishermen who are struggling to make a living at sea.  The fishing industry in New England is an important part of our heritage. From our nation's earliest days, fishing has served as an economic driver that has allowed our nation to prosper. Maine's proud fishing heritage is woven deeply into the cultural fabric of our state. Sadly, the global economic downturn and heavy-handed federal regulations threaten the economic stability of this venerable industry. To attempt to assist our fishing families, I am pleased to be joined by my colleague from Massachusetts, Senator Kennedy, in introducing the Working Waterfront Preservation Act and the Commercial Fishermen Safety Act.  All along our Nation's coasts there are harbors that were once full of the hustle and bustle associated with the fishing industry. Unfortunately, there is an erosion of the vital infrastructure known as our working waterfronts that is so critical to our commercial fishing industries. I have drafted legislation that will help combat the loss of commercial access to our waterfronts and support the fishing industry's role in our maritime heritage.  When constituents first called asking me to help them in their efforts to stop the loss of their fishing businesses and the communities built around this industry, I learned that no Federal program exists that supports preserving or increasing waterfront access for the commercial fishing industry. This is especially disheartening because every week we are losing more of our working waterfronts in this country. Quite simply, once lost, these vital economic and community hubs of commercial fishing activity cannot be replaced.  That is why I am introducing the Working Waterfront Preservation Act. This legislation would create a program to support our Nation's commercial fisherman and the coastal communities that are at risk of losing their fishing businesses.  The need for such a program is demonstrated by the loss of commercial waterfront access occurring in Maine. Only 25 of Maine's 3,500 miles of coastline are devoted to commercial access. We are continually seeing portions of Maine's working waterfront being sold off to the highest bidder--with large vacation homes and condominiums rising in places that our fishing industry used to call home.  The reasons for the loss of Maine's working waterfront are complex. In some cases, burdensome fishing regulations have led to a decrease in landings, hindering the profitability of shore-side infrastructure, like the Portland Fish Exchange. In other cases, soaring land values and rising taxes have made the current use of commercial land unprofitable. Property is being sold and quickly converted into private spaces and second homes that are no longer the center of economic activity. With each conversion of commercial waterfront access to private development, a piece of Maine's proud maritime tradition is irretrievably lost.  Maine's lack of commercial waterfront prompted the formation of a ``Working Waterfront Coalition.'' This coalition was comprised of an impressive number of industry associations, nonprofit groups, and State agencies, who came together to preserve Maine's working waterfront.  I am pleased to note that the Working Waterfront Coalition was successful in contributing to the creation of two programs in Maine. The first is a tax incentive for property owners to keep their land in its current working waterfront state. The second is a pilot program for grant funding to secure and preserve working waterfront areas. Since 2006, the Working Waterfront Access Pilot Program has secured 11 properties totaling more than 25 acres ofland that supports more than 300 boats, 400 fishing industry jobs, and more than $26 million in income directly associated with our working waterfronts. The State of Maine has taken positive action to save its waterfronts and is a model for other States in the country facing this problem.  This work is not, however, finished. The loss of commercial waterfront access affects the fishing industry throughout all coastal states. And a modest Federal investment could do so much to save these areas. Preservation of the working waterfront is essential to protect a way of life that is unique to our coastal States and is vital to economic development along the coast. Fishermen are being pushed out of the waterfront as their profitability shrinks and land values soar. Our legislation targeting this exact problem, as no Federal program exists to assist States like Maine, Florida, Washington, and Louisiana.  The Working Waterfront Preservation Act would assist by providing Federal grant funding to municipal and State governments, non-profit organizations, and fishermen's cooperatives for the purchase of property or easements or for the maintenance of working waterfront facilities. The bill contains a $50 million authorization for grants that would require a 25 percent local match. Applications for grants would be considered by both the Department of Commerce and State fisheries agencies, which have the local expertise to understand the needs of each coastal State. Grant recipients would agree not to convert coastal properties to noncommercial uses, as a condition of receiving Federal assistance.  This legislation also includes a tax component. When properties or easements are purchased, sellers would only be taxed on half of the gain they receive from this sale. This is a vital aspect of my bill because it would diminish the pressure to quickly sell waterfront property that would then, most likely, be converted to noncommercial uses, and would increase the incentives for sellers to take part in this grant program. This is especially important given that the application process for Federal grants does not keep pace with the coastal real estate market.  This legislation is crucial for our Nation's commercial fisheries, which are coming under increasing pressures from many fronts. This new grant program would preserve important commercial infrastructure and promote economic development along our coast.  Second, I am introducing the Commercial Fishermen Safety Act of 2009, a bill to help fishermen purchase the life-saving safety equipment they need to survive when disaster strikes.  Every day, members of our fishing communities struggle to cope with the pressures of running a small business, complying with burdensome regulations, and maintaining their vessels and equipment. These challenges have been made worse by the growing economic crisis, which only adds to the dangers associated with fishing.  Year-in and year-out, commercial fishing ranks among the nation's most dangerous occupations. Fatality rate data compiled by the Census of Fatal Occupational Injuries program for 2007 has, once again, listed fishing as having the highest fatality rate among selected occupations. While I am encouraged that 2007 saw a drop in the number of occupational-related fatalities in the fishing industry, we must be doing more to save lives at sea.  The New England fishing community is no stranger to tragedy. Just this year, the Patriot, a 54-foot fishing boat out of Gloucester, MA, sunk off the coast of Massachusetts without warning. The ship's captain Matteo Russo and crew member John Orlando, who were lost in the incident, were unable to send a mayday call in the early morning of January 3, 2009. The unexplained circumstance of their deaths offers little solace to the families and communities that loved them. What is clear is that preventing further loss of life requires that we do all we can to promote safety at sea.  Coast Guard regulations require all fishing vessels to carry safety equipment. The requirements vary depending on factors such as the size of the vessel, the temperature of the water, and the distance the vessel travels from shore to fish. Required equipment can include a liferaft that automatically inflates and floats free, should the vessel sink. Other life-saving equipment includes: personal flotation devices or immersion suits which help protect fishermen from exposure and increase buoyancy; EPIRBs, which relay a downed vessel's position to Coast Guard Search and Rescue Personnel; visual distress signals; and fire extinguishers.  When an emergency arises, safety equipment is priceless. At all other times, the cost of purchasing or maintaining this equipment must compete with other expenses such as loan payments, fuel, wages, maintenance, and insurance.  The Commercial Fishermen Safety Act of 2007 provides a tax credit equal to 75 percent of the amount paid by fishermen to purchase or maintain required safety equipment. The tax credit is capped at $1500. Items such as EPIRBs and immersion suits cost hundreds of dollars, while liferafts can reach into the thousands. The tax credit will make life-saving equipment more affordable for more fishermen, who currently face limited options under the federal tax code.  We have seen far too many tragedies in this occupation. Please, let us support fishermen who are trying to prepare in case disaster strikes. Safety equipment saves lives. By providing a tax credit for the purchase of safety equipment, Congress can help ensure that fishermen have a better chance of returning home each and every time they head out to sea.                                 ______                                       By
