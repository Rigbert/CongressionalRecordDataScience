Mr. Speaker, I rise to introduce a resolution that expresses deep concern about ongoing violations of human rights in Kazakhstan. President Nursultan Nazarbaev, the authoritarian leader of this energy-rich country, has been flagrantly flouting his OSCE commitments on democratization, human rights, and the rule of law, and thumbing his nose at Washington as well.  In the 106th Congress, there was a near unanimous vote in the House for a resolution I introduced voicing dismay about general trends in Central Asia. We sent a strong signal to leaders and opposition groups alike in the region about where we stand.  Since then, the overall situation has not gotten better--throughout the region, super presidents continue to dominate their political systems. But their drive to monopolize wealth and power while most people languish in poverty is finally producing a backlash. Today in Central Asia, things are stirring for the first time in a decade.  Even in quasi-Stalinist Turkmenistan, an opposition movement-in-exile led by former high ranking government officials has emerged which openly proclaims its intention of getting rid of dictator Saparmurat Niyazov. In Kyrgyzstan, disturbances in March, when police killed six protesters calling for the release of a jailed parliamentarian, were followed by larger demonstrations that forced President Akaev in May to dismiss his government. The iron-fisted Islam Karimov of Uzbekistan, under considerable pressure from Washington, has made some limited concessions to domestic and international public opinion, sentencing policemen to prison terms for torturing detainees and formally lifting censorship.  In Kazakhstan, however, President Nursultan Nazarbaev has reacted differently to domestic pressure and to Washington's calls for reforms to keep repression from breeding terrorism. Since last fall, Nazarbaev has cracked down hard, when his position became a little shakier. First we saw squabbles within the ruling--or should I say, ``royal''?--family burst out into the open when Nazarbaev demoted his powerful son-in-law. Then a new opposition movement emerged, headed by former officials who called for urgent reforms. Two of the leaders of that movement are now in prison. Subsequently, Kazakhstan's prime minister had to acknowledge the existence of $1 billion stashed in a Swiss bank account under Nazarbaev's name. Some of the few opposition legislators allowed into parliament have demanded more information about the money and about any other possible hoards in foreign banks.  This would be a scandal in any country. But with a consistency worthy of a nobler goal, Nazarbaev's regime has for years stifled the opposition and independent media. And as detailed in a recent Washington Post story, which I ask to be inserted for the Record, Kazakh authorities have recently intensified their assault on those few remaining outlets, employing methods that can only be described as grotesque and revolting. In one case, the editor of an opposition newspaper found a decapitated dog hanging outside her office. Attached to a screwdriver stuck into its body was a message that read ``there won't be a next time.'' On May 23, the State Department issued a statement expressing ``deep concern'' that these assaults ``suggest an effort to intimidate political opposition leaders in Kazakhstan and the independent media and raise serious questions about the safety of the independent media in Kazakhstan.'' That statement did not have the desired effect--last week, someone left a human skull on a staircase in the building where the editorial office of another newspaper is located.  Mr. Speaker, after September 11, the U.S. Government moved to consolidate relationships with Central Asian states, seeking cooperation in the battle with terrorism. But Washington also made plain that we expected to see some reform in these entrenched dictatorships, or we would all have to deal with consequences in the future. Nursultan Nazarbaev has ignored this call. Increasingly nervous about revelations of high-level corruption, he is obviously determined to do anything necessary to remain in power and to squelch efforts to inform Kazakhstan's public of his misdeeds. But even worse, he seems convinced that he can continue with impunity as his goons brutally threaten and assault the brave men and women who risk being journalists in a country so hostile to free speech.  Mr. Speaker, against this backdrop, I am introducing this resolution, which expresses concern about these trends, calls on Kazakhstan's leadership to observe its OSCE commitments and urges the U.S. Government to press Kazakhstan more seriously. I hope my colleagues will support this resolution and I look forward to their response.         [Washington Post Foreign Service, Mon., June 10, 2002]                      New Repression in Kazakhstan       Journalists Targeted After President Implicated in Scandal                            (By Peter Baker)       Almaty, Kazakhstan.--The message could not have been      clearer even without the note. In the courtyard of Irina      Petrushova's opposition newspaper office, a decapitated dog      was hung by its paws, a green-handled screwdriver plunged      into its torso with a computer-printed warning attached to      it.       ``There won't be a next time.''       The dog's missing head was left along with a similar note      at Petrushova's house. Three nights later, someone threw      three molotov cocktails into her office and burned it to the      ground.       The political climate in this oil-rich former Soviet      republic has taken a decidedly ominous turn in recent weeks,      ever since the revelation that the country's president,      Nursultan Nazarbayev, secretly stashed $1 billion of state      money in a Swiss bank account 6 years ago. As the scandal      blossomed, opposition leaders were suddenly arrested,      newspapers and television stations shut down, and critical      journalists beaten in what foes of the government consider a      new wave of repression.       What inspectors and regulators have not accomplished,      mysterious vandals have. One of the country's leading      television stations was knocked off the air when its cable      was sliced in the middle of the night. Shortly after it was      repaired, the cable was rendered useless again when someone      shot through it.       ``Everything that's been achieved over the last 10 years,      it's been wiped out,'' Petrushova lamented.       ``This political system we have is still Soviet,'' said      Yevgeny Zhovits, director of the Kazakhstan International      Bureau for Human Rights and the Rule of Law. ``By its spirit,      by its nature, by its attitude toward personal freedom, it's      still Soviet.''       The tale of intrigue emerging in Kazakhstan, while familiar      across the former Soviet Union, takes on special significance      in Central Asia, a region that has become far more important      to the United States as it fights a war in nearby      Afghanistan. The case also sheds some light on the tangled      world of oil, money and politics in a country with massive      energy reserves.       The U.S. Embassy and the State Department have issued      statements condemning the pattern of events and fretting      about the state of democracy in a country still run by its      last Communist boss. But many reformers in Kazakhstan worry      that the West has effectively turned its eyes away from human      rights abuses to maintain the international coalition against      terrorism.       ``All this is happening with the silent consent of the      West,'' said Assylbeck Kozhakhmetov, a leading figure in      Democratic Choice for Kazakhstan, an opposition party founded      last year. Until Sept. 11, Nazarbayev's government worried      about offending the West, he noted, but not anymore. ``The      ostrich party of Western democracies actually unties the      hands of dictators.''       Nazarbayev, a burly, 61-year-old former steel mill blast-     furnace operator, has run this giant, dusty country of 17      million people with an authoritarian style. Nazarbayev was a      former member of the Soviet Politburo who took over as head      of the republic in 1990, became president after independence      in 1991, and continued to dominate Kazakhstan through      uncompetitive elections and a referendum extending his term.       His relationship with oil companies has prompted      investigations in Switzerland and the United States as      prosecutors in both countries probe whether an American      lobbyist helped steer millions of dollars in oil commissions      to him and other Kazakh leaders.       The long-brewing questions about such transfers and rumors      of foreign bank accounts erupted into a full-blown scandal in      April when Nazarbayev's prime minister admitted to parliament      that the president diverted $1 billion to a secret Swiss bank      account in 1996. The money came from the sale that year of a      20 percent stake in the valuable Tengiz offshore oil fields      to Chevron.       The prime minister, Imangali Tasmagambetov, said that      Nazarbayev had sent the money abroad because he worried that      such a large infusion of cash into Kazakhstan would throw the      currency into a tailspin. Although he never disclosed the      secret fund to parliament, Nazarbayev used it twice to help      stabilize the country during subsequent financial crises,      Tasmagambetov said.       In an inter-view last week, a top government official      dismissed the significance of the revelation and the      resulting furor.       ``The so-called Kazakh-gate, the government officially      explained this,'' said Ardak Doszham, the deputy minister of      information. ``There was a special reserve account set up by      the government. It's a normal account that can be managed by      officials appointed by the government. It's not managed by      individuals. The money that goes into it is state money, and      it's supposed to be used to meet the needs of the state.''       Asked who knew about it, Doszham could identify only three      men, Nazarbayev, the prime minister and the chairman of the      national bank. Asked why lawmakers were never informed, he      said, ``It was impossible to raise this issue before      parliament because it would have elicited many questions.''       But opposition leaders and journalists said Nazarbayev      finally revealed the account this spring only after they      pushed Swiss prosecutors for information. The opposition and      journalists said they believe the president announced the $1      billion fund only as a smoke screen to obscure other matters      still under investigation by the Swiss and U.S. prosecutors.       ``All around there is bribe-taking and stealing and      mafia,'' said Serikbolsyn Abdildin, the head of the Communist      Party and one of two parliament deputies whose information      request to prosecutors preceded the announcement. ``There's      corruption in the top echelon of power.'' The disclosure of      the $1 billion Swiss fund was designed to ``fool public      opinion,'' he said.       The disclosures have coincided with an escalating series of      troublesome incidents for those who do not defer to the      government.       Just days before Tasmagambetov's speech to parliament,      Kazakh authorities arrested opposition politician Mukhtar      Abilyazov, while his colleague, Ghalymzhan Zhaqiyanov,      avoided a similar fate only by fleeing into the French      Embassy here in Almaty, the former capital, two days later.       After assurances from Kazakh authorities, he left the      embassy, and promptly was also taken into custody. The      government insisted it was pursuing embezzlement charges      against the two, both founding members of Democratic Choice.      The opposition called it blatant harassment.       Other opposition figures began to feel the heat as well.      While independent media in Kazakhstan have often experienced      difficulty in the decade since independence, a string of      frightening episodes convinced many journalists that they      were being targeted.       The government began enforcing a five-year-old law      requiring television stations to ensure that 50 percent of      their broadcasts were aired in the native Kazakh tongue, a      language that in practice remains secondary to Russian here.      Most television stations cannot afford to develop such      programming and prefer to buy off-the-shelf material from      Russia, including dubbed Western television shows and movies.      As government agents swarmed in and began monitoring channels      this spring, they began seizing licenses of those stations      that did not comply.       Similarly, inspectors showed up at newspaper offices      demanding to see registration papers and suspending those      publications that did not have everything in order. Some that      did not list their addresses properly were abruptly shut      down. Printing houses began refusing to publish other papers,      and one printing house was burned down in unclear      circumstances.       Tamara Kaleyeva, president of the International Foundation      for Protection of Speech here, said about 20 newspapers have      been forced to stop publishing and about 20 television      stations have been shut down or face closure.       ``It appears the Swiss accounts are the reason for a      terrible persecution against free speech,'' she said. Added      Rozlana Taukina, president of the Central Asia Independent      Mass Media Association, ``The country is turning into an      authoritarian regime.''       Doszham, the deputy minister, denied any political      motivations behind the recent actions. Television stations      had been flouting the language law, he said, and the      government has suspended about seven or eight, and gone to      court to recall the licenses of another six or seven.      Similarly, he said, newspapers had been violating      requirements. ``The law is harsh,'' he said, ``but the law is      the law.''       Even more harsh, however, has been an unofficial but often      violent crackdown. It is not known who is orchestrating it.      Bakbytzhan Ketebayev, president of Tan Broadcasting Co.,      whose Tan TV station was among the best known in Kazakhstan,      has been off the air for two months following repeated      attacks on his cable. Even after it was repaired following      the gunshots, it was damaged yet again when someone drove      three nails in it. ``Once it's an accident, twice it may be      an accident,'' he said. ``But three times is a trend.''       At the newspaper Soldat, which means soldier in Russian but      is also a play on words in Kazakh meaning ``that one demands      to speak,'' the assault was more personal. One day in late      May, four young men burst into the newspaper office and beat      two workers there, bashing one woman's head so hard she      remains in the hospital. They also took the computer      equipment.       Ermuram Bali, the editor, said the attack came the day      before the weekly was to run the second of two installments      reprinting a Seymour Hersh piece from the New Yorker about      oil and corruption in Kazakhstan. ``This is the last warning      against you,'' he said the assailants told his staff. Other      journalists have been physically attacked as well.       And then there was Petrushova and the headless dog. Like      Soldat, her newspaper, the Republic Business Review, had      written about the scandal. Then the mutilated animal was      found May 19, and finally the newspaper office was set aflame      on May 22.       Petrushova suspects state security agencies were behind the      incidents but cannot prove it. ``The throne started to waver,      and in order to hold it in place, all sorts of measures are      being used,'' she said. Now she works out of borrowed offices      at Tan TV headquarters, putting out the newspaper on her own      typographical machine and stapling each issue. ``It's just      like it was in the time of the Soviet Union.''                               ____________________
