I would like to see the reform. I really think at a time when taxpayers are being told that we are going to mind their dollars carefully, that we are doing to tighten the belt here, we are not going to let people rip off things. There is no excuse by saying the Senate does not like our reforms. That is not good enough.  I mean the bottom line is we are going to lose millions of dollars, folks. This is a mini-mini version of a savings and loan scandal where taxpayers end up holding the bag when these properties fail, and this bill allows it to continue.  But I say to my colleagues in the House, for all of the things in the bill, defeat it today because a section 515 scandal will continue. We will see it on ``60 Minutes.'' We will see it on ``20/20.'' We will see it on ``Prime Time.'' And after this speech it is not good enough to say, oh, I did not know it was in there. It is in there, the section 515 scandal is in there, and unless the gentleman from New York [Mr. Lazio] puts the reforms in place to clean it up taxpayers are going to be left holding the bag.  Vote ``no'' on this bill.
