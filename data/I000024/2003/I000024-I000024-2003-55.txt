Wigley in my remarks.  Mr. McCAIN. Dr. Wigley was mentioned by the Senator in his statement on the floor.  He goes through several misrepresentations. Perhaps the most serious one, and this is a quote from his letter: the third representation made by Senator Inhofe concerns the observed record of global mean temperature changes over the past 100 years. This data show a warming to about 1940, little change from 1940 to the mid-1970s, and then further warming. Senator Inhofe implies that these changes are inconsistent with the global warming hypothesis and with climate models. This is categorically incorrect. In order to understand these observed changes, it is necessary to consider all likely causal factors, both human-induced and natural. Human-induced factors include the warming effects of greenhouse gases and the cooling effects of sulfate aerosols. Natural factors include changes in the output of the sun, effects of explosive volcanic eruptions like Mount Pinatubo in 1991. When all these factors are considered, models give an expected pattern of 20th century temperature changes that is in remarkable agreement with the observations, and the models clearly show the three phases as noted above, in particular the leveling off, the warming trend over 1940 to 1975, turns out to be explained largely by the cooling effects of sulfate aerosols, temporarily offsetting the warming due to increasing concentration of greenhouse gases, something which was first pointed out in the paper of mine published in Nature in 1989, which has been clearly stated in a subsequent IPCC report. This remarkable agreement shows quite clearly that human factors have been the dominant cause of global scale climate change over the past 50 years, contrary to the assertion by Senator Inhofe that all observed changes are merely manifestations of natural viability.  For his part, Dr. Schneider had the following to say about Senator Inhofe's statement: It is misrepresenting my views to characterize them as even implying that IPCC is exaggerated or failed to describe the state of the science fairly at the time the assessment reports were completed in the year 2000.  So Dr. Wigley and Dr. Schneider take some exception to how their views were characterized on the floor of the Senate.  I want to point out again that the 17,000, or whoever they were, scientists or those who claimed to be scientists--and there are some interesting signatures to that--were in opposition to the United States signing the Kyoto Treaty.  I know that my colleague, the Senator from Connecticut, would like to say a few words, but I again want to read a letter from 1,010 preeminent scientists who write:       Dear Senators Frist and Daschle: Two years have elapsed      since the publication of the reports by the Intergovernmental      Panel on Climate Change and the National Research Council on      the state of the science of climate change and its impacts on      the United States and the rest of the world. As scientists      engaged in research on these subjects, we are writing to      confirm that the main findings of these documents continue to      represent the consensus opinion of the scientific community.      Indeed, these findings have been reinforced rather than      weakened by research reported since the documents were      released. In brief--  And he goes through a number of aspects of it.  I ask unanimous consent that it be printed in the Record.  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in the Record, as follows: The State of Climate Science: July 2003--A Letter From U.S. Scientists                                                    July 29, 2003.     U.S. Senate,     Washington, DC.       Dear Senators Frist and Daschle: Two years have elapsed      since the publication of the most recent reports by the      Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) and the      National Research Council (NRC) on the state of the science      of climate change and its impacts on the United States and      the rest of the world. As scientists engaged in research on      these subjects, we are writing to confirm that the main      findings of these documents continue to represent the      consensus opinion of the scientific community. Indeed, these      findings have been reinforced rather than weakened by      research reported since the documents were released.       In brief, the findings are that:       (1) Anthropogenic climate change, driven by emissions of      greenhouse gases, is already underway and likely responsible      for most of the observed warming over the last 50 years--the      largest warming that has occurred in the Northern Hemisphere      during at least the past 1,000 years;       (2) Over the course of this century the Earth is expected      to warm an additional 2.5 to 10.5 deg.F, depending on future      emissions levels and on the climate sensitivity--a sustained      global rate of change exceeding any in the last 10,000 years;       (3) Temperature increases in most areas of the United      States are expected to be considerably higher than these      global means because of our nation's northerly location and      large average distance from the oceans;       (4) Even under mid-range emissions assumptions, the      projected warming could cause substantial impacts in      different regions of the U.S., including an increased      likelihood of heavy and extreme precipitation events,      exacerbated drought, and sea level rise;       (5) Almost all plausible emissions scenarios result in      projected temperatures that continue to increase well beyond      the end of this century; and,       (6) Due to the long lifetimes of greenhouse gases in the      atmosphere, the longer emissions increase, the faster they      will ultimately have to be decreased in order to avoid      dangerous interference with the climate system.       Evidence that climate change is already underway includes      the instrumental record, which shows a surface temperature      rise of approximately 1 deg.F over the 20th century, the      accelerated sea level rise during that century relative to      the last few thousand years, global retreat of mountain      glaciers, reduction in snow cover extent, earlier thawing of      lake and river ice, the increase in upper air water vapor      over most regions in the past several decades, and the      0.09 deg.F warming of the world's deep oceans since the      1950's.       Evidence that the warmth of the Northern Hemisphere during      the second half of the last century was unprecedented in the      last 1000 years comes from three major reconstructions of      past surface temperatures, which used indicators such as tree      rings, corals, ice cores, and lake sediments for years prior      to 1860, and instrumental records for the interval between      1865 and the present.       On the subject of human causation of this warmth, the NRC      report stated that, ``The IPCC's conclusion that most of the      observed warming of the last 50 years is likely to have been      due to the increase in greenhouse gas concentrations      accurately reflects the current thinking of the scientific      community on this issue.'' Indeed, computer simulations do      not reproduce the late 20th century warmth if they include      only natural climate forcing such as emissions from volcanoes      and solar activity. The warmth is only captured when the      simulations include forcings from human-emitted greenhouse      gases present in the atmosphere.       In summary, the main conclusions of the IPCC and NRC      reports remain robust consensus positions supported by the      vast majority of researchers in the fields of climate     change and its impacts. The body of research carried out      since the reports were issued tends to strengthen their      conclusions.           Sincerely,       Richard J.

The letter further states:       Over the course of this century, the Earth is expected to      warm an additional 2.5 to 10.5 degrees Fahrenheit, depending      on future emissions levels and on the climate sensitivity--a      sustained global rate of change exceeding any in the last      10,000 years.       Temperature increases in most areas of the United States      are expected to be considerably higher than these global      means because of our nation's northerly location and large      average distance from the oceans.       Almost all plausible emissions scenarios result in      projected temperatures that continue to increase well beyond      the end of this century, and       Due to the long lifetimes of greenhouse gases in the      atmosphere--  Those are the ones that cause no harm in the view of the opponents of this legislation.       the longer emissions increase, the faster they will      ultimately have to be decreased in order to avoid dangerous      interference with the climate system.       Evidence that climate change is already underway includes      the instrumental record, which shows a surface temperature      rise of approximately 1 degree Fahrenheit over the 20th      century, the accelerated sea level rise during that century      relative to the last few thousand years, global retreat of      mountain glaciers, reduction in snow cover extent, earlier      thawing of lake and river ice, the increase in upper air      water vapor over most regions in the past several decades,      and the 0.09 Fahrenheit warming of the world's deep oceans      since the 1950s.       Evidence that the warmth of the Northern Hemisphere during      the second half of the last century was unprecedented in the      last 1,000 years comes from three major reconstructions of      past surface temperatures, which used indicators such as tree      rings, corals, ice cores, and lake sediments for years prior      to 1860, and instrumental records for the interval between      1865 and the present.       On the subject of human causation of this warmth, the NRC      report stated that the IPCC's conclusion that most of the      observed warming of the last 50 years is likely to have been      due to the increase in greenhouse gas concentrations      accurately reflects the current thinking of the scientific      community on this issue.  What the Senator from Connecticut and I are doing is an incredibly modest proposal to try to at least stop the increase of greenhouse gases. The overwhelming majority of the scientific community in the United States of America agrees that climate change is taking place. How serious that is, how significant it is, and how longlasting its effect could be the subject of significant debate and discussion.  But the fact is that the loss of jobs, which I do not believe is accurate, is an issue that needs to be addressed. But what about the loss of our environment? What happens if the coral reefs die? What happens if the Arctic icecap melts? What happens if we continue to see increased temperatures?  I don't know all the answers as to what happens. I leave that in the hands of people who are smarter than I am. But if this picture doesn't concern you, then nothing will. I hope we will be able to pass this legislation as a very modest and a very humble beginning to addressing the issue of climate change.  I assure my colleagues of one thing. I will talk about this again tomorrow. We will be back on this issue, just as we were back on the issue of campaign finance reform. We will be back on it because this is not stopping. This is not stopping. More and more evidence will be accumulated and more and more people will become concerned because we love this great country of ours and we love this world and we do not want to see it destroyed.  The overwhelming body of scientific evidence indicates we are placing our globe in jeopardy and the lives and futures of our children and our grandchildren. We may have lived in a very nice time in the history of the world. Our children and grandchildren may be condemned to a much less happy world.  I reserve the remainder of my time.
