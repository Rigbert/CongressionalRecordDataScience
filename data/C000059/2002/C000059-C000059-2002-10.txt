Speaker, like most Americans, I have become jaded to the fact that the news media uses the airways to promote their liberal agenda. But when National Public Radio made a thinly veiled accusation that the Traditional Values Coalition could be responsible for the anthrax attacks on Capitol Hill, they crossed the line from simple bias to outright libel.  Mr. Speaker, the thousands of men and women who make up the Traditional Values Coalition are our neighbors, our fellow churchgoers. They are the people who responded to our national emergency by giving their money, clothes, food, time, and even their blood to the victims of September 11. But to NPR, they are simply accused terrorists.  In the end, while the people of the Traditional Values Coalition practice the American ideals of charity and compassion, NPR continues to practice their traditional values: shameful pettiness and slanderous lies.                          ____________________
