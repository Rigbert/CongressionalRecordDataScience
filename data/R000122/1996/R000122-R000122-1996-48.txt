Speaker, I rise today to commemorate the 175th anniversary of Greek Independence Day, which falls on March 25. On this historic day, the Greek people broke from the Ottoman Empire after more than 400 years of foreign domination, clearly demonstrating their long-standing and continuing love of freedom.  Greece's democratic ideals and institutions continue to inspire people and nations around the world, and they have enabled the United States and Greece to enjoy a strong relationship. The contributions that Greek-Americans have made in our society are especially evident in my home State of Rhode Island, where the oldest Greek settlement dates back to the late 1890's. Many of the early Greek immigrants to the State worked as mill workers, foundrymen, fishermen, or merchant seamen. Today, the descendants of these hard-working people form a proud and prosperous Greek-American community, which continues to enrich Rhode Island and our Nation.  While we are here today to celebrate Greek history and its contributions, it is also important to recognize the continuing struggles of the Greek people. For more than 20 years, military occupation and human rights abuses by Turkey continue to hamper efforts to bring about a resolution to the situation in Cyprus. The time has come to end the strife and violence that have racked Cyprus since the Turkish invasion. I am a cosponsor of House Concurrent Resolution 42 which calls for the demilitarization of Cyprus and I urge my colleagues to join as cosponsors. The United States can and must play a role to help the people of Cyprus and stabilize relations between Greece and Turkey.  The Ecumenical Patriarchate, the spiritual leader for over 250 million Greek Orthodox Christians, is located in Turkey and continues to be the victim of harassment and terrorist attacks. I am also a cosponsor of House Concurrent Resolution 50, which calls for the United States to insist that Turkey protect the Ecumenical Patriarchate and all Orthodox Christians residing in Turkey and I would urge my colleagues to sign onto this important legislation.  The relationship between the United States and Greece continues to be of political, economical, and social importance. It is my hope we will continue to strengthen the bond between the United States and Greece, and to promote peace and stability in this region of the world. I would like to commend my colleagues, Representatives Bilirakis and Maloney, for forming the Congressional Caucus on Hellenic Issue. As a member of this caucus, I look forward to working with them and my other colleagues to heighten awareness of issues of concern to the Greek-American community and to further our mutually beneficial relationship with Greece.  In closing, I am proud to participate in the celebration of Greek Independence Day. I wish to extend my congratulations and best wishes on this day to the millions of Greek-Americans and all the citizens of Greece.                          ____________________
