 President, I am impressed.  The second thing I say to my friend from New Hampshire, I find his reasoning absolutely fascinating and appealing. It is a little like saying, you know, we have been in the candy drawer for the last year, but we are going to lock it now because we think you are right; there should have been a lock on this drawer the whole time, as they walk around fat and happy and 300 pounds. I kind of like that.  I have been here 27 years, and I have never been as impressed with the generosity of the other party as I have been today. I wanted to say that and tell you how good it makes me feel.  I yield the floor.
