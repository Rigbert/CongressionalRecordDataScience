 President, I speak in favor of the motion by the Senator from New Hampshire, the ranking member of the Budget Committee, to make sure we continue existing tax policy throughout the period of time of this budget resolution.  Considering the issue of taxes and this budget, press reports have indicated we may be in the ninth inning of this budget season. The President sent his budget to Capitol Hill 3 months ago. The Senate Budget Committee marked up a budget resolution. It passed the Senate. That resolution lays out the Democratic leadership's fiscal priorities for the next 5 years. As everyone knows, the American people spoke last November and as a result of that election, we have a new Democratic majority in both Houses of Congress. So for the first time in 12 years, Democrats have the privilege, but also the responsibility, for our budget.  The Senate spoke very clearly in support of some tax relief. The voice came in the form of Senator Baucus and his amendment. My friend, the chairman of the Finance Committee, secured $180 billion to prevent part of the big tax increase that will go into effect January 1, 2011. Although the Baucus amendment only provides 44 percent of the tax relief room that is actually needed to keep existing tax policy in place so there is no tax increase, it is, in fact, far superior, though, to the position on the same issue by the other body, because the House position is zero tax relief. That is right: zero tax relief. What does zero tax relief mean? It means a total tax increase of $936 billion over 5 years. That, in fact, is the largest tax increase in history, and it is a tax increase that will occur automatically without a vote of Congress. Of course, it is inconceivable that people say: Well, we aren't responsible for a tax increase. If you like the tax policy we have today and you don't do anything to stop it, and you automatically have a tax increase, then the people who let it automatically happen are responsible for increasing taxes--the biggest tax increase in the history of the country.  That tax increase means real dollars out of the wallets of real middle-income families. I have a chart here. The chart shows a wall of tax increases. The chart shows a family of four at $40,000 a year average income--the national average--will face a tax increase of $2,052. Now, for a lot of my rich liberal friends, that may not seem like a lot of money, but for a hard-working family of four in my State of Iowa, a $2,052 increase in taxes without even a vote of the Congress happening on January 1, 2011 is a lot of money, and it matters. That is why that wall of tax increases ought to be clear to everybody, and we ought to do everything we can to bring down that wall.  As a senior Republican member of the Budget Committee, I have not been consulted on the budget by our chairman, but I have made my views clear to our distinguished chairman. What I know about the budget I have learned from press reports. If those reports are true, I would encourage the chairman and the Senate leadership to stand strong for the Senate position, which is taking care of some of the tax increase that would have taken place--44 percent of it--not as good as it ought to be, but it is surely better than the other body.  Press reports indicate that the Democratic Budget Committee chairmen are working on a compromise that would condition the tax relief on a surplus. That is, the Baucus amendment would be subject to a trigger.  Now, what is a trigger? Well, I have another chart. This chart deals with perhaps the most famous trigger. The chart shows, as my colleagues can see, Trigger, the cowboy actor Roy Rogers' horse. You can see from the chart that Trigger is a pretty impressive looking horse. We would definitely like to have such a Trigger on my farm to help with the chores, and I am sure my grandkids would enjoy a ride with Trigger were he stabled on my farm. He is a beautiful horse.  As western movie buffs know, Trigger is no longer with us. Trigger is stuffed and on display at the Roy Rogers-Dale Evans Museum in Branson, MO. Although Trigger was an impressive looking horse, this trigger device the Democrat leadership is looking at is far from impressive. The trigger notion is something that has a long history with Democratic leadership. Back in 1996, as an example, the Clinton administration and the Democratic leadership argued for a trigger for the $500 per-child tax credit and other family tax relief issues. They took this position after President Clinton had vetoed the bill containing the family tax relief proposals. If the Clinton administration and the Democratic leadership had prevailed, millions of American families would have received the $500 per-child tax credit perhaps in 1999 through 2001--only in those years. If President Clinton and the Democratic leadership had won and the trigger were in place, then millions of families would have lost the child tax credit in the years 2002 until now. So why would anybody in Congress want to be so antifamily and put in a trigger policy, as the practice was at that time, that would deny families with children the child tax credit? It doesn't make sense, but that is the way triggers work.  The same dynamic occurred in 2001. With surpluses, the Democratic leadership opposed broad-based, bipartisan tax relief, including a doubling of the $500 per-child tax credit. One of the ideas the Democratic leadership flirted with at that time was the trigger. There were a few Republicans attracted to the idea as well, I have to confess.  The trigger was debated somewhat, but it was never found to be workable. It wasn't workable. So if it wasn't workable 6 years ago, why are they bringing it out of the attic now for consideration? Because a trigger is a complicated matter. It could be suggested that the mechanics of a broad-based tax trigger are a little bit like trigonometry. Trigonometry is a division of mathematics that deals with triangles. It is simple on its face, but you can see from this textbook, it can become pretty complicated pretty easily. Look at this. That is complicated.  Interweaving the complexities and uncertainties of triggered tax relief with the vast American economy could lead to a new term. That new term would be ``trigonomics.'' As much as folks complain about the uncertainty and complexity of the tax policy, I don't think the Democratic negotiators should want us to take us to the land of trigonomics.  To some degree, the current law sunset of 2001 and 2003 is a de facto trigger. If you look at those in opposition to permanence of the bipartisan tax relief, you will find that it is, with very few exceptions, the same folks who like triggers.  The tax system is a very complex, very pervasive force in our society.  It affects real Americans, all Americans, and it affects all economic activity. So creating conditional tax relief through a trigger mechanism would destabilize an already unwieldy tax system. How are families, how are businesses, how are investors supposed to plan their affairs with a trigger hanging over their current tax law rules that keeps taxes low? Think about that. What would we be doing to the hard-working American taxpayers?  Now, as an aside, those taxpayers, by the way, are sending record amounts of revenue to the Treasury Department. This very day, it is reported in the Wall Street Journal that more taxes came in in April than we have ever had in the history of our country--because the bipartisan tax relief plans of 2001 and 2003 are growing the economy. They are the goose that laid the golden egg, for 3 years in a row, bringing in massive amounts of revenue into our Federal Treasury, to a point where, by the end of this fiscal year, the annual deficit will be less than 1 percent of gross national product. When you are dealing with a $13 trillion economy, 1 percent up or down is about as good as you can do 12 months ahead in planning a budget and tax policies for thisgreat country of ours. So the American taxpayer is doing his or her part to reduce the deficit.  I ask unanimous consent to have printed in the Record a couple of articles from the BNA Daily Report for Executives, one dated May 3, 2007, another dated May 7, 2007.  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in the Record, as follows:          [From the Daily Report for Executives, May 3, 2007]Robust Revenues Lead Treasury To Drop Three-Year, Consider Buying Debt                                  Again       The U.S. Treasury Department said May 2 it was scrapping      sales of the three-year note and that it has discussed with      Wall Street representatives the issue of debt buybacks, a      finance management tool last seen when the government was in      surplus, as tax collections continue to come in at a healthy      pace.       ``As you all know, receipts have been strong and largely      consistent with our forecasts. Based on this and other      factors, we're announcing this morning our decision to      discontinue the issuance of the three-year note,'' Anthony      Ryan, Treasury assistant secretary for financial markets,      said at the department's quarterly press briefing. The change      will allow Treasury to ensure auctions of remaining issues      are large enough to attract active bidding, help balance its      portfolio of debt and ``manage the improving fiscal      outlook,'' Ryan said.       The three-year note was revived in May 2003 after being      discontinued previously when the government began posting      surpluses from 1998 through 2001.                       Talks With Advisory Panel       The discussion of debt buybacks was held with the      Treasury's Borrowing Advisory Committee, a panel of private      sector representatives from the securities industry. Treasury      officials meet quarterly with the group to receive input on      issues facing Treasury's debt managers, who aim to sell U.S.      Treasuries to finance government borrowing at the lowest      possible cost over time.       Treasury had asked the TBAC to address ``what practices      Treasury and market participants should consider in a      significantly improving fiscal or surplus environment, given      volatility in budget forecasts and the Administration's long-     term plan to balance the budget,'' according to minutes of      the meeting released by Treasury.       Ryan called the talks ``an initial discussion'' that did      not signal any decisions and intended merely to broach the      issue.       ``We asked this question in an attempt to continue to be      proactive and forward-looking,'' he said. ``Given some of the      volatility associated with our projections, it can't hurt to      be prepared.''                         Recent Swings Volatile       Budget swings over the past decade have been particularly      volatile. In 1997, a Democratic White House and a Republican      Congress reached agreement on a 5-year plan to bring the      budget into balance. Thanks in large part to surging capital      gains revenues, balance was reached in 1998.       On the other hand, few analysts expected the sharp drop-off      in revenues that followed the relatively light 2001 recession      and the enactment of President Bush's tax cut plan. Revenues      have surprised on the upside in recent years, and that trend      is expected to continue this year, according to analysts      watching the early data on April tax returns, which bring in      a sizeable chunk of the government's overall annual revenue.       A Treasury chart prepared for the TBAC showed the possible      range of borrowing outcomes if historic ranges of forecast      error, either positive or negative, occurred. If the      surprises kept to the positive side, the chart showed      a potential need for a large paydown of debt as soon as      2010.       Asked if that implied a budget surplus in 2010, 2 years      ahead of what Congress and the White House have targeted for      a surplus, Matthew Abbott, deputy assistant secretary for      federal finance, said, ``What the chart illustrates is that      it's possible. Not that it's expected, but that's possible.''                `Premature' to Discuss Earlier Surpluses       A Wall Street economist also warned that reaching surplus      ahead of 2012 was unlikely, given uncertainty about what the      government will do about the Alternative Minimum Tax as well      as the temporary tax cuts that expire in 2010.       ``I think it would be premature to think about buybacks      because of expected budget surpluses,'' said Michael Moran,      chief economist with Daiwa Securities. However, he said      buybacks could be used instead as a tool to affect the      maturity of outstanding debt, a factor that influences      interest costs.       Moran also said the ``excellent inflows in April'' on the      tax side were likely to lead him to revise downward his      deficit forecast from $175 billion in 2007.                        Hoyer Hopeful on Budget       Democrats in Congress are continuing to work on hammering      out the framework for a budget resolution that can pass both      chambers of Congress and reach balance in 2012. With an      informal deadline of May 15 for completing action on the      budget, the House has yet to name members of a conference      committee for its side.       Majority Leader Steny Hoyer (D-Md.) remained optimistic,      telling reporters May 2, ``We want to move ahead on the      budget. The answer to your question is I'm hopeful we'll move      the budget in the next couple of weeks, that we think that's      important to do.''       A House Democratic aide said conferees may not be named in      the April 30 week, as had been expected, but could instead be      named early in the May 7 week. ``We can see our way to get      there'' to a resolution, the aide told BNA.                                  ____          [From the Daily Report for Executives, May 7, 2007]CBO Lowers Projection of 2007 Deficit To $150-$200 Billion Range on Tax                                 Receipts       The Congressional Budget Office said May 4 that the      projected 2007 federal budget deficit could come in much      lower than had been expected at the beginning of the year,      possibly as low as $150 billion, based on continued strength      in tax revenues.       ``Revenues have risen by about 11 percent compared with      receipts in the same period of 2006, only slightly more than      CBO anticipated when it prepared its most recent budget      estimates in March; outlays have grown by only 3 percent,''      the CBO said in its projection issued ahead of the monthly      financial statement to be released by the Treasury Department      on May 10.       ``CBO now expects that the government will end 2007 with a      deficit of between $150 billion and $200 billion, assuming      enactment of pending supplemental appropriations,'' the      agency said.       In March, the agency had projected about a $214 billion      deficit, assuming an Iraq war supplemental is passed by      Congress. In 2006, the deficit totaled $248.2 billion.                      Further Receipt Growth Seen       Healthy tax revenues were cited May 2 by Treasury      Department officials in their decision to eliminate sales of      the three-year note from their regular auctions of government      debt (85 DER EE-2, 05/3/07). Treasury officials also      disclosed they had discussed the issue of debt buybacks with      an advisory committee made up of private sector experts.      While debt buybacks were seen when the government last ran a      surplus, Treasury officials said the discussions with the      panel were only made in an effort to be forward-looking and      proactive.       Prior to the CBO release, Rob Portman, director of the      White House's Office of Management and Budget, said the      budget was benefiting from a healthy economy.       ``Solid economic growth is pushing Federal tax receipts up,      and will drive the deficit down even faster as we move toward      balance,'' he said in a statement.       ``We've just seen a record-breaking April tax collection,      and the outlook is for further growth in tax receipts. That's      good news for our federal budget, and underscores the need      for making the pro-growth tax relief permanent and having      spending restraint in place.''                   Lawmakers Aim for Balance in 2012       On Capitol Hill, lawmakers are struggling to close the      differences between House- and Senate-passed versions of the      2008 budget blueprint. Democrats have said they are aiming      for a budget that can pass both chambers of Congress by May      15 and reach balance by 2012. However, negotiators have been      stuck on several issues, including whether to allow room for      extending some temporary tax cuts.       In its report, the CBO said it expected the government to      post a $176 billion surplus in April, well above the $119      billion surplus seen in April 2006. Because of the mid-month      deadline for individual tax payments, April is a      crucial month for government revenues. If the April      projection is correct, the year-to-date deficit will be      about $83 billion, or about $101 billion less than in the      first seven months of fiscal 2006, the said.       CBO said receipts from individual income taxes were up by      about $105 billion, or 17.5 percent, through April compared      with the same period in the previous year, while payroll      taxes were up by $27 billion, or 5.5 percent in the same time      frame.       ``About 85 percent of the growth in total receipts through      April occurred in receipts from individual income and payroll      taxes, the two largest sources of revenues,'' the agency      said. It noted, however, that some nonwithheld receipts      appeared to be booked earlier by Treasury in 2007 than in      2006, shifting some receipts from May to April. If that      factor is adjusted for, the agency said, overall receipts      would have been up by closer to 9 percent, ``only slightly      more'' than CBO had projected in March.
