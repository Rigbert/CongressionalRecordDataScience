Let me say on behalf of the minority, the Democrat side of the aisle shares your concern and commitment to assuring retirement security for our people. As you know, we strongly disagree with the suggestion that has been made by the administration with reference to the creation of private accounts and what we perceive as privatizing parts of Social Security. But I want you to be assured that we share your view that we want to make sure that retirement accounts are secure and that Americans have opportunities to participate in the creation of retirement accounts. I thank the gentleman for his observation.                          ____________________
