 I believe the process was used last year to put a moratorium on going forward with the development of oil shale, much of which is found in Utah. I see our friend from Utah. So it is not at all inappropriate, it strikes me, for the appropriations process to consider the other side of the equation, which is to actually provide additional domestic production.  It is pretty clear what is going on here, I say to my friend from Texas.
