 Chairman, we talk about job creation. Where is your information about how many jobs have been created?  Second of all, the gentleman from Wisconsin previously talked about exports. Nobody in this House believes more than I do that we have got to rebuild our manufacturing base, create decent-paying jobs and exports. That is not what we are talking about here.  In fact, what we are talking about here is helping the largest corporations in America who have thrown hundreds of thousands of American workers out on the street, set up factories abroad.
