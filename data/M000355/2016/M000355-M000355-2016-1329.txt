 In the Energy Committee, it passed overwhelmingly with the support of both parties. Here on the floor, it has been subject to an open amendment process, with input from both sides. More than 30 amendments from both Democrats and Republicans have already been adopted. The Senator from Alaska recently sought consent to continue that progress by getting several more amendments pending. It is unclear why any colleague would object to her effort or why they would effectively block consideration of their own amendments, but that is what happened. It is disappointing for our country.  We are hoping our friends will reconsider. Remember, the Energy Policy Modernization Act is broad bipartisan legislation designed to help Americans produce more energy, pay less for energy, and save energy, all while helping strengthen our long-term national security. We should pass it.  I am asking colleagues to take yes for an answer and allow the open amendment process to continue so that we can pass it, which is so important to helping our country prepare for the energy demands of today and the energy opportunities of tomorrow.                          ____________________
