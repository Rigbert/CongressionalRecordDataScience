Speaker, on May 9, I came to the Floor and spoke about the March For Our Lives on March 24 and the nine extraordinarily poised students in Morristown, New Jersey, who spoke at the rally there, which I attended. I include in the Record remarks by Benjamin Douglas. I hope my colleagues will read them and internalize the sense of fear in which our nation's students are living every day--and our responsibility as Members of Congress to do something to address this crisis of gun violence.            March For Our Lives Remarks by Benjamin Douglas       Mass shootings have been becoming a more and more common      part of our society for years now. By the time I became aware      of this, many ordinary people had already begun to work      toward change. One such person was a close friend of mine who      took part     in and introduced me to the Sandy Hook Ride on Washington      also known as Team 26. Team 26 is an organization of twenty-     six cyclists and activists who every year, ride together from      Newtown, CT, to Washington, DC, in order to honor the twenty-     six lives lost in the Newtown School Shooting, raise      awareness of gun violence, and the ever-growing need for      common sense gun legislation. His participation in this ride      and my discovery of it opened my eyes to many things      regarding the topic of gun violence.       Firstly, it got me thinking about my own town's      vulnerability to this ever growing issue. I had grown up      believing that my town was immune to the epidemic of gun      violence. But with my new outlook on the conflict, I found      that it has become increasingly difficult, almost impossible      to still confidently say this. I realized that no town in our      country is more or less likely to experience these types of      tragedies.       Also, I thought about how gun violence and other forms of      mass violence had affected my childhood. Seemingly endless      lock-down drills, news stories of `another shooting,' and      hearing my peers discuss what they would do if they were ever      in a scenario such as a school shooting. I knew that no one      should need to worry about their safety or think about how      they would react in public places during an avoidable tragedy      like this. I felt strongly about this and wanted to make a      difference.       Through watching the men and women who rode their bikes      from Newtown, CT, to Washington, DC, stop along the way to      hold rallies, call people to action, and spread hope wherever      they went, I saw ways I too could make a difference. The      following year, I rode with Team 26, and I witnessed the      rallies at which many of the family members and friends of      people who had lost their lives to gun violence spoke about      their experience.       During our rally in Trenton, we heard members of Mothers      Demand Action speak about the loss of their sons and      daughters, we learned exactly how it felt to have someone you      love so dearly taken from you forever due to a strangers ease      of access to a firearm.       Here, in Morristown, we met and rode with a mother whose      life was turned upside down by a man who discharged a firearm      in a mall, seriously hurting her, and killing her fifteen-     year-old daughter!       Listening to these people speak helped me discover the real      reason I was there.       I was riding with Team 26 to be a messenger.       We were listening to these people speak first-hand about      when their loved ones were taken by another person with a gun      and how it felt and affected their lives.       We took these peoples' experiences and stories to the      elected officials in the states we visited and in our      nation's capital to educate them on what is really going on      in their country.       It is so easy to be unaware of how often shootings occur as      most shootings go unreported and therefore are quickly      forgotten by those not involved. But for the friends and      family whose friend, child, or sibling had been taken from      them, any of these occurrences are life changing.       We ride to ensure that no life gets forgotten.       We ride to educate our lawmakers about gun violence beyond      the statistics, to show them not only the numbers, but who      those numbers represent and the heartbreak and sorrow they      live with.       We ride to encourage these lawmakers to begin making      change.       To urge their peers to stand up with them against gun      violence.       To vote for common sense gun laws such as mandatory      background checks, banning assault rifles and bump-stocks,      and helping to make mental healthcare more accessible and      accepted nationwide.       Team 26 shares many of its goals with the hundreds of other      organizations and groups who are currently battling the      nationwide epidemic of gun violence now more than ever. We      all must now come together as one group and refuse to be      silenced.       We must continue to organize these events and never stop      making noise until our representatives get it.       Until they understand that gun violence is not a problem      that is going to fix itself and that the citizens they      represent are relying on them to become part of the solution.       In order to convince our representatives that the voice of      many is more powerful than ever, we must never give up and      become an active part of our society. You can do this in      countless numbers of ways.       If you are seventeen or older, make sure you are registered      to vote.       If you are eighteen or older, make sure that you do vote.       No matter what your age is, you can get involved and make      your voice heard. In fact, you already have by attending this      event and hopefully attending more in the future to show that      we will never go away.       Unfortunately, it is unlikely this will be the end. But we      must all make a continuous effort to keep the pressure on and      to fight for what is right. Without the power of the people,      this conflict will never have a solution.       So we must press on, ride on, never give up, and pledge to      being the generation that will create the place where this      will never happen again.                          ____________________
