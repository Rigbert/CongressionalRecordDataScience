Speaker, I rise today in support of the Financial Freedom Act of 1999. This is a common-sense piece of legislation which would provide broad based tax relief to individuals and families.  For forty years, the Democrats had control of Congress and practiced their policy of, tax, tax, spend, spend. Now that Republicans have been in the majority for more than 4 years, we have balanced the budget, agreed to set aside all Social Security surplus funds for social Security and Medicare, and still have an excess of funds.  Not surprisingly, the Democrats would prefer to keep these funds in Washington and create new and unneeded programs.  The Democrats are acting as if they found a wallet full of money with no ID. They want to take the money and run with it. But this wallet does have an ID. It belongs to the American taxpayer. It is our moral obligation to return their money.  Mr. Speaker we have these excess of funds because our economy is booming. And, the economy is booming because of the hard-work of the American people. Mr. Speaker, what has Congress contributed to the GDP? Nothing!  We have no right to keep this money in Washington. We should return this money to the people who have worked long and hard for it.  The Financial Freedom Act is a solid piece of legislation and I urge my colleagues to support it.
