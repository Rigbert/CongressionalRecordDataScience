 President, the Boxer amendment purports to deal with the loss of manufacturing jobs and the outsourcing problem. If some on the other side want to do something about manufacturing jobs, they should stop obstructing the FSC/ETI bill with poison pill political amendments. When we come back after next week, I'd ask those on the other side to put results ahead of politics and let us finish the bipartisan JOBS bill.  This amendment, on the other hand, just suggests that the Finance Committee repeal the tax policy of deferral and raise taxes on small manufacturers. The tax policy of deferral insures that American companies like Intel and Hewlett-Packard, compete on a level playing field with foreign companies. Eliminating deferral means U.S. companies will face a tax burden that is not shared by Japanese, German, British or other competing companies.  The Boxer amendment, though styled as a tax increase on the wealthy, contains a tax increase on our small business manufacturers. It would reverse the bipartisan Finance Committee bill's lower rate for manufacturers. Instead of 32 percent, small business manufacturers tax rates would be raised to a level higher than what the Fortune 500 pay.  If you care about manufacturing jobs, why would you punish our manufacturers by raising their marginal tax rates? If you care about manufacturing jobs, help us get the FSC/ETI bill passed and don't raise taxes on manufacturers.  I urge my colleagues to oppose the Boxer amendment.
