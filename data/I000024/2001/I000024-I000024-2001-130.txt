President, it is my privilege today to pay tribute to anoutstanding woman who will be recognized this Saturday, February 10, with a special Honor Dance for her years of service to American Indians and to our country. This dance honors what is perhaps one of the most impressive and prestigious achievements of Lorena DeRoin's lifetime: becoming the first and only American Indian ever to serve as president of American War Mothers.  American War Mothers is a national, patriotic organization dedicated to recognizing mothers whose children have served in the military. As national president, she is able to expound on years of experience leading women in both state and local chapters of the organization.  Born February 9, 1915, in Red Rock, Oklahoma, Mrs. DeRoin has made her mark as an American Indian and a patriot. She belongs to the White Pigeon Clan of the Otoe-Missouria Tribe. In 1962, she joined Otoe War Mothers, a local chapter of American War Mothers. During her years of service, she worked on all standing committees and then became president of the chapter. She is also retired from the Bureau of Indian Affairs as an employee of the old Chilocco Indian School.  Showing her dedication to our country, she has served as Mistress of Ceremonies for three separate years on Mothers Day at Arlington National Cemetery and laid the Wreath at the Tomb of the Unknown Soldier.  Mrs. DeRoin's contributions to our community and our country are an example of true servant leadership. Oklahoma is fortunate to count Lorena DeRoin as one of our own. It is my privilege to recognize her accomplishments and to also wish her a Happy Birthday.                          ____________________
