President, I rise to ask my colleague from Alaska about the Warning, Alert, and Response Network Act, or WARN Act, that is part of the SAFE Port Act that is before the Senate. The WARN Act will authorize a wireless alert capability to provide citizens with emergency alerts on their wireless devices. This is an important enhancement to the emergency alert system that FEMA currently operates. I would note that the language in the WARN Act does not alter FEMA's role in the emergency alert system. It is my understanding that this language directing the FCC to develop the wireless capabilities will not interfere with the Homeland Security and Governmental Affairs Committee considering and reporting legislation next year to further clarify FEMA's role with respect to the emergency alert system and new technologies. Is that correct?
