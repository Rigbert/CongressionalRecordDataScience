Chairman, the amendment I am proposing would restore a program that the majority party has zeroed out in this legislation for the Public Housing Drug Elimination Program. This program has been in operation since President Reagan signed the legislation in his last administration, and was first appropriated, funds were first let around the country, by the first Bush Administration back in 1988.  Our amendment has been scored by CBO as budget neutral, both in outlays and budget authority, because of offsets from the HOME program and the Down Payment Assistance Initiative, which has not been authorized.  Last year Congress provided over $310 million to over 1,100 housing authorities across the country for this very, very successful program, which aims at keeping criminal activity down in some of the most vulnerable neighborhoods in our country where seniors, low-income families, and the disabled live on a daily basis.                              {time}  0930  It is a worthy program; it is a successful program that has been supported by both Republican and Democratic administrations. Frankly, I am rather perplexed, I am mystified, as to why any administration or any subcommittee would zero out a program with this rate of success.  Over 118 Members of this Congress have signed a letter to the gentleman from New York (Mr. Walsh) and the gentleman from West Virginia (Mr. Mollohan) supporting the continuation of this program, and with me here at the desk I have a list of Members' districts that include over 1,100 Housing Authorities where this program has been in operation and so successful.  Now, there is no question that crime has dropped nationwide and, in particular, in some of the most vulnerable areas of our cities, so let me explain what used to happen. What used to happen is that drug lords in places like Chicago literally controlled the roofs. I was in the housing field long before I was elected to Congress. I know what it is like to stand on the roof of a building and watch as mothers cannot leave a housing project to go buy milk because the drug lords control the streets, and if they had a deal coming down, you could not live your life.  This program aims to get rid of that, to set up police substations in many of these housing projects in some of the most dangerous parts of America to let the children in those areas have a chance at a decent life. This is a program with a track record, and it is a good one, and it should not be zeroed out.
