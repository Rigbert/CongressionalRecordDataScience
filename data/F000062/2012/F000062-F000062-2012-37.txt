 President, it is with great sadness that I come here today to talk about my friend: Senator Danny Inouye. Danny was a friend of mine since I came to the Senate 20 years ago. He had a unique ability to connect with people, to befriend them. I know. He always helped me. He was smart, able and someone that over 20 years I grew to love.  He was a war hero who fought bravely in World War II, even at a time when many in this country actively discriminated against Japanese-Americans.  And he served in this body for 50 years--the second longest serving Senator of all time.  Danny and I worked closely together on the Appropriations Committee for many years. I often sought his counsel, and he was always an advocate for me.  I want to say something personally to his beloved wife Irene: You were married to a truly wonderful man and an American hero. Death of a loved one is hard. I know. I have been through it. But, Irene, the love does remain. I know you were so proud to be his wife, to help him share his dreams through these years.  I want you to know that you have many friends here, who now want to help you through this most difficult part of life.  Danny, you will be greatly missed.  Thank you for your service, thank you for your friendship.
