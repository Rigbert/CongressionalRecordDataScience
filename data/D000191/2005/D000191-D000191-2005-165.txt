  Mr. DeFAZIO. Mr. Speaker, we will adopt a so-called energy policy for the United States later today. We are in the beginnings of a 21st century energy crisis, skyrocketing prices at the pump, consumers are being gouged, growing dependence on foreign oil. And what is the answer of the Republican majority and this administration? Let us obligate the taxpayers of the United States to borrow $15.4 billion as a gift, a needed incentive to the oil industry to go out and produce more.  At 60 bucks a barrel and $2.40 a gallon and record profits and huge piles of cash they do not know what to do with, we need to subsidize the oil industry? I do not think so.  We need a new energy policy that will serve this country and the challenges of the 21st century with new technologies, new efficiency, and breaking our dependence on foreign oil. Unfortunately, we are getting exactly the opposite here today.                          ____________________[Page H6940]From the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]                      WE NEED A NEW ENERGY POLICY  (Mr. DeFAZIO asked and was given permission to address the House for 1 minute.)
