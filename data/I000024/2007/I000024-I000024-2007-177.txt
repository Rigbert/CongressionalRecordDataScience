The distinguished junior Senator from California can say over and over and over again as many times as she wants that it is giving money to oil companies. It is not.  Specifically, the EDA portion provides grants to local communities if they want them. If the local community doesn't want them, they don't have to have them.  At this point in the Record I want to have printed a letter from the EDA that says:       No for-profit entity is eligible to receive EDA assistance.  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in the Record, as follows:         United States Department of Commerce, Economic            Development Administration,                                 Washington. DC, October 21, 2005.     Hon. James M. Inhofe,     Chair, Committee on Environment and Public Works, U.S.          Senate, Washington, DC.       Dear Chairman Inhofe: This letter responds to the Committee      on Environment and Public Works' request on October 19, 2005      for clarification on the Economic Development      Administration's (``EDA'') mission and entities that are      eligible to receive EDA assistance, as well as additional      information on EDA's past involvement in base realignment and      closure (``BRAC'') rounds.       EDA's mission is to lead the federal economic development      agenda by promoting innovation and competitiveness, preparing      American regions for growth and success in the worldwide      economy. To implement this mission, EDA is directed by its      authorizing statute, the Public Works and Economic      Development Act of 1965, as amended (``PWEDA''), to foster      economic growth by ``empowering local and regional      communities experiencing chronic high unemployment and low      per capita income to develop     private sector business and attract increased private capital      investment'' (Section 2(a)(3)(C) of PWEDA).       EDA is authorized to provide assistance only to an      ``eligible recipient,'' as that term is defined in PWEDA. An      ``eligible recipient'' means a(n) (l) economic development      district; (2) Indian tribe; (3) State, including a special      purpose unit of a State or local government engaged in      economic or infrastructure development activities; (4) city      or other political subdivision of a State; (5) institution of      higher education; or (6) public or private non-profit      organization or association acting in cooperation with      officials of a political subdivision of a State (Section      3(4)(A) of PWEDA). No for-profit entity is eligible to      receive EDA assistance with one exception: EDA may provide a      grant to a for-profit entity under its Training, Research and      Technical Assistance program (Section 3(4)(B) of PWEDA).      However, this relatively small program is not applicable to      the provision of EDA assistance for the reuse of former      military installations.       For the most recent BRAC round, beginning in FY 1994,      Congress (Commerce-Justice-State appropriators) began adding      a Defense Economic Adjustment line item to EDA's annual      appropriations. In FY 1994, EDA received $80 million in      defense economic adjustment funding. The high-water mark of      this round came in FY 1995, with BRAC '95 underway, in which      EDA received an appropriation of $125 million in defense      economic adjustment funding that was subsequently slightly      reduced due to an across-the-board rescission that year.      Defense economic adjustment appropriations then slowly      declined through FY 2001. The table below depicts actual      EDA Defense Economic Adjustment appropriations (after any      rescissions or adjustments) for the most recent BRAC      round.             [Dollars in millions, after rescissions, if any]------------------------------------------------------------------------                                                       Defense Economic                     Fiscal year                          Adjustment                                                         appropriation------------------------------------------------------------------------1994................................................               $801995................................................               1201996................................................                901997................................................                901998................................................                891999................................................                84.82000................................................                77.32001................................................                31.4------------------------------------------------------------------------       Defense Economic Adjustment appropriations have been      allocated among EDA's six (6) regional offices based on a      variety of factors, including the number of major      installation closures located within the regional office's      designated region, the number of military and civilian      personnel dislocations resulting from base realignments, the      number of affected defense installation contractors (not      relevant to the current round), and the relative economic      distress level of the affected area.       Each fiscal year, EDA's regional offices have awarded      assistance to BRAC-affected communities based on the policies      and procedures in place at the time of each award. These      policies and procedures are published in the Federal Register      each year in EDA's Federal Funding Opportunity (``FFO'')      notice. The FFO also specifies EDA's Funding Priorities for      the funding available during that fiscal year. Funding      Priorities include such items as investing in transportation,      communications, or other sector-specific infrastructure      enhancements. In no instance has any one funding priority      utilized all of a regional office's defense economic      adjustment allocation. Rather, investments are made across      different priority areas based on the needs of the local and      regional economy.       EDA Defense Economic Adjustment investments made during the      most recent BRAC round, covering the period from FY 1994      through FY 2001, are depicted in the enclosed tables. As      requested, the tables include the investment recipient,      location, EDA grant dollars, and jobs and private investment      realized when available.       Thank you for this opportunity to explain EDA's mission and      its policies and procedures related to BRAC, and to provide      additional information on EDA's past BRAC-related      investments.       If you have any additional questions, please do not      hesitate to contact David T. Murray, EDA's Director of      Intergovernmental Affairs, at (202) 482-2900.           Sincerely,                                                 Benjamin Erulkar,                                                    Chief Counsel.
