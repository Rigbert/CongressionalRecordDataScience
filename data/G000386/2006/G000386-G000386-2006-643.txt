 President, I was saddened to learn of the sudden passing of Forest City Chief of Police Douglas ``Doug'' Book on January 13. Doug leaves behind a remarkable career in law enforcement that spans over three decades. He has had an immense impact not only in his community of Forest City but throughout the entire State of Iowa.  Doug Book began his career as a full-time patrolman in 1968 and quickly rose amongst the ranks of his department until he was appointed chief of police in 1973. He served faithfully in this capacity until his passing. In addition to his dedicated service to his community, Doug also served Iowa as the head of the North Central Iowa Narcotics Task Force for the past 10 years. Doug also served as chairman of the Iowa Law Enforcement Academy Board and as president of the Iowa Association of Chiefs of Police and Peace Officers.  Doug's constant support and guidance for his fellow officers did not stop at Iowa's borders but spilled over to other departments in New York City. Chief Book joined a group of Iowa police officers as part of a critical incident stress management team that helped New York City police officers cope with the aftermath of the September 11 terrorist attacks.  One of Doug's colleagues described him simply as a ``good guy, a good cop, and a good friend.'' His friends and family should be very proud of what he has done for so many people. Chief Book's devotion, hard work, and dedication to duty will be sorely missed.                          ____________________
