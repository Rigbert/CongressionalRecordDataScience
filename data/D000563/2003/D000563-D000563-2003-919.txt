' We provided these      privileged documents to the Committee in order to respond      fully to the Committee's request and to expedite the      confirmation process.  In response to my friend, the point I am making is they did not draw the same absolute line being drawn by theBush White House for Miguel Estrada. They disclosed information which reflected purely internal deliberations and the work product of attorneys and confidential legal advice and did it in the spirit of cooperation. They drew a line, but the line was on the side of disclosure. The line drawn by the Bush White House for Estrada is on the side of concealment, the refusal to disclose this information.
