Boris Nemtsov.  Tragically, Mr. Nemtsov was gunned down Friday night as he walked across the Bolshoi Moskvoretsky Bridge with his girlfriend, just yards from the Kremlin and Red Square in central Moscow. Hours before his death, he had given a radio interview where he criticized Russian President Putin for his aggression in Ukraine and Russia's own economic woes--brave acts in a nation where criticism of Putin is not tolerated.  Mr. Nemtsov has been one of the most vocal and highest profile opposition leaders in recent years, tirelessly speaking up for democratic reforms and rights on behalf of the Russian people. In fact, Mr. Nemtsov has been working on behalf of the Russian people for nearly 30 years.  He moved from physics into politics shortly after the Chernobyl disaster in 1986, first winning a seat in the Russian Parliament in 1990. After a series of successful economic reforms as a Parliamentarian and later Governor, Nemtsov was then appointed Deputy Prime Minister under the first President of the Russian Federation, Boris Yeltsin, and even had a chance at the Presidency himself. However, he returned to Parliament after the 1998 crash of the Russian stock market until 2004. Since then, he was active in everything from politics to banking, and over the years he raised repeated concerns that Putin's policies were rolling back democracy and civic freedoms in Russia. Mr. Nemtsov had been arrested several times--and complained of official harassment--for his participation in demonstrations in support of reforms to end corruption, uphold the rule of law, and support basic freedoms.  It is no surprise that tens of thousands of people showed up this Sunday to a rally in Moscow. Originally scheduled to lead the event himself to oppose Russian aggression in Ukraine, the rally turned into an opportunity for members of the opposition movement to mourn Mr. Nemtsov's death. People held images of Mr. Nemtsov, flew flags, and even held up posters and signs with phrases such as: ``I am not afraid.''  Several thousand also showed up to his funeral Tuesday. Mr. Nemtsov's mother Dina Eidman received all the well-wishers. In recent months, she had reportedly shared her fears that her son may be killed for his criticism of President Putin.  Under President Putin there has been a troubling pattern of silencing peaceful dissent--a problem no doubt made worse by the deliberate whipping up of nationalistic fervor in recent months around Putin's invasion of eastern Ukraine.  We recall the tragic death in prison of Russian human rights lawyer Sergei Magnitsky, jailed for uncovering hundreds of millions of dollars in tax fraud perpetuated by Russian officials in 2009. Mr. Nemtsov had even visited Washington, DC, in 2010 to support the Magnitsky Act.  Some of you may know of Natalya Estemirova or Anna Politkovskaya, two Russian human rights activists and journalists who were outspoken about human rights abuses in Chechnya, and murdered in 2009 and 2006, respectively. There was also the 2006 poisoning in London of Alexander Litvinenko, an FSB officer who defected and made several claims of corruption against Russian law enforcement officials. Incredulously, one of those suspected for his murder by British authorities was later elected to the Russian Parliament. Sadly, the list goes on.  More recently, the nationalistic passions unleashed by the annexation of Crimea and Sevastopol last year has led to more narrowing of free speech and the marginalization of activists. Many have faced harassment, prison sentences, even violence. And in many of these types of cases, perpetrators are not brought to justice. In a country where authorities may sometimes be involved in crimes of their own and where law enforcement, judicial, and investigative bodies lack credibility, there is very little accountability.  What has been happening in eastern Ukraine and Russia is deeply troubling. President Putin has used the invasion of Ukraine to justify a further crackdown on his own people's talents and aspirations. He has used state-controlled media to unleash anti-Western propaganda that is an insult to the Russia people. He has bet his people's economic and international standing on the pursuit and protection of his own kleptocracy. The Russian people deserve better.  In the case of Mr. Nemtsov, I echo the words of President Obama and countless others: an independent investigation must take place to find out who was responsible for Mr. Nemtsov's death, and the perpetrators must be swiftly brought to justice. The same goes for the many others who had the courage to peacefully report the truth or voice dissent in Russia and then found themselves in jail or murdered.  I joined Senator Johnson this week in leading a resolution recognizing Boris Nemtsov and calling for an investigation. I urge my colleagues to support this hero who has been taken from us too soon, and I hope we can continue to work in his honor to support the Russian people as they stand for democratic reforms.                          ____________________
