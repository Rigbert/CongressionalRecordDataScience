President, I rise in opposition to the amendment. I have serious concerns about our current trade relations with China. Last year, our merchandise trade deficit with China grew to $39.5 billion, which is an increase of more than 213 percent over the past 5 years. This year, our trade deficit with China is expected to reach $50 billion.  It is clear that, in many cases, goods from the United States are locked out of China's markets, while goods from China are allowed to enter United States markets at nondiscriminatory tariff rates. Last year, the United States imported $51.5 billion in goods from China, while China imported only $12 billion in goods from the United States. More than one-third of China's exports are sold to the United States, while only 2 percent of total United States exports are sold to China.
