 President, I apologize to Chairman Levin. I had to leave the floor to attend a conference meeting on the stimulus bill before he finished his remarks.  I would like to rebut his remarks regarding Mr. Bill Lynn.  In regards to the Executive order on ethics, I agree President Obama is attempting to set high standards for executive branch appointees; however, giving special waivers to nominees such as Mr. Lynn water down the spirit and authority of his own Executive order. I would ask President Obama: How many more waivers will you grant in the next 4 years?  I say to Chairman Levin, you seemed to blame former Defense Secretary Cohen for the financial troubles at DOD, not Mr. Lynn. I could not disagree with you more on this issue. Chief Financial Officer Lynn was chiefly responsible for the policies and regulations governing accounting practices. His straight-pay policy went against all commonsense accounting practices. DFAS technicians should not have paid bills like they did without first confirming that the proper obligations were in the books of account.  Mr. President, I yield the floor and suggest the absence of a quorum.
