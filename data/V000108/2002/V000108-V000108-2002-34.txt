Speaker, it is my distinct pleasure to congratulate the Southlake Center for Mental Health located in Lake County, Indiana as it celebrates its 25 anniversary this month. The Southlake Center for Mental Health will commemorate its 25 years of dedicated service to the communities of Northwest Indiana at a gala celebration to be held at Villa Cesare in Schererville, Indiana. The celebration will serve as an opportunity for the Southlake Center for Mental Health to reaffirm its commitment to excellence in mental health services to every individual in Merrillville, Hobart, Crown Point and the surrounding, communities.  The Southlake Center for Mental Health was conceived early in 1975. In July, 1977, the Southlake Center began operations, initially offering outpatient, consultation and education services in leased facilities. By working together with community leaders and educating the public about community mental health care, the main center at 8555 Taft Street opened in Merrillville in 1979 on a 10-acre tract of land.  During the past two decades, the Southlake Center for Mental Health has continued to grow and change, reflecting the needs of the communities while remaining committed to the highest caliber of mental health care. To those in need of mental health care, there is nothing more precious. During the past 25 years, the Southlake Center for Mental Health has been a beacon of hope in Northwest Indiana, providing community based mental health and addiction treatment services to more than 40,000 individuals.  In its 25 years of existence, the Southlake Center for Mental Health has had the support of several residents and leaders in the community. One such tireless leader and advocate for mental health care is Lee Strawhun. Lee is a dreamer, a visionary and a hard working realist. His involvement in the lives of the people of Northwest Indiana is genuine, compassionate and committed. As the President andCEO of the Southlake Center for Mental Health, Lee has steered the center through obstacles, growth and so much more. In addition to Lee's devotion, the members of the Southlake Center for Mental Health Board of Directors have played a vital role in assuring that the organization is one of the best community based behavioral healthcare organization in the state. Members of the Board of Directors include: Ronald Borto, Chairman; Mary Beth Bonaventura; Harold Foster; Drew Furuness; Edmund Gunn; Charles Kleinschmidt; Donald Levinson; James McShane, 111; C. Robert Onda; Patricia Schaadt; and Larry Shaver. Additionally, this 25th anniversary celebration would not be possible without the continued dedication of the entire staff at the center, specifically, Dr. Cheryl Morgavan, Dr. Les Schiller and Valerie Madvek, who are also celebrating 25 years with the Southlake Center.  Mr. Speaker, I ask you and my other distinguished colleagues to join me in commending the administrators, health care professionals, and other individuals who, over the years, have contributed to the Southlake Center for Mental Health's success in achieving its standard of excellence. Their hard work has improved the quality of life for everyone in Indiana's First Congressional District.                          ____________________
