Mr. Speaker, the aging of the Baby Boom generation has been extensively discussed in Congress and among the American people, with particular attention to the impact on Social Security and Medicare.  What has not been widely discussed, however, is a related but very distinct trend: the rapid expansion of the group of Americans defined by the Bureau of the Census as ``the oldest old''--those senior citizens aged 85 and above. Often lost during discussions of the Baby Boom generation is the fact that the fastest growing demographic age group in the United States is the ``oldest old.''  That is why I am introducing legislation, joined by my colleagues Phil English (PA), Ron Paul (TX), John Ensign (NV), and Chris Shays (CT) to help Americans better prepare themselves and their families for their long term health care needs of the future. The tax breaks contained in this legislation will go a long way towards providing families with peace and security against the massive costs of professionally provided long term care, including nursing home care, home health care, and adult day care services.  I am pleased that this legislation has already secured the support of the 60 Plus Association and the Home Health Assembly of New Jersey. The Health Insurance Association of America (HIAA) has also endorsed the concept behind the bill.  Our Nation will soon be grappling with a long term care crisis unless Congress acts now to prevent it. From 1960 through 1994, the senior citizen population (age 85+) increased by 274 percent. And the number of Americans in the 85+ age cohort is expected to double in size by the year 2020, reaching 7 million. The number of senior citizens between the ages of 75 and 84 will reach nearly 15.5 million by 2020. The sixty four thousand dollar question is: how will we as a nation meet our parents' and grandparents' long-term care need?  This demographic change will put an enormous strain on our nation's fragmented system of long-term care. Already, our Medicaid program has demonstrated its financial shortcomings when providing long-term care services to increasing numbers of the frail elderly. The Medicaid program already spends over $40 billion on long term care services for senior citizens. These expenditures are projected to double over the next 10 years.  A vital part of any comprehensive response to these trends must be the promotion of private long term care insurance (LTC) for Americans. Although the number of persons insured under LTC policies has nearly doubled between 1992 and 1996, this growth is from a very low base. The fact of the matter is that the overwhelming majority of Americans still do not have any private LTC insurance coverage at all. This needs to change, and soon.  Mr. Speaker, the Long Term Care Advancement Act of 1998 will assist Americans prepare for their future long term care needs. My bill will allow penalty-free withdrawal from IRAs and 401 (k) plans when the funds are used to pay for `qualified' LTC insurance premiums (as defined by the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act of 1996).  In addition, a certain portion of the IRA/401 (k) withdrawals used for LTC will be excluded from taxable income. Depending on one's tax bracket, age, and type of policy purchased, the savings on a long term care insurance policy under my bill are considerable, and could range from 15 to 25 percent.  Lastly, the Long Term Care Advancement Act will provide a refundable $500 tax credit for families caring for a dependent elderlyspouse or parent in the home. This tax credit is important because most of the long term care provided in America is provided by families in the home, and these families desperately need and deserve tax relief.  By encouraging more Americans to plan for their future care needs I believe we can improve the medical, social, and financial well being of families, as well as provide substantial future savings to the Medicaid and Medicare programs. According to the John Hancock Mutual Life Insurance Company, there is a 48% chance of any given individual of needing long term care in one's lifetime. And the costs of nursing home care for one year is approximately $40,000. The potential for savings to American families, as well as the Medicaid and Medicare programs, by encouraging families to purchase LTC insurance is simply enormous.  I look forward to working on and discussing long term care issues with my colleagues during the remainder of the 105th Congress, and urge all of my colleagues to support this important initiative.                          ____________________
