 Just in response to the gentleman, if he had been listening, he might have heard the gentleman from Texas listing bases in Texas which are going to lose funds for critical military construction projects, yet he launches off into some fantasy about Iraq--I didn't even quite get that part--and also that we are proposing open borders. I am not aware of anyone on this side of the aisle who is proposing open borders.                              {time}  1300  We are proposing effective, 21st century border security at the real threats to America, like drug importation through our legal ports of entry and maritime drug imports that we can't intercept because we don't have the resources, and we are wasting money on a stupid, static wall.  Madam Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the gentlewoman from California (Ms. Barragan).
