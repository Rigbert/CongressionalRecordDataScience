 President, I love to hear the Senator speak. If the two-speech rule applied to this place, I imagine we would have only one or two Senators who ever spoke. I will be delighted to hear him again.  I would like to make several points to him, and I will not take long. I would like to ask him a question, if I may.  If I may ask the Senator from Mississippi, is it his--I realize there is no unanimous consent in any of this--but just as he postulated what he hoped would happen in terms of procedure here this afternoon, is it the Senator's intention that, if his motion to recommit fails, that we would go then to a vote up or down on the nominee?
