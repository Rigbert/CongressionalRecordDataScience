President, we have talked about the budget. I have listened to the distinguished majority leader. I am absolutely convinced that if the distinguished Republican leader and the distinguished Democrat leader in this body could sit down with the President that we could reach those areas of compromise.  We have to understand that no matter what the issue is here, when there are many, many differing views, that nobody wins totally. We do not pass a Gingrich budget or a Dole budget or a Daschle budget, a Clinton budget or a Leahy budget, but we can pass a budget for this country and one that will bring us to a balanced budget but will also allow at least bipartisan cooperation on issues like education, environment, medical care for the elderly, and so forth.  I was concerned in the other body when I hear some say, ``Well, let's lock everybody in a room and throw the key away until this is settled.'' I say to those same people, why did you not stay here last weekend and do it? Why did you not stay and turn the key on your own doors and stay here?  They are claiming over there in the other body that this is for a more efficient Government. This is the least efficient way to run a government, let alone a business--send everybody home so no work is being done, but then people are being told they will be paid for their lost time. They should be paid because it was not through their fault, but the American taxpayer is not being paid for lost services.  These Federal workers want to go back to work, they want to help run   this country, they want to process the passport claims and the veterans claims and everything else. They cannot understand why we will not make it possible.  Frankly, I think some Members of Congress ought to be asked--those who feel we should lock up the leadership and the President--ought to be asked, why did you leave last weekend? Did you go home for a Christmas vacation? Did the taxpayers pay for your airplane fares home? Of course they did. Did the taxpayers pay for your salary while you were home making political speeches? Of course they did.  Then they also ought to be asked: Do you not think it would have been better to stay and get the country back to work, get the Government back to work, and stop these shenanigans?  As I said before, I have been in negotiations, some very tough negotiations, with the distinguished majority leader and the distinguished Democratic leader. I know them both to be Senators of great honor and great ability. I am willing to rely on them to negotiate with the President of the United States and get us out of this. I hope it can be done.                          ____________________
