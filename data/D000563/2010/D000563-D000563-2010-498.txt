They have been asked to make the package smaller, which they did. They have been asked to pay for portions of the package, which they did. And still Republicans continue to filibuster and stop this bill.  What the Senator from Kentucky wants to do would be virtually unprecedented, that we would pay for the emergency spending for unemployment compensation by removing money from our jobs program, the stimulus program. So he is going to kill jobs on one side to pay for the unemployed on the other side. It makes no sense economically and it is certainly not within the tradition of the Senate, and I object.
