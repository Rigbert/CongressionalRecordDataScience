 It has not improved the substance of the Smith amendment--the time. It is essentially, as the Senator from New Hampshire indicated, similar to the Craig amendment; very little difference. I urge my colleagues to recall how they voted on the Craig amendment, and the same rationale applies with regard to the Smith amendment.  I hope when we get to the vote--which I hope is very shortly--that we will vote no on the Smith amendment.  I yield the floor.
