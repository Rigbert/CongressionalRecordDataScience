President, the Height of Land in Maine's Rangeley Lakes Region is a crown jewel among my State's abundant natural treasures. The panorama of lakes and mountains, streams and valleys, offered by this lofty perch in the Western Mountains, is among the most spectacular sights in New England.  I rise today to congratulate a remarkable group of local citizens, the Rangeley Lakes Heritage Trust, for their hard work and commitment over more than 2 decades to protect and preserve this extraordinary place and to make it accessible to all. The Height of Land Overlook on the Rangeley Lakes National Scenic Byway, officially dedicated on July 15, 2012, demonstrates the great partnership they have formed with State and Federal Government, conservation organizations, businesses, and neighbors to achieve lasting accomplishments.  Since the Rangeley Lakes Heritage Trust was formed in 1991, it has conserved more than 12,800 acres of land, including 45 miles of lake and river frontage, 15 islands, and the commanding 2,443-foot Bald Mountain, so that these features might be accessed and enjoyed by residents and visitors forever. The Height of Land Overlook has converted a narrow and dangerous corridor into a spacious, safe, and welcoming place for inspiration and reflection.  To complete this outstanding project, the Rangeley Lakes Heritage Trust brought together a wide range of people and organizations into a common cause. It overcame the boundaries between towns, bridged the divide between government agencies, and worked collaboratively with the private sector. The commitment by the Maine Department of Transportation is especially commendable.  In 2009, I was pleased to help secure $2.9 million in U.S. Department of Transportation funding for this important project. It is essential that the Federal Government be a strong member of partnerships to preserve our natural treasures, enhance recreation, promote economic growth, and help protect the environment. The Height of Land Overlook and the conservation walk that will be completed next spring will help make this area a national destination.  Sir Edmund Hillary said that, ``People do not decide to become extraordinary. They decide to accomplish extraordinary things.'' Like that famous mountaineer, the citizens who came together to establish the Rangeley Lakes Heritage Trust had a lofty goal. They not only reached the summit, they went far beyond. Their amazing success speaks volumes about the commitment that the people of Maine have to preserve our special places and to share them with all Americans.                          ____________________
