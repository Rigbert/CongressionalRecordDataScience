President, I have been working with the Senator from Idaho, and I think we have reached an agreement on this, in which we provide language that says if a person who comes to the United States on a non-immigrant visa is in possession of a hunting license or permit lawfully issued within the United States, they then would not be covered by the provisions of this law. That is consistent with the original language of the amendment.  At this point, I yield to the Senator from Idaho.
