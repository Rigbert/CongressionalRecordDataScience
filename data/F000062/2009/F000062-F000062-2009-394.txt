 President, today I am pleased to join with Senators Specter and Feingold in introducing the Equal Justice for U.S. Service Members Act. The Act would eliminate an inequity in current law by allowing all court-martialed U.S. servicemembers who face dismissal, discharge or confinement for a year or more to petition the United States Supreme Court for discretionary review through a writ of certiorari.  The bill is a simple one, and would do the following: allow a writ of certiorari to be filed in any case in which the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Armed Forces has denied review; and allow a writ of certiorari to be filed in any case in which the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Armed Forces denied a petition for extraordinary relief.  In our civilian courts today, all person convicted of a crime, if they lose on appeal, have a right to petition the U.S. Supreme Court for discretionary review. Even enemy combatants have the right to direct appellate review in the Supreme Court.  In contrast, however, our men and women in uniform do not share this same right. Our military personnel can apply to the U.S. Supreme Court only if the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Armed Forces actually conducts a review of their case or grants a petition for extraordinary relief. That only happens about 10 percent of the time.  In other words, in 90 percent of their case, our U.S. servicemembers are prevented from ever seeking or obtaining direct review from the Supreme Court.  This disparity is not limited to our civilian and military court systems. A similar disparity exists within our military court system relief. The Government routinely has the chance to petition the Supreme Court for review of adverse court-martial rulings in any case where the charges are severe enough to make a punitive discharge possible. But our military personnel do not share the same rights to petition the Supreme Court as the military prosecutors on the other side of the aisle.  This is wrong, and this inequity was recently noted by the American Bar Association, which passed a resolution calling on Congress on fix this long-standing ``disparity in our laws governing procedural due process.''  Every day, our U.S. service personnel place their lives on the line in defense of American rights. It is unacceptable for us to continue to routinely deprive our men and women in uniform one of those rights--the ability to petition their Nation's highest court for direct relief. It is a right given to common criminals in our civilian courts, to the Government, and even to some of the terrorists who we hope to prosecute as war criminals.  The bill is supported by the American Bar Association, the Military Officers Association of America, and the National Institute of Military Justice. Robinson Everett, the former Chief Judge of the U.S. Court of Military Appeals, the predecessor to the Court of Appeals for the Armed Forces, also supports the bill.  It's long past time we give them the same rights as the American citizens they fight, and sometimes die, to protect.  I urge my colleagues to support this important legislation to give equal justice to our U.S. servicemembers.  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be printed in the Record.  There being no objection, the text of the bill was ordered to be printed in the Record, as follows:                                 S. 357       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of      the United States of America in Congress assembled,     SECTION 1.
