 BENNETT. I would like to obtain the floor in my own right at some point, but I make a comment to the Senator from Kentucky and ask him if he would like at this point with respect to the 126 scholars that have been mentioned up until now--I will wait until I have the floor.  Mr. McCAIN. I think this kind of debate we need to engage in. I think this is important. I think the Congressional Record needs to be made and I look forward to more of this kind of debate and discussion because this is really the heart of the matter. I thank the Senator from Kentucky for raising this particular issue because this seems to be one of the major, if not the major, areas that need to be discussed.  Thank you.  Mr. McCONNELL. I believe I still have the floor.  I agree with the Senator from Arizona. I think this is the heart of the current version of McCain-Feingold, and certainly does need to be adequately vented.  I see the Senator from Wisconsin was interested in getting into the discussion.
