Mr. Speaker, I yield such time as she may consume to the gentlewoman from Georgia [Ms. McKinney].  (Ms. McKINNEY asked and was given permission to revise and extend her remarks.)  Ms. McKINNEY. Mr. Speaker, I rise in opposition to this section. This rule would require a three-fifths majority to pass any legislation raising income tax rates. This rule flies in the face of the Constitution. It will only strengthen the ability of special interest lobbies to paralyze this Nation.  Let us be clear that this rule would only govern taxes on earned income. Income taxes are progressive taxes. Republicans do not propose a three-fifths requirement to change the tax rate for capital gains. Republicans do not propose a three-fifths majority to create tax shelters for tax avoiders. Republicans do not propose a three-fifths requirement to increase deficit spending or raise the national debt.  This is one more gimmick. Its a gimmick that will spawn more gimmicks. Its a gimmick that will undermine the constitutional provisions for majority rule in the House of Representatives.  I urge my colleagues to respect the pledge they made to uphold the Constitution. Don't give in to gimmicks.
