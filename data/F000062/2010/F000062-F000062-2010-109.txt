 President, I rise in support of the education provisions in the reconciliation legislation that reforms Federal student loan programs and will help our Nation's neediest students afford college by providing $35.5 billion for the critical Pell grant program.  Nearly 700,000 students in California right now receive Pell grants of up to $5,550 out of over 8 million students nationwide. The majority of these students come from families where the average income is less than $40,000.  The Pell grant funds in the bill will help prevent cuts to students' grants of up to 60 percent and prevent nearly 600,000 students from losing their grant entirely.  It will also help 63,000 more students in California receive a Pell grant so they can afford to go to college during this tough economic time.  Specifically, the legislation will allow the current Federal Direct LoanProgram, backed by the U.S. Treasury, to be the sole originator of all federal student loans; save $61 billion over 10 years by eliminating the Federal Family Education Loan Program, FFELP, which provides unnecessary subsidies to private lenders and banks for originating student loans.  Of the $61 billion in savings, it directs $10 billion to help reduce the Federal deficit, and the remainder towards important education programs, such as $35.5 billion for Pell grants to help students afford college; direct $22.5 billion of the total $35.5 billion in new Pell Grant funds to increase the maximum award amount--from the current $5,550 to about $6,000 to help with rising college costs.  The economic downturn has resulted in increased enrollment at colleges and universities, and increased eligibility in Federal student aid, with the number of Pell grant recipients increasing by 1 million students in the past two years alone.  In my home state of California, these important provisions are supported by the University of California, UC, California State University, CSU, and California's public community college system--which together serve approximately 500,000 Pell grant students.  I urge my colleagues to support these provisions that are critically important to our Nation's students.                              puerto rico
