Chair, I hate to disagree with the chairman of our subcommittee. But let me just say that the amendment actually reads: ``None of the funds made available by this act may be used to revoke funding previously awarded.''  ``None of the funds.'' That means there can be no oversight. If criminal activity is occurring, none of the funds may be used to revoke funding previously awarded.  What kind of an amendment is this? This is a very irresponsible amendment, and it shouldn't be on this bill. If the gentleman has got some problem down there he wants to solve, we will be happy to work with him on that on. But I think to tie the hands of our government in making sure that every taxpayer dollar is properly managed and has oversight is really wrongheaded.  Again, I urge my colleagues to vote ``no'' on the Pittenger amendment.  Mr. Chair, I yield back the balance of my time.  The Acting CHAIR. The question is on the amendment offered by the gentleman from North Carolina (Mr. Pittenger).  The question was taken; and the Acting Chair announced that the ayes appeared to have it.
