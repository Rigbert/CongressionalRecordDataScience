Speaker, I thank the gentleman for yielding.  For some reason, long ago, sometime when I was very young, I became aware of the Salton Sea and became kind of fascinated with this inland body of water created by a manmade engineering mistake and had been saddened in later life to see its incredible degradation, and in particular the highly publicized die-off of large numbers of migratory birds.  This is a very prime stopping point for migratory birds, so not only would it be a tremendous resource for the people of southern California in terms of its recreational values and environmental values, but also for migratory birds and things that would benefit all of us in the United States by having it appropriately restored to health.  That being said, we have a common objective. The problem here is the process. And I have got to say that I am a bit puzzled by recent actions in the committee on which I have served now for more than 11 years, formerly called the Interior Committee and formerly called Natural Resources, now called Resources. And I guess therein lies the rub. The current chairman removed the word ``natural'' from the title because he took some offense to that, and things have been a little bit weird ever since.  That is what is going on here today. We are considering a number of bills tomorrow in the Subcommittee on Water and Power that have some merit in terms of turning over reclamation projects to local districts, but the chairman of the subcommittee is going to insist on environmental waivers, which the President has promised will bring about vetoes on all of those, no matter what merit they might have.  I have the same problem with this legislation before us. Why not work out the differences with the administration?  I know that the majority does not like the reality of Bill Clinton in the White House. There are some days I do not like the reality of Bill Clinton in the White House. Other days it is okay.  The point is, it is a reality, and we have a lengthy statement of administration policy here which is pretty definitive. There are some problems we have to work out. Why not work out these problems and achieve our common objective, which is to clean up the Salton Sea?  I think that this was a great dream of our deceased member, and I fully am supportive of that dream. I would love to see it come to fruition in my lifetime, and I would like to see it happen without a lot of unnecessary delay, but there are substantive concerns here.  I am pleased to hear from the previous speaker that they are going to drop the proposal that the money comeout of the Land and Water Conservation Funds. That would have been an unprecedented expenditure, and that is fine. I am happy to find the money elsewhere in the budget. I can come up with some budgetary offsets to fund this, if it costs $350 million or half a billion or less. I do not know what it is going to cost, because the other concern here is I do not know that we know the solution at this point in time.  From what I heard in the committee and in the deliberations in the committee, we are not quite certain of how we are going to go forward, what technology or which one of these methods will work, what exactly are all the interrelationships between the salinity and the other pollution problems, the bird die-offs. None of this is totally explicable.  I do not think that the Miller bill is being offered in the spirit of trying to delay the cleanup. It is not being offered because of some sort of pride of authorship. It is a genuine attempt to get this thing done this year by this Congress and move it forward so that we can all live to see the cleanup of the Salton Sea. That is what is going on here.  These are not insignificant concerns. There is probably a constitutional problem with the way this bill is being written by the manager's amendment to require that the committees of jurisdiction basically sign off on the final project, and the Secretary would be subject to a resolution of the committees, not of the entire Congress.  I have been down that road with other legislation. That does not stand up to scrutiny. If some obstructive person wants to sue, they can delay this thing for years just because of that provision. Why have that provision? We could have an expedited congressional review. There are other ways to get around that problem. It just seems that that was done in haste and perhaps out of a desire to get this done, but I think it is a problem.  The Clean Water Act exemption, that is a problem. It is a problem with the administration. It is a problem with some Members on this side.  Limitations on liability, that should lie with both sides of the aisle. We do not want to expose the Federal taxpayers to have them assume new liabilities that they do not currently have when there are other responsible authorities who should share in any future liability that might arise.  Cost sharing, irrigators benefit. Irrigators are a big part of the problem in terms of the increased salinity in the chemical soup we are dealing with here. Why should not they have some cost sharing if they are going to continue to benefit and will doubly benefit by an improved and cleaner Salton Sea? There are a number of other minor provisions that are of concern.                              {time}  1800  But I rise out of a genuine concern that we do something significant here today, not just something symbolic, something that actually will be enacted into law.  Too many times that I have been here, both with my own party in charge and now with the Republicans in charge, we do things for the day or for the moment or to say we passed them out of the House of Representatives. Does not do us a lot of good if they do not get through the United States Senate and they do not get signed by the President of the United States. And a number of the problems that I am pointing out here that are addressed by the Miller substitute are problems that are going to cause problems in the other body and are going to cause big problems downtown.  So I would just urge us to move ahead deliberately with what I believe is probably the intent of all Members of this body, and that is to get this job done as expeditiously as possible and honor the memory of our diseased colleague.
