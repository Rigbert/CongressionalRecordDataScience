 President, Senator Coburn forgot to mention one point when talking about the increase in VA funding. He forgot to mention that we were in two wars.  He forgot to mention that 500,000 men and women came back from Iraq and Afghanistan with posttraumatic stress disorder and TBI, not to mention the loss of legs, the loss of arms, eyesight and hearing.  He forgot to mention that many of the veterans from World War II, Korea, and Vietnam are getting older and need more detailed care.  So I think it is important that we put $5 billion into the VA to provide the doctors, the nurses, the personnel they need, so that the veterans can get into the VA and have quality and timely care. That is what this legislation is about.  I ask for the yeas and nays.
