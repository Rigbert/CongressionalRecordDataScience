 Mr. President, I rise to again state my opposition to the BRAC amendment as it is proposed. Let's get it clear. I understand that my colleagues who are offering this amendment are very sincere in their efforts to address the problem of an excess infrastructure, certainly within the Department of Defense.  Let me be absolutely clear that I agree with the assertion that there isexcess infrastructure. I have no quarrel with that. But let me be equally clear that until I am confident we can focus the BRAC where there is excess infrastructure and until we can ensure that any savings from such a BRAC--a lot has been said about the savings--will go toward modernization, or readiness, or procurement, as opposed to funding the numerous expeditions this administration continues to assign our military, such as Bosnia and Kosovo, I can't support any additional rounds of BRAC at this time.  Let me explain in a little bit more detail. ``They'' all understand that there is too much infrastructure for the current force strength. ``They'' know they need to act to reduce it. But the political costs are too high, and ``they'' know the blame for not having another BRAC can be easily passed off to others. We heard a lot of talk about ``they'' from the proponents of BRAC. Unfortunately, the readiness of our Armed Forces suffers because ``they'' are unwilling to act. I would like to get to the definition of who ``they'' are.  Most people who follow the excess military infrastructure issue--the BRAC issue, if you will--would say that ``they'' are the U.S. Congress. Senator after Senator has come to the floor with not really arms waving, but with some pretty tough commentary, pointing the finger at the Congress as being ``they.'' However, let me also point out that a strong case can be made that ``they'' are also the civilian and uniformed leadership of the Department of Defense.  I am not trying to pick on anybody. I just want to share the responsibility in a fair way. Of course the Congress must approve the additional funds of BRAC, and therefore the responsibility is clearly on the shoulders of the Senate and the House. I accept that responsibility. The distinguished Presiding Officer does as well. Every Member of the Senate Armed Services Committee and the comparable committee in the House does as well. But the leadership of DOD has not shouldered the responsibility, in my personal opinion, to adequately prepare for future BRAC rounds. They could, by requiring each service to develop a prioritized listing of bases and facilities that are in excess, or the generic description of same, more especially in regards to the mission of the base.  I know what they are going to say. Their defense is such as, that would be impossible because of the politics of it; it would bias any future BRAC rounds, and therefore they should not be done until a BRAC is authorized.  By ``they'' I am talking about the DOD. ``They'' in this particular instance further state that it would be impractical to categorize the facilities by mission since most facilities are multifunctional, and therefore any future BRAC should, as in theory they have in the past, include all military facilities regarding the BRAC criteria.  If we are talking about BRAC, everybody is going to be on the same criteria. Everybody is on the table.  Of course, most bases and facilities are multifunctional. After all, they all train, they all have administrative functions, they all have public works tasks, but they all have a clear, primary mission.  Additionally, it is a bit disingenuous for the Department of Defense to say that all bases would be included, all are on the chopping block for consideration in any future BRAC round. That is rather disingenuous it seems to me, even if, for example, the service academies would be on the table, or the Norfolk Naval Base, or Andrews Air Force Base, or Fort Hood, or Camp Pendleton were on the table for BRAC consideration. That is not reasonable. That is not going to happen. It is not reasonable to expect that those, or other key facilities where we must have a primary mission, would be seriously considered for closure or for realignment.  It is not unreasonable to expect that a similar listing of definable excess capacity could and should be developed and be the focus of future reductions of infrastructure rather than, as I have said, before the ``everything is on the table'' approach in regard to BRAC.  Many of my colleagues have heard me voice my concern over what I call ``BRAC purgatory.'' That is, quite simply, what every city in America with a military facility goes through every time a BRAC round is mentioned. What that means in real terms is that the city or the community involved spends a lot of money from their very limited budget to hire so-called ``experts'' or ``consultants'' to help to really protect their base from any future BRAC round.  If we can focus BRAC on the primary mission of bases and generically define what we need, and what we don't need, we will spare many communities from ``BRAC purgatory.'' We will let them off the BRAC hook if their facility is not on the excess infrastructure list. We are going to save a lot of communities from ``BRAC purgatory,'' and we are going to save a lot of headaches and a lot of money.  I am equally concerned that the Department has failed to develop a strategy for the next round of BRAC. Let me emphasize ``strategy.'' You just can't go to a BRAC and put bases on the chopping block. A specific infrastructure strategy is required for at least three reasons.  First, as the military approaches the optimum infrastructure, great care is going to have to be made. It will be required to prevent the cutting of the essential infrastructures.  Second, since the military missions and roles are changing --and, boy, are they changing; for example, the Air Force sees itself becoming an expeditionary force rather than a garrison force, and that is happening; the Army, Navy, and Marine Corps are all searching for a new mission and a new role--I think the Department of Defense-wide assessment of the types and the number and the location of the military facilities needed to support the national strategy must be developed. There must be a strategy there.  Third, both the Quadrennial Defense Review and the National Defense Panel strongly recommended consolidation and joint basing for the military to optimize their capability in an atmosphere of reduced budgets and reduced force structure military environment.  In isolation, each of those three requirements represents a difficult, a complex, and a contentious undertaking within the military and the Department of Defense. However, when taken as a collective mandate to shape the future infrastructure needs of the military, such an important imperative cannot possibly be accomplished within the guidelines of just a simple BRAC. It seems to me that the Department of Defense has to have the courage and will to oversee the services and direct actions be taken that would set the correct approach to reducing our excessive infrastructure to match our future military strategy. They should do that--not a BRAC commission.  The third action that DOD must find the will to take is defining the savings associated with BRAC and establishing a way to funnel those moneys into readiness, modernization, or the procurement or quality-of-life programs. In the April 1998 Department of Defense report on BRAC, they admitted that, ``by their very nature, estimates of savings are subject to some uncertainty.'' That is probably the understatement of this debate. The Department further stated that, ``No audit trail, single document, or budget account exists for tracking the end use of each dollar saved through BRAC.''  Let me repeat that. Senator after Senator has come to the floor and said: Look at the money we are going to save in regard to BRAC. Then they look at the problems with modernization, and procurement, and readiness. Yet no audit trail, no single document, no budget account exists for tracking the end use of each dollar saved through BRAC. However, they assured Congress that, ``The Department is committed to improve its estimates of costs and savings in future rounds of BRAC.'' ``Oh, we are going to get it right next time.''  It seems to me it takes courage to solve that problem, and it takes a dedicated effort to set up the processes to track and direct the BRAC savings into the promised accounts. And it will take more than a ``trust me, it will be much better next time'' assurance before many Members of Congress will let the reported savings, the estimated savings, the reported savings of another round of BRAC simply remain unaccounted for, be lost in the bookkeeping of the Department of Defense, or, in fact, if there are savings, if we can account for savings, they end up in suchmissions as Kosovo or Bosnia--which have to be funded, by the way, and which we addressed in regard to emergency funding.  That is the proper way to fund the final act of courage on the part of the uniformed and civilian leadership of DOD--I use the word ``courage'' in quotes here--that directly impacts the future rounds of BRAC politics of the last round.  A lot has been said about this. I understand it. I am not going to rehash that today. But based on a recent memorandum from the Department of the Air Force, it seems to me there is some acquiescence to such pressure to not really carry out the BRAC action directed in the last round. BRAC is a hard sell in Congress under normal times and under the purest of motives. But when actions are taken that clearly disadvantage others and violate the BRAC process for political gain, BRAC is a ``no sell'' in Congress.  For the Department of Defense to simply say that all we need is for Congress to authorize additional rounds of BRAC is an easy way to avoid the responsibilities for actions that must be taken by the Department of Defense well in advance of any congressional action.  It seems to me the Department of Defense can go a long way to helping us in regard to the BRAC process if they simply develop the fortitude and the decisionmaking to start the process now to correctly and accurately shape and define the infrastructure--not to simply put everything on the table to save money but be required to support the military of the 21st century even if they risk pressure from the White House or Capitol Hill. Without such a strategy, I cannot support another BRAC round that has a poorly prepared and inadequately staffed approach to reducing the excess infrastructure.  I urge a ``no'' vote from my colleagues on this matter.                         Privilege Of The Floor  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that Kevin Zumbar, a military fellow, and Zach Terwilliger, a legislative intern, in the office of Chairman Warner, be granted floor privileges for the duration of the Senate's debate on S. 1059, the National Defense Authorization Act.
