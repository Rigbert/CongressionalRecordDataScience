 President, I yield myself 1 minute.  I appreciate the Senator's amendment. He seeks to help encourage charitable giving for scholarships, a very worthy cause. Obviously, it is an idea that deserves to be debated and to be looked at carefully. Unfortunately, it falls outside the scope of the RELIEF act. I hope the Senator and I can work to have the Finance Committee consider a charitable bill down the road.  Before I close, I thank the Senator for his good work on the Senate Finance Committee. He is a new member of the committee. The committee has greatly benefited from his energy and ideas. The people of Arizona are fortunate to have his service on the Finance Committee.  I yield the floor.
