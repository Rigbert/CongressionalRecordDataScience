President, while the Senator from Missouri is still on the floor, I noted what my friend said about his being the first member of his family to get a college degree.  The Leahys came to Vermont in 1850. When my grandfather--who was a stone carver--died, my father was a teenager, and he had to go to work. I became the first Leahy to get a college degree, and my sister was the second one. I have to think what the path might have been otherwise. There is one thing we all have to agree on: We have to make it easier for college to be affordable, with all kinds of plans and ideas. The kids have to be able to go to college. I was able to do that. I was able to go on to graduate school. It is so important to be able to compete today. I was touched by what my friend said, and I appreciate it.               Comprehensive Addiction and Recovery Bill  Mr. President, we have kind of a good news/bad news situation today. The good news is that Congress is taking a step forward on how to respond to opioid addiction. By advancing the Comprehensive Addiction and Recovery Act, or CARA, we are leaving behind decades-old misconceptions about how to confront addiction.  For too long, Congress relied on punitive measures that only served to push addicts further underground and away from recovery. This legislation treats opioid addiction as an illness. It combats it as we would any other public health issue, through a commitment to evidence-based treatment and recovery programs. But the bad news is our commitment falls short.  The conference report promises critical programming, but then it does not pay the bill. It does not provide the resources necessary to support the programming. So we should know what we have here. We have a first step--an important first step but barely a first step. If we make a mistake and say: OK, we have done our job, then we have failed the countless communities across the country grappling with addiction. We are doing very little to stem this epidemic.  I am afraid my friends, the Republicans, have repeatedly blocked efforts to fund the programs authorized by CARA. When the legislation was first considered on the Senate floor, Republicans opposed Senator Shaheen's amendment that would have provided $600 million in new funding of emergency supplemental appropriations, which is actually a modest amount considering what is needed in this country.  Then we have the appropriations process in committee this year. Emergency funds to fight this addiction epidemic were denied. Senate Republicans kept assuring us that there was going to be a time and a place to include real funding. Well, last week's conference provided such an opportunity. I, along with other Democratic conferees, identified commonsense and bipartisan offsets that would enable us to dedicate almost $1 billion in new resources to put the programs in CARA to work. We told our Republican counterparts wecould not sign the conference report unless it included meaningful funding, but the Republicans voted against funding CARA so I did not sign the report. They also made a new promise. At the conference meeting, the Republicans promised to include $525 million in new funding to combat addiction through the appropriations process. I have to note that I hope Americans demand that Congress keep this promise and provide meaningful funding for CARA--not with poison pill offsets that would kill it but with real promises.  I will soon again join with Senators Murray, Wyden, and Shaheen to introduce legislation to provide $920 million to fund CARA. It could be fully paid for. It could be paid for with offsets that received overwhelming bipartisan support. If we are really serious about combatting the opioid epidemic, there is no sense not to pass this, and there is no sense not to put our money where our mouths are, because, if we fund it, it can make an important difference. We can expand prevention efforts, expand access to treatment and recovery services, and authorize the critical public health programs to create and expand Medication Assisted Treatment, MAT, programs.  If CARA were funded, it could make an important difference in communities across the country. The bill lays the groundwork for expanding prevention efforts and access to treatment and recovery services. It removes arbitrary restrictions on prescribing Medication Assisted Treatment, which will allow nurse practitioners and physician assistants in Vermont to treat addiction just as they treat other illnesses. It authorizes a critical public health program I helped create to expand MAT programs. Some Vermonters tell me they are struggling with addiction and they have had to wait nearly 1 year to receive treatment. At the Chittenden Clinic in South Burlington, VT, several have died while waiting. Because we wouldn't fund it, several died. This story is not unique.  The bill also includes my provision to support our rural communities by increasing access to the overdose reversal drug naloxone. Rural locations have the highest death rates in the country from opioid poisoning, and getting this drug into more hands will save lives.  The Comprehensive Addiction and Recovery Act also recognizes that the overprescription of opioids is largely responsible for this epidemic, and the legislation includes a provision I strongly support to encourage the National Institutes of Health to intensify research on the effectiveness of opioids in treating chronic pain and to encourage the development of opioid-alternatives to manage chronic pain.  Two weeks ago, on a beautiful Vermont evening, a standing-room only crowd filled a conference room at the Green Mountain Technical and Career Center for a community meeting on opioid abuse. The event was organized by Lamoille County Sheriff Roger Marcoux. He is a former DEA agent who has seen the toll of heroin and opioid abuse and what it has done in the rural regions of my State.  Dr. Betsy Perez, a panelist and longtime practitioner at nearby Copley Hospital, surprised many in the crowd when she addressed the opioid issue from a personal rather than from a medical perspective. This doctor told the heart-wrenching story of her addicted daughter's journey.  Despite many efforts at treatment, her daughter repeatedly relapsed, eventually winding up homeless on the streets of Burlington. Her daughter is now 2 years into recovery and recently became a mother. The cost of her intensive residential treatment was high. It drained the doctor's retirement savings. But she would have it no other way. I wonder how much better off they might have been if we had prevention clinics in place.  I held a hearing in St. Albans, VT--again, standing room only. I remember a noted pediatrician who spoke about being with parents whom he did not identify. He said they were well off. He was telling them about the dangers of opioids and how teenagers can get addicted. They were shocked to hear this.  They said: Thank you for telling us about this. We will watch out for our daughter.  He said: I have been treating your daughter for 2 years. She is an addict.  You could hear a pin drop in that room. But she was getting treatment, and many are not so fortunate. Each day, throughout our country, 129 people die from drug overdoses. I suspect that almost every Vermonter knows someone who has been impacted by addiction. This is not the future we want for our children, our grandchildren, our communities. In Vermont, we know what it takes to get ahead of addiction. While I appreciate the attention Congress has given this issue, CARA will only work for Vermont and States across the country if Congress is willing to provide the funding that is necessary to fight this epidemic.  I was proud to help usher CARA through the Senate. I will support it today. But I am greatly disappointed that Congress has so far refused to treat this public health crisis as seriously as it did the swine flu or Ebola.  I would urge all Senators: Don't go just to formal meetings. Just stand outside your local grocery stores, as my wife, a registered nurse, and I often do. Just talk with people. Walk down the street, and talk with people. You are going to find what Vermonters know all too well: Lives are at stake here, and time is of the essence. It is time for Congress to act like it and fully fund CARA.  I know when Marcelle and I go home, we want to say that we are helping because we know some of these families personally. In a little State of only 600,000 people, you tend to know a lot of people. I have seen some of the finest families in our State devastated by this. I am sure it is the same in the Presiding Officer's State and every other State in this country. We have to represent the people from our States and help.  Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.
