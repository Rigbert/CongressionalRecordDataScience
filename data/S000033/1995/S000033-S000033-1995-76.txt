 Chairman, now is not really the time to get into a debate over some of the issues that the gentleman from California and the chairman raised, but I would just say the following: We are one Government, and all of the money that we expend comes from the taxpayers, the American people.  The facts are very clear that the United States has, for example, the highest rate of childhood poverty in the industrial world. Nobody disputes that. It is a national shame. In my view, the gentleman may disagree.  The facts are also clear that as a result of policy being made by the majority party, more and more children in this country will suffer and childhood poverty will increase. The United States today, in the United States today, millions of working-class families cannot afford to send their kids to college.  To my mind, there is no question but as a result of recent decisions made by the majority, it will be significantly harder for middle-class families to send their kids to college.  In my State of Vermont and in California and all over this country, millions of elderly people cannot afford the high cost of pharmaceutical drugs, and millions of senior citizens today cannot afford the high cost of health care, despite Medicare.  There is no dispute that as a result of cuts in Medicare, it will be harder and harder for the elderly people to pay for their health care needs, which are going up.  We are one people. If we expend more unnecessarily on intelligence budgets, with the end of the cold war and the decline of the Soviet Union, there is simply less money available to be used on other domestic needs.
