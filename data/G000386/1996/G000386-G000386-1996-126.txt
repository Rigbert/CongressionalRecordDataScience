 The FCS is regulated by the Farm Credit Administration. There has been a vacancy on the FCA Board since the resignation of Board member Gary Byrne on March 31, 1995. Under previous agreement with the President, the name of a highly qualified Iowan, Ann Jorgenson, was referred in August 1995 to the White House with the understanding that the President would send her name to the Senate for confirmation. To date, the White House has neglected to act on the nomination. This Senator feels that the lack of a full Board is very disruptive to the smooth operation of the Farm Credit System.  Can the Chairman share with the Senate any information which he may have on the nomination and whether or not the Senate will be able to act on it this Congress?
