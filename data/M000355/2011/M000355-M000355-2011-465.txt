 Senators in both of our parties agree that there has been a significantbreakdown in the Senate, though I am sure there are different perspectives on the causes of the breakdown. We both recall that in the not too distant past, when the minority and majority were reversed, we both had somewhat different perspectives on these issues. But know that the majority leader and I both care about this institution and the vital role it plays in our democracy.  I am happy about the reforms that we will be adopting today. The rules create many rights--for individual Senators, for the minority, and for the majority leader. But, with rights come responsibilities and Senator Reid and I have discussed how to ensure that we return to a better balance between those two this Congress, and that the twin hallmarks of the Senate--the right to debate and amend legislation--are restored.
