President, I would like to take a moment to make my colleagues aware of the accomplishments of an outstanding Illinois citizen. This Thursday, June 10, Ira P. Weinstein will turn 80. As we celebrated Memorial Day just a week ago, I think it is appropriate to mention Mr. Weinstein's service to our country as it is a constant reminder that without the dedication and bravery of so many like him, the freedom we are privileged to enjoy could not be possible.  Born in Chicago, Illinois on June 10, 1919, Mr. Weinstein entered the U.S. Army Air Corps in 1942, just as America was being drawn into World War II. Trained as a Navigator-Bombardier, Mr. Weinstein rose to the rank of First Lieutenant and proceeded to fly 25 missions during World War II as a member of the 8th Air Force 445 Bomb Group, 702nd Squadron. Although the 24 previous missions he flew had been safe ones, Mr. Weinstein's 25th would be his most harrowing.  On September 27, 1944, Mr Weinstein's plane was shot down over Germany during the Kassell Mission. As he parachuted to the ground, Mr. Weinstein found safety and eluded capture for six days. Unfortunately, he was found by the enemy and held as a Prisoner of War in Stalag Luft I, in Barth, Germany. On May 11, 1945, the camp where Mr. Weinstein was held was liberated, ending an eight-month ordeal as a POW. For his heroism, Mr. Weinstein was awarded several distinguished service medals. These include the Purple Heart, the Air Medal, the POW Medal, a Presidential Citation, the American Campaign and European Campaign Medals, the WW II Victory Medal, and the distinguished French Croix de Guerre.  After returning from the war, Mr. Weinstein, like so many others of his generation, went on to become accomplished in the world of business, building a successful advertising agency respected throughout the Chicago area. Despite the loss of his wife several years ago, Mr. Weinstein, now retired, enjoys being a grandfather and takes special pride in his expertise as a horticulturist.  I am pleased to take this opportunity today to honor an American hero and one of my constituents. As we did one week ago today, we should not hesitate to honor our defenders of freedom every day as we enjoy the liberty they fought so hard to protect.                          ____________________
