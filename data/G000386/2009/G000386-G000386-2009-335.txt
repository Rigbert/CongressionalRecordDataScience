 Lynn appeared to agree with all of my findings and recommendations 100 percent. That is a conclusion I make. The letter will be in the Record, so Members can read it for themselves. He saidthat he was ``very troubled'' by every one of the control weaknesses cited in the report.  Mr. Lynn further stated:       There are unacceptable weaknesses in our internal control      programs.  He promised me he would be taking aggressive corrective action to improve and tighten controls. He concluded by saying:       I want you to know that I place the highest priority on      ensuring that we have the best possible protections against      fraud and wrongful payments.  I also shared my concerns with Secretary of Defense Bill Cohen in a letter dated October 5, 1998. In his response on November 16, 1998--and I have that response from Secretary Cohen here--he offered identical assurances.  I ask unanimous consent to have that letter printed in the Record.  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in the Record, as follows:                                                      U.S. Senate,                                   Committee on the Judiciary,                                  Washington, DC, October 5, 1998.     Hon. William S. Cohen,     Secretary of Defense, Pentagon,     Washington, DC.       Dear Bill, I am writing to follow up on my recent      Subcommittee hearing that examined the results of the Joint      Review of Internal controls at the Department of Defense.       First, I would like to extend my sincere appreciation to      the Department of Defense (DOD) for excellent cooperation and      support throughout the Joint Review of Internal Controls. The      person who is most responsible for energizing this project is      Mr. Bob Hale, Assistant Secretary of the Air Force for      Financial Management and Comptroller. We first met on June      27, 1997 to lay the ground work for the project. At that      meeting, Mr. Hale agreed--with the full backing of the      Secretary of the Air Force--that this would be a joint review      between his office and my Subcommittee on Administrative      Oversight and the Courts. As part of this arrangement, Mr. A.      Ernest Fitzgerald, Management Systems Deputy of the Air      Force, was authorized to participate. Mr. Fitzgerald was a      key asset, since internal controls are one of his primary      areas of responsibility. The ``jointness'' of this project      contributed greatly to its success. Despite some rough spots,      this approach could serve as a model for future cooperative      efforts. Due largely to Mr. Fitzgerald's active      participation, the department directed some corrective action      as problems were being discovered and documented.       Second, I have the distinct impression that no one in the      department takes much exception to the findings and      recommendations contained in either the Joint Staff Report or      the accompanying reports issued by the General Accounting      Office. The attached letter from the Under Secretary of      Defense, Mr. Bill Lynn, is testimony to that fact. He admits      that he is ``very troubled'' by the control weaknesses that      were uncovered by the Joint Review and is taking aggressive      corrective action. Those efforts appear to be focused in one      critical area--tightening controls over the process for      placing ``remittance addresses'' on checks and electronic      fund transfers. I am encouraged by Mr. Lynn's positive      attitude and his determination to address these problems in      meaningful ways. However, my long experience with the      department causes me to feel some skepticism. In the past, I      have found wide disconnects between what is promised by      senior DOD officials and what is really done. I hope you will      personally make sure that Mr. Lynn and other responsible      officials fix this terrible problem.       I intend to follow up until I feel that the taxpayers'      money is adequately protected.       Third, as Mr. Lynn said, he was ``very troubled'' by the      problems cited in the reports. The Joint Staff Report, for      example, states that the control environment within the      Defense Finance and Accounting Service (DFAS) is      characterized by ``fraud and deceit''--to use the exact words      of a senior DFAS official. Between late 1995 and early 1997,      there were repeated reports and allegations of fraudulent      activity in DFAS--particularly at the OPLOC at Dayton, Ohio.      In at least three instances, the Director of the Denver      center, Mr. John Nabil, ordered the Director of Internal      Review, LTC Boyle, to investigate. In each case, LTC Boyle      confirmed the existence of fraudulent activity within DFAS.      Mr. Nabil even signed a memorandum (attached) on September      30, 1996 that substantiates the existence of criminal      activity within his organization. Yet every one of these      ``red warning flags'' was ignored, and DFAS management failed      to report suspected violations of 18 U.S.C. 1001 and other      laws to the proper authorities--as required by law. The end      result of this mismanagement was costly to the taxpayers.      Embezzlers like SSGT Miller--and certainly others--were      allowed to tap into the DOD money pipe--unrestricted--and      steal huge sums of money--undetected. Eventually, an employee      at Dayton blew the whistle and called the law directly. Maybe      those persons who raised red flags at Dayton deserve awards?       In conclusion, I don't believe that the problems at the      Dayton OPLOC are an isolated case. I think they are part of a      general pattern of fraud and abuse within DFAS. The Joint      Staff Report uncovered evidence of similar kinds of      fraudulent activities at the Denver center in 1997 and 1998.      I intend to refer this matter and other related matters to      investigative and audit agencies for further investigation.       Bill, someone needs to be held accountable for what      happened at the Dayton OPLOC and for what appears to be      happening at the Denver center today. Who is responsible?      Without some accountability, Mr. Lynn's promises will, in      fact, come to nothing. Please let me know what you decide to      do.           Sincerely,                                Charles E. Grassley, Chairman,          Subcommittee on Administrative Oversight and the Courts.       Attachment.                                     The Secretary of Defense,                                Washington, DC, November 16, 1998.     Hon. Charles Grassley,     Chairman, Subcommittee on Administrative Oversight and the          Courts, U.S. Senate, Washington, DC.       Dear Chuck: This is in response to your recent letter      following your Subcommittee hearing regarding internal      controls at the Department of Defense (DoD). Be assured we      take this matter very seriously. I know my Comptroller, Mr.      Bill Lynn, has discussed with you measures the Defense      Finance and Accounting Service (DFAS) is taking to improve      internal management controls.       Your letter made specific mention of the DFAS Denver Center      in Colorado, and the fraud case at its subsidiary office in      Dayton, Ohio. Even though the perpetrator at Dayton was      caught and convicted, the case indicates weaknesses in      internal management controls that must be remedied. Toward      that end, DFAS has implemented a number of very specific,      system-oriented improvements to strengthen existing controls,      establish new controls, and ensure that published procedures      are followed. In addition, we have instituted an extensive,      in-depth internal review of the entire Denver Center network.      DFAS also established a separate office to strengthen      internal controls and ensure compliance at all levels.       DFAS, as an organization, is 7 years old and is composed of      approximately 20,000 personnel located in 17 states. We      should acknowledge the dedicated public servants who go out      of their way every day to ensure that the taxpayers' money is      protected. Bill Lynn and I will help them in every way we can      to make sure that the suggestions for improvement, which have      been presented in the various reports, hearings, and      meetings, are evaluated and implemented where necessary.       Chuck, you and I share a common interest in protecting      scarce financial resources, while supporting the great men      and women of our armed forces. The hard work by you and your      staff has assisted significantly in the progress we have      made. We will continue to work to improve our financial      management.           Sincerely,                                                             Bill.
