President, for anybody who wants to speak, following the normal unofficial procedure, as people are available, we can go back and forth, side to side.  I note that I have no objection to proceeding to the motion to discharge the nomination of Ted Olson to be Solicitor General. I mention this because I want Senators to understand. We had a divided vote in the committee, and with a divided vote in the committee, because of the procedures of the Senate, I am sure we could have either bottled it up for some time in committee or for some time here. I do not want to do that. I think there should be a vote one way or the other. We have had too many examples in the past few years of nominations being bottled up that way.  On this one, I have concerns about Mr. Olson, but I am agreeable to having a vote up or down on his nomination. In fact, I say to my friend, the distinguished chairman of the Senate Judiciary Committee, that we also have before us the nominations of Mr. Dinh to be head of the Office of Policy Development of the Justice Department and Mr. Chertoff to be head of the Justice Department's Criminal Division. I am perfectly agreeable to rollcall votes on them, too, and will, to notify Senators, vote for them as I did in committee. Of course, that is something that has to be scheduled.
