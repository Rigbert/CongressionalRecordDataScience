President, Senator Dean Heller may have been a freshman Senator when he came to this body in 2011, but he was not short on experience. First elected as a Nevada assemblyman in 1990, Senator Heller has served in government ever since.  During his Senate tenure, Senator Heller has shown a great interest in protecting American's data privacy, and he was an important partner in our efforts to pass the USA FREEDOM Act. He was a staunch advocate of that bill, even when many in the Senate were pushing for expanded surveillance powers over Americans. Both of us recognized that though the bill may not have included every provision we wanted, the best way to offer privacy protections was through compromise.  While his tenure here was brief, I have appreciated getting to know Senator Heller and working with him on issues of great importance. I wish Senator Heller, his wonderful wife, Lynn, and their four children the very best in this next chapter of their lives.                          ____________________
