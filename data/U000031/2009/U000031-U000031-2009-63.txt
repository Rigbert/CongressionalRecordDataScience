Main St., Benton Harbor, MI 49022  Description of Request: Michigan Works, a state-supported job recruitment and training organization, is starting a job-training program designed to work in tandem with the upcoming $500 million Harbor Shores mixed-use economic development project being undertaken by Benton Harbor. The basic workforce transformation program, which would be funded by the monies requested here, includes at least three core elements: basic skills training, including workforce literacy remediation; skills training for in-demand, high-growth occupations; and transitional job services. All activities will be based on proven programs administered by workforce training professionals as part of the region's existing and ongoing workforce development activities. All programs will be designed to reduce the unemployment rate, increase the local labor participation rate, increase job readiness, place people into jobs, and increase per capita income. These funds are consistent with the mission of the Employment and Training Administration. Benton Harbor, Michigan is the poorest city in one of the most economically challenged states in America. The magnitude of Benton Harbor's problems is stunning--a workforce with an average 6th grade literacy level and an 80% high school dropout rate by young males. In Benton Harbor 42% of the available workers are out of the workforce, a fact exacerbated by the lack of basic skills needed to maintain employment which has only served as a barrier to attract new employers into the area.  Amount: $381,000  Financial Breakdown: The majority of this funding (around 70%) will go to staffing services, stipends for program participants, as well as literacy remediation services. The remainder of the funding will be provided for training scholarships, community outreach, participant assessments and support services. Michigan Works will provide supplemental funds.  4.

Phytopthora Research  Department: Agriculture  Account: Cooperative State Research Education and Extension Service  Legal Name of Requesting Entity: Michigan State University  Address of Requesting Entity:  Description of Request: Researchers at Michigan State University are leaders in the fight to control Phytophthora capsici, a fungal-like pathogen that lives in the soil and causes numerous plants to rot. Phytophthora management has been complicated by its longevity in soils (10 or more years), its ability to spread in water, its resistance to a key fungicides and lack of disease resistant varieties. Michigan State University has developed new techniques for control and resistant varieties. However, losses caused by Phytophthora have become so large throughout the nation in recent years that the economic viability of the vegetable industries in many states is at risk, and more research is necessary. Since 1996, researchers have leveraged private, state and federal funds to significantly advance disease management. The widespread crop loss caused by Phytophthora capsici will be lessened, keeping family farms and their communities viable. Spread of Phytophthora to new sites will be stopped. Ways to remediate/treat infested ground and water sources will be identified. Integrated management strategies that emphasize cultural methods and environmentally friendly practices will be developed.  Amount: $346,000  Financial Breakdown: This money will provide 346,000 in funding for Phytophthora research at Michigan State University. Approximately 85 percent of the funding will go to researchers, technicians and students. Approximately 15 percent will be used for materials, supplies and administration. Michigan State University has received outside sources of funding for Phytophthora research as well. This funding is consistent with the authorized purpose of the Cooperative State Research, Education and Extension Service.                          ____________________
