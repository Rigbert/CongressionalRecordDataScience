Chairman, I would ask very simple questions of those who have drafted this amendment and are offering it. Do the gentlemen wish to do anything in this amendment that would lessen the inspection that the FDA does of drugs that may be manufactured or sold in another country and used by U.S. citizens? I want to understand the full intent of the amendment, because when the FDA Commissioner came before our subcommittee and I asked the question about drugs from other countries, she said that they could not give certainty that they were of equal quality.
