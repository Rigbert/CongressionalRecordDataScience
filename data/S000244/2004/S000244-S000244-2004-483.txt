Speaker, I yield myself the balance of my time.  Mr. Speaker, while I respect the arguments of the gentleman from Texas (Mr. Paul), even though I do not agree with them, I think it is important to look at what the resolved clause of this resolution says in deciding whether or not to support or oppose the resolution.  I will read it. ``Resolved, That the House of Representatives: (1) congratulates the DEA on the occasion of its 30th Anniversary;  ``( 2) honors the heroic sacrifice of those of its employees who have given their lives or have been wounded or injured in the service of our Nation; and  ``(3) thanks all the men and women of the DEA for their past and continued efforts to defend the American people from the scourge of illegal drugs.''  This resolution has nothing to do with drug policy. It has nothing to do with whether the war on drugs has been successful or not. It has nothing to do with whether or not drugs should be legalized. What it does do is to tell the people who have worked for the DEA for the last 30 years that their service has not been in vain executing a policy in criminalizing certain drug activities and use of certain drugs that this Congress has passed.  It also commemorates the people who have given their lives or been wounded in the service of their country. The DEA is a law enforcement agency. We make the laws, they enforce the laws. This resolution gives them thanks for enforcing the laws and commemorating those who have made the ultimate sacrifice. I support the resolution, and I urge Members to support the resolution.
