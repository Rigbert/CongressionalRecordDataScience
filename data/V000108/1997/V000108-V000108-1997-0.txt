Speaker, I appreciate the recognition and I appreciate the gentleman from New Jersey as well as the gentleman from Mississippi yielding time to me, and I would also start out by associating myself with the remarks made by both the gentleman from New Jersey as well as the gentleman from Mississippi on the proposed fast track authority that we in this Chamber will be voting on sometime Sunday.  Mr. Speaker, we live in a global economy and we are engaged in a global competition. I know this and so do the tens of thousands of working Americans that I represent. The people I represent in northwest Indiana are not afraid of competition. They embrace it, because they work hard and do their job better than anyone else in the world. The steel workers and other working men and women I represent are happy to trade their products in the world's markets, but in trading their products, they do not want to trade away a living wage.  For half a century, the people of America, at the cost of thousands of lives and trillions of dollars, have fought and worked to export the unique American value of democracy. As we look back on history and at the world today, we can see we have achieved success in doing so. But as we stand here today, we must think about exporting another important American value, the value that hard work is rewarded. This is a value that I was taught growing up in Gary, Indiana. I was taught that if one studied in school and worked hard in life, one would be rewarded with a living wage that would allow you to get married, buy a house, have children, send them to school, and then enjoy an economically secure retirement.  But in today's debate on fast track, instead of working to export the American value of hard work globally, we are diminishing the value of work for all. The competition that will arise from the trade strategy we are debating today will not result in a race to the top, but in a drop to the bottom. And my fundamental concern is that if we in this House and others in this government do not export the value of labor and reward hard work in America, no one else will.  I find it interesting that prior to the adoption of NAFTA 3 years ago, a local industry told me that they supported the agreement because it would be good for us. Prior to NAFTA, the same industry had a trade surplus with Mexico. Since NAFTA, that industry has a trade deficit with Mexico 20 times as large. But they have never complained. Why? Because their bottom line has not changed, and in fact, it has increased. They invest overseas, payingpeople less and make more money. Unfortunately, the thousands of employees they have left stranded in places like Gary, Indiana; New Chicago, Indiana, have no recourse. In abrogating their responsibility, the responsibility to fairly reward hard work, these corporate citizens of the United States of America have dashed the American dream of many of the people we represent.  We must not take the world economy as we find it and adapt to it, as so many people have suggested we do. We must make the world economy adapt to our fundamental American economic principle that hard work pays. It pays in the form of a living wage to working people.  It might not happen this year; it might not happen next year, it might not happen in 20 years, but if it happens 50 years from now, our grandchildren will look back and say that we today here in this place did not break our covenant with the next generation of American citizens.  I would ask all of my colleagues to join with me in opposing giving President Clinton his fast track authority.                          ____________________
