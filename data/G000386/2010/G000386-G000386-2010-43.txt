 President, I wish to tell my colleagues why I think the bill before us, S. 3816, is not a good approach. This bill is being sold as somehow having the potential to create American jobs, but it would likely have the exact opposite effect. It would lead to a net decrease in American jobs. For that reason, I encourage my colleagues to vote against this bill.
