 President, I rise today to honor a true local hero in my State, Dover's Police Chief Keith Faulkner.  Chief Faulkner retired his badge earlier this month after an unprecedented 28 years of service on the Dover Police Department. His service and leadership truly were unique. He joined the police force as a student cadet and is the first and only such officer to rise to the rank of Chief of Police.  Personally, I have to admit I know what it must feel like when a police officer's long-serving, trusted partner retires. Keith Faulkner proudly first put on his Dover Police uniform the same year I took office as a U.S. Senator. Chief Faulkner and I have been through a lot together, and I will greatly miss his advice, counsel and support.  Fortunately, Chief Faulkner isn't going far. He already has started a new venture at nearby Delaware State University in Dover as associate director of public safety. DSU just formed a police department last year, and I am confident the University, its students and faculty will benefit immensely from his nearly three decades of law enforcement experience.  Chief Faulkner is widely credited with restoring and strengthening the Dover Police Department's reputation as a leading law enforcement agency in our State. Under his command, Dover achieved the coveted national accreditation, a distinction shared by only about 700 police forces nationwide. He also presided over the institutionalization of community policing on the Dover police force, which has contributed to reducing crime and boosting the confidence of local residents in the police. In fact, for the first time ever, crime rates for violent and non-violent crimes are down for the past two straight years.  And his commitment to public service goes beyond Dover. Keith has served as Vice-Mayor on the Smyrna Town Council, Chair of the Delaware Police Chiefs' Council, and sits on my independent Military Academy Review Board to interview and select the high school students I appoint to our national military service academies.  To be honest, the real purpose of this tribute to Chief Faulkner is not to wish him a ``happy retirement!'' I am confident he will continue to be a leader in our State on law enforcement issues. And I am hopeful that his role as a public servant has only just begun.  I wish Keith and his family many more years of good health, safety and good fortune.                          ____________________
