Speaker, it is with deep sadness that I mourn the loss of my friend and colleague, Congressman Charlie Norwood. Charlie was a tenacious fighter in Congress who would not back down from his beliefs. More important than his work in the House of Representatives, he was a dedicated husband, loving father of two sons and a grandfather of four.  Charlie served his country proudly in Vietnam and was a decorated veteran. Upon his return to the states, he practiced dentistry and helped countless Georgians. In 1994, he brought his compassion and conservative values to Washington. I soon learned that Charlie Norwood was a man of impressive character and conviction, with a Southern charm and heart of gold.  Charlie Norwood was a fervent believer in tackling the problem of illegal immigration, and I enjoyed working with him to pass immigration reform. Charlie made a valuable contribution to the House's immigration bill in the 109th Congress by including parts of his CLEAR Act in the legislation. I shared his belief that we should direct local law enforcement to help us apprehend the illegal immigrants in this country who are criminals.  Charlie courageously battled cancer for a number of years, and he was an inspiration to many, including his colleagues on both sides of the aisle. I am pleased that I had the opportunity to work with Charlie, and my wife Cheryl and I extend our deepest sympathies to Gloria Norwood and their entire family.                          ____________________
