 Chairman, I rise in strong support of the Obey amendment.  Mr. Chairman, is it really appropriate to be talking about another $74 billion investment for a space station when we have 5 million children in America who are hungry and this Congress is cutting back on nutrition programs and food stamps?  I do not think that that is a proper or moral tradeoff. We should not be doing that.  Mr. Chairman, the budget that we are dealing with now devastates programs for affordable housing. How can low-income people bring up a family when they make $6 an hour and are forced to pay 50 or 60 percent of their limited incomes for housing? How many more families, how many more children, will be made homeless as a result of this budget? That is not right.  Mr. Chairman, the wealthy in our country have the resources to send their kids to the finest private schools and the finest colleges, colleges which often cost $25,000 a year or more.  The working class and the middle class of this country do not have that luxury. In fact, it is harder and harder for the average American family to afford college for their kids.  Mr. Chairman, how do we tell the working families of this country that we are prepared to spend tens of billions more on the space station, but we are cutting back drastically on student loans, on Pell grants, on upward bound, on the National Service Program; congressional decisions which will make it impossible for millions of American kids to afford college. Billions more for hardware in space; major cuts in education. That does not make sense.  The Republican budget that we are operating under eliminates LIHEAP. Elderly people in Vermont, throughout this country, will go cold when the weather becomes 20 below zero. Mr. Chairman, $74 billion more for the space station; elderly people in America going cold. Those are wrong priorities.
