 President, I ask unanimous consent that following the disposition of the Biegun nomination, the Senate proceed to legislative session and resume consideration of the House message to accompany H.R. 1158; that if cloture is invoked on the motion to concur in the House amendment to the Senate amendment to H.R. 1158, the postcloture time be expired, the other pending motions and amendments be withdrawn, and the Senate vote on adoption of the motion to concur in the House amendment to the Senate amendment to H.R. 1158 with no intervening action or debate.
