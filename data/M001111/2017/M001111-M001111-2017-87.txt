 President, I have to say that this is a sad day for the Senate. I know many of us here today--certainly my Democratic colleagues--are truly appalled. Onceagain, instead of working on the many pressing issues at hand, Republicans are continuing their tired, dangerous obsession with attacking women's health.  Once again, women's health is being used as a political football, with Republicans attempting to cut off access to vital healthcare services. Once again, millions of families across the country are watching Congress, wondering why there isn't just one more Republican who will stand up for them.
