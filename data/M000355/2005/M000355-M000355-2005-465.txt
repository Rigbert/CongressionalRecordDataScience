 President, I rise today to recognize the outstanding service of a remarkable Kentuckian, Mr. Ronald W. Kiser. Mr. Kiser is the assistant chief of the Engineering Division for the Louisville District of the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers. He will retire from the Corps of Engineers this September 30 with over 36 years of dedicated service to our Nation.  A Louisville resident for decades, Mr. Kiser is originally a native of Charleston, WV. He began his career with the Corps of Engineers in the Huntington District, in West Virginia, upon graduation from the West Virginia University Institute of Technology, where heearned a bachelor's degree in civil engineering. During his time with the Huntington District, Mr. Kiser's duties included evaluating buildings for safe refuge from nuclear fallout, overseeing relocations of railroads and highways at major flood-control projects and navigation projects, and participating in emergency disaster recovery.  In 1974, Mr. Kiser was selected to lead the Relocations Branch of the Engineering Division in the Louisville District. His work involved many aspects of civil-works projects, including the design of Zilpo Road at Cave Run Lake, in northeastern Kentucky, which is now featured in a register of America's most scenic highways. Over the next 10 years, Mr. Kiser not only served the Louisville District, but was solicited by the Pittsburgh District and the Europe Division, in addition to earning a master's degree in civil engineering from Ohio State University. While assisting the Pittsburgh District, Mr. Kiser led the relocations associated with the Stonewall Jackson Dam Project and the Monongahela River Locks Renovation Project. During his time with the Europe Division, he managed military operations and maintenance projects totaling approximately $200 million a year.  Mr. Kiser returned to the Louisville District in 1983 and was selected as chief of the Army Section in the newly established Military Branch that had been formed to oversee the Louisville District's military mission. Thanks to his leadership, vision, and dedication to duty, the Louisville District gained a reputation for excellence in execution that it retains to this day. Among the many major military installations Mr. Kiser helped oversee are Fort Campbell and Fort Knox, both in Kentucky, and many Army Reserve facilities nationwide.  During this time, Mr. Kiser extended his leadership well beyond his assigned missions. He mentored Captains Robert Rowlette and Mike Pratt, who both went on to become Corps of Engineers District Commanders. He worked on the Standardized Design Program Committee for the Corps of Engineers Headquarters. He led the Louisville District to become the Centers of Expertise for Centralized Vehicle Wash Facilities, Bowling Centers, and Class 6 Beverage Stores. And he was a key player in organizing the first MILCON Conference, and developing the standard ``partnering'' clause for construction contracts.  Mr. Kiser continued his leadership role in the Louisville District's Engineering Division throughout the 1990s, in positions ranging from chief of the first environmental support program to his current position of assistant chief of the Engineering Division. His devotion to the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers over several decades has made for a stronger, safer, more prosperous Nation for his fellow Kentuckians, and for all Americans.  A good neighbor and a valued steward of our defense assets and natural resources, Mr. Kiser will be remembered for his spirit of service, patriotism and dedication to his country. On the occasion of his retirement, I ask my colleagues to join me in extending best wishes to Mr. Ronald W. Kiser.                          ____________________[Pages S10183-S10184]From the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]                          MR.
