 And you don't do that with the promise of just tax cuts for the wealthy.  We know trickle-down doesn't work. We all saw what happened from 2001 to 2008 when we gave away the tax cuts. Here we are today, now having to deal with the deficit. We all remember what happened during the Clinton administration when we had a balanced package that had both investments and responsible revenue and what happened in that decade when our economy rebounded and we got to a surplus and people felt strong again.  So that is what our budget is based upon, and I would be happy to yield additional time to both Senators to talk about this critical aspect of our budget.
