  Mr. DeFAZIO. Last December, with one vote, Congress voted to add $400 billion to this year's deficit by extending all the Bush tax cuts and adding a new Social Security tax holiday. The premise was this would put America back to work. Well, guess what? It hasn't worked--borrowed money, a consumption-driven economy is anemic at best. Now the Republicans and President Obama want to double down. They want to expand and continue the Social Security tax holiday at a cost of 220 billion borrowed dollars.  How about instead of more tax cuts, instead of reducing investment in infrastructure, how about $220 billion of real investment in our crumbling national infrastructure? We could put 7.5 million people to work, not just in construction, in engineering, in small businesses and manufacturing, and add $1.5 trillion to our economy.  The choice is clear: more failed policies of the past or investment in the future.                          ____________________
