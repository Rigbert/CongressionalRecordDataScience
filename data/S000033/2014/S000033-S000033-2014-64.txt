 While no one is quite exactly clear how much those two wars will end up costing us, the estimate is between $3 and $6 trillion. The point Senator Durbin made is even those who voted against the war--and I did as well--understood that when we sent men and women off to battle they would have to have all of the resources they needed to do their mission. Equally important, what we are saying now is when they come home wounded in body, wounded in spirit, we need them to have the resources they require to make their lives whole again. That is a moral obligation. I thank the Senator for raising that point.  I will yield the floor in a second, but first I will conclude by saying that I want to see this bill passed as soon as possible. We are working as hard as we possibly can, but anyone who magically thinks the only problem facing the VA is more accountability and better management is not correct. We do need better management at the VA, we do need more accountability at the VA, and this legislation will provide that.  People who are incompetent and people who are dishonest should be fired. There must be more transparency, and there certainly must be a much clearer chain of command that goes from Washington to regional hospitals and facilities and back up again.  At the end of the day, the best management in the world is not going to provide the quality and timely health care veterans need unless we have the doctors, nurses, and other medical personnel, and that is the simple fact. Excellent management, yes; transparency, yes; fire incompetent people, yes; but we also need the doctors and nurses to provide quality and timely care to the veterans of our country.  With that, I yield the floor.
