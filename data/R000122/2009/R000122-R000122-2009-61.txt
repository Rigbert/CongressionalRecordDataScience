As I noted, page 46 of the committee report includes a table that shows the estimated State-by-State obligation limitation for Federal-Aid Highway Program funding. This information was prepared for the Appropriations Committee by the Federal Highway Administration based on current law and the funding level provided in this bill. It is my understanding that this table is designed to be illustrative rather than determinative of actual funding levels. Could the Senator confirm that this understanding is correct?
