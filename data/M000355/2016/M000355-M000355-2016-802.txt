 President, will the Senator yield for a question?  Mr. McCAIN. I will be glad to.  Mr. McCONNELL. How many Democratic Senators on the Armed Services Committee voted against this bill?  Mr. McCAIN. None. I am unhappy to say that the three votes against happened to be on this side of the aisle.                          ____________________
