 1089. A bill to provide for the introduction of pay-for-performance compensation mechanisms into contracts of the Department of Veterans Affairs with community-based outpatient clinics for the provision of health care services, and for other purposes; to the Committee on Veterans' Affairs.  Mr. McCONNELL. Mr. President, I rise today to introduce the Veterans Health Care Improvement Act of 2011.  As we all know, the Department of Veterans Affairs strives to provide the best possible health care for our nation's heroes. However, it has come to my attention that the quality of care provided to our nation's veterans remains inconsistent among community-based outpatient clinics. Some of these clinics are operated by private health care providers under VA contracts. These VA-contracted health care providers are compensated for their work at community-based outpatient clinics on a capitated basis, which means they are essentially paid based on how many new veterans they see during a pay period. These firms are therefore rewarded for the number of veterans they sign up, not for the quality of treatment provided to our veterans. While I am not opposed to capitation per se, I am concerned current VA policy provides contractors with the wrong incentives. Contracted health care providers should have incentives to provide the best possible care for veterans, not simply get as many veterans as possible through their doors.  As a result of the capitated system, it has been reported that too many of our nation's heroes have faced difficulties at these clinics in scheduling appointments, have suffered from neglect or have received substandard health care. This occurred under the last administration and I am concerned it may be continuing in the current one.  As such, I am reintroducing the Veterans Health Care Improvement Act, which attempts to fix the way VA-contracted health care providers are compensated at clinics. This bill would require the VA to begin to introduce a pay-for-performance compensation plan for contractors, thereby gradually incentivizing a higher quality of care for veterans seen at privately-administered community-based outpatient clinics.  This bill gives the VA the flexibility to begin to implement such a system through a pilot program and leaves the VA the discretion as to how to adopt and best implement the pay-for-performance standards. In this respect, the bill defers to the VA on how best to execute these changes. It is my hope that my colleagues will support this measure.  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be printed in the Record.  There being no objection, the text of the bill was ordered to be printed in the Record, as follows:                                S. 1089       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of      the United States of America in Congress assembled,     SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.       This Act may be cited as the ``Veterans Health Care      Improvement Act of 2011''.     SEC. 2. FINDINGS.       Congress makes the following findings:       (1) Veterans of the Armed Forces have made tremendous      sacrifices in the defense of freedom and liberty.       (2) Congress recognizes these great sacrifices and      reaffirms America's strong commitment to its veterans.       (3) As part of the on-going congressional effort to      recognize the sacrifices made by America's veterans, Congress      has dramatically increased funding for the Department of      Veterans Affairs for veterans health care in the years since      September 11, 2001.       (4) Part of the funding for the Department of Veterans      Affairs for veterans health care is allocated toward      community-based outpatient clinics (CBOCs).       (5) Many CBOCs are administered by private contractors.       (6) CBOCs administered by private contractors operate on a      capitated basis.       (7) Some current contracts for CBOCs may create an      incentive for contractors to sign up as many veterans as      possible, without ensuring timely access to high quality      health care for such veterans.       (8) The top priorities for CBOCs should be to provide      quality health care and patient satisfaction for America's      veterans.       (9) The Department of Veterans Affairs currently tracks the      quality of patient care through its Computerized Patient      Record System. However, fees paid to contractors are not      currently adjusted automatically to reflect the quality of      care provided to patients.       (10) A pay-for-performance payment model offers a promising      approach to health care delivery by aligning the payment of      fees to contractors with the achievement of better health      outcomes for patients.       (11) The Department of Veterans Affairs should begin to      emphasize pay-for-performance in its contracts with CBOCs.     SEC. 3. PAY-FOR-PERFORMANCE UNDER DEPARTMENT OF VETERANS                    AFFAIRS CONTRACTS WITH COMMUNITY-BASED                    OUTPATIENT HEALTH CARE CLINICS.       (a) Plan Required.--Not later than one year after the date      of the enactment of this Act, the Secretary of Veterans      Affairs shall submit to Congress a plan to introduce pay-for-     performance measures into contracts which compensate      contractors of the Department of Veterans Affairs for the      provision of health care services through community-based      outpatient clinics (CBOCs).       (b) Elements.--The plan required by subsection (a) shall      include the following:       (1) Measures to ensure that contracts of the Department for      the provision of health care services through CBOCs begin to      utilize pay-for-performance compensation mechanisms for      compensating contractors for the provision of such services      through such clinics, including mechanisms as follows:       (A) To provide incentives for clinics that provide high-     quality health care.       (B) To provide incentives to better assure patient      satisfaction.       (C) To impose penalties (including termination of contract)      for clinics that provide substandard care.       (2) Mechanisms to collect and evaluate data on the outcomes      of the services generally provided by CBOCs in order to      provide for an assessment of the quality of health care      provided by such clinics.       (3) Mechanisms to eliminate abuses in the provision of      health care services by CBOCs under contracts that continue      to utilize capitated-basis compensation mechanisms for      compensating contractors.       (4) Mechanisms to ensure that veterans are not denied care      or face undue delays in receiving care.       (c) Implementation.--The Secretary shall commence the      implementation of the plan required by subsection (a) unless      Congress enacts an Act, not later than 60 days after the date      of the submittal of the plan, prohibiting or modifying      implementation of the plan. In implementing the plan, the      Secretary may initially carry out one or more pilot programs      to assess the feasability and advisability of mechanisms      under the plan.       (d) Reports.--Not later than 180 days after the date of the      enactment of this Act and every 180 days thereafter, the      Secretary shall submit to Congress a report setting forth the      recommendations of the Secretary as to the feasability and      advisability of utilizing pay-for-performance compensation      mechanisms in the provision of health care services by the      Department by means in addition to CBOCs.                                 ______                                       By
