Speaker, I rise today in memory of Meghan Elizabeth Price, who was the President of the Student Government Association at the University of Maryland, College Park. Meghan tragically died in a car accident on December 29, 1998. She was a senior Government & Politics major and was preparing to attend law school in the fall. She is survived by her parents, Karlyn ``Susan'' Price and John ``Sonny'' Price, as well as her brother Jonathan.  Meghan was a respected student leader in College Park. She served in many leadership positions on campus. Prior to her election as President in October, she held the positions of Vice-President of Campus Affairs, Legislative Director, and the Cambridge Community Legislator for the Student Government Association. While she was the Vice-President of Campus Affairs she helped to found the Flagship Initiative, which is a student initiated effort to lobby the General Assembly for increased funding for the University of Maryland, College Park. She also worked closely with University of Maryland Officials, including the President and the Athletic Director, to improve the quality of life for all of the members of the University of Maryland community.  Meghan's activism began before she arrived in College Park and extended beyond just the College Park community. She attended Southern Garrett High School where she was a member of the Student Council for four years and was the President her senior year. She was also the Drum Major of the Marching Band, and a four-year member of the softball team. In addition she interned at EMILY's List and volunteered on my re-election campaign.  Meghan was a member of Omicron Delta Kappa Fraternity and a graduate of the College Park Scholars Public Leaders Program. She participated in the Blind Skiers Program at Wisp and the annual University of Maryland Holocaust Memorial Vigil.  It is regrettable the such a young, motivated and inspirational leader is lost so early in life. Meghan touched so many people in her short time with us and set an example that will shine forth for all to see, even in her absence.  I join with the University of Maryland community in expressing my sorrow in the loss of a visionary leader and an admired human being. May God bless those she left behind.                          ____________________
