Speaker, I yield myself the balance of my time.  Mr. Speaker, contrary to what the distinguished minority leader said, I offered to file a supplemental committee report. However, in order to do so, I asked that the authors of the amendment admit that the amendment did not specifically exclude the sexual predators from the exemptions they proposed. That offer was refused by the minority side of the aisle.  The committee report does accurately state that sexual predators are not carved out of the exemptions that were proposed. It is not a misrepresentation. It accurately shows that the authors of the amendment did not draft those amendments as narrowly as they should have. And when we vote on legislation, we vote on what is on the plain text of the piece of paper, not on what the author of an amendment intended to do.  I do not like to see this resolution come before us, but what I will say is that we were accurate, and if you do not want this to happen again, draft your amendments properly.  Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.
