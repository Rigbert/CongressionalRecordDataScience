President, next year I intend to speak more about the Scholar Rescue Fund Alumni Research Program.  I am aware of this through my friendship with Dr. Henry Jarecki. I believe that it is something more Senators should be aware of, and something that would appeal to Senators in both parties. Perhaps one of the best ways to describe it would be to include in the Record remarks, by Dr. Jarecki, and I so ask unanimous consent to have those remarks printed.  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in the Record, as follows:       Allan Goodman has, in introducing me, spoken of the fact      that I accepted Henry Kaufman's mandate to help develop the      IIE's newly-established Scholar Rescue Fund. Doing what Henry      tells me to do is easy for me and this mandate was even      easier: I have been a refugee and I am an academic; and the      risks of free speech are tattooed on the skin of my relatives      and on my mind. I wanted to start immediately.       When I came to talk to Allan about the program, he was as      enthusiastic as I was but wondered whether we should wait      with the start until we had the endowment funds to make sure      that the program would last. His comments sounded so sensible      that I didn't at first know what to say. But that, as people      who know me, didn't last too long.       I told him how, in 1937, Franklin Roosevelt had convened a      conference of representatives from 80 countries in Evian,      France, to encourage them to accept Hitler's Jews, and how      speaker after speaker had praised President Roosevelt's      wonderful idea but said that, unfortunately, his particular      country could not take part at that moment because of a      unique problem they were having in his particular country      just at that particular time. Finally, the representative of      Rafael Trujillo, then known as the Butcher of Santo Domingo      for having machine-gunned hundreds of Haitian refugees who      tried to cross the border into the Dominican Republic, got up      to speak. Trujillo was, understandably enough, in bad odor      all over the world and so he tried to make amends by letting      his representative announce that Trujillo had agreed to let      100,000 of the refugees settle in the Dominican Republic.       The world's refugee organizations then set to work to make      sure that it all went well. They started by developing      precise criteria: how many merchants, how many farmers, and      what ages they should be; how many married and unmarried and      a lot more. By the middle of 1938 they had developed their      criteria and started to interview prospective candidates for      the trip. By that time, it was a lot easier to interview      candidates because many of them were already in concentration      camps. Over the next 9 months, these careful choosers found      900 who could go to the Dominican Republic, where most of      them settled in a small town called Sosua and survived the      war. Over 99,000 were left behind to die.       When I got through with my story, Allan told me to get on      with it and get on with it we have after I found generous      kindred spirits in my fellow Trustee Jeffrey Epstein and in      George Soros, both of whom I want not to thank in the name of      persecuted scholars in over 60 countries from whom we now      have requests for help. Sixty countries! What are they      thinking of? How can benighted tyrants and despots be smart      enough to know how powerful free-thinking scholars can be?      And how they must intimidate them into silence. ``They kill      your voice even before their kill you,'' said Maimul Khan, a      rescued scholar from Bangladesh who is here with us tonight.       I learned a lot from Allan's first reaction. It made me      understand how important it would be to find financial and      popular support for IIE programs that did not yet have      endowment or government backing. Back in the 30's when we      were raising money on our own, we made and carried out the      decision to bring European scholars to the States. We only      had enough money to bring out 300 of them but that was enough      to help found a graduate facility at the New School here in      New York.       This story from the thirties was just one of the many      stories I heard when I first joined the Board of IIE a few      years ago. I was impressed with the history of the Institute      which has undertaken hundreds of educational programs in its      80 years of existence, including the ``crown jewel'' of      such programs, the Fulbright Program that it has      administered on behalf of the Department of State since      that program's inception. With the help of its sponsors      and donors, the IIE has had an essential role in the      growth and development of hundreds of thousands of people      who are today leaders in every field of endeavor--be it      government, science, academe or business.       Just two weeks ago, three scientists were awarded the Nobel      Prize; two of them for their work on neutrinos, particles so      small that they are virtually impossible to detect. The one      from Japan and the one from Italy were Fulbrighters who      studied here in the Fifties. Last year, too, two Nobel Prize      winners for economics were Fulbrighters.       In your program this evening is a list of all of the      Fulbrighters and other IIE participants who, like our      founders Elihu Root and Nicholas Murray Butler, have been      awarded the Nobel Prize. It is an impressive roster of a      small subset of the IIE alumni network.       While I was learning about our history, I discovered that      my mentor and Chairman at Yale, the renowned psychiatrist      Fritz Redlich, had first visited the United States in 1930 on      an IIE program which brought him for a year from Vienna to      the University of Iowa. Fritz told me that in 1938, when he      recognized that he had to leave Vienna or go to a      concentration camp, his sponsor at Iowa was the only American      he knew who could provide him the ``affidavit'' required by      the U.S. government--the document that I and all other      refugees knew so well as committing the person who signed it      to not letting the recipient end up on welfare, a charge to      the state.       Fritz came here, became a professor at Yale, then head of      the Department of Psychiatry and eventually Dean of the Yale      Medical School. He was a brilliant and caring doctor who      wrote extensively on whether the poor got the same treatment,      or even the same diagnoses, as the rich. And he was, like me,      an iconoclast. It was he who brought me to Yale, a fact that      has had such a strong influence on my own life.       Fritz was, of course, not the only scholar who was rescued      from Hitler's Germany and the countries falling to Nazi      control. As I mentioned before, the Institute's ``University      in Exile'' program brought more scholars to America, enough      indeed to form the graduate faculty of the New School      University here in New York, a university which to this day      remains a vibrant academic institution.       The list of IIE alumni is not limited to scholars fleeing      persecution or Nobel Prize winners, however; it would fill a      ``Who's Who'' of world leaders: Valery Giscard d'Estang,      former President of France; Margaret Thatcher, former Prime      Minister of England; 10 Heads of State, 56 Ambassadors, 44      Nobel Laureates, 115 University presidents, and 400,000 more      men and women who have been educationally enriched by the      experience we helped them to have.       The accomplishments of the IIE Alumni Network have indeed      been so illustrious that their stories seemed to me a natural      way to explain to the world just why international education      was so valuable and to obtain popular support for our      educational and humanitarian programs. To make sure that an      understanding of this network was available to us all, I      accepted Tom Russo's and Allan Goodman's challenge to      establish and codify an IIE Alumni database.       We will use this database to let the world know about the      kinds of people who have made good, in part because of the      programs designed and administered by the Institute. That      awareness will help us to develop support for additional      programs that are responsive to the needs of the current      moment--like the Scholar Rescue initiative I and others      have told you about.       I encouraged Dan Greespahn, who has done a terrific job      heading the Alumni Research Program, to find out as much a he      could about our alumni, both so that we could learn about      them and so that they could help us develop our new programs.      It was in the course of developing this Alumni Database that      we encountered Ruth Gruber, about whom you will hear more      momentarily.       And so there was a wonderful confluence of events: My      mentor and close friend, Fritz Redlich, who led Yale      University to the heights of scholarly achievement through      encouraging the free flow of ideas, and Ruth Gruber, an      outstanding humanitarian, journalist and author: both IIE      alumni--Fritz coming here and Ruth going there, both in 1930.       Henry Kaufman, on whose vision all of this rests, suggested      that we create an award to recognize some of the most      accomplished of those alumni. What better way to do so than      to name the award for someone who, for me at least, is the      paradigm of what IIE strive for--Fritz Redlich.       (Fritz, will you please stand and be recognized.)       Fritz, in appreciation of what you have meant to me and to      your thousands of students and in recognition of IIE's role      in ensuring your safety here in the United States, we want to      name our annual award the Fritz Redlich Alumni Award. Thank      you for letting us do so.       Tonight we present the first Fritz Redlich Alumni Award to      Ruth Gruber.       Our efforts to tell you about Ruth are made somewhat easier      by our friends in the film industry who, in 2001, made a CBS      television mini-series that detailed Ruth's rescue of 1000      refugees form Europe in 1944. In that film, the part of Ruth      Gruber was played by the highly accomplished actress Natasha      Richardson.       Ms. Richardson's performances on stage, screen and      televsion--both here and abroad--have been recognized by the      most prestigious awards in the entertainment industry. They      began in 1986 when she received the London Drama Critics's      Most Promising Newcomer Award. In 1992, she received the      London Drama Critics Best Actress Award. She received a Tony      for her performance as Sally Bowles in Cabaret, as well as      Outer Critics Circle, Drama League and Drama Desk Awards for      Best Actress. And there are many, many more.       Natasha Richardson is with us this evening to introduce      Ruth Gruber and to present her with the Fritz Redlich Alumni      Award. Let's start Natasha's introduction of Ruth by taking a      look at Natasha playing her in the film I told you about.                          ____________________
