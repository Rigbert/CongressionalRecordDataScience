  Mr. DeFAZIO. Madam Speaker, we cannot go on as a nation piling debt on debt year after year. The national debt is nearly five times higher today than it was when Ronald Reagan became President in 1981. That is a disgraceful, bipartisan legacy of irresponsible spending and tax giveaways.  The total debt of the Federal Government totals more than $4.6 trillion, more than $16,000 for every man, woman, and child in America. Interest alone will total more than $225 billion, more than 10 times all the Federal funds spent on all education programs and assistance by the Federal Government.  Some oppose the balanced budget amendment over genuine concern for the fate of Social Security, child nutrition, education funding, or other meritorious programs. An honest assessment of these programs shows us they have not done well while we accumulated $4 trillion in debt these last 12 years.  There is not a penny in the Social Security trust fund. It has all been borrowed and spent, replaced by a pile of IOU's.  Twenty percent of my State's children live in poverty and go to bed hungry every night.  We all know the shortfall in education funding. It is time to balance the Federal budget.                          ____________________
