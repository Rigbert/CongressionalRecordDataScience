Speaker, I rise in tribute to Virginia Saunders, Program Operations and Evaluation Specialist for Congressional Documents, in the Office of Congressional Publishing Services at the Government Printing Office, as she approaches her 60th anniversary of dedicated Federal service, May 26, 2005.  Mr. Speaker, this is becoming a habit: Ten years ago, on the occasion of Ms. Saunders' 50th anniversary of Federal service, I rose to recognize Ms. Saunders' achievements, and I expect to do so again ten years from now. Born Virginia R. Frisbie in Darlington, Maryland, on October 11, 1926, Ms. Saunders spent her entire career in service to her fellow Americans. After working briefly at the Federal Bureau of Investigation, she came to the Government Printing Office on February 4, 1946, as a war service junior clerk-typist in the division of public documents, stock section. Two years later, she was promoted to the division of public documents reference section. In February 1951, Ms. Saunders was promoted to indexing clerk and earned subsequent promotions in the same classification. In July 1958, she was promoted to library technician. Becoming a congressional documents specialist in April 1970, she was then promoted to supervisor of the congressional documents section in July 1974. In October 1983, Ms. Saunders assumed the position of congressional documents specialist in the congressional printing management division, customer services, and in September 2004 she was promoted to her current position.  As I pointed out ten years ago, although one may not yet recognize the name of this outstanding GPO employee, the end product of her dedicated efforts is certainly familiar. Ms. Saunders has primary responsibility for the Congressional Serial Set, which is a compilation of all the House and Senate documents and reports issued for each session of Congress. Dummy volumes establishing the format for each edition are prepared and assigned a serial number following each session of Congress. The actual books are produced by GPO's binding division, often as many as 100 volumes per set for each session of Congress. As a chronicle of work of the Congress over the years, the Congressional Serial Set is rivaled only by the Congressional Record. While the Serial Set records behind-the-scenes legislative activities for the United States, the Congressional Record reflects the ``in-session'' proceedings. Distributed to the House and Senate libraries, the Archives, the Library of Congress, and depository libraries, the Congressional Serial Set joins the Congressional Record in offering students and historians a rich insight into the American system of government. Virginia Saunders makes all that possible.  In late 1989, Ms. Saunders recognized the importance of the depository library program in informing the Nation, and drew upon her then-43 years of GPO experience to submit an employee suggestion regarding the appendix to the Iran-Contra Report to Congress. She suggested that this 40-volume publication, which was printed as both a Senate and House report, be bound only once for the serial set volumes of House and Senate reports that are sent to depository libraries. She further suggested that the Schedule of Volumes, a listing of the bound volumes, contain a notation explaining the missing serial number volumes. The implementation of this suggestion resulted in a reduction of 13,740 book volumes to be bound, saving the Federal Government over $600,000. In recognition of these efforts, she received GPO's top monetary Suggestion Award for that year. In ceremonies held on January 9, 1991, Ms. Saunders received a Presidential letter of commendation under the Quality and Management Improvement Award Program. In his letter to Ms. Saunders, President George H.W. Bush noted, ``You have demonstrated to an exceptional degree my belief that Federal employees have the knowledge, ability, and desire to make a difference.'' As one with the privilege of representing tens of thousands of Marylanders in Federal service, I know this to be true.  In tribute to her work on the Congressional Serial Set, in 1999 Ms. Saunders received the James Bennett Childs Award from the Government Documents Roundtable of the American Library Association. The ALA honored Ms. Saunders' ``distinguished contribution to documents librarianship,'' and paid ``grateful recognition'' of a lifetime of exceptional achievements in this important field of endeavor.  I know my colleagues and Ms. Saunders' family, friends, and co-workers join me in congratulating her on 60 years of exemplary Federal service. See you in 10 years, Virginia!                          ____________________
