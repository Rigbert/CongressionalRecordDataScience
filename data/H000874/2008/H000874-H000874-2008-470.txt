 for his outstanding contributions to the natural heritage of the State of Maryland. Mr. Facchina has made his name as one of Maryland's leading businessmen--but I suspect that he will be remembered just as much for his wonderful generosity. He has left our State a gift whose value cannot be measured in dollars: the gift of open, unspoiled land.  Most recently, Mr. Facchina made headlines with his donation of 179 acres in St. Mary's County to the Maryland Environmental Trust. No doubt, he could have sold development rights on that land for a significant profit. But by placing it under a conservation easement, he ensured that it will remain pristine and largely undeveloped. Wetlands and woods will stand in place of housing tracts. And our State's environmental health will benefit: By including vital waterfront land in his grant, Mr. Facchina contributed to our efforts to clean up and preserve the endangered Chesapeake Bay.  At the same time, the grant strengthens one of southern Maryland's most valuable economic resources, the Patuxent River Naval Air Station. By protecting the buffer surrounding the Navy base, Mr. Facchina's donation helps ensure that the Naval Air Station will remain open and viable, creating jobs in St. Mary's County and driving the local economy. In cases like this one, conservation often proves to be good business.  So I thank Paul Facchina, not only for his most recent gift, but for a long and proud legacy of giving that includes an historic plantation, headwater streams of the St. Mary's River, and the forest habitats of Maryland birds. In all, his family has entrusted more than 2,100 acres to the environmental care of our State. When Maryland residents enjoy that open land, and all of its benefits, I hope they will remember whom to thank.  I also want to take this opportunity to recognize the excellent work of the Maryland Environmental Trust, which will take care of that land as part of its more than 112,000 acres. Since 1967, the Trust has worked to help keep our State beautiful, and to help landowners preserve their piece of it. For more than four decades, landowners have relied on the Trust to watch over the legacies they leave, and I'm sure that they will be able to do so for decades to come.                          ____________________
