President, we have the benefit of looking through the lens of history to learn from past mistakes in the hopes of making more informed decisions for the future. No example is more relevant today than the unintended effects of the 2003 invasion of Iraq, and their bearing on the threats of today. I opposed that war from the beginning, and we have paid, and continue to pay, a tremendous price--in American lives, in the unfathomable expense of taxpayer dollars, and in the escalation of strife in that region, and beyond.  There is no doubt that the terrorists of the Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant, ISIL, have emerged from Al Qaeda in Iraq, seizing upon instability, weak institutions, ethnic fractions, and general hostility toward Western forces that resulted from the post-9/11 Iraq invasion. Our personnel, allies, and interests abroad face significant threats from this terrorist group, which have arisen out of the ill-conceived invasion of Iraq.  We can be proud of the bravery, dedication, and sacrifice of our soldiers and their families. They are not at fault for the complex situation in which we now find ourselves. They served our Nation dutifully, and for that we are grateful. Rather, it serves as a reminder that policymakers cannot act recklessly--especially when taking military action. As we continue to address the very real threat that is ISIL, it is astounding to me how far in the past the hard lessons we learned now appear to be to some commentators and policymakers.  I ask unanimous consent that a perceptive and well-written analysis on this subject, written by the distinguished journalist and former foreign correspondent Barrie Dunsmore, that was published in the Rutland Herald and the Montpelier (Barre) Times Argus on May 24, 2015, be printed in the Record.  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in the Record, as follows: [From the Rutland Herald and the Montpelier (Barre) Times Argus; May                                24, 2015]                             Short Memories                          (By Barrie Dunsmore)       ``I am running because I think the world is falling      apart,'' Sen. Lindsey Graham of South Carolina said this past      week. Senator Graham is not alone among the many aspiring      Republican presidential candidates. Not only do they want us      to believe the world is falling apart. They also want us to      believe it's not their fault.       As Robert Costa wrote in the Washington Post, ``One by one,      nearly a dozen GOP hopefuls took the stage (in Des Moines      Iowa) for a Lincoln dinner, each different in style and      stature but all joining a rising Republican chorus that lays      blame for the Islamic State terrorist group squarely at the      feet of President Barack Obama.'' Senator Lindsey Graham said      to cheers, ``If you fought in Iraq, it worked. It's not your      fault it's going to hell. It's Obama's fault.''       The Islamic State is but one of the Middle East's problems      of recent years. The hopes for a more democratic region      engendered by the Arab Spring, have been dashed. Egypt is now      more of a military dictatorship than it was under President      Hosni Mubarak. Without dictator Muammar Gaddafi, Libya is now      awash with weapons, without a functioning government and      ruled by tribes. Syria is still in the throes of a three year      unresolved civil war, with an estimated 150,000, dead. As      Iran and Saudi Arabia violently vie for dominance in Lebanon,      Syria, Iraq and Yemen, indisputably the Middle East is more      unstable than it was seven years ago.       Yet just as the world economy was in a deep depression      after the market crash of '08, when Obama took office so too      was the Middle East in turmoil--mostly because of the 2003      American invasion of Iraq.       As they seek to shift the blame of Iraq, which just last      year conservative pundit George Will wrote was ``the worst      foreign policy decision in U.S. history,'' Republicans are      asking us to forget the past. I don't doubt that some already      have. In the era of Twitter, YouTube and Instagram, seven      years may seem like an eternity. But not everyone will      forget.       Former Florida Governor Jeb Bush found this out on a recent      campaign stop, when Ivy Ziedrich, a Nevada college student      confronted him with the charge, ``Your brother created      ISIS.'' Bush's response was, ``ISIS didn't exist when my      brother was president.''       It is accurate that the name Islamic State was not in use      during the George W. Bush presidency. But the movement that      later became ISIS was a direct result of the American      invasion. That group called itself ``al Qaida in Iraq.'' It      was led by the fanatic Abu Musab al-Zarkawi, and was      responsible for hundreds of bombings, kidnappings and      beheadings--yes beheadings--in a reign of terror which made      Zarqawi the most wanted man in Iraq. His goal was to rid Iraq      of foreign forces, and to provoke sectarian conflict between      Iraq's Shiite majority and his own Sunni Muslim sect.       Zarqawi was killed in an American bombing raid in 2006. But      nine years ago, the Washington Post reported, ``Analysts      warned that his death may not stem the tide of the insurgency      and violence. . . . Zarqawi set up numerous semi-autonomous      terrorist cells across Iraq, many of which could continue      after his death.''       Indeed they did. And joined by numerous bitter Sunni      officers from Saddam Hussein's army, al-Qaida in Iraq      eventually morphed into the Islamic State in Iraq and Syria      (ISIS.) Its current leader is an Iraqi named Abu Bakr al      Baghdadi, who claims to be the caliph (supreme leader) of the      new Islamic State.       But ISIS is by no means the only bi-product of the American      invasion of Iraq. When Iraqi President Saddam Hussein and his      Sunni dominated regime were overthrown by American military      might, there were no happier people than the Shiite mullahs      of Iran. Saddam had initiated the bloody eight     year Iran-Iraq war. Without Saddam on its border to worry      about, Iran was now free to encourage the Iraqi Shiite      majority to assume power over their Sunni and Kurdish      minorities. Thus a Shiite led Iraq became a major ally of      Iran in its power struggle with Sunni Saudi Arabia. And that      Sunni-Shiite battle for regional domination is at the root of      most of the current sectarian violence in the Middle East.       (This reminds me of the credibly sourced story that      surfaced years ago. Evidently after meeting with the      president on the eve of the Iraq invasion, one of the Iraqi      exiles who strongly encouraged American intervention was      nevertheless shocked that Mr. Bush did not seem to understand      the difference between Sunnis and Shiites.)       But let's set aside all this troublesome history. What is      it that Republicans want to do--in the future--to resolve the      problem of the Islamic State?       Most of them apparently feel that in 2016, American voters      will want their president to get really tough with ISIS. So      far, the rhetoric has been overblown and viable alternatives      seem in short supply.       Senator Marco Rubio (R-FLA), when speaking to the Freedom      Forum of South Carolina, used a line from the movie      ``Taken'', in explaining what he would do with the      terrorists. ``We will look for you. We will find you. And we      will kill you.''       Former Senator Rick Santorum of Pennsylvania said at a      recent meeting in Iowa. ``They want to bring back the 7th      century of jihad. So here's my suggestion: We load up our      bombers, and we bomb them back to the 7th century.''       Senator Graham and most of the other candidates, seem once      again to be under the sway of the same neo-conservative,      tough-guy thinking that gave us the Iraq War. Presidential      wannabes might want to take a closer look at that war--eight      years of fighting, at one point with 162,000 U.S. troops on      the ground and substantial air and naval support nearby. The      cost was at least $2 trillion, nearly 4500 Americans killed      and hundreds of thousands seriously wounded. Yet with all      that military might and its enormous costs, the United States      did not prevail.                          ____________________
