  I am confident that I could find in the Agriculture Committee, in every other committee here, a staff member who would say after we voted something out, if they knew all of that information they probably would not have voted that way. If we operate with that as the basis for whether or not it is worthy to refer back to a committee a nomination or a piece of legislation, we are not going to get very far.  Again, I am not in any way--please let my colleague understand and the record show--I am not in any way questioning the motivation of my colleague from Mississippi. What I am suggesting is that a close look at the facts and the law makes an overwhelming and compelling case that Justice Dennis did exactly the right thing when he concluded that there was no need to recuse himself.  I see my other friend from Mississippi and my two colleagues from Louisiana, who are very interested in this, are here. I will be available if they want to ask me any more questions.  So I will in the meantime yield the floor and stand ready to answer questions if anybody has them.
