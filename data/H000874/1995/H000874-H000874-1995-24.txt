 I say to my friend that I am going to be here. As you know, I live close by, so it is easy for me. I have been here for the last 12 days in a row. I was here last Saturday and Sunday working on this budget, at the White House. You were as well. I do not know whether the gentlewoman from Ohio [Ms. Pryce] was, but we are all dedicated to doing this.  What I am saying is, common sense, it seems to me, would dictate that we simply tell the Government, ``You are going to operate until January 2 and we are going to continue to stay here and work.'' You do not need to recess from day to day to do that. You can adjourn, or recess, if we have a CR to accomplish that objective.
