Chairman, I think to close debate it is important for us to focus on what a statute of repose is. A statute of repose is a limit during which period a lawsuit can be filed alleging negligence in the manufacture of that product.  The statute of repose here that is proposed is 15 years. That means that the product will have to be on the market and be used for 15 years, during which period of time a lawsuit can be filed and the manufacturer exposes himself to liability.  Is not 15 years long enough? If the product is defective, should not that defect become apparent within a 15-year period of time? I think the answer to that question is yes.  The gentleman from Ohio [Mr. Oxley] has correctly stated that the 15-year statute of repose that is proposed in this bill is the longest of the State statutes of repose. So by federalizing this issue, we are in effect extending the time for which lawsuits can be filed in most States.  The amendment that the gentleman from Illinois is proposing is one that is very important, and that is taking out this last sentence, which was put in the statute of repose section by mistake, that says that if there is a penny of copayment or a penny of a deductible, then there is no statute of repose whatsoever, no limitation on when the lawsuit can be brought.                              {time}  1345  That will mean much higher product liability insurance premiums that manufacturers will have to pay. Who pays those product liability insurance premiums? We all do, as consumers, because those premiums are a cost of doing business. They are folded into the cost of the product.  By passing this amendment and establishing a standard of repose, we can lower those premiums, and thus lower the cost to our constituents. I urge an ``aye'' vote.
