President, in just a few moments Senator Landrieu is going to come to the floor to talk about the small business bill, and I will just say a word or two about my support for her efforts.  She did something extraordinary last week. She is a determined Senator, and the time came when she wanted to see a fund created to lend money to small businesses. So she took to that desk and grabbed her charts and stayed there all day until she got the job done. She got 60 votes, which is a daunting task sometimes in the Senate, and added into this bill a fund to loan money to small businesses across America.  We need it. We need it across America, and we need it in Illinois.
