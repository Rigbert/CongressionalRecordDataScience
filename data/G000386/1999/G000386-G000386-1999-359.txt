 President, I am pleased to support this amendment with my colleagues, Senator Collins, Senator Sessions, and others. This amendment will offer freedom of choice to millions of Americans and will ensure they have access to a wide range of providers.  Our amendment would provide individuals with the option of choosing a point-of-service plan when no such option exits. I support this because I want to give people choice and the ability to go out of network if they need to. They may have to pay more for this freedom, but they should at least have this protection if they want it.  I have been a long-standing supporter of the point-of-service option. This provision was part of my Medicare patients' bill of rights in 1997. I also supported a similar amendment offered by Senator Helms on the Senate floor several years ago.  I believe people should have this option when they are willing to pay for it. Point-of-service provides people with the security of insurance coverage to see providers outside the plan if they need to. Many people are will to pay for this extra security. But for people who don't want to pay for this, they won't have to. They can choose another plan that better suits their needs.  In addition, this amendment ensures that managed care plans do not discriminate against any class of providers, such as chiropractors or optometrists. This is important to patients because it ensures they have access to certain providers or services they prefer who may be left out of the network. Classes of providers, who are not medical doctors, are sometimes excluded from participating in managed care plans to restrict patients' access to their services. Our amendment would ensure this does not happen by prohibiting plans from discriminating against any class of providers who are licensed to practice in their state.  This amendment is about choice, freedom, and security. It is about allowing patients to choose a plan or provider that best meets their health care needs. I hope my colleagues on both sides of the aisle will vote in favor of these very important patient protections.  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Thomas).
