Chairman, I will say with all due respect to my friend from Florida, your side of the aisle is unbelievably concerned with anything that Hillary Clinton may have had any relationship to over the last 29 years of her life.  Mr. Chairman, in closing, I believe we can extricate ourselves from these horns of dilemma on which I do not believe we are hoist. I say to my friend that I think we can reject your amendment or perhaps you would withdraw it. We could reject your amendment and pursue the proper investigation, so that we have a fully funded program that we all think is important, and at the same time make sure it is being run properly.
