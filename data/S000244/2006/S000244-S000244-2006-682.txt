Speaker, I move to suspend the rules and agree to the concurrent resolution (H. Con. Res. 367) honoring and praising the National Society of the Sons of the American Revolution on the 100th anniversary of being granted its Congressional Charter.  The Clerk read as follows:                            H. Con. Res. 367       Whereas the National Society of the Sons of the American      Revolution (in this resolution referred to as the ``SAR'')      was founded on April 30, 1889, and chartered by Congress 100      years ago on June 9, 1906;       Whereas the Charter was signed by Theodore Roosevelt,      himself a member of the SAR;       Whereas the SAR was conceived as a fraternal and civic      society composed of lineal descendants of the men who      wintered at Valley Forge, signed the Declaration of      Independence, fought in the battles of the American      Revolution, served in the Continental Congress, or otherwise      supported the cause of American Independence;       Whereas 16 American Presidents have been proud members of      the SAR;       Whereas the Charter of National Society of the Sons of the      American Revolution describes the objects and purposes of the      Society as ``. . . patriotic, historical and educational''      and that it is charged with perpetuating the memory of the      men who, by their services or sacrifices during the war of      the American Revolution, achieved the independence of the      American people;       Whereas the Society is also dedicated to inspiring its      members and the community at large with a more profound      reference for the principles of the Government founded by our      forefathers and to encourage historical research about the      American Revolution;       Whereas the SAR has a long record of accomplishments in      teaching about the Revolutionary War and those who gained our      freedom during the War for Independence;       Whereas it is largely through efforts by the SAR in the      late 1800s and early 1900s that the National Archives were      established to gather the records of the men who fought and      provided services during the Revolutionary War;       Whereas the SAR advances its mission through commemorations      of battles and events that led to our freedom;       Whereas the SAR devotes a great deal of its time, energy,      and resources to working with children so that they might      have a better understanding of the history of the United      States;       Whereas the SAR is currently working to establish a Center      for Advancing America's Heritage adjacent to its national      headquarters in Louisville, Kentucky; and       Whereas the SAR's almost 27,000 members are organized in      Chapters throughout the 50 States and the District of      Columbia and in several countries overseas that helped the      American Colonies gain their freedom: Now, therefore, be it       Resolved by the House of Representatives (the Senate      concurring), That the Congress--       (1) recognizes the 100th anniversary of the historic      Congressional Charter of the National Society of the Sons of      the American Revolution; and       (2) honors and praises the National Society of the Sons of      the American Revolution on the occasion of its anniversary      for its work to perpetuate and honor the memory of the brave      men who fought to gain our freedom during the Revolutionary      War and for the Society's unfailing devotion to our Nation's      youth.
