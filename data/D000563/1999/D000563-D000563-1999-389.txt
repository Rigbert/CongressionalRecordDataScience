We were so despondent that we were going to really change the constitutional framework. That failed by one vote.  Two years later--the Senator from Delaware is right--somehow or another, the Republican Party is searching for its roots and searching for its identity. It has now gone beyond the era of Gingrich and Dole, and it is trying to find out what it stands for anymore. As the Senator from Delaware said, they used to stand for fiscal conservatism. We have a trillion-dollar tax cut, primarily for the wealthiest people, that will divert funds that could be spent to retire the national debt, a debt of over $5 trillion, which costs us a billion dollars a day in interest. We collect taxes from American families--payroll taxes--for a billion dollars a day in interest.  Would the Republicans join the Democrats and say our first priority is to eliminate this debt? No. Instead, they are saying our first priority is tax breaks for the higher income individuals, which could endanger the economy.  I think this Republican Party is searching for identity. I think the Democrats have a situation that I would like to test in an election. If this were a referendum, as in parliamentary forms of government, I would like to take this question to the American people: Do you want a trillion-dollartax break for the wealthiest people over the Democratic approach to take whatever surplus we have and put it into Social Security, put it into Medicare, and bring down the national debt?  I think ours is a sounder approach. I ask the Senator from Delaware, in his experience in history and in American politics, has he ever seen the world turn so upside down that we Democrats are now the fiscal conservatives?
