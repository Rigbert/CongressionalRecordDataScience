Chairman, I thank my distinguished friend from West Virginia (Mr. Mollohan), the ranking member of the subcommittee for yielding me the time, and I rise in strong support of his amendment.  I want to say at the outset that I believe that the chairman of this subcommittee is not necessarily in theory opposed to the dollars being added back and, therefore, I think in terms of substance, we can all support this amendment.  The ranking member, the gentleman from West Virginia (Mr. Mollohan) will argue that we are constrained by funding priorities, but I believe that this is a priority. I believe that is why the gentleman from West Virginia (Mr. Mollohan) has offered it. If we think NASA's work is confined to scientific esoterica that only a handful of Ph.D.s can understand, we need to think again. Research and development conducted by NASA for our space program has led to widespread social benefits, everything from improvements in commercial airline safety to understanding global climate change.                              {time}  1500  NASA's research also has benefited medical science. For example, its research on the cardiovascular systems is leading to breakthrough discoveries, testing procedures and treatments for heart disease. A few of today's space-derived improvements include blood pressure monitors, self-adjusting pacemakers and ultrasound images. You would not think of that at first blush. The amendment before us would restore $322.7 million in funding for NASA's space and aeronautical programs, funding that was cut in committee from the President's number.  The amendment before us brings our national priorities back into focus, which is, in my opinion, what we ought to do. It would restore $260 million to NASA's space launch initiative, which is critical for our future space needs. In addition, this amendment would restore $16.6 million in funding for NASA's Living with a Star initiative, a project that will be run at Goddard Space Flight Center.  Mr. Speaker, the tapestry of our national history is woven together by exploration and discovery, from the first settlers in Jamestown to the expeditions of Lewis and Clark, to Neil Armstrong's first step on the Moon 31 years ago. Today, let us reaffirm our national commitment to the latest frontier, science and technology.  I urge my colleagues to support this amendment.  Mr. Chairman, let me state my strong support for this amendment on NASA funding. It's not about pork-barrel spending and pet projects. It's about our Nation's peace and prosperity, and our quality of life.  If you think that NASA's work is confined to scientific esoterica that only a handful of PhDs can understand, think again.  Research and development conducted by NASA for our space program has led to widespread social benefits--everything from improvements in commercial airline safety to understanding global climate change.  NASA's research also has benefitted medical science. For example, its research on the cardiovascular system is leading to breakthrough discoveries, testing procedures and treatments for heart disease. A few of today's space-derived improvements include blood pressure monitors, self-adjusting pacemakers and ultrasound images.  The amendment before us would restore $322.7 million in funding to NASA's space and aeronautical programs--funding that was cut in committee. That's certainly a lot of money. However, before I describe the NASA programs that would be forced into a stare down with the budget ax, and why funding for these programs ought to be restored, let me ask this question: Are our national priorities so out of whack that we're willing to sacrifice our commitment to science and technology on the altar of enormous and irresponsible tax cuts? Despite the pioneering spirit that courses through our national character, the majority party apparently thinks so.  Last year, they pushed their huge tax cut scheme through Congress, even though it could have put at risk the healthiest economy in our lifetimes. This year, they're back with equally irresponsible tax schemes.  That's what this cut to NASA funding is all about--funding tax cuts that would benefit the wealthiest among us.  The Republican Party--with its $175 billion in tax cuts over five years, which, according to some estimates, would rise to nearly $1 trillion over 10 years--has to make its budget numbers add up somehow.  Today, NASA's neck is stretched out on the chopping block. Yesterday, it was our school modernization and class-size reduction efforts. And tomorrow, it will be our initiative to put more police officers on our streets.  All of these vital programs--and our effort to add a prescription drug benefit to Medicare--face the budget ax because the Republican Party would rather pass tax-cut schemes than invest in our Nation's future.  The amendment before us brings our national priorities back into focus. It would restore $260 million to NASA's space launch initiative, which is critical for our future in space. Safe, low-cost space transportation is the key to expanded commercial development and civil exploration of space. This NASA program would enable new opportunities in space exploration and enhance international competitiveness of the U.S. commercial launch industry. It's no wonder that NASA believes this program could impact space exploration and commerce as deeply as the Apollo program.  This amendment also would restore $16.6 million in funding for NASA's Living With a Star initiative--a project that will be run at Goddard Space Flight Center in my district. The Living With a Star initiative will enhance our understanding of the Sun and its impact on Earth and the environment. It will enable scientists to predict solar weather more accurately, and understand how solar variations affect civilian and military space systems, human space flight, electric power grids, high-frequency radio communications, and long-range radar.  In addition, this amendment would restore $46.1 million in funding for two programs that are developing solutions to expensive delays in commercial airline traffic. NASA uses its unique research capabilities to diagnose problems with current air traffic systems and develop technology solutions.  Mr. Chairman, the tapestry of our national history is woven together by exploration and discovery--from the first settlers in Jamestown to the expeditions of Lewis and Clark to Neil Armstrong's first step on the Moon 31 years ago. We have never turned our backs on challenge. We have never been content with the status quo. We have always dared to peer over the next horizon.  Today' let's reaffirm our national commitment to the latest frontier, science and technology. I urge my colleagues to support this amendment.
