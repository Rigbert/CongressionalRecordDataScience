Speaker, I wish to inform my colleagues and those who are listening this evening of the publication of an excellent new report called Made in China, released by Charles Kernaghan, of New York City. This report can be found at web site www.nlcnet.org. It talks about the role of U.S. companies in denying human and worker rights in China.  The report begins, ``For years, and now again with renewed vigor, U.S. companies have claimed that their mere presence in China would help open that society to American values.'' And it talks about ``Recent in-depth investigations,'' conducted by individuals in China, at great risk to themselves, ``of 16 factories in China producing car stereos, bikes, shoes, sneakers, clothing, TVs, hats and bags for some of the largest U.S. companies clearly demonstrate that Wal-Mart, Nike, Huffy and others and their contractors in China continue to systematically violate the most fundamental human and worker rights, while paying subsistence wages.''  The report talks about Kathie Lee handbags being made for Wal-Mart at the Qin Shi factory where 1,000 workers were being held under conditions of indentured servitude in that Communist country forced to work 12-to-14-hour days 7 days a week with only one day off a month while earning an average of 3 cents an hour. However, after months of work, 46 percent of the workers surveyed have earned nothing at all. In fact, they owed money to the company.  This report is absolutely amazing, and I would urge all my colleagues to take a look at the firms mentioned in this book.  I also want to refer this evening to one in particular, Huffy Bicycles, which had been manufactured in my own State of Ohio, where 2,000 people lost their jobs, people who were earning $11 an hour, making a quality product. They were asked by their company to take a $2 an hour wage cut in Salina, Ohio, and they did, earning $9 an hour, because they wanted to keep their jobs. And I might say that Huffy has 80 percent of the U.S. bicycle market. Those jobs were moved to China. They were testing the waters in China. This is even before this proposal here to have permanent normal trade relations with China.  Why should we approve of a system which does the following? Huffy uses a contractor in China, the Taiwanese Zhenzhen Nan Guan Corporation in Bicycle Factory Number 1. There is also a Bicycle Factory Number 2. They assemble these bikes from parts supplied from local materials, from local factories, or from the Fuda Corporation from Taiwan. The workers in this factory work from 8 in the morning until 9:30 or 11:30 at night. They work 7 days a week. They earn 25 cents to 41 cents per hour for a weekly wage of $16.68 for a 66-hour workweek.  Think about that. And if they do not work the mandatory overtime, they are penalized double. They lose $6.02 of their weekly wage, or 2 full days of wage if they refuse to work the overtime.  Not only that, but the quality of the bicycle has gone down. If we go to Kmart, if we go to these retail outlets and we buy a Huffy bike, it still costs $100, but look at the welds. The double welds that used to exist on the fenders, which our workers were very proud of their work in the State of Ohio, they know good metal and they know good quality workmanship, that does not exist any more. The quality of metals has gone down.  And when we try to find if the bearings are good or we try to figure out before we buy it whether the bike is of quality, everything is sprayed with paint now. We really cannot tell the quality of the workmanship until we buy the bicycle. Huffy does not stand for quality any more.  I will never get one of their campaign contributions, but what they did to the workers in Salina, Ohio, to me, is repugnant. And I think to have this kind of indentured servitude, for America to approve anything permanent with China, until we fix situations like this, really undermines the fundamental liberties and principles for which this Nation should stand domestically and internationally.  And let me add a word as a graduate of the University of Michigan. Two weeks ago the University of Michigan Board of Trustees, along with Brown University and the University of Oregon, refused to sign contracts with Nike Corporation, which is also talked about in this excellent report. And they did that because all the university boards of trustees asked to do was that the sports departments not buy sports equipment from sweat shop labor in places like China. Those companies were so angry that they cut off $26 million to the University of Michigan's endowment as well as the University of Oregon and Brown University.  Well, Mr. Speaker, my hat is off to those university boards. The presidents of those universities, including Gordon Gee of Brown University. They did the right thing for the world, the right thing for America. Their moral courage will stand on its own.                          ____________________
