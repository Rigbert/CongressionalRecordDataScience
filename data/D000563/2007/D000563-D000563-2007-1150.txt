. sanctions or even multilateral U.S. sanctions, but together these steps might work. Hundreds of thousands of people in Darfur have been killed, and millions have been driven from their homes. It is too late to repeat the empty promise of ``never again,'' but we can at least live up to the pledge of no more.  I am reminded of my former colleague, boss, and mentor, Paul Simon of Illinois, who in 1994 joined Senator Jim Jeffords in asking that troops be sent to Rwanda to try to stop the massacre. We were told that 5,000 soldiers could have stopped that massacre of 800,000 innocent people. No action was taken. These innocent people died. Senator Simon and Senator Jeffords did their best to try to call the attention of Congress and the Government and the world to what was happening in that nation, to no avail.  But they can at least take satisfaction--the late Paul Simon and Jim Jeffords--that they did their best as Members of the Senate. So many of my colleagues on both sides of the aisle joined me in this bipartisan effort to call attention to the genocide in Darfur and to urge our Government to take decisive, meaningful action as quickly as possible to spare these suffering people.  I yield the floor.                               Exhibit 2                     [From the Wall Street Journal]                         The Genocide Olympics                    (By Ronan Farrow and Mia Farrow)       ``One World, One Dream'' is China's slogan for its 2008      Olympics. But there is one nightmare that China shouldn't be      allowed to sweep under the rug. That nightmare is Darfur,      where more than 400,000 people have been killed and more than      two-and-a-half million driven from flaming villages by the      Chinese-backed government of Sudan.       That so many corporate sponsors want the world to look away      from that atrocity during the games is bad enough. But      equally disappointing is the decision of artists like      director Steven Spielberg--who quietly visited China this      month as he prepares to help stage the Olympic ceremonies--to      sanitize Beijing's image. Is Mr. Spielberg, who in 1994      founded the Shoah Foundation to record the testimony of      survivors of the holocaust, aware that China is bankrolling      Darfur's genocide?       China is pouring billions of dollars into Sudan. Beijing      purchases an overwhelming majority of Sudan's annual oil      exports and state-owned China National Petroleum Corp.--an      official partner of the upcoming Olympic Games--owns the      largest shares in each of Sudan's two major oil consortia.      The Sudanese government uses as much as 80% of proceeds from      those sales to fund its brutal Janjaweed proxy militia and      purchase their instruments of destruction: bombers, assault      helicopters, armored vehicles and small arms, most of them of      Chinese manufacture. Airstrips constructed and operated by      the Chinese have been used to launch bombing campaigns on      villages. And China has used its veto power on the U.N.      Security Council to repeatedly obstruct efforts by the U.S.      and the U.K. to introduce peacekeepers to curtail the      slaughter.       As one of the few players whose support is indispensable to      Sudan, China has the power to, at the very least, insist that      Khartoum accept a robust international peacekeeping force to      protect defenseless civilians in Darfur. Beijing is uniquely      positioned to put a stop to the slaughter, yet they have so      far been unabashed in their refusal to do so.       But there is now one thing that China may hold more dear      than their unfettered access to Sudanese oil: their      successful staging of the 2008 Summer Olympics. That desire      may provide a lone point of leverage with a country that has      otherwise been impervious to all criticism.       Whether that opportunity goes unexploited lies in the hands      of the high-profile supporters of these Olympic Games.      Corporate sponsors like Johnson & Johnson, Coca-Cola, General      Electric and McDonalds, and key collaborators like Mr.      Spielberg, should be put on notice. For there is another      slogan afoot, one that is fast becoming viral amongst      advocacy groups; rather than ``One World, One Dream,'' people      are beginning to speak of the coming ``Genocide Olympics.''       Does Mr. Spielberg really want to go down in history as the      Leni Riefenstahl of the Beijing Games? Do the various      television sponsors around the world want to share in that      shame? Because they will. Unless, of course, all of them add      their singularly well-positioned voices to the growing calls      for Chinese action to end the slaughter in Darfur.       Imagine if such calls were to succeed in pushing the      Chinese government to use its leverage over Sudan to protect      civilians in Darfur. The 2008 Beijing Olympics really could      become an occasion for pride and celebration, a truly      international honoring of the authentic spirit of ``one      world'' and ``one dream.''
