 President, on behalf of the Chairman of the Budget Committee, who is necessarily absent, I submit his budget statement and scoring table on S. 2593, the Department of Defense appropriations bill.  I support S. 2593, the Defense appropriations bill for fiscal year 2001. As scored by the Congressional Budget Office without any further adjustments, the pending bill provides $287.6 billion in total budget authority and $178.9 billion in new outlays for the Department of Defense and related activities. When adjusted for outlays from prior years, the bill totals $277.2 billion in outlays.  The bill, as reported, is consistent with the level of budget authority made available by the 2001 congressional budget resolution. It is also within the allocation of budget authority and outlays made available pursuant to section 302(b) of the Congressional Budget Act of 1974.  S. 2593 provides a 2.4 percent increase in overall procurement spending, a 4.5 percent increase in research and development, and a 0.4 percent increase in Operations and Maintenance.  I support this bill, and I urge its adoption. I want to complement the chairman of the Appropriations Committee for his work on this legislation.  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that a Senate Budget Committee table displaying the budget impact of this bill be placed in the Record.  There being no objection, the table was ordered to be printed in the Record, as follows:  S. 2593, DEFENSE APPROPRIATIONS, 2001--SPENDING COMPARISONS--SENATE-                              REPORTED BILL               [Fiscal year 2001, in millions of dollars]------------------------------------------------------------------------                                            General                                            purpose  Mandatory    Total------------------------------------------------------------------------Senate-reported bill:  Budget authority.......................   287,415        216   287,631  Outlays................................   276,959        216   277,175Senate 302(b) allocation:  Budget authority.......................   287,415        216   287,631  Outlays................................   279,578        216   279,7942000 level:  Budget authority.......................   268,605        209   268,814  Outlays................................   261,933        209   262,142President's request:  Budget authority.......................   284,305        216   284,521  Outlays................................   275,871        216   276,087 SENATE-REPORTED BILL COMPARED TO: Senate 302(b) allocation:  Budget authority.......................  ........  .........  ........
