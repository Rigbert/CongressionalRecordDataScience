 President, Senators can expect rollcall votes throughout Wednesday's session as the Senate attempts to complete work on the first concurrent budget resolution. The majority leader states that he is still hopeful that the Democratic leader will join him in an effort to yield back much of the statutory time limitation for the budget resolution. All Members will be notified accordingly as any votes are ordered with respect to any amendments to this important legislation. Again, on behalf of the majority leader, I want to remind all Members that this is the last week prior to the Memorial Day recess, so we will appreciate all Members' cooperation in scheduling of votes and of other floor action. The majority leader expresses thanks to all Members for their attention.                          ____________________
