SEC. 206. INFORMATION SHARING.       (a) Definitions.--In this section:       (1) Advisory board.--The term ``Advisory Board'' means the      Advisory Board on Information Sharing established under      subsection (i).       (2) Executive council.--The term ``Executive Council''      means the Executive Council on Information Sharing      established under subsection (h).       (3) Homeland security information.--The term ``homeland      security information'' means all information, whether      collected, produced, or distributed by intelligence, law      enforcement, military, homeland security, or other activities      relating to--       (A) the existence, organization, capabilities, plans,      intentions, vulnerabilities, means of finance or material      support, or activities of foreign or international terrorist      groups or individuals, or of domestic groups or individuals      involved in transnational terrorism;       (B) threats posed by such groups or individuals to the      United States, United States persons, or United States      interests, or to those of other nations;       (C) communications of or by such groups or individuals; or       (D) groups or individuals reasonably believed to be      assisting or associated with such groups or individuals.       (4) Network.--The term ``Network'' means the Information      Sharing Network described under subsection (c).       (b) Findings.--Consistent with the report of the National      Commission on Terrorist Attacks upon the United States,      Congress makes the following findings:       (1) The effective use of information, from all available      sources, is essential to the fight against terror and the      protection of our homeland. The biggest impediment to all-     source analysis, and to a greater likelihood of ``connecting      the dots'', is resistance to sharing information.       (2) The United States Government has access to a vast      amount of information, including not only traditional      intelligence but also other government databases, such as      those containing customs or immigration information. However,      the United States Government has a weak system for processing      and using the information it has.       (3) In the period preceding September 11, 2001, there were      instances of potentially helpful information that was      available but that no person knew to ask for; information      that was distributed only in compartmented channels, and      information that was requested but could not be shared.       (4) Current security requirements nurture over-     classification and excessive compartmentalization of      information among agencies. Each agency's incentive structure      opposes sharing, with risks, including criminal, civil, and      administrative sanctions, but few rewards for sharing      information.       (5) The current system, in which each intelligence agency      has its own security practices, requires a demonstrated      ``need to know'' before sharing. This approach assumes that      it is possible to know, in advance, who will need to use the      information. An outgrowth of the cold war, such a system      implicitly assumes that the risk of inadvertent disclosure      outweighs the benefits of wider sharing. Such assumptions are      no longer appropriate. Although counterintelligence concerns      are still real, the costs of not sharing information are also      substantial. The current ``need-to-know'' culture of      information protection needs to be replaced with a ``need-to-     share'' culture of integration.       (6) A new approach to the sharing of intelligence and      homeland security information is urgently needed. An      important conceptual model for a new ``trusted information      network'' is the Systemwide Homeland Analysis and Resource      Exchange (SHARE) Network proposed by a task force of leading      professionals assembled by the Markle Foundation and      described in reports issued in October 2002 and December      2003.       (7) No single agency can create a meaningful information      sharing system on its own. Alone, each agency can only      modernize stovepipes, not replace them. Presidential      leadership is required to bring about governmentwide change.       (c) Information Sharing Network.--       (1) Establishment.--The President shall establish a trusted      information network and secure information sharing      environment to promote sharing of intelligence and homeland      security information in a manner consistent with national      security and the protection of privacy and civil liberties,      and based on clearly defined and consistently applied      policies and procedures, and valid investigative, analytical      or operational requirements.       (2) Attributes.--The Network shall promote coordination,      communication and collaboration of people and information      among all relevant Federal departments and agencies, State,      tribal, and local authorities, and relevant private sector      entities, including owners and operators of critical      infrastructure, by using policy guidelines and technologies      that support--       (A) a decentralized, distributed, and coordinated      environment that connects existing systems where appropriate      and allows users to share information among agencies, between      levels of government, and, as appropriate, with the private      sector;       (B) the sharing of information in a form and manner that      facilitates its use in analysis, investigations and      operations;       (C) building upon existing systems capabilities currently      in use across the Government;       (D) utilizing industry best practices, including minimizing      the centralization of data and seeking to use common tools      and capabilities whenever possible;       (E) employing an information access management approach      that controls access to data rather than to just networks;       (F) facilitating the sharing of information at and across      all levels of security by using policy guidelines and      technologies that support writing information that can be      broadly shared;       (G) providing directory services for locating people and      information;       (H) incorporating protections for individuals' privacy and      civil liberties;       (I) incorporating strong mechanisms for information      security and privacy and civil liberties guideline      enforcement in order to enhance accountability and facilitate      oversight, including--       (i) multifactor authentication and access control;       (ii) strong encryption and data protection;       (iii) immutable audit capabilities;       (iv) automated policy enforcement;       (v) perpetual, automated screening for abuses of network      and intrusions; and       (vi) uniform classification and handling procedures;       (J) compliance with requirements of applicable law and      guidance with regard to the planning, design, acquisition,      operation, and management of information systems; and       (K) permitting continuous system upgrades to benefit from      advances in technology while preserving the integrity of      stored data.       (d) Immediate Actions.--Not later than 90 days after the      date of the enactment of this Act, the Director of the Office      of Management and Budget, in consultation with the Executive      Council, shall--       (1) submit to the President and to Congress a description      of the technological, legal, and policy issues presented by      the creation of the Network described in subsection (c), and      the way in which these issues will be addressed;       (2) establish electronic directory services to assist in      locating in the Federal Government intelligence and homeland      security information and people with relevant knowledge about      intelligence and homeland security information; and       (3) conduct a review of relevant current Federal agency      capabilities, including--       (A) a baseline inventory of current Federal systems that      contain intelligence or homeland security information;       (B) the money currently spent to maintain those systems;      and       (C) identification of other information that should be      included in the Network.       (e) Guidelines and Requirements.--As soon as possible, but      in no event later than 180 days after the date of the      enactment of this Act, the President shall--       (1) in consultation with the Executive Council--       (A) issue guidelines for acquiring, accessing, sharing, and      using information, including guidelines to ensure that      information is provided in its most shareable form, such as      by separating out data from the sources and methods by which      that data are obtained; and       (B) on classification policy and handling procedures across      Federal agencies, including commonly accepted processing and      access controls;       (2) in consultation with the Privacy and Civil Liberties      Oversight Board established under section 211, issue      guidelines that--       (A) protect privacy and civil liberties in the development      and use of the Network; and       (B) shall be made public, unless, and only to the extent      that, nondisclosure is clearly necessary to protect national      security; and       (3) require the heads of Federal departments and agencies      to promote a culture of information sharing by--       (A) reducing disincentives to information sharing,      including overclassification of information and unnecessary      requirements for originator approval; and       (B) providing affirmative incentives for information      sharing, such as the incorporation of information sharing      performance measures into agency and managerial evaluations,      and employee awards for promoting innovative information      sharing practices.       (f) Enterprise Architecture and Implementation Plan.--Not      later than 270 days after the date of the enactment of this      Act, the Director of Management and Budget shall submit to      the President and to Congress an enterprise architecture and      implementation plan for the Network.
