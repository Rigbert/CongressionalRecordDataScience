 Mr. President, I salute my colleague from Minnesota. I know he is leaving the floor. I came in at the end of his remarks. I know he was responding to the President's State of the Union Address and probably has another meeting to go to, but he captured my sentiment on this completely.  I think what we have to look at now is what is in the best interest of this Nation in terms of the long haul. We have just finished the 20th century which we called the ``American Century.'' Will the 21st century be an American century? I think some of the decisions we are making today will decide that.  I think the Senator from Minnesota put his finger on it: What are the most important things for the future of families in America? I think over and over they tell us: Education, Senator, Congressman, Governor. We want you to do something about education.  I heard the President talk about education last night. I think the Senator from Minnesota believes, as I do, there is a lot we can do to make this a stronger nation in this century, but it means an investment in education. If we decide, instead, that we are going to give a tax cut primarily to the wealthiest people in America instead of investing in education, instead of expanding health care coverage, instead of protecting Social Security and Medicare, then it is very shortsighted.  The President's remarks were well received. I thought he did an excellent job in his first State of the Union Address. But now it is time to step back and reflect. We not only reflect on his remarks, but we reflect on his record in Texas where he tried the same thing--a tax cut that did not work, a State that is now out of money. We do not want to go down that same road.  I thank the Senator from Minnesota for his remarks.
