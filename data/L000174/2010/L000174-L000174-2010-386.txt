President, I rise today to pay tribute to a dedicated public servant in Vermont who passed away earlier this month.  Ralph Jackman joined the Vergennes Volunteer Fire Department in 1947, and took over the helm as chief of the department in 1954. Some 55 years later, in November 2009, he stepped down from his post--widely recognized as one of the longest serving fire chiefs in the Nation.  During his time as the chief, Jackman saw many changes at the fire department. The department grew immensely-- doubling the number of firefighters and tripling the number of vehicles. He oversaw the establishment of a cadet program and the construction of a new fire station. He also found time for a variety of community service activities, including serving as the two-time president of the Vermont State Firefighters Association. Throughout his entire career, Jackman was in the thick of the action, responding to emergency calls and managing the volunteer department's operations.  Chief Jackman's family had firefighting in its blood. Jackman's twin brother Fred, who passed away in 2008, was a member of the Bristol Fire Department for 62 years, including 14 years as that department's chief. Chief Jackman's wife, as well as his five daughters, helped the Vergennes Volunteer Fire Department throughout his career. And eight of Chief Jackman's grandchildren are now firefighters.  My wife, Marcelle, and I wish to express our deepest condolences to Chief Jackman's wife, Myrle Jackman, his immediate family and his extended family in the fire service community throughout Vermont. They are rightly proud of Chief Jackman's long and distinguished career and the legacy he has left behind in Vergennes and Vermont.  I ask unanimous consent that a story from The Burlington Free Press about Chief Jackman's storied career be printed in the Record.  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in the Record, as follows:             [From the Burlington Free Press, Jan. 7, 2010]          Last Call for Chief Jackman: Hundreds Attend Funeral                           (By Matt Sutkoski)       Vergennes.--Ralph Jackman made his last fire call      Wednesday.       Jackman was chief of the Vergennes Fire Department from      1954 until November--55 years. He died Saturday at the age of      85. Services were held for him Wednesday morning.       Family, friends and more than 200 firefighters crowded into      St. Peter's Catholic Church for the services. The      firefighters came from surrounding towns and distant      communities--Addison, Whiting, Bristol, Cabot, Burlington,      Shrewsbury, East Montpelier, even Nashua, N.H.       At the service, Mark Bouvier of the Bristol Fire Department      said Jackman's whole family helped with the chief's decades-     long career. He had five daughters, and when they were      growing up and a fire call came into the Jackman home in the      middle of the night, everyone sprang into action. One      daughter would answer the phone, others would make sure his      gear was ready for him; another would open the garage door.      ``He needed all his daughters to get ready for fire calls,''      Bouvier said.       Firefighting runs in the Jackman family blood. His twin      brother Fred, who died in 2008, was a member of the Bristol      Fire Department for 62 years and was chief for 14 of those      years. Eight of Ralph Jackman's grandchildren are      firefighters.       Jackman was one of the nation's longest serving fire      chiefs, and he was often in the forefront of Vermont      firefighting innovations, Bouvier said. Under Jackman, the      Vergennes Fire Department was the first to acquire a hose-     reel truck and the first to establish a cadet program.       As great a contribution Jackman made to the Vergennes Fire      Department, he thought of all the city's residents, Bouvier      said. He'd give fuel oil to needy residents during the time      he owned a fuel business. Somebody else might get a warm coat      from him, and he was heavily involved in a variety of      charitable organizations until the end of his life, Bouvier      said.       The Rev. Yvon Royer, officiating at the Mass, also took      note of Jackman's lifelong contributions. ``He was a true      icon of the community. It was a respect that was earned,''      Royer said.       After the service, with an honor guard of firefighters      saluting, Jackman's American flag-draped coffin was loaded      onto the back of Vergennes Fire Pumper Truck 316. Led by a      contingent of Vergennes firefighters and followed by      Jackman's family and friends, the truck bearing the coffin      rolled slowly up Maple Street, turned right on Main, then      right again onto Green Street to the Vergennes fire station.       The fire truck, parked in front of the station, then      blasted its horn three times to ceremonially mark Jackman's      final alarm.                          ____________________
