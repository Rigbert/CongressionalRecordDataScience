Speaker, I rise to honor the memory of Kevin Jefferson, a lifelong community leader and public servant. Through his work on issues from voter registration to gun control community empowerment, and through his service as an Itinerant Elder in the African Methodist Episcopal Church, Kevin made a lasting difference for the better in the time that he was given.  Kevin began his career in public service early as a student at Bowie State, where he played an active role in student life. After serving on Rev. Jesse L. Jackson's Presidential campaign staff in 1984 and 1988, Kevin joined the national staff of the Rainbow/PUSH Coalition, through which he promoted voter registration and education. He went on to become the first National Minority Affairs Coordinator at Handgun Control, Inc., and in this role, traveled the country to help secure support for the Brady Gun Control Bill. His leadership on these important initiatives led to his involvement with President Clinton's Presidential campaign. And in 2000, he was appointed to the Federal Emergency Management Agency, and later held numerous positions at the State Department. Kevin also served as Special Assistant to the Secretary of Labor, Honorable Alexis Herman, and was appointed to the Office of the President, Community Empowerment Board. Throughout his lifetime, Kevin served on a number of Presidential campaigns, worked closely with the DNC and served as the Executive Director of the Democratic National Committee Voting Rights Institute. He is honored and respected by the Democratic Party for his hard work and support.  I join Kevin's family, church and all those who knew and loved Kevin in appreciation for his well-lived life and in fond reflection on his memory. I was proud to count him as a friend, and he will be dearly missed.                          ____________________
