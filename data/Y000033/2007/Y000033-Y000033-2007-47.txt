Again, I just hope you understand, this is a national forest. It only has 4 percent available. A national forest that has 4 percent. And the gentleman, the ranking member, has mentioned the fact that there's no $40 million being spent.  And by the way, this is on national land because the comment was made about the roads could be built by the persons that's doing the logging. That's true. But if it's built by that person, those roads are no longer available to the general public. And what has happened, we've built a network of roads on Prince Wales Island primarily that provide, for all the local communities, communications capability that tie in with the ferries. Those roads still belong to the United States, just not the State of Alaska. They're part of the United States road system.  And so I'm just suggesting that these roads, if it was done by just a contractor, then that right wouldn't be there. Those roads would have to be pulled up, put to rest back to the original contour.  So, again, I know who's asking you to do this. I understand it. But it's really being a little disingenuous. In fact, the roads themselves are in a different area that was on private land. This is on Federal land, not private land.  And so I respectfully again ask for a ``no'' vote on this amendment because it's the wrong thing to do for the State of Alaska and for the United States.
