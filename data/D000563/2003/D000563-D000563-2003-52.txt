 Heart disease, cancer, and strokes are the leading causes of death for people age 65 and older. According to the CDC, air pollution can be devastating to the healthiest Americans, but can be deadly for senior citizens and other vulnerable populations with these diseases. The EPA should be creating regulations that maximize health protections for everyone, especially older Americans.  However, instead of maximizing the benefits for everyone, the regulatory analysis is being manipulated in a way that makes seniors' lives, and the lives of other vulnerable populations, worth less than the lives of other Americans. This practice, commonly known as the senior death discount, devalues the lives of almost 30 million Americans who are over the age of 70.  To give you a sense of how this works, when the EPA develops environmental regulations, it must evaluate the costs and benefits of multiple regulatory alternatives. As part of the calculation of benefits, the EPA places a dollar amount on each life that can be saved by implementing each alternative. The EPA often makes a determination about which regulatory alternative to adopt based on the comparison of the benefits and costs.  Historically, the EPA valued all lives equally by using the same dollar amount for every potential life saved. But now the OMB is encouraging agencies to base the value of a life on the age of a person. In many cases, when discounting was applied, the life of each person over the age of 70 was valued at 37 percent less than the life of a younger person. In other cases, each year people aged, their lives were considered to be worth less--leading to some lives being worth a de minimus amount. In still other cases, the lives of people with illnesses or other health conditions were further devalued.  The use of the senior death discount has played a significant role in some very important environmental policies. In a rule to cut emissions from heavy diesel equipment, the EPA not only lowered the value of saving the lives of seniors, but also for children and the disabled. In the end, discounting calculations shrank the benefits from over $81 billion to just over $12 billion.  In a regulatory proposal to control air pollution from snowmobiles, the benefits were originally calculated to be approximately $77 billion by 2030. However, the health benefits dropped to only $8.8 billion--half of this decrease was due to the senior death discount and half was due to selective use of scientific studies limiting the amount of people who were affected. Applying the senior death discount in this instance made certain regulatory alternatives less appealing, and the rule was ultimately weakened as a result.  Some of my colleagues may wonder whether this amendment is still necessary, given that former EPA administrator Christine Todd Whitman said the agency would no longer discount the lives of seniors by 37 percent when calculating the benefits of regulatory policies. However, there is no guarantee that the new administrator or other agencies will follow this policy.  In addition, Whitman's remarks did not apply to other forms of discounting, which continue to be used. These other forms of discounting also reduce the benefits of important regulatory policies. Besides seniors, vulnerable populations, such as children and those with chronic illnesses and disabilities, are affected when these forms of discounting are used.  John Graham, the head of the OMB regulatory office, has backed away from his support of the 37 percent discount rate for seniors. However, as recently as June 16, he is still insisting that the value of saving lives should depend on a person's age, and he is still pushing agencies to use forms of discounting.  It seems that the end goal is to whittle down the benefits, until they are so close to the costs that regulations will be difficult to justify. So unless we take action today, it appears that the lives of vulnerable Americans will continue to be devalued.  The House already passed Congressman Allen's amendment to the House VA-HUD bill, which is similar to my amendment. Members from both sides of the aisle spoke in favor of the amendment and it was accepted unanimously. It's now time for the Senate to act.  Twenty-two national organizations, including AARP and a host of environmental and faith-based organizations, support this amendment.  Our Nation's regulatory system must use methods of analysis that produce regulations that will fairly protect all Americans from the effects of air pollution, toxic waste and other dangerous substances in our environment. We cannot afford to back away from decades of environmental laws that have improved the quality of life for all of us.
