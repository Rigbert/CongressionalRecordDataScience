I submit the following article for the Record.   (By Roy E. Barnes, Governor, to Georgia House of Representatives)       Forty years ago, faced with court orders to integrate and      with demonstrations by Georgians who wanted the University of      Georgia and the state's public schools closed instead, the      people who stood in our places did the right thing.       The schools stayed open.       And Governor Ernest Vandiver told the General Assembly      that, unless Georgia faced up to the issue and moved on, it      would ``devour progress--consuming all in its path--pitting      friend against friend demoralizing all that is good--stifling      the economic growth of the state.''       We have a great deal to be proud of as Georgians--our      history, our heritage, our state's great natural beauty--but      nothing should make us prouder than the way Georgia has led      the South by focusing on the things that unite us instead of      dwelling on those that divide us.       While the government of Arkansas used the armed forces of      the state to prevent nine black students from enrolling at      Little Rock's Central High School, while the Governor of      Alabama stood defiantly in a schoolhouse door, Georgia      quietly concentrated on growing our economy, on the goals      that bring us together rather than those that can tear us      apart.       And, in the process, Georgia established itself as the      leader of the New South.       Forty years ago, Birmingham was about the same size as      Atlanta, and Alabama's population and economy were almost as      big as ours.       Georgia moved ahead because its leaders looked ahead.       Anyone who doesn't realize that's why Georgia has become      the fastest growing state east of the Rocky Mountains does      not understand economic development.       I am a Southerner.       My wife is named May-REE.       I like collard greens with fried streak-o-lean, catfish--     tails and all, fried green tomatoes, cat head biscuits and      red eye gravy.       My heart swells with pride when I see a football game on a      crisp fall Saturday.       I still cry when I hear Amazing Grace.       My great grandfather was captured at Vicksburg fighting for      the Confederacy, and I still visit his grave in the foothills      of Gilmer County.       I am proud of him.       But I am also proud that we have come so far that my      children find it hard to believe that we ever had segregated      schools or separate water fountains labeled ``white'' and      ``colored.''       And I am proud that these changes came about because unity      prevailed over division.       Today, that same effort and energy of unity must be      exercised again.       The Confederate Battle Flag occupies two-thirds of our      current state flag.       Some argue that it is a symbol of segregation, defiance,      and white supremacy. Others that it is a testament to a brave      and valiant people who were willing to die to defend their      homes and hearth.       I am not here to settle this argument--because no one can--     but I am here because it is time to end it.       To end it before it divides us into warring camps, before      it reverses four decades of economic growth and progress,      before it deprives Georgia of its place of leadership--in      other words before it does irreparable harm to the future we      want to leave for our children.       As Governor Vandiver said four decades ago this month:      ``That is too big a price to pay for inaction.       ``The time has come when we must act--act in Georgia's      interest--act in the future interest of Georgia's youth.''       And, as Denmark Groover--Governor Marvin Griffin's floor      leader and the man who assured adoption of the current flag      in 1956 told the Rules Committee this morning:       ``This is the most divisive issue in the political      spectrum, and it must be put to rest.''       Denmark Groover is right. It is time to put this issue to      rest and to do so in the spirit of compromise.       This morning the House Rules Committee passed out a bill to      make Georgia's flag represent Georgia's history--all of      Georgia's history.       Both personally and on behalf of the people of Georgia, I      want to thank Calvin Smyre, Larry Walker, Tyrone Brooks, and      Austin Scott for their work to bring the people of Georgia      together.       The Walker Rules Committee substitute takes the original      Georgia flag--the Great Seal of Georgia set against a      background of blue--and adds a banner showing all of      Georgia's other flags. It has the National Flag of the      Confederacy and the Confederate Battle Flag, as       The bill also has a provision preserving Confederate      monuments and says our current state flag should be displayed      in events marking Georgia's role in the Confederacy.       To those who say they cannot accept this because the      Confederate flag is still in the banner, you are wrong. The      Confederacy is a part of Georgia's history.       To those who say they are opposed to this because it      changes the current flag, you are wrong also. The Confederacy      is part of our history, but it is not two-thirds of our      history.       It is time to honor my great grandfather and the Georgians      of his time by reclaiming the flag they fought under from      controversy and division.       The Walker Rules Committee substitute preserves and      protects our heritage, but it does not say that, as      Southerners and as Georgians, the Confederacy is our sole      reason to exist as a people.       Defeating this compromise will confirm the worst that has      been said about us and, in the process, dishonor a brave      people.       Adopt this flag and our people will be united as one rather      than divided by race and hatred.       Adopt this flag and we will honor our ancestors without      giving aide to those who would abuse their legacy.       Georgia has prospered because we have refused to be      divided.       We have worked together, and the nation and the world have      taken notice.       We are where we are today, the envy of other states,      because decades ago our leaders accepted change while others      defied it.       In the long run, it has paid us handsome dividends.       Today, the eyes of the nation and the world are on us again      to see whether Georgia is still a leader or whether we will      slip into the morass of past recriminations.       I have heard all the reasons not to change the flag and      adopt this compromise: ``it will hurt me politically'';      ``this is how we can become a majority''; ``this is our wedge      issue''; ``this is the way we use race to win.''       Using race to win leaves ashes in the mouths of the      victors.       If there is anything we should have learned from our      history, it is that using racial bigotry for political      advantage always backfires. Sometimes in the short run,      sometimes in the long run. Often both.       And if you allow yourself to be dragged along in its raging      current--even if only briefly--you will live the rest of your      life regretting your mistake.       I know.       Seventeen years ago this General Assembly debated whether      to make the birthday of Martin Luther King, Jr. a state      holiday.       Many of the arguments I heard then I hear again today.       ``What will they want next?''       ``You know you can't satisfy them.''       The argument that gave the most political cover was      ``Martin Luther King was a great man, but we already have      enough holidays, and we don't need any more.''       I was a young state senator, and my calls and constituents,      for whatever reason, were against the King Holiday. I knew it      was the right thing to do, but I was so worried about my      political future that I did what many legislators do: when      the vote came up, I had important business elsewhere.       1 knew instantly I'd made a mistake. So when the bill came      back to the Senate for agreement, I voted for it.       I was immediately besieged by constituents; so on final      agreement, I voted against it.       There is not a day that goes by that I do not regret that      vote.       Fortunately, there were enough leaders in this General      Assembly then with the wisdom and the fortitude that I lacked      as a young legislator.       Don't make my mistake.       Each of you knows the right thing to do.       You know it in your heart.       You know it in your mind.       You know it in your conscience.       And, in the end, that is all that matters.       When the dust settles and controversy fades, will history      record you as just another politician or as a person of      conscience?       Make no mistake, just as with me and a vote almost 20 years      ago, history will make a judgment.       Robert E. Lee once said ``it is good that war is terrible,      otherwise men would grow fond of it.''       This is not an issue upon which we should have war.       Our people do not need to bleed the color of red Georgia      clay.       This is an issue that demands cool heads and moderate      positions.       Preserving our past, but also preserving our future.       And not allowing the hope of partisan advantage to prohibit      the healing of our people.       Like most of you, I am a mixture of old and new, of respect      and honor for the past, and of hope for the future.       The children of tomorrow look to us today for leadership.       If we show them the courage of our convictions, they will      one day honor us as we honor the true leaders of decades      past.       Do your duty--because that is what God requires of all of      us.                               ____________________
