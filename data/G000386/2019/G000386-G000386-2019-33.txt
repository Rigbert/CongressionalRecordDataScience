S.-Mexico-Canada trade agreement. I recently spoke with my colleagues in the House of Representatives and also officials within the administration about the same subject. By all accounts, the deal is close on the United States-Mexico-Canada trade agreement.  I urge House Democrats to act quickly and be reasonable so we can finally deliver certainty on this issue to the American people. It has now been more than a year since the leaders of Canada, Mexico, and the United States signed the agreement, so Americans have waited a year for what can happen now. This modernized trade agreement will create hundreds of thousands of new jobs and help Americans grow wages for our workers.  The end of this year's legislative session is rapidly approaching, as we all know. If a deal cannot be reached by the end of this week, I do not see how the USMCA can be ratified in the year we are in. As it is, the window of opportunity for 2019 is extremely tight. Now is the time for the Democratic-controlled House of Representatives to finally act so we can act in the Senate.  I yield the floor.  I suggest the absence of a quorum.
