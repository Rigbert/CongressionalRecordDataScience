 President, I thank my colleague from Colorado for offering my amendment. This is legislation that I originally offered last year as a free standing bill. I would like to say a few words on the amendment and ask my colleagues to support. It is co-sponsored by Senators D'Amato, Sessions, Stevens, and Grams.  First, let me remind my colleagues of what the amendment does. I have outlined these in letters to my colleagues and in my original statement on the floor. In addition, many of you have heard from various federal law enforcement associations that support this amendment. Its main intent is to address a problem, a gray area, in current law. As it now stands, the situation reminds me of the old saying that no good deed goes unpunished.  This involves what I call the 7-11 situation. Suppose for a moment that an off-duty Capitol Police officer or a Customs Agent or some other federal officer goes into the 7-11 to buy coffee. While he is there, a robber tries to hold up the store and is threatening the public with violence. Under the present circumstance a not so funny thing can happen. If the off-duty officer intervenes to protect the public and is hurt in the process. Or if someone is hurt in the incident, the officer could lose his workman's compensation or be sued by the felon for injuries because the Federal officer was acting outside the scope of his work. If he was not on duty or if the felony did not occur as part of the duties involved in his job description, he has no protections.  This is a real concern to serving officers. It puts them in a difficult situation. That is what this amendment fixes. It would give protection to Federal officers in these situations.  Now, let me make it clear. This does not mean an expansion of the authorities to Federal officers to make arrests in matters reserved to the states. I have checked this with the States' Attorneys General. This amendment also does not authorize Federal law enforcement officers to act like cowboys. Nothing in current law, even when acting on official duty, would permit an officer to act irresponsibly. They are subject to penalties if they should do so under their scope of work and they are subject to the same sanctions here.  What we have now, however, is a situation where a law enforcement officer has to make a sudden decision. Does he intervene to protect the public, which is what we would all expect? Or does he sit it out to avoid the risk of being sued or losing his workman's compensation if he is injured? I think I know what most of us would expect. I know what most of us believe is the responsible thing to do. We would expect the officer to intervene with a clear conscience and the knowledge that his act of decency and responsibility will not be punished. I would add that this situation, fortunately, is not a common one. It is, however, one that needs to be addressed.  I hope that we will adopt this amendment today. It has been a long time in coming and I urge my colleagues to join me in voting for it. Again, let me remind my colleagues that this language has been a free-standing bill for almost a year and has been available for comment. We have worked with DEA, Customs, and many others on the language. It has been provided to both majority and minority members. Most of these members have been visited by all the major Federal law enforcement associations and unions, which, I might mention, support this legislation wholeheartedly. I offer for the Record a few of the letters that have been written to me and other Members in support. I believe all the Federal law enforcement officers who risk their lives on our behalf deserve this much. We know only too well the risk they take on our behalf.  I ask unanimous consent that these letters be printed in the Record.  There being no objection, the letters were ordered to be printed in the Record, as follows:                                           Federal Law Enforcement                                         Officers Association,                               East Northport, NY, April 10, 1998.

Hon. Orrin G. Hatch,     Chairman, Senate Judiciary Committee, Washington, DC.       Dear Senator Hatch: On behalf of the Law Enforcement      Steering Committee (LESC), I write to request your support of      S. 1031, the Federal Law Enforcement Officers Good Samaritan      Act of 1998.

This bill, introduced by Senator Chuck Grassley in 1997,      would provide full legal protection for federal law      enforcement officers who intervene in certain situations to      prevent loss of life or serious bodily injury to a citizen.      This bill, if enacted, would offer legal protection to      federal law enforcement officers who unexpectedly encounter      and take action to prevent a violent crime in progress or to      assist in an emergency. The bill does not expand the      investigative authority or jurisdiction of any federal      agency. The bill has the support of the Fraternal Order of      Police, the National Organization of Black Law Enforcement      Executives, the National District Attorney's Association, and      many other law enforcement organizations. The citizens of the      United States would benefit in that the country's well      trained and equipped law enforcement officers would be      encouraged to assist the public. Federal law enforcement      officers would benefit in the knowledge that the Congress of      the United States supports them when they take appropriate      action to help a citizen in need.       It is our desire to see this bill enacted during the 105th      Congress. We would appreciate your assistance in this effort.           Sincerely,                                                Robert L.
