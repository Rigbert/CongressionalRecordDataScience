Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.  Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentleman from New York (Chairman Walsh) for his longstanding leadership on behalf of peace and justice and fairness in Northern Ireland. He has been indefatigable over these many years, and he continues to be. I would thank him for his leadership and remind my colleagues of the importance of trying to get the IFI to look further into reconciliation projects and police reform projects.  As I indicated earlier, we have had seven hearings on police reform in Northern Ireland with a focus on what the United States can do to try to foster that, so there is total transparency, and the best type of methods used by police with human rights training being part of that. It has become very clear that this would help to advance that kind of understanding between the two communities. Those barriers need to be broken down. We do it by getting both communities working together.  We are, I think, or many of us, very encouraged that Hugh Orde is the new chief constable. He replaces a man that many of us had very serious disagreements with in the past, and our hope is that he will continue and even accelerate the pace of reform. This helps to build under him additional strong Earth and concrete, and a base for him to go forward.  This bill has worked; this law has worked; and the IFI, the International Fund for Ireland, has worked for many years to foster reconciliation. This bill gives it an additional push and would provide $25 million authorization for each of the next 2 years.  Again, I want to thank all Members for their support. It is a bipartisan bill.
