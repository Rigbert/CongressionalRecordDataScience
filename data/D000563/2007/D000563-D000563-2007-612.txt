When someone like Bill Gates of Microsoft comes and says: You have to give me visas so I can bring in foreign-trained engineers for my expanding information technology company, it really is a challenge to us. Why aren't we producing engineers here at home?  It comes to this point: Will there be the kind of support, financial support for those promising students to get into math and science and engineeringor will they be discouraged at an early age and give up on it?  The same thing is true--and I know the Senator from Massachusetts is well aware of it--when it comes to the field of nursing. We are just a few years away from being 1 million nurses short of what we need in America. As the baby boomer generation reaches a point where it needs more medical help, there will be fewer medical professionals available. We don't want to see that happen. It compromises the quality of care and also puts pressure on the United States to poach--to go after medical professionals in developing countries to attract them to the United States.  So when we talk about this investment in education, it means a lot to the high-tech industry. It means a lot to every American in terms of basic health care. It means a great deal when it comes to the teachers we need.  I had the university presidents, several of them from Illinois, in my office just a few weeks ago, and they talked about math and science skills, how that is the one thing that troubles them as they look ahead, that our students aren't keeping up in the world in terms of developing their math and science skills. How do they reach that point? Better classroom teachers, which means more young people graduating college, going into the teaching profession, who can make that call because they are not worried about paying back their debt.  It all works together. If we start cutting back in terms of higher education, arguing we can't afford it, we will pay for it for decades to come.
