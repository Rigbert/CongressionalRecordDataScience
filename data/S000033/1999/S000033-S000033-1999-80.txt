 Chairman, I just want to clarify again what might be a complicated issue to the Members. There are two separate amendments. This amendment would restore the $13 million that the committee cut and would bring funding to the same level that has been proposed by the Senate and to significantly less than the administration proposed. That is what this amendment is about.  The next amendment we will debate is the proposal to provide a 25 percent offset from the States.
