 President, reserving the right to object, and I will not be objecting, let me echo the remarks of the majority leader. This is an important piece of legislation.  The part I have the most interest in renews Burma's sanctions--something we have done on an annual basis for 10 years. We are renewing the sanctions in spite of the fact that much progress has been made in Burma in the last year and a half. Secretary Clinton will, of course, recommend to the President that these sanctions be waived in recognition of the significant progress that has been made in the last year and a half in that country, which is trying to move from a rather thuggish military dictatorship to a genuine democracy. There is still a long way to go.  This is an important step in the right direction. America speaks with one voice regarding Burma. My views are the same as the views of the Obama administration as expressed by Secretary Clinton.  I thank the chairman of the Finance Committee also for helping us work through the process, and particularly Senator Coburn, who had some reservations about the non-Burma parts of this bill. I think we have worked those out and are moving forward. It is an important step in the right direction.
