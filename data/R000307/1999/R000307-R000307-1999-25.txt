I believe it is absolutely mandatory for Congress to bring much needed relief to the home health care industry in the timeframe she has emphasized, as well as to the small rural hospitals and teaching hospitals that also are feeling the pinch of all the legislative and regulatory changes made in the last few years.  The Senator is exactly right. We will have to move quickly. We must do it this year. There has been talk if we can't agree on a single proposal, we might have to put it off until next year. Time is of the essence in regard to our hospitals, especially the small rural providers. They operate on a shoestring budget. The same is true for the home health care agencies.  I will continue to work with the distinguished Senator to pass legislation before Congress adjourns for the year. We cannot go home before we straighten this out and provide some help.  I thank the Senator for her leadership. I think we have had a very good colloquy.
