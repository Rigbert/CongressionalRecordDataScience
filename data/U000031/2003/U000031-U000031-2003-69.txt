Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that the Committee on Energy and Commerce be discharged from further consideration of the resolution (H. Res. 100) recognizing the 100th anniversary year of the founding of the Ford Motor Company, which has been a significant part of the social, economic, and cultural heritage of the United States and many other nations and a revolutionary industrial and global institution, and ask for its immediate consideration in the House.  The Clerk read the title of the resolution.
