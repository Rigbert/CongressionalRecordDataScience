 President, I rise today in honor of an inspiring Kentucky leader--Kathy Hogancamp, State representative for Kentucky's Fourth District.  Representative Hogancamp's resiliency determination, and strong sense of community service is clearly reflected in the course of her career prior to political service. She is a former teacher, and also served as an official of the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services and Department of Education from 1985 to 1991. Most recently, Kathy applied her master's degree in guidance and educational psychology in her work as a private tutor.  As our Nation struggles to recapture the initiative and stamina essential to reviving the American Dream, Kathy Hogancamp exemplifies what self-empowerment and the courage to make a difference truly mean. Since age 17, Kathy has been wheel-chair bound. Yet, she has never allowed her physical limitations to deter her work in serving her community and fulfilling her Christian mission. Kathy believes that character and intellect are far more important than her physical condition. Her optimism and drive to achieve are the basis of her personal philosophy--if there are obstacles to overcome, then overcome them.  In 1994, Kathy Hogancamp set out to win Kentucky's Fourth District House seat. Despite the odds in a predominately Democratic district, Hogancamp won the confidence of the voters and the title of State representative. Representative Hogancamp's campaign reflected the needs and interests of her district, not herself, as her platform focused on cutting taxes and revising the Kentucky Education Reform Act.  In February, Representative Hogancamp encountered a challenge that tested her will and strength as a serious automobile accident left her battered and bruised in the hospital. I am pleased to tell the Chamber that Kathy is recovering quite well and is eager to return to her duties as State representative. Mr. President, I want to share with my colleagues her thoughts on public service and sense of responsibility in her role as a lawmaker and community leader. It is my hope that her words will serve to remind us what our role as Members of the U.S. Senate means to our constituents and the future of our Nation.  Mr. President, I ask that the Paducah Sun's February 14, 1995, article on Representative Hogancamp be printed in the Record.  The article follows:                 [From the Paducah Sun, Feb. 14, 1995]   Rep. Hogancamp Resolved, Upbeat Since Last Brutal Brush With Death                        (By Donna Groves Haynes)       Bruised, battered and lying in a hospital bed, state Rep.      Kathy Hogancamp still radiates strength and determination.       ``That's the way God built me,'' said Hogancamp, who has      been paralyzed since a car wreck 23 years ago and is now      recovering from serious injuries sustained in a van wreck      Feb. 7 near Beaver Dam.       ``I could have decided to be a couch potato when I was 17      and would have been justified in doing so,'' Hogancamp said      in an interview from her hospital room Monday. ``I made the      decision to make something of my life because I do believe I      have something to give back to our culture.''       Now after a second serious car crash, Hogancamp is      displaying the same resilience. ``I've learned that accidents      do strike twice, and God still has His hand on my head,'' she      said.       Doctors do not expect Hogancamp's mobility to be any more      impaired than it was before the wreck. ``It's just all the      logistics--getting a new (wheel) chair, a new car . . . new      makeup,'' she said jokingly, referring to the fact that her      personal belongings were strewn over about a 30-foot area in      the wreck.       Over the weekend, Hogancamp was moved out of intensive care      and into a private room. Although she has been told she could      be released Thursday, Hogancamp added, ``but I don't trust      doctors.''       Even in the hospital, Hogancamp was beginning to talk about      business again. When U.S. Sen. Mitch McConnell called Monday      to ask her how she was feeling, she volunteered to speak at      the upcoming Lincoln Day festivities ``if at all possible.''       Hogancamp views her latest ordeal as a ``wake-up call from      God,'' an attempt on His part to ensure she is properly      motivated in her legislative endeavors. ``God had to get my      attention again, a      second time, telling me to stay on the track. When you reach      adulthood, it's easy to slip into lifeless faith, I had      not escaped that.       ``He was saying to me; `I put you in this position of      responsibility. Don't blow it.'''       Asked if she ever wanted to question, ``Why me?'' Hogancamp      explained that she learned from the Biblical character Job      that that would be futile. ``Job never got his question      answered. He just saw God, and his question paled in      comparison.       [[Page S3292]] ``It's an insignificant question. You can      waste your life on it. You just need to take what you can      from your past and move on. A lot of the things I learned      when I was walking are helpful to me now. I used to be in      speech and drama. That helped me learn to write a heck of a      speech.''       Although Hogancamp is alert and making jokes, she realizes      she has a long road of recovery ahead of her. ``I'm a lot      more recovered upstairs than my body is,'' she said. ``My      whole body is one big bruise.''       Among her more serious injuries are a few cracked ribs and      a compound fractured wrist. But because it's her left wrist,      Hogancamp made light of that. ``It's not my major make-up      hand anyway,'' she said.       Hogancamp is optimistic that the wrist injury will not      prevent her from using an adaptive device to write on her      computer.       And she believes her injuries could even result in some      benefits. ``It banged up my legs pretty good, so much so that      I may end up sitting straighter. It banged me around so much,      I may end up with better posture. Isn't that ironic?''       Hogancamp said she remained conscious as the van tumbled      out of control Tuesday night. ``Bright lights, going round      and round and wondering, `When is this going to end?' I've      never done drugs, but that's got to be close to what a drug      experience would be.''       When the van finally came to rest, Hogancamp found herself      face down in the mud with her body twisted. She could see      that her left wrist was severely mangled, but, being      paralyzed, had no idea what her other injuries might be.       Still, she said, her faith helped her to remain calm. ``I      knew if God had brought me that far, it wasn't going to be      the end.''                               ____________________
