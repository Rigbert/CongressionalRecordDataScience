President, yesterday the inspector general of the Department of Housing and Urban Development announced that it will review whether the White House has deliberately interfered with the timely distribution of hurricane funds to Puerto Rico. That is pretty amazing. I have never seen a case that I remember where the inspector general of Housing and Urban Development had to look into whether the White House was deliberately interfering with funds to go to a disaster area.  I know firsthand what it is like to see a State hit by disaster. Tropical Storm Irene hit Vermont in 2011, and it devastated our State. People lost their homes, roads were washed out, bridges destroyed, and communities forever changed. I saw bridges twisted like a child's toy. I saw farmhouses that had been on the north side of the river, which were now on the south side of the river, upside down and destroyed. I saw farmers' fields wiped out, businesses ruined, schools destroyed, roads necessary to bring medical supplies into villages gone. I know firsthand. I know as a lifelong Vermonter that in these moments the Federal Government is a critical partner in the effort to recover and rebuild.  It is the same in other States--North Carolina, South Carolina, Florida, Texas, Hawaii, Puerto Rico, the U.S. Virgin Islands. They are all counting on us to get this bill across the finish line.  That is why, 3 weeks ago, I put a compromise on the table to create a path forward. I did it in my capacity as chairman of the Appropriations Committee. It was a reasonable proposal. It does not restore everything that had been eliminated from the House bill, but it was a compromise that focused on the most critical proposals and the immediate needs. Had Senate Republicans accepted this proposal, we likely would have seen quick passage of a disaster bill in a bipartisan fashion in both the Senate and the House. It actually would have eliminated the need for a conference and would have gotten the assistance to the people who need it sooner rather than later.  Unfortunately, it appears the President will not accept even this reasonable offer. It makes me think about when he closed down the government for over 1 month because the Congress gave him only $1.6 billion for a wall, and then he reopened the government when we gave him $1.3 billion. I don't know if they actually read the proposals and bills that we sent.  In this case, I think it is obvious what is happening. The President is willing to endanger the entire disaster package for all of the United States because he wants to pick winners and losers. When there is a disaster, there are no winners and losers. Americans come together to help everybody. Yet he wants to say who gets assistance in the wake of disasters based on his own arbitrary standards and political grudges. That is unacceptable. Where is it going to end? Which State will the President disfavor next? Remember that just a few months ago, the President, in a tweet, threatened to cut off aid to California as they were reeling from some of the worst fires in recent history. He sent a tweet telling millions of Americans he doesn't want to help. We are an independent branch of government. We have to have a responsible party in the room, and it should be Congress.  I think back to when Vermont was hit by disaster and hurricane flooding. As I was traveling around the State the day after, surveying the damage, I was receiving emails from a number of Senators, Republicans and Democrats, saying: Vermont stood with us when we had a disaster; we will stand with you today.  That is what I want to do. I want to help, just as I voted to help Louisiana six times and Mississippi for their damage. It wasn't for a political benefit for Vermont, but it was because we are Americans and we all stand together.  To think that we might consider a disaster package that picks and chooses which Americans are helped when they have all suffered equally from disasters, and to say: OK, you, American, we favor you, you get money. You, American, I don't like you. So you are not going to get money. That is not the American way. That is not the way the Senate should be.  Let's pass a bill that addresses the needs of all communities impacted by disaster and do it now. People are waiting. The needs are pressing.  I will file an amendment today with my recommended compromise. It provides a reasonable path forward--one that allows us to move quickly to get assistance to the people who need it now. I hope all Members will support it.  The Governor of Puerto Rico made a strong statement this morning.  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to have printed in the Record a statement by Puerto Rico Governor Ricardo Rossello.  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in the Record, as follows:           Statement by Puerto Rico Governor Ricardo Rossello                            (March 26, 2019)       San Juan, Puerto Rico.--``The comments attributed to Donald      Trump today by senators from his own party are below the      dignity of a sitting President of the United States. They      continue to lack empathy, are irresponsible, regrettable and,      above all, unjustified.       ``I want to be very clear: Not a single federal dollar has      been used to make debt payments. This has been the most      transparent recovery in the history of the United States,      providing unprecedented access and collaboration with federal      agencies. In fact, just yesterday we reached an agreement      with FEMA on the transition of responsibilities for the      reimbursement of recovery funds. An agreement predicated on      the acknowledgment by the federal government that appropriate      fiscal controls are in fact established.       ``I can only assume that Trump is receiving misleading      information from his own staff. I have now made several      requests to meet with the President to discuss Puerto Rico's      recovery and reconstruction, but up to this day we haven't      received a confirmation or a date, even though Trump told me      we would meet after his visit to Vietnam earlier this year.       ``I invite the President to stop listening to ignorant and      completely wrong advice. Instead he should come to Puerto      Rico to hear firsthand from the people on the ground. I      invite him to put all of the resources at his disposal to      help Americans in Puerto Rico, like he did for Texas and      Alabama. No more, no less.       ``Of course, today the world knows the unpleasant truth      that Puerto Rico is a colonial territory of the United States      and are well aware of the democratic deficiencies we endure:      We are not allowed to vote for our President nor have voting      representation in Congress. Even as we have asked      democratically for statehood twice in the past seven years,      the federal government has delayed their responsibility to      act.       People from all over the nation, and the world, have      witnessed the inequalities Americans face on the island. The      federal response and its treatment during these past months      in the aftermath of Hurricane Maria is clear evidence of our      second-class citizenship.       ``Mr. President: Enough with the insults and demeaning      mischaracterizations. We are not your political adversaries;      we are your citizens.       ``We are not asking for anything more than any other U.S.      state has received. We are merely asking for equality.''
