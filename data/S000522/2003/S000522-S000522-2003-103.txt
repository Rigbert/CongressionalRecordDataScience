Mr. Speaker, I support S. 3, the ``Partial Birth Abortion Ban Act of 2003.''   This bill prohibits a heinous and inhumane procedure. Partial birth abortions are a procedure in which a fully viable child is killed just inches from being fully delivered.   This procedure is inhumane and barbaric, and has no place in a civilized society.   Also, a partial birth abortion is not safe for women, and is never necessary to preserve the health of the mother. Unlike other abortion procedures, partial birth abortion involves killing a child that is no longer in the womb.   I strongly support the passage of this conference report.
