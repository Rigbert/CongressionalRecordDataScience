 President, if I may just for a moment echo the comments of the Senator from New York, this morning I watched on television the ceremony at the Pentagon. As I watched the calling of the names, a photo flashed on the screen of each individual. What you saw were young military men, you saw a lieutenant colonel, you saw the faces of whole families wiped out, young people, older people, you saw every race. In a sense, when you looked at the benches and the water flowing under the benches and the maples that will grow around them, as you listened to the sad song of the pipers, you realized what a great country this is and how we respect every single human life and how important that is; also, how important it is that the message remain true, that the message remain full of heart but also full of vigilance that this must never happen again in our homeland.  So I wish to join Senator Schumer and send our best wishes, our sympathy, our sorrow to these families 7 years later, and our thanks to those who gave their lives in the Pentagon.  I had a chance to sit down with the family of a captain of the American Airlines plane that flew into the Pentagon. It was very revealing because at the time they were convinced it was the heroic gesture of this captain in turning the plane away from the U.S. Capitol that played a role. I want them to know that I was thinking of them both during the Pentagon ceremony and the ceremony in front of the Capitol.  So all those victims remain in our hearts and in our minds, and we consecrate ourselves to work on their behalf.  Thank you very much, Mr. President.
