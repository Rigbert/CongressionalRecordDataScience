I thank my good friend for yielding, and I applaud his tremendous leadership over the years in defense of the culture of life, for being consistent on all human rights issues--from child soldiers and combating that abuse of children to the abuse of unborn children by way of abortion. So I thank him for that. I would just make a few points, because we are coming to a close, Mr. Speaker.  Today, doctors diagnose illness and disability before birth. New and exciting breakthrough health care interventions for the unborn, including microsurgeries, are leading to an ever-expanding array of successful treatments and cures of sick or disabled unborn babies. A few other Members have made this point very clearly, as do I, which is that unborn children are society's littlest patients, and they might need health care just like any one of us.                              {time}  1640  In stark contrast, abortion methods rip, tear, dismember or chemically poison the fragile bodies of unborn babies to death, and abortion pills cause premature expulsion from the womb and death. There is nothing benign, compassionate, or just about an act that utterly destroys the life of a child and often physically, psychologically, and emotionally harms women. And despite the near total absence of any meaningful reporting by the news media, women get hurt and even die from legal abortions.  According to the most recent Centers for Disease Control report, from 1973 to 2008, at least 403 women tragically died in the United States from legal abortion. And that sad fact is almost certainly a significant undercount because the methodology employed by CDC is passive and voluntary and likely to miss instances of both mortality and morbidity.  In the years since CDC's ``most recent report,'' many more women have surely died, like Tonya Reaves, a 24-year-old woman who died last July from a botched second trimester dismemberment abortion, a D&E, at a Chicago area Planned Parenthood abortion mill.  The abortion industry, Mr. Speaker, excels at surface appeal argument and at propaganda. Indeed, the misleading term ``safe abortion'' purposefully misses the point that no abortion, legal or illegal, is ever safe for the baby, and all are fraught with negative health consequences for the mother.  Today, at least 104 credible studies show significant psychological harm, major depression, and/or elevated suicide risk to women who abort. The Times of London reported that:       Senior psychiatrists say that new evidence has uncovered a      clear link between abortion and mental illness in women who      have had no previous history of psychological problems.      They've found that women who've had abortions have twice the      level of psychological problems, three times the level of      depression as women who have given birth or who have never      been pregnant.  One comprehensive study out of New Zealand in 2006 found that 78.6 percent of the 15- to 18-year-olds who had had abortions displayed symptoms of major depression as compared to 31 percent of their peers.  Mr. Speaker, there are at least 115 studies that show significant association between abortion and subsequent premature births. You never read about this in the news media.  Researchers Shah and Zao show a 36 percent increase for pre-term birth after one abortion and a staggering 93 percent increased risk after two.  What does this mean for children? Pre-term birth is the leading cause of infant mortality in the industrialized world after congenital anomalies. Pre-term infants have a greater risk of suffering chronic lung disease, sensory deficits, cerebral palsy, cognitive impairments, and behavioral problems. Low birth weight is similarly associated with neonatal mortality and morbidity.  These are consequences that are visited upon a woman later on. She's never told this at the abortion clinic that subsequent children that she will have later in her life could suffer prematurity and low birth weight.  And, finally, the extremism of the pro-abortion industry is shocking.  Last spring, the House of Representatives took up Trent Frank's bill to ban sex-selection abortion. The bill garnered a solid majority, 246-168 in the House. President Obama, however, made it absolutely clear that he would veto the sex-selection abortion prohibition should it be sent to the White House.  While sex selection targets almost exclusively girls for extermination, simply because they're girls, the egregious practice remains legal in most of our States. In fact, only four States--Illinois, Pennsylvania, Oklahoma, and Arizona--and several countries, including the United Kingdom, prohibit sex-selection abortion. And yet we have not been able to get that legislation enacted into law, and it's opposed by President Obama.  Mr. Speaker, we need to stand up for life. Again, I want to thank my good friend and colleague from Nebraska for having this second Special Order on defending life. And like Jeff, I do look forward to the March for Life on January 25 where we will all rally in defense of the defenseless.
