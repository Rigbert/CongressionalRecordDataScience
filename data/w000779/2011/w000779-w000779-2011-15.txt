President, never in our Nation's history has the American military relied more on National Guard and Reserve servicemembers than it has in the last 10 years.  More than 800,000 members of the National Guard and Reserves have been called to active duty service since 9/11, many of them serving two, three, and four tours of duty in Iraq and Afghanistan  Our military does an exceptional job of preparing these guardsmen and reservists for combat, but we do far too little to prepare them for transition back to civilian life.  Our guardsmen need a transition from the trauma of combat to the serenity of home in Oregon and throughout our Nation. But instead our guardsmen and reservists are sent back to their community with little or no time to readjust. In a matter of a few days these guardsmen go from holding a gun in the chaos of a combat zone to holding their children in the serenity of their own home. That has to be a difficult transition.  Unlike most active-duty troops who receive a soft landing through a number of carefully monitored reintegration programs and other support services provided on an active-duty base, returning guardsmen lack the support system of a large base.  While active-duty soldiers come home to military bases and the jobs and support systems that they provide, returning Guard members are in many instances left to face the increasingly stark reality of transitioning to civilian life on their own.  The amount of personal and professional requirements placed on guardsmen and reservists pre- and post-deployment are mind boggling. What they need more than anything is time to wind down and tend to their lives.  Even under the best of circumstances, the road back from war is difficult and extremely stressful. Men and women who have served in harm's way experience higher rates of divorce and suicide.  Many battle the debilitating effects and stigma associated with Post Traumatic Stress Disorder. In the current struggling economy, nearly half of the guard members and reservists have no job to return to. Some find that the jobs and careers they put on hold to serve their country simply no longer exist.  To compound an unacceptable unemployment problem, Guard members and reservists are immediately taken off the military payroll once they get home.  Imagine that reality for a second. You left your home, your family and your job to serve your country in harm's way for 10 months, only to be welcomed back with no job and nosource of income to pay for your home or support your family.  If they do have a job waiting for them, to keep a steady income, Guardsmen must jump right back into the high stress of relearning their civilian job without a chance to decompress or readjust from the stress of combat.  That is what my bill would help fix.  The National Guard and Reserve Soft Landing Reintegration Act would allow returning guardsmen and reservists to take up to 45 days to decompress, reintegrate, and get their lives in order, while still being paid.  I started this program because I think that citizen-soldiers are one of the strengths of this nation. They and their families should be acknowledged for the level of sacrifices that they are making.  Addressing the post deployment-related needs of returning guardsmen is not only the moral thing to do; it is also strategically wise for our nation.  This is part of the promise our nation made to take care of our troops. They did their best of us. We should do our best for them.  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be printed in the Record.  There being no objection, the text of the bill was ordered to be printed in the Record, as follows:                                S. 1839       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of      the United States of America in Congress assembled,     SECTION 1.
