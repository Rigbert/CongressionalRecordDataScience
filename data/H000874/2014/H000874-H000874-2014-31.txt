 Given that expectation of moving on it, does the gentleman expect or know whether or not we will deal with the ``train and equip'' authorization within the framework of the National Defense Authorization Act, or perhaps the omnibus or some other piece of legislation?  I yield to my friend.  Mr. McCARTHY of California. I thank the gentleman for yielding.  You were with us at the White House when the President laid out the supplemental. The Appropriations Committee is going through all the funding there. No decisions have been made yet where that would move forward, but it is our intention to be able to have that question answered but be able to have the resources needed to do the job.
