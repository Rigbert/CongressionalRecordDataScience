Speaker, I rise today to speak about the ongoing epidemic of Missing and Murdered Indigenous Women and Girls. Alaska Native and American Indian women and girls face disproportionately high rates of violent crimes including murder, rape, kidnapping, and trafficking. Alaska Native and American Indian women are 10 times more likely to be murdered than other Americans. The National Crime Information Center reported that, in 2016, there were close to 6000 reports of missing American Indian and Alaska Native women and girls. According to the Urban Indian Health Institute, Alaska is the fourth highest state in terms of the number of these cases.  In Alaska, extreme isolation and lack of law enforcement in remote Native communities make it difficult to prevent and respond to these crimes. In fact, only one out of every three Alaska Native villages have any law enforcement at all. These villages are not connected to the road system, and it can take days for state troopers to respond to incidents, particularly when weather prevents flights from landing. Women and girls in urban areas also face risk factors, particularly when they are away from the support of family and culture.  Given the scale of the crisis, it is troubling that tribes and Native communities do not have adequate resources to respond. Native communities around the country are governed by a varying patchwork of criminal jurisdictions that complicate law enforcement and leave Native women and girls unprotected. Native communities and tribes also lack full access to crime databases, which undermines the efforts of tribal law enforcement and tribal courts. In addition, the Justice Department, which is responsible for pursuing the most serious crimes in Native communities, declines to prosecute the majority of these cases.  Instead of simply acknowledging these issues, Congress must act. We must reauthorize the Violence Against Women Act. VAWA funds vital programs, like domestic violence shelters. The House's reauthorization bill expands legal authority for tribes to prosecute violent crimes against women. It also includes a new demonstration program, enhanced by an amendment I offered, that would expand Alaska Native villages' jurisdictional authority.  We must pass the BADGES Act, which Rep. Haaland sponsored and I cosponsored. The BADGES Act improves BIA law enforcement recruitment and retention. The bill also improves federal law enforcement reporting mechanisms for missing and murdered Indigenous women. In addition, it expands tribal access to federal criminal databases. Congress must honor the trust relationship and pass this crucial legislation.                          ____________________
