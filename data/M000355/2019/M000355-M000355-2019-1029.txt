 President, yesterday, our colleagues on the Armed Services Committee heard testimony from Dr. Mark Esper, the Senate-confirmed Secretary of the Army and President Trump's nominee for Secretary of Defense. They examined his extensive record of military and public service and discussed the variety of challenges the next Secretary will face. By the end, I believe anybody impartial would have to have come away impressed by Dr. Esper's mastery, intelligence, and thoroughness.  Of course, it is not exactly surprising that a decorated combat veteran and distinguished scholar would convey expertise and calm under pressure. For those of us who knew him during his service as national security adviser to the former majority leader, Bill Frist, those qualities are familiar.  You could hardly invent better qualifications for the top job at the Pentagon than Mark Esper's: a graduate of West Point, advanced degrees from the Harvard Kennedy School and George Washington University, courageous service with the 101st Airborne in the Gulf war, service at the Defense Department, a successful career in the private sector.  Every step of the way, he earned respect and admiration. That includes high praise from DOD leaders of the last administration, the Obama administration. They say that Dr. Esper ``works hard, he's smart, he's dedicated.'' He has ``all the qualifications.''  Our colleagues at the hearing saw an exceptionally well-qualified nominee. In fact, as my friend the junior Senator from Virginia has put it, they saw aman of ``sound character and moral courage.'' He is a man of honor and integrity, dedicated to our Nation and committed to the men and women who serve in uniform, and I think it is clear he deserves prompt confirmation. Even more, the Pentagon and our Nation's security deserve a Senate-confirmed Secretary of Defense to be in place and on the job.  I urge my colleagues to join me in supporting his confirmation as soon as it can reach the floor.                          ____________________
