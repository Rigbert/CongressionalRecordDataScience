Speaker, I have no further requests for time, and I yield back the balance of my time, adding that the gentleman from Mississippi (Mr. Taylor) asked me to make his comments known and his expressions of appreciation to the gentleman from New York (Mr. Gilman) and others for their leadership on this, and he joins us very strongly in supporting this legislation.
