 There was a lot of pushback from a number of people, the administration and on the Senator's side of the aisle, initially, when I wrote into the law that said it would suspend any money--$1.3 billion--for the military, unless there was a certification that they were upholding the moves necessary toward democracy.  As a result, all the money the Senator is concerned about is being held back because of the Leahy amendment--which is joined in by Senator Graham, whom I see coming onto the floor--when we did the Foreign Operations bill.  I appreciate the words of the Senator from Kentucky. I can assure him, with the Leahy amendment, none of the foreign aid is going to Egypt as they conduct their operations the way they are.           Violence Against Women Reauthorization Act of 2011  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to have printed in the Record letters in support of the reauthorization of the bipartisan Violence Against Women Reauthorization Act report.  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in the Record, as follows:         National Task Force to End Sexual and Domestic Violence            Against Women,                                                 February 9, 2012.       Dear Representative: We, the undersigned organizations,      represent millions of victims of domestic violence, dating      violence, sexual assault and stalking, and the professionals      who serve them, throughout the United States and territories.      On behalf of the victims we represent, we ask that you      support the Violence Against Women Act's (VAWA)      reauthorization.       VAWA's programs support state, tribal and local efforts to      address the pervasive and insidious crimes of domestic      violence, dating violence, sexual assault and stalking. These      programs have made great progress towards keeping victims      safe and holding perpetrators accountable. This critical      legislation must be reauthorized to ensure a continued      response to these crimes.       Since its original passage in 1994, VAWA has dramatically      enhanced our nation's response to violence against women.      More victims report domestic violence to the police and the      rate of non-fatal intimate partner violence against women has      decreased by 53%. The sexual assault services program in VAWA      helps rape crisis centers keep their doors open to provide      the frontline response to victims of rape. VAWA provides for      a coordinated community approach, improving collaboration      between law enforcement and victim services providers to      better meet the needs of victims. These comprehensive and      cost-effective programs not only save lives, they also save      money. In fact, VAWA saved nearly $12.6 billion in net      averted social costs in just its first six years.       VAWA has unquestionably improved the national response to      these terrible crimes. We urge you to support VAWA's      reauthorization to build upon its successes and continue to      enhance our nation's ability to hold perpetrators accountable      and keep victims and their children safe from future harm.       We look forward to working with you throughout the      reauthorization process.

Dear Members of Congress: Since its passage in 1994, the      Violence Against Women Act (``VAWA'') has shined a bright      light on domestic violence, bringing the issue out of the      shadows and into the forefront of our efforts to protect      women and families. VAWA transformed the response to domestic      violence at the local, state and federal level. Its successes      have been dramatic, with the annual incidence of domestic      violence falling by more than 50 percent.       Even though the advancements made since in 1994 have been      significant, a tremendous amount of work remains and we      believe it is critical that the Congress reauthorize VAWA.      Every day in this country, abusive husbands or partners kill      three women, and for every victim killed, there are nine more      who narrowly escape that fate. We see this realized in our      home states every day. Earlier this year in Delaware, three      children--ages 12, 2\1/2\ and 1\1/2\--watched their mother be      beaten to death by her ex-boyfriend on a sidewalk. In Maine      last summer, an abusive husband subject to a protective order      murdered his wife and two young children before taking his      own life.       Reauthorizing VAWA will send a clear message that this      country does not tolerate violence against women and show      Congress' commitment to reducing domestic violence,      protecting women from sexual assault and securing justice for      victims.       VAWA reauthorization will continue critical support for      victim services and target three key areas where data shows      we must focus our efforts in order to have the greatest      impact:       Domestic violence, dating violence, and sexual assault are      most prevalent among young women aged 16-24, with studies      showing that youth attitudes are still largely tolerant of      violence, and that women abused in adolescence are more      likely to be abused again as adults. VAWA reauthorization      will help us break that cycle by consolidating and      strengthening programs aimed at both prevention and      intervention, with a particular emphasis on more effectively      engaging men and local community-based resources in the      process.       A woman who has been sexually assaulted can be subjected to      further distress when the healthcare, law enforcement, and      legal response to her attack is not coordinated and      productive. Whether it is a first responder without adequate      training, a rape kit that goes unprocessed for lack of      funding, or a phone call between a crisis counselor and a      prosecutor that never takes place, sexual assault victims      deserve better. We must develop and implement best practices,      training, and communication tools across disciplines in order      to effectively prosecute and punish perpetrators, as well as      help victims heal and rebuild their lives.       There is a growing consensus among practitioners and      researchers that domestic violence homicides are predictable      and, therefore, often preventable. We can save the lives of      untold numbers of potential homicide victims with better      training for advocates, law enforcement, and others who      interact with victims to recognize the warning signs and      react meaningfully.       The fight to protect women from violence is one that never      ends. It is not a year-to-year issue, which is why we think      it is critical that Congress reauthorize the Violence Against      Women Act. We know a great deal more about domestic violence,      dating violence, sexual assault and stalking than we did 17      years ago. Reauthorizing VAWA will allow us to build on those      lessons and continue to make progress and save lives.       VAWA was last reauthorized in 2006 and time is of the      essence for reauthorization of this important law. We urge      Congress to take on this critical mission and reauthorize      VAWA.                                  ____                               National Sheriffs' Association,                                 Alexandria, VA, February 1, 2012.     Hon. Patrick Leahy,     U.S. Senate,     Washington, DC.     Hon. Mike Crapo,     U.S. Senate,     Washington, DC.       Dear Senator Leahy and Senator Crapo: On behalf of the      National Sheriffs' Association (NSA) and 3,079 elected      sheriffs nationwide, I am writing to express our support for      the Violence Against Women Reauthorization Act (VAWA).       NSA and the nation's sheriffs recognizes the extreme      seriousness that the crimes of domestic violence, sexual      assault, dating violence, stalking, and sex trafficking have      on law enforcement, victims, and communities across the      nation. Originally established in 1994, VAWA works to      increase officer and victim safety, while striving to prevent      future abuse, by providing resources to law enforcement      agencies to enhance their core programs and policies, as well      as to reaffirm the commitment to reform systems, that affect      victims of domestic violence, sexual assault, dating      violence, stalking, and sex trafficking.       The reauthorization of VAWA would continue to enable law      enforcement agencies across the country to adequately address      domestic violence, sexual assault, dating violence, stalking,      and sex trafficking crimes by expanding funding for programs      that recognize the concerns and needs of victims.      Furthermore, VAWA supports the key collaboration between the      victims' services community; health care community; and law      enforcement to ensure that all victims are receiving the      critical treatment and services necessary after a crime has      occurred.       However, we do have one point of concern regarding the VAWA      reauthorization involving PREA (Prison Rape Elimination Act)      standards as they apply to the Department of Homeland      Security (DHS). NSA strongly believes that sexual violence      and abuse have no place in our correctional facilities. As      such, NSA has been working closely with the Department of      Justice (DOJ) on PREA to ensure that the final standards take      into consideration the vast differences between jails, which      sheriffs largely operate, versus prisons; thus enabling for      the efficient and effective implementation in jails      nationwide.       Title X of the VAWA reauthorization would require DHS to      establish and implement PREA standards for DHS detention      facilities. As you may be aware, many sheriffs contract with      DHS to house criminal aliens in their jails. As sheriffs will      need to comply with PREA standards when finally established      by the DOJ, NSA would ask that you, and the Senate Judiciary      Committee, ensure that the VAWA reauthorization language      clarifies that DHS PREA standards need to be consistent with      DOJ PREA standards. This would ensure that there are not      differing standards for jails based on the federal, state, or      local detainees held, as well as help with the swift and      successful implementation of final PREA standards.       While the law enforcement community, and society as a      whole, has made great strides in combating such crimes as      domestic violence, sexual assault, stalking, sex trafficking,      and dating violence since the original enactment of VAWA,      there is still more work that still needs to be done. The      reauthorization of VAWA will enable the continued partnership      among sheriffs and victims' advocates and service providers      to protect victims and prevent future victimization      throughout the United States.       Senator Leahy and Senator Crapo, the National Sheriffs'      Association thanks you for     your leadership on this important issue in the 112th      Congress.           Sincerely,                                       Sheriff Paul H. Fitzgerald,     President.                                  ____                                           Federal Law Enforcement                                         Officers Association,                                 Washington, DC, January 31, 2012.     Hon. Patrick Leahy,     Chairman, Senate Judiciary Committee.     Hon. Charles Grassley,     Ranking Member, Senate Judiciary Committee.       Dear Chairman Leahy and Ranking Member Grassley: On behalf      of the 26,000 members of the Federal Law Enforcement Officers      Association (FLEOA), I am writing to express our full support      for Senator Leahy's proposed reauthorization of the Violence      Against Women Act (VAWA). FLEOA has supported the essential      purpose of this legislation since it was first passed in      1994. According to the Centers for Disease Control and      Prevention, one in four women will experience domestic      violence in their lifetime. In our proud Land of the Free and      Home of the Brave, this is unacceptable.       FLEOA fully supports the substitute amendment to S. 1925.      The amendment properly calls for the U Visa cap to be raised      to allow for the recapture of 5,000 unused U Visas. Current      law authorizes an annual issuance of only 10,000 U Visas.      Unfortunately, dangerous criminals remain undaunted by this      cap and it only serves to discourage non-citizen battered      women from cooperating with law enforcement.       The absolute priority for all law enforcement officers is      the pursuit and capture of violent criminals. By limiting the      number of U Visas law enforcement can request, Congress is      effectively amputating the long arm of the law. Law      enforcement officers and prosecutors don't hand out U Visas      like cotton candy. U Visas are an essential tool carefully      used by law enforcement and tempered with great scrutiny.      Again, our unwavering priority is to do everything within our      means to protect women who are victimized by violent      criminals.       I respectfully ask that both parties rally behind this      important legislation, and that we unite in recognition of      the need to protect all battered women from dangerous      criminals.           Respectfully submitted,                                                        Jon Adler,                                               National President.
