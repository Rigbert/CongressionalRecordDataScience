He and I both had the opportunity to speak to participants in the Hackathon that is going on as we speak. Mr. Cantor and I were cooperative in this effort as well, and Mr. McCarthy and I have continued thistradition. Like Mr. McCarthy, I believe this will be of great assistance in moving us forward with technology to make our institution more transparent, the people's business more available to them, and that we will benefit from this in this institution.  In addition to that, of course, we believe it will have ramifications beyond this institution as they brainstorm and come together on how technology can be used better in our democracy both in terms of our government and politics, but also in terms of our economy and growth of jobs.  So I thank the gentleman and his staff.  I want to mention my own staffer, Steve Dwyer, who is one of the real talents in my office and, in my opinion, within the House staff, Republican and Democrat, working together on behalf of the better use of technology.  So I thank my friend for his observation.  Mr. Speaker, this week we have had two bills that we have spent significant time on that purported to deal both with debt and with deficit reduction, neither of which I think anybody in this House, Republican or Democrat, would place much of a bet on becoming law. They were message bills. We now dealt with legislation to repeal the Affordable Care Act for the 61st time, and we dealt with a bill to close down Planned Parenthood, which clearly is not going to happen. Indeed, it should not happen. Ninety-seven percent of what they do is providing health care to women who need healthcare services.  So we passed, also, a bill that the gentleman, the majority leader, points out we need to do something to extend the debt limit. He is right on that. We do need to do it. But we spent a period of time on a bill called debt prioritization. I call that a charade, Mr. Speaker. I believed it was a charade. I believe that once you don't pay one of your bills, you have defaulted. Whether or not you prioritize and pay 10 bills that you owe first, get those paid, if you don't pay the other 10, it is default. But we do need to pass a debt limit extension. We need to pass a clean debt limit extension. We will run out of time on November 3.  Mr. Speaker, my friend, the majority leader, was just talking to Mr. Ryan, who possibly will be the next Speaker of this institution. Mr. Ryan said, when asked a question in 2011, shortly after the Republicans took charge of this House--to be specific, on January 6, 2011--will the debt limit be raised? Does it have to be raised? Mr. Ryan answered yes.  Even more compellingly, Mr. Hensarling, one of the most conservative Members of this body, said that not raising the debt is not an option. He went on to say: What I do think is, yes, it would be catastrophic to have the Nation default upon its debt.  Hensarling said that to The Hill on April 10, 2011.  Mr. Speaker, I believe if we bring a clean bill to this floor Tuesday or Wednesday of next week, almost every Democrat will vote for it. Why? Because we agree with Jeb Hensarling not to do so would be catastrophic. It would also be irresponsible and malfeasance.  Mr. Speaker, I ask the majority leader, who has said that we need to do it, we must do it, can the majority leader tell us when that bill will be brought to the floor?  I yield to my friend.                              {time}  1215  Mr. McCARTHY. Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentleman for yielding.  It is one thing to pass the debt limit; it is another thing not to deal with the problem and not find a solution. That is why, in this House, we are very proud of the fact, when Republicans took the majority, we had always offered a budget that balances. We passed one. The balances were outraising new taxes within the decade. Unfortunately, the White House has never found a way to do that.  As the gentleman mentioned, the Secretary has moved the date from reaching the debt limit up to November 3. As I mentioned in the schedule, the House is expected to address this issue next week. There are bipartisan discussions that are ongoing, and I will keep Members abreast and advise them as soon as a path forward is determined.  I am hopeful that we stop kicking the can down the road. In our own budgets that balance, we know the debt limit will have to be raised. That is why you quote our Members saying that. We also acknowledge that it has to be solved. That is why we put a balanced budget up to pay for it going forward. That is why I am hopeful, in these bipartisan discussions, that we start the down payment where we don't have to worry about raising the debt limit, that we are actually paying off the debt and not leaving this to our children and grandchildren.
