President, last week, I filed two important amendments to the pending Wall Street reform legislation to protect the identity of whistleblowers and to ensure transparency and accountability to the American public when the government investigates allegations of financial fraud. My amendments on whistleblower confidentiality strike a careful balance between the need to protect the identity of whistleblowers and the public interest in transparency. I hope the Senate will work to include these amendments in the bill.  The recent economic crisis has revealed how corporate greed must be reigned in on Wall Street. While average Americans were suffering, many Wall Street investment banks and insurance companies went to great lengths to hide their shaky finances from stockholder and government regulators. Whistleblowers serve an important role in exposing financial fraud. This underscores the importance of ensuring that whistleblowers are provided the necessary protections to come forward with allegations of financial fraud and ensuring that the American public has access to critical information about corporate financial wrongdoing.  My amendments addresses two key problems with the whistleblower provisions in the bill: First, the bill would prevent whistleblowers from obtaining information that they themselves have provided to government regulators under any circumstances. Second, the bill creates an unnecessary exemption to the Freedom of Information Act, FOIA, that would, in some cases, shield critical information about financial fraud from the public indefinitely.  To strengthen the protections for whistleblowers, my amendments strike the well-intended, but overbroad confidentiality provisions in sections 748(h) and 922(h) of the bill, and replace those provisions with new language that both protects the confidentiality of whistleblower identity information and ensures the public's right to know. Specifically, the amendments require that government regulators may not disclose whistleblower identity information without the whistleblower's consent. My amendments also require that the government notify the whistleblower if information about the whistleblower's identity will be shared with other government agencies, or foreign authorities assisting with an investigation.  To ensure the public's right to know, my amendments remove language from the bill that, in some cases, would change law and could indefinitely shield critical information about financial fraud from the public. My amendments do not change existing disclosure requirements and exemptions under FOIA, but, rather, they require that government regulators treat information that reveals the identity of whistleblowers as confidential. Other information that a whistleblower provides to the government would remain subject to the existing disclosure requirements and exemptions under FOIA and other Federal laws.  My amendments are modeled after whistleblower protection provisions that Congress has previously and overwhelmingly enacted in other recent legislation. The amendments also complement the whistleblower protections already included in the bill.  My amendments are supported by a broad coalition of open government organizations, including--the Project on Government Oversight, Citizens for Responsibility and Ethics in Washington, OpenTheGovernment.org, Public Citizen, the Progressive States Network, Common Cause, National Community Reinvestment Coalition, Consumer Action, OMB Watch, National Fair Housing Alliance, and Americans for Financial Reform. I thank each of these organizations for their support of the amendments and for their work on behalf of whistleblowers and the public's right to know.  As the Senate concludes debate on critical reforms to head off the Wall Street fraud and abuses, we must work to ensure accountability and openness in how the government responds to this crisis. The improvements in my amendments will ensure that whistleblowers have the protection that they deserve and that financial firms will be held accountable. I urge all Senators to support these open government amendments.  I ask unanimous consent that a copy of a support letter signed by several open government organizations be printed in the Record.  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in the Record, as follows:                                                     May 11, 2010.     Hon. Patrick Leahy,     U.S. Senate,     Washington, DC.       Dear Senator Leahy: We, the undersigned organizations,      write to thank you and share our support for the amendment      (SA 3297) you have offered to the Restoring American      Financial Stability Act, S. 3217. The amendment will replace      two dangerous provisions that would unnecessarily limit      public access to critical information and place a gag on      whistleblowers with language that instead would provide      authentic confidentiality and protection of the identity of      whistleblowers. We believe that in order to both preserve      government accountability and encourage whistleblowers to      come forward this amendment must be incorporated into S.      3217.       Tucked inside two provisions to establish whistleblower      incentives and protections to rightly encourage the flow of      information of wrongdoing to the Securities and Exchange      Commission (SEC) and the Commodities Futures Trading      Commission (CFTC) are poison pill secrecy measures. Sections      748(h)(2) and 922(h)(2) bar the public and the whistleblower      from ever being able to obtain information about      investigations if the government never acts. If a      whistleblower faces retaliation there would be no access to      government records needed to prove status as a whistleblower.      If there is no action due to inept bureaucracy, fraud,      collusion, or worse, there would be no way to hold the      government accountable.       We must preserve the ability of the whistleblower to gain      access to the information if retaliation occurs, as well as      public access to hold the Commission and other government      agencies accountable, especially if there is no investigation      or the investigation leads to no further judicial or      administrative action. Your amendment would do just that, and      would remove the blanket gag orders creating a permanent seal      and government secrecy.       Moreover, as you know, it is unnecessary to add additional      exemptions to the Freedom of Information Act (FOIA) in these      whistleblower provisions. Forty years of jurisprudence have      proven the FOIA's exemptions (amended in 1986 to expand      protection for law enforcement records) have stood the test      of time, fairly and effectively balancing the agency's      interests in confidentiality and personal privacy rights with      the public's right to know.       Investigations occur across the federal government every      day and information pertaining to the administrative stages      of these investigations is protected. In more than two      decades, no agency has expressed concern over unwarranted      access to investigative information during an open      investigation. We not only see no justification to hide      closed     investigations of possible wrongdoing in the financial      industry, whether or not provided by a whistleblower, but      find this to be at cross-purposes with making government      regulation of the financial industry more transparent and      effective.       We thank you for this amendment to preserve whistleblower      rights, public access to information, and government      accountability, and for your commitment to protecting the      public's right to know.           Sincerely,         Project on Government Oversight (POGO); Citizens for            Responsibility and Ethics in Washington (CREW);            Government Accountability Project (GAP);            OpenTheGovernmentorg; Public Citizen; Progressive            States Network; Common Cause; National Community            Reinvestment Coalition; Consumer Action; OMB Watch;            National Fair Housing Alliance; Americans for Financial            Reform.
