Chairman, I claim the time in opposition, although I am not in opposition.  The Acting CHAIR. Without objection, the gentleman from Oregon is recognized for 5 minutes.  There was no objection.  Mr. DeFAZIO. Mr. Chairman, I certainly want to work with the gentleman. I mean, this is a story that tugs at you. The gentleman brings before us an important issue. I think there is a way to get at this; so, I would love to work with the gentleman as we go to conference and see what we can do.  With the indulgence of the House, I yield 1 minute to the gentleman from Tennessee (Mr. Cohen).
