Speaker, I rise today to congratulate Oregon State University's 2006 baseball team on their College World Series Championship June 26, 2006. This title is a fitting ending to a truly remarkable season for the Beavers. The team has made Oregon proud; this is a victory for fans throughout the state.  I'd like to recognize the individual coaches and players not only for their victory, but also for their teamwork and sportsmanship which undoubtedly contributed to this accomplishment for the team and the university. Head Coach Pat Casey, Coaches Marty Lees and Dan Spencer, Assistant Coach David Wong and Strength and Conditioning Coach Andy Dendas.  Players: Erik Ammon, Sophomore; Darwin Barney, Sophomore; Bret Bochsler, Freshman; Reed Brown, Sophomore; Dallas Buck, Junior; Brian Budrow, Freshman; Mitch Canham, Sophomore; Bryn Card, Freshman; Brett Casey, Freshman; Cory Ellis, Freshman; Derek Engelke, Sophomore; Josh Forgue, Freshman; Cole Gillespie, Junior; Ryan Gipson, Senior; Tyler Graham, Junior; Mark Grbavac, Freshman; Kevin Gunderson, Junior; Koa Kahalehoe, Freshman; Greg Keim, Junior; Jon Koller, Senior; Chris Kunda, Senior; Eddie Kunz, Sophomore; Joey Lakowske, Freshman; Greg Laybourn, Freshman; Lonnie Lechelt, Sophomore; Mike Lissman, Junior; Anton Maxwell, Junior; Jake McCormick, Junior; Shea McFeely, Senior; Jonah Nickerson, Junior; Joe Paterson, Sophomore; Casey Priceman, Sophomore; Sean Rockey, Freshman; Bill Rowe, Senior; Scott Santschi, Junior; Alex Sogard, Freshman; Dale Solomon, Freshman; Michael Stutes, Sophomore; Rob Summers, Freshman; Daniel Turpen, Sophomore; Geoff Wagner, Senior; John Wallace, Freshman.  As the underdog team throughout much of the tournament Oregon State truly impressed us with their resilience. Oregon State is the first team in 16 years to win their first College World Series game and national title in the same season. The support of the community and fans contributed much to the spirit that followed this team through their victory. Of notable credit, Jonathan Casey, son of Coach Pat Casey inspired us all with his unbreakable belief in Oregon State Baseball.  Oregon State is the first Northern-based school to win the College World Series in 40 years, I hope that this is a new trend in athletics throughout Oregon and the Pacific Northwest. Congratulations Beavers on a hard-fought and well-earned championship.                          ____________________[Extensions of Remarks][Pages E1341-E1342]From the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]    COMMENDING OREGON STATE UNIVERSITY ON THEIR COLLEGE WORLD SERIES                                 ______                                                          HON.
