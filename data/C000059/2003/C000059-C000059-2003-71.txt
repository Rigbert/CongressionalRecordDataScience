Speaker, I rise today to honor and pay tribute to an individual whose dedication and contributions to the Inland Empire are exceptional. The Inland Empire has been fortunate to have dynamic and dedicated business and community leaders who willingly and unselfishly give their time and talent and make their communities a better place to live and work. Jamil Dada is one of these individuals. On March 21, 2003, Jamil will be honored by the Boy Scouts of American and will receive the 2003 Distinguished Citizen Good Scout of the Year Award.  Jamil is the Senior Financial Manager for Provident Bank's eleven branches and serves as the manager of Investment Services. In addition to his outstanding professional career, Jamil finds time for numerous community organizations. He serves as Chairman of the Riverside County Workforce Development board which oversees approximately $18 million of federal funding that Riverside County receives for workforce development and job training. His financial experience and integrity led to his appointment to the board by the Riverside County Board of Supervisors.  In addition, Jamil serves as a board member of the Riverside Community College Foundation, the United Way of the Inland Valleys, the Boy Scouts of America Inland Empire Council, the Family Service Association of Western Riverside County and the Magnolia Center Division of the Greater Riverside Chamber of Commerce. He is also a member of the Planned Giving Advisory Board at the University of California, Riverside.  Jamil is a long time member of the Moreno Valley Rotary Club and currently is Vice-Chairman of the Moreno Valley Chamber of Commerce. He is a board member of the Police Activities League and treasurer of the Moreno Valley Substance Abuse Task Force. He is also actively involved as the Vice President of Moreno Valley's largest food pantry, the Community Assistance Program. Jamil has also been instrumental at March Air Reserve Base as an Honorary Commander. He is also the Vice President of the March Air Field Air Museum, Chairman of the Friends of March Field and treasurer of the MARB Forum.  In 1993 the Moreno Valley Hispanic Chamber honored him as their Man of the Year and in 1994 he was Rotarian of the Year for Rotary District 5330 and Moreno Valley's Citizen of the Year in 1997. In 2002 he was the finalist in the Inland Empire Leaders of Distinction.  Jamil has set a standard of excellence and commitment in his work in the community that would be hard to match. His tireless passion for community service has contributed immensely to the betterment of the Inland Empire. His involvement in the community makes me proud to call him a fellow community member, American and friend. I know that many community members are grateful for his service and salute him as he receives the 2003 Distinguished Citizen Good Scout of the Year Award.                          ____________________
