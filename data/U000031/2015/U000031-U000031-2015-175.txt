Speaker, I rise today to recognize the nationally renowned Air Zoo in Kalamazoo, Michigan, which is hosting the 2015 Science Innovation Hall of Fame Awards on April 18, 2015.  It is only fitting that the Air Zoo is the setting for this gala event to recognize the transformative work of top Southwest Michigan students and teachers in the fields of science, technology, engineering, arts and mathematics as well as residents who have advanced the area of aviation. The Air Zoo was founded in 1977 as the Kalamazoo Aviation History Museum by Suzanne and Pete Parish, who wanted to share their enthusiasm for World War II airplanes and artifacts. Scientific affiliations grew to include the Smithsonian Institution and the Michigan Space Science Center, which allows visitors to experience some of the challenges astronauts face during their training. Full-motion flight simulators, 3-D and 4-D theaters, and interactive exhibits--including one about women in aviation and space--provided adventure little seen in regular museums.  Education is tucked inside a fun setting as evidenced by the Air Zoo being named as the ``Best Place to Spend a Day with Your Family'' and ``Best Place to Take out-of-Towners'' for the past three years by the more than 130,000 visitors it has touching down at its doors each year.  Mr. Speaker, many have wondered how the facility got its name. As the collection of airplanes grew, so did the number of animal names: Wildcat, Hellcat, Bearcat and Flying Tiger. Obviously, these flying critters can only be contained in an Air Zoo.  Recently the Air Zoo was recognized as one of the jewels in the crown of the state by receiving a grant from the Michigan Council for Arts and Cultural Affairs to keep this state-of-the-art air and space museum on its mission of preserving the legacy of flight. I am proud to recognize the many accomplishments of the Air Zoo by the people who work there and wish them much success in the future.                          ____________________
