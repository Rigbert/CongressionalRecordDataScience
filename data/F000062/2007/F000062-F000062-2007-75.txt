 Pierce.  This bill would rename a post office in Taft, California after Staff Sergeant Pierce.  Staff Sergeant Pierce moved to Taft, California as a young child and attended Taft city schools and Taft Union High School, which my own father graduated from in 1922.  Staff Sergeant Pierce would have graduated with the Taft Union High School class of 1959, but he chose to join the U.S. Army in 1958.  On September 20, 1965, Staff Sergeant Pierce was killed near Ben Cat in the Republic of Vietnam. He made the ultimate sacrifice to protect his comrades, smothering the blast of an anti-personnel mine with his body.  He was only 24 years old.  He left behind his wife, Verlin, and three children: Teresa, Kelley, and Gregory.  President Lyndon B. Johnson posthumously awarded Staff Sergeant Pierce the Medal of Honor on February 24, 1966. The citation on his Medal of Honor reads as follows:       For conspicuous gallantry and intrepidity at the risk of      life above and beyond the call of duty. Sgt. Pierce was      serving as squad leader in a reconnaissance platoon when his      patrol was ambushed by hostile forces.       Through his inspiring leadership and personal courage, the      squad succeeded in eliminating an enemy machinegun and      routing the opposing force. While pursuing the fleeing enemy,      the squad came upon a dirt road and, as the main body of his      men entered the road, Sgt. Pierce discovered an antipersonnel      mine emplaced in the road bed.       Realizing that the mine could destroy the majority of his      squad, Sgt. Pierce saved the lives of his men at the      sacrifice of his life by throwing himself directly onto the      mine as it exploded. Through his indomitable courage,      complete disregard for his safety, and profound concern for      his fellow soldiers, he averted loss of life and injury to      the members of his squad.       Sgt. Pierce's extraordinary heroism, at the cost of his      life, are in the highest traditions of the U.S. Army and      reflect great credit upon himself and the Armed Forces of his      country.  Naming the Taft Post Office in Staff Sergeant Pierce's honor is a fitting commemoration and meaningful way for the community to remember thededication and sacrifices of the members of our Armed Forces.  I would like to thank the members of the Taft City Council, who passed a resolution on September 4, 2007 to request that Congress rename the Taft Post Office the Larry S. Pierce Post Office.  I sincerely hope that my colleagues will support this resolution to honor the service and sacrifice of Staff Sergeant Pierce.  I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be printed in the Record.                                 ______                                       By
