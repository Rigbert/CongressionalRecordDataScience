 President, I conclude by pointing out the following: Last year, we spent $1.8 billion--$1.8 billion--on the elections. You tell me, take soft money, hard money, no money, up money, down money, any money--if you take it out, you take a piece of it out and you do not limit the amount we can spend, I promise you--I will bet my career--2 years from now, we are going to be standing here, and I am going to say: We just spent $1.9 billion, and the average cost of an election has gone to $7.1 million.  Average people have no shot of getting in the deal. They have no shot of getting in the deal.  Money is property. Money is not speech. I cannot believe the Founders sat there and said: You know, if I win the genetic pool, I am entitled to have a greater influence in my country and in the electoral process than if I am not in that genetic pool; I was born into land wealth or mercantile wealth. I cannot believe they believed that. I cannot believe that was the case.  I conclude by saying we have the ability under a controlling government interest to deal with corruption in our electoral process. I defy anyone to look me straight in the eye and say they believe all this additional money in the electoral process is not polluting and corrupting the process. It puts honorable young women and men in the Republican and Democratic Parties who are getting into the process in the position of shaving their views very nicely before they get there. No one is going to pay them off, but they are not stupid. I yield the floor.
