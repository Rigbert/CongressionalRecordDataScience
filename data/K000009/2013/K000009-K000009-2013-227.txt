I rise in support of Hurricane Sandy relief wherever it is needed.  I want to offer my voice of support to the people of New York, New Jersey, Connecticut and all others impacted by Hurricane Sandy. Its devastation was vast.  Yesterday, President Obama declared Cuyahoga County, Ohio a federal disaster area as a result of the damage of Hurricane Sandy.  Cuyahoga County private, nonprofit groups, local governments and State agencies are eligible for more than $17 million to cover the cost of storm-related work caused by Hurricane Sandy on Oct. 29 and 30, the Federal Emergency Management Agency announced Thursday.  Cuyahoga County was the only one of Ohio's 88 counties to be eligible for the money from FEMA's Public Assistance Program.  Additionally, Hurricane Sandy did over $13 million in damage to the Lake Erie Ports of Cleveland and Lorain. Storm swells on Lake Erie were massive as the system rolled through and caused extensive damage. While the property damage and displacement was nothing compared to what our citizens in New York, New Jersey, Pennsylvania, and Connecticut experienced and are living with, Congress must address these emergency needs brought on by Mother Nature. It is incumbent upon this Congress to rebuild and restore the might of our Nation's communities so severely impacted by natural disasters.
