 President, that the Department of Defense has turned the corner. I wish I could report that infrastructure costs were coming down. But the latest report of the General Accounting Office tells me that nothing has changed since the last future year defense plan, meaning 1996. The trends have to be the same. The Pentagon still has infrastructure costs on the wrong track. They are still on an up-ramp instead of on a down-ramp. This is what the new data show. As the Department of Defense budget top line goes up, infrastructure costs go up. Infrastructure costs should come down even if the top line goes up. The infrastructure costs ought to be decoupled from the top line. The infrastructure costs need to be recoupled to the force structure because that is what Secretary Perry says is his intent.  The infrastructure costs in the military force structures are not in sync. They are out of whack. We need to bring them back into balance. As I read what Senator McCain has written in his white paper, he says that is what we must do as well. But that is not what has happened. The Department of Defense seems to be creating new infrastructure faster than the old stuff is made excess.  That is what this new data tells us. This is its new data that the General Accounting Office has followed for 1 year that was not available until the General Accounting Office updated it. It shows a steady increase in the infrastructure costs for fiscal year 1997 through fiscal year 2001.  I want to repeat. There is a very steady increase from $146 billion in fiscal year 1997. It dips by $1 billion to $145 billion in 1998, but then it goes right back up to $148 billion in 1999; $2 billion more in the year 2000. Then it leaps by $5 billion to $155 billion in the year 2001. That is a projected increase of $9 billion over the next 5 years. If Congress keeps pumping up the defense budget, these numbers will increase even more.  The data portrayed on table 1 of this new General Accounting Office report is particularly troublesome.  I also ask unanimous consent at this point to have table 1 printed in the Record.  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in the Record, as follows:                TABLE 1.--PROJECTED FUNDING FOR INFRASTRUCTURE CATEGORIES, FISCAL YEARS 1997-2001                                                           [In billions of dollars]                                            ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------                     Infrastructure categories                       FY 1997  FY 1998  FY 1999  FY 2000  FY 2001----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------Installation support...............................................    25.10    23.64    22.68    22.53    23.03Central training...................................................    19.35    19.40    20.08    20.71    21.46Central medical....................................................    15.47    15.82    16.13    16.64    17.38Central logistics..................................................    13.33    13.30    14.18    14.15    14.70Force management...................................................    12.91    12.38    13.05    13.12    13.35Acquisition infrastructure.........................................    10.25    10.64    10.97    11.19    11.76Central personnel..................................................    10.33    10.24    10.41    10.60    10.83Central command, control, and communications.......................     5.78     5.84     6.05     6.05     6.20Resource adjustments \1\...........................................      .05      .53      .50      .62      .58  Total direct infrastructure \2\..................................   112.58   111.80   114.05   115.61   119.30----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\1\ These include adjustments for foreign currency fluctuations and service and Defense Logistics Agency managed  stock fund cash requirements.                                                                                 \2\ Totals may not add due to rounding.

As shown in figure 3 and table 2, most direct      infrastructure activities are funded by operation and      maintenance and military personnel appropriations. Thus, if      DOD is to achieve significant infrastructure savings for      future force modernization, the savings must come from these      accounts. However, these appropriations have been closely      associated with the readiness and quality-of-life of the      force, the Secretary of Defense's priority areas for the last      few years.
