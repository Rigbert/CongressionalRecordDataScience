Speaker, I yield to the gentleman from California (Mr. McCarthy), the majority leader, for the purpose of inquiring of the schedule of the week to come.

Mr. Speaker, on Monday, the House will meet at noon for morning hour and 2 p.m. for legislative business. Votes will be postponed until 6:30.  On Tuesday and Wednesday, the House will meet at 10 a.m. for morning hour and noon for legislative business.  On Thursday, the House will meet at 9 a.m. for legislative business. Members are advised that later votes than normal are possible on Thursday and to keep their travel plans flexible.  No votes are expected in the House on Friday.                              {time}  1300  Madam Speaker, the House will consider a number of suspensions next week, a complete list of which will be announced by close of business today.  The House will consider H.R. 5053, the Preventing the IRS Abuse and Protecting Free Speech Act, sponsored by Representative Roskam. This commonsense bill prohibits the IRS from collecting donor information, which has been used by the IRS to improperly target tax-exempt organizations.  Finally, Madam Speaker, the House will consider H.R. 5293, the FY17 Defense appropriations bill, sponsored by Representative Rodney Frelinghuysen. We expect a large number of amendments to be considered on this bill. So, again, Members are reminded to keep their travel schedules flexible at the end of next week.
