In fact, the earlier coalition has grown to 18 industry representatives, including cattle, poultry, swine producers, Coca-Cola, Pepsi, even Cargill. In a letter to me, the coalition writes:       We are asking Congress to provide those that utilize and      rely on corn and corn products a reasonable amount of      certainty that adequate supplies are available to all users      of this commodity.  We know right now the price of corn is very high. This obviously has--it does not happen in a vacuum. Too often on the Senate floor we believe things can be done without affecting others. In this case, it is definitely affecting others, as indicated by these communications.  Now, with respect to our amendment, they state:       Your amendment would go a long way in ensuring a safety net      ensuring those of us that utilize corn and corn products will      have enough to go around should a drought or flood occur that      would limit the harvested amount that is available.  Now, our amendment seeks to provide some of the much needed equity in the current system. This amendment simply requires that the USDA provide information on projected corn harvests each year. Well, they do that anyway. This is not going to incur anymore of a hardship on the USDA; they have that capability; they are already doing it.  If the projected harvest is below a certain percentage, then the administrator has the authority to modify the mandate for the next year.  So that if it comes down and we see we are going to have a drought, we are going to have some kind of a problem, we would be able to address that by making a small adjustment to the mandate that is there.  Now, I would expect the ethanol industry to support our amendment, since first they claim there is no food versus feed issue. Second, because they have stated repeatedly that corn farmers can grow much more renewable--Fuels Association President Bob Dineen said--this is the one who is very strong in the ethanol mandate the American farmer absolutely has the ability to grow more corn to provide sufficient quantities of grain and food and feed for fuel usage and we are going to see that that happens.  Well, if that is the case, then there is not a problem. So I am not suggesting or picking any favorites with this amendment. I am saying we ought to be sure in the event that something that can be foreseen, and these droughts can be foreseen--as I say, they are doing it right now. So this amendment supports that concept.  Corn farmers have done a great job in increasing yield per acre in the past and they will continue to do that. Our amendment simply provides, as a collective food industry State, a reasonable amount of certainty and a safety net, so that all the U.S. agriculture is able to prosper.  I know there are others who are on the floor who would disagree with my amendment. I certainly wish to make sure they have time to express themselves. So if the Senator from Iowa is prepared at this point to speak, I would be glad to yield to him.                               Exhibit 1                                                    June 20, 2007.     Sen. James Inhofe,     Russell Senate Office Building,     Washington, DC.       Dear Ranking Member Inhofe: We believe in the need to      advance renewable and alternative sources of energy. New fuel      sources offer the potential to eliminate our dependence on      foreign oil while contributing to the long-term stability of      our rural economies. But, as we seek to implement policy that      will move us toward accomplishing this objective, it is      essential that we carefully weigh the impacts of our actions      on other segments of the economy. Additionally, we would hope      that any policy that is agreed upon during this debate would      not overly tax one group in an effort to hopefully achieve      the objective of energy independence.       We are concerned that the very aggressive increase in      biofuels mandates proposed in S. 1419 raises fundamental      questions about the impact that an increased federal      government mandate for corn-based ethanol, in addition to new      state mandates, will have on the livestock, poultry and food      industry's ability to produce competitively available,      affordable food. It is vitally important that we fully      appreciate and understand the implications of quintupling the      Renewable Fuel Standard (RFS) mandate, and we would ask that      you use careful consideration and listen to the significant      issues being raised by those in the agriculture and food      products community.       Rapid development of the corn-based ethanol industry is      already having adverse impacts on food supplies and prices, a      major concern for us. Rising food prices, coupled with the      rising energy prices we are seeing throughout the country,      pose a threat to the health of our national economy.      According to a recent report by Merrill Lynch Chief      Investment Strategist Richard Bernstein, within the first      three months of the year, food prices rose at an annualized      rate of 7.3 percent. That is slightly higher than the      anticipated annual rise in healthcare costs over the next      decade, according to the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid      Services' National Health Statistics Group. In addition, the      continued aggressive expansion of corn ethanol production      diminishes the availability of soybeans and other crops. We      need a safety valve that ensures availability and that works.       We are asking Congress to provide those that utilize and      rely on corn and corn products a reasonable amount of      certainty that adequate supplies are available to all users      of this commodity. Your amendment to S. 1419, the Agriculture      Equity Adjustment Provision (#1666) would go a long way in      achieving a safety net ensuring those of us that utilize corn      and corn products will have enough to go around should a      drought or flood occur that would limit the harvested amount      that is available.       We look forward to working with you to achieve a balanced      approach between all competing uses of corn as we go forward      in this energy debate. We need an adequate contingency plan      in place, and this amendment achieves that goal.       Thanks again for your leadership and efforts.           Sincerely,         American Feed Industry Association, American Meat            Institute, Cargill, The Coca Cola Company, ConAgra            Foods, General Mills, Grocery Manufacturers/Food            Products Association, Hormel Foods, National            Cattlemen's Beef Association, National Chicken Council,            National Pork Producers Council, National Restaurant            Association, National Turkey Federation, PepsiCo, Inc.,            Seaboard Corporation, Tyson Foods, United Egg            Association, United Egg Producers.
