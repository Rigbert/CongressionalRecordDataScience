Speaker, I thank the gentlewoman from Maryland (Mrs. Morella) for yielding me this time.  I saw the courage and conviction in their eyes. It reflected the courage and conviction of Joe and Thomas. It reflected the courage and conviction of their fellow Americans, their fellow citizens. They were not prepared, nor are they now prepared, to let those who would terrorize our institutions or our people flinch, retreat, or cower. It is appropriate that we honor these two men for their courage, for their commitment, and for their contribution to making America the greatest land on the face of the Earth. God blesses America. God blessed America through the lives of Thomas and Joseph.
