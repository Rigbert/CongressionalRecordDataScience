 President, today, I wish to honor the life of Jean Sullivan, who was instrumental in making the Alabama Republican Party what it is today. Jean gracefully represented Alabama for 20 years while serving as a powerful force on the Republican National Committee. She was a close personal friend of mine, and I deeply respected her.  Long before Alabama became a red State on the national election map, Jean was fighting to gain popularity for the party she so adamantly supported. She worked on the forefront of molding what the Republican Party would mean for Alabama. Her efforts in promoting and electing Republican candidates are undeniable. She was outspoken and unafraid to fight for what she believed. Her energy will be missed in our State.  Jean was hard-working, energetic, and a true Republican icon. I am proud of her efforts, and I am grateful for her endless dedication to Alabama politics. I know she will be missed not only by her three sons, Kent, Arthur, and Jim Sullivan, her two daughters, Teresa Collins and Connie McAfee, and her many friends, but also by the many people she worked with and inspired in Alabama politics.                          ____________________[Page S6416]From the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]                   TRIBUTE IN HONOR OF JEAN SULLIVAN
