That is how most Americans who work get their health insurance. The employer contribution the Senator receives and I receive is about 72 percent of the premium.  The Senator from Louisiana has characterized an employer contribution as a government subsidy. I would like to ask the Senator from Louisiana, is he prepared to disclose the government subsidy, as he calls it, that he has personally received for his health insurance as a Member of the Senate?
