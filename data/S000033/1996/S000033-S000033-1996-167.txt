 Speaker, for the benefit of my colleagues I would like to have printed in the Record this statement by Sarah Snider and Stephanie Petrolito, high school students at the People's Academy in Vermont. They were speaking at my recent town meeting on issues facing young people.       (Alternated speaking):       We represent the U.S. History class at People's Academy in      Morrisville.       As high school students, we worry every day about our post-     secondary plans, such as college, a vocational or trade      school, or perhaps even joining the workforce directly after      graduation.       As a class we've done some research on the subject, as a      result we have lots of questions. We have more questions than      answers, because many of us have not been through the      financial aid process. Our questions begin with average      students, from average families in average American towns.       Most American students are average, who don't get straight      A's, and who aren't necessarily gifted in athletics or the      arts. This is especially true in other larger states, where      student-teacher ratio's are higher, and less attention is      given to the student as an individual, and their talents.      Also, the majority of American families belong to the middle      class, and are not particularly wealthy or incredibly poor.       A major part of financial aid is based on students'      academic and extracurricular achievements, as well as their      families' income. Many of these students have incredible      potential that is not expressed in their high school      transcripts. Most of the students in the class that I      represent fall into this category. I know that I do. We'd      like to know what can be done to insure that we receive a      college education.       The idea of spending 20 years paying off a debt is very      discouraging, and although we are told that it is worth the      money, most students are hesitant. As average students in the      middle class, what kind of scholarships or financial aids, if      any, are available to us? Many students are left so      discouraged at these prospects that they decide, instead of      furthering their education, to join the workforce. Education      is a right for every American student, not a privilege.       Congressman Sanders: That is an incredible presentation.      You've raised a lot of very important questions. I certainly      don't know all the answers. But if basically what you're      saying--let's say you have a middle class family making $20      or $30 or $40,000/year, and it costs $20-30,000 for one year      to send one kid to college. That equation doesn't make sense,      right? You can't do it.       Answer. Right.       Congressman Sanders: Further, I think you've made the point      that if you don't have a college education, you won't make it      into the middle class. So let me throw it back to you. If you      were sitting in my seat in Congress, what would you do?       Answer. I would probably be inclined to * * * have the      government be more involved. Like, what the girl from      Brattleboro said about other countries where the government      is more involved in college, and it costs less. And I totally      agree that's the way it should be in this country, and that      the government should spend less money on the military.       Congressman Sanders: Okay, as it happens I agree with you.      But what is the other argument that is being made? What do      you hear a whole lot of about the government lately? What do      some people say about the government? Have you heard much?       Answer. Not much.       Congressman Sanders: Does everybody agree with your point      of view?       Answer. No, not everybody. A lot of people think * * * that      there is enough financial aid out there, and that there are      other things that we need to worry about also. * * * But I      just think really that education is incredibly important, and      everybody thinks that.       Congressman Sanders: And a lot of people think, in fact,      that the government should play less of a role.       Answer. Right.       Congressman Sanders: There's a whole line of thought out      there, in which probably a majority of members of Congress      now believe in exact contradiction to what you're saying.      They're saying the government should get out of the issue.      That Americorps--you mentioned Americorps--there's an effort      to defund Americorps completely, not put one penny into      Americorps.       Answer. But these are the people who've already been      through college, and are not worrying about it now. There are      three children in my family, and there's no way unless we      each get a job during college, and try to go to college and      do extracurricular activities, that we're going to be able to      go to college.       Congressman Sanders: I agree with you. But when you hear      the discussion going on in Congress about the role of      government, what they have advocated, if I'm not mistaken, is      that government should play a strong role in assuring that      the middle class is able to send their kids to college, okay?      Okay. So * * * they are defining a role of government. Right      now in Congress there are many who strongly disagree with      what they are asserting. I happen to agree. Thank you very      much for your excellent presentation.                          ____________________
