Speaker, I move to suspend the rules and agree to the resolution (H. Res. 132) expressing the sense of the House of Representatives that the Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals ruling in Newdow v. United States Congress is inconsistent with the Supreme Court's interpretation of the first amendment and should be overturned, and for other purposes.  The Clerk read as follows:                              H. Res. 132       Whereas on June 26, 2002, the Ninth Circuit Court of      Appeals, in Newdow v. United States Congress (292 F.3d 597;      9th Cir. 2002) (Newdow I), held that the Pledge of Allegiance      to the Flag as currently written to include the phrase, ``one      Nation, under God'', unconstitutionally endorses religion,      that such phrase was added to the pledge in 1954 only to      advance religion in violation of the establishment clause,      and that the recitation of the pledge in public schools at      the start of every school day coerces students who choose not      to recite the pledge into participating in a religious      exercise in violation of the establishment clause of the      first amendment;       Whereas on February 28, 2003, the Ninth Circuit Court of      Appeals amended its ruling in this case, and held (in Newdow      II) that a California public school district's policy of      opening each school day with the voluntary recitation of the      Pledge of Allegiance to the Flag ``impermissibly coerces a      religious act'' on the part of those students who choose not      to recite the pledge and thus violates the establishment      clause of the first amendment;       Whereas the ninth circuit's ruling in Newdow II contradicts      the clear implication of the holdings in various Supreme      Court cases, and the spirit of numerous other Supreme Court      cases in which members of the Court have explicitly stated,      that the voluntary recitation of the Pledge of Allegiance to      the Flag is consistent with the first amendment;       Whereas the phrase, ``one Nation, under God'', as included      in the Pledge of Allegiance to the Flag, reflects the notion      that the Nation's founding was largely motivated by and      inspired by the Founding Fathers' religious beliefs;       Whereas the Pledge of Allegiance to the Flag is not a      prayer or statement of religious faith, and its recitation is      not a religious exercise, but rather, it is a patriotic      exercise in which one expresses support for the United States      and pledges allegiance to the flag, the principles for which      the flag stands, and the Nation;       Whereas the House of Representatives recognizes the right      of those who do not share the beliefs expressed in the pledge      or who do not wish to pledge allegiance to the flag to      refrain from its recitation;       Whereas the effect of the ninth circuit's ruling in Newdow      II will prohibit the recitation of the pledge at every public      school in 9 states, schooling over 9.6 million students, and      could lead to the prohibition of, or severe restrictions on,      other voluntary speech containing religious references in      these classrooms;       Whereas rather than promoting neutrality on the question of      religious belief, this decision requires public school      districts to adopt a preference against speech containing      religious references;       Whereas the constitutionality of the voluntary recitation      by public school students of numerous historical and founding      documents, such as the Declaration of Independence, the      Constitution, and the Gettysburg Address, has been placed      into serious doubt by the ninth circuit's decision in Newdow      II;       Whereas the ninth circuit's interpretation of the first      amendment in Newdow II is clearly inconsistent with the      Founders' vision of the establishment clause and the free      exercise clause of the first amendment, Supreme Court      precedent interpreting the first amendment, and any      reasonable interpretation of the first amendment;       Whereas this decision places the ninth circuit in direct      conflict with the Seventh Circuit Court of Appeals which, in      Sherman v. Community Consolidated School District (980 F.2d      437; 7th Cir. 1992), held that a school district's policy      allowing for the voluntary recitation of the Pledge of      Allegiance to the Flag in public schools does not violate the      establishment clause of the first amendment;       Whereas Congress has consistently supported the Pledge of      Allegiance to the Flag by starting each session with its      recitation;       Whereas the House of Representatives reaffirmed support for      the Pledge of Allegiance to the Flag in the 107th Congress by      adopting House Resolution 459 on June 26, 2002, by a vote of      416-3; and       Whereas the Senate reaffirmed support for the Pledge of      Allegiance to the Flag in the 107th Congress by adopting      Senate Resolution 292 on June 26, 2002, by a vote of 99-0:      Now, therefore, be it       Resolved, that it is the sense of the House of      Representatives that--       (1) the phrase ``one Nation, under God,'' in the Pledge of      Allegiance to the Flag reflects that religious faith was      central to the Founding Fathers and thus to the founding of      the Nation;       (2) the recitation of the Pledge of Allegiance to the Flag,      including the phrase, ``one Nation, under God,'' is a      patriotic act, not an act or statement of religious faith or      belief;       (3) the phrase ``one Nation, under God'' should remain in      the Pledge of Allegiance to the Flag and the practice of      voluntarily reciting the pledge in public school classrooms      should not only continue but should be encouraged by the      policies of Congress, the various States, municipalities, and      public school officials;       (4) despite being the school district where the legal      challenge to the pledge originated, the Elk Grove Unified      School District in Elk Grove, California, should be      recognized and commended for their continued support of the      Pledge of Allegiance to the Flag;       (5) the Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals ruling in Newdow v.      United States Congress has created a split among the circuit      courts, and is inconsistent with the Supreme Court's      interpretation of the first amendment, which indicates that      the voluntary recitation of the pledge and similar patriotic      expressions is consistent with the first amendment;       (6) the Attorney General should appeal the ruling in Newdow      v. United States Congress, and the Supreme Court should      review this ruling in order to correct this constitutionally      infirm and historically incorrect holding; and       (7) the President should nominate and the Senate should      confirm Federal circuit court judges who interpret the      Constitution consistent with the Constitution's text.
