President, regretfully, I am going to oppose this amendment. I am going to have to cover some points which my good friend from Kentucky made that I think are totally wrong.  First of all, I don't agree we need to be going up there with Federal dollars bailing out cities that are having problems. Of course, that is a decision thatis going to be made, I suppose, by a lot of people.  Also, the Senator from Kentucky talks about sending billions of dollars overseas. I agree with my colleague from Kentucky about some of the foreign aid and I would join with him but certainly not in this case. Before I tell my colleagues why, let me clarify something.
