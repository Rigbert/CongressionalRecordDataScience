President, today I pay tribute to a great Rhode Islander, Marguerite K. McKay, who passed away last month at the age of 96.  Marguerite Katherine McCrudden was born in Providence on September 15, 1918, and grew up in the Smith Hill neighborhood of the city. One of six children, she attended St. Patrick's High School in Providence and graduated from Bryant College in 1938.  Marguerite spent much of her professional life dedicated to the city of Providence. She began her career in the Building Inspector's Office, and later moved to the Providence School Department, where she worked until she retired.  Marguerite married Franklin Richard McKay in 1950, and together they had one child, Bernard. Franklin served as a city councilman and city solicitor in Attleboro, MA, and both he and Marguerite were active in the Attleboro community and their church parish, St. John the Evangelist.  After Franklin's passing in 1968, Marguerite spent her time living in Barrington, RI, and on Prudence Island in Narragansett Bay. She enjoyed cooking, gardening, swimming, and following politics. In her retirement, she traveled extensively and remained active in her church, St. Luke's in Barrington. In 2005, she moved to Reston, VA to be closer to her family.  Marguerite passed away in Reston in May. Her funeral was held on June 20 at her childhood church, St. Patrick's, in the Smith Hill neighborhood of Providence. She was predeceased by her beloved grandson Brendan, who passed away last year.  I would like to offer my heartfelt condolences to Marguerite's son Bernard and his wife Mary; her grandchildren Patrick, Conor, and Rosemary; her three great-grandchildren; and her two surviving siblings, Cornelius Bernard McCrudden and Mary McCrudden Broome. Marguerite led a life of service to her community, and our State is better for it. I know her example of good will and selflessness will continue to sustain and inspire her family.                          ____________________
