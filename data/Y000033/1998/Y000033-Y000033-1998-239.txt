Mr. Chairman, I rise in opposition to the amendment.  Mr. Chairman, the Congress is given the responsibility to determine the civil rights and status of the inhabitants of Puerto Rico under the Treaty of Paris. I have the Treaty of Paris in front of me. I do not want to get into a great debate with my friend, the gentleman from Illinois, but Congress extended U.S. sovereignty to Puerto Rico and U.S. nationality to its residents.  Consequently, I oppose the amendment, and I think that we ought to have a vote on the amendment.
