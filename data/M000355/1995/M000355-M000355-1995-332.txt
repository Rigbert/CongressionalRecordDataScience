 President, I stand today to pay tribute to Van Vance, the ``Voice of the Cards.'' Van Vance has kept University of Louisville basketball and football fans tuned in on WHAS radio since the 1981-82 seasons. And today, I'm saddened to announce that one of the biggest Cardinals fans is giving up two of his true loves; play-by-play for U of L basketball and his ``Sportstalk'' radio show.  Van's voice will surely be missed by U of L basketball fans next season. He will also be missed by his old buddy and cohost, Jock Sutherland. For Cardinal fans, Jock and Vance are like the Siskel and Ebert of basketball, they have been inseparable for the past 13 seasons. Jock describes Van as ``an absolute total professional.'' In a recent article in Louisville's Courier Journal Jock called Van ``the Walter Cronkite of Louisville Sports. They can replace you and replace you with a good man, but there'll only be one Walter Cronkite.''  Van's love for basketball started at an early age. He earned the nickname ``Hawkeye'' while playing basketball at Park City High School. He lead the team in scoring during the 1951-52 season, and even though his career high was 39 points, Van most remembers a 34-point performance that included a perfect 18 of 18 from the free throw line. Those are just several reasons Van earned letters in four sports and an athletic scholarship to Western Kentucky University.  His first job in radio came after a station manager in Glasgow, KY, heard his delivery of an ``I Speak for Democracy'' speech. He wasted no time getting to work, he started the job just hours after his last basketball game at Park City High in 1952. Van still had ``Hoop Dreams.'' He went to play basketball for legendary Ed Diddle at Western Kentucky, but when the coach made him choose between basketball and radio, Van gave up the courts for the studio.  After several radio jobs, Van finally landed at WHAS-AM in Louisville. He started as a staff announcer in 1957, and then joined the sports staff in 1970. That same year, WHAS acquired the rights to broadcast the Kentucky Colonels' games of the American Basketball Association. Van did play-by-play for the Colonels until the franchise disbanded in 1976. Then in 1981, WHAS-AM was awarded the rights to U of L football and basketball games, and Van Vance was back on the air. The rest is Cardinals sports history.  Mr. President, I ask you and my fellow colleagues to pay tribute to the career of Van Vance. It has been a memorable one, highlights include; doing play-by-play for the Louisville victory over Duke in the 1986 NCAA championship, the Kentucky Colonels' victory in the 1975 ABA championship, the first basketball ``Dream Game'' between U of L and UK, and the football Cardinals big win in the 1991 Fiesta Bowl. A recent quote from Van sums it up best: ``I've always said a play-by-play announcer is like a surfer--the better the team, the better the game, the better announcer you can be. If you have a good wave, just ride it.'' Let's hope Van catches the ``Big Kahuna'' and the ``Voice of the Cards'' lives on in the hearts of cardinal fans young and old.                          ____________________
