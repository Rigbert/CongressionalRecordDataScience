President, I spoke about the situation in Cote d'Ivoire just last Friday and pointed out that the person responsible for the chaos and killing--a rebel named Alassane Ouattara--met last Friday with President Obama in our Nation's White House. I said then and say now again that this was an unwise and grossly misguided decision by Obama. It is in fact an outrage that our President would welcome, with open arms, a potential war criminal who is responsible for the death of at least 3,000 people and displacement of half a million refugees in the African country of Cote d'Ivoire. Ouattara is an illegitimate usurper who has scandalized Cote d'Ivoire's electoral system, and unlawfully ousted the democratically elected incumbent President Laurent Gbagbo.  Now the Associated Press reports just yesterday that the violence in Cote d'Ivoire remains uncontrolled. The title of the AP story says is all. It reads: ``Warlords in Ivory Coast continue to reign, national reconciliation difficult 3 months later.''  The AP story highlights the just released Amnesty International report that I spoke about last week that pointed out that ``Ouattara's rebel Army continues to carry out violence and intimidation against ethnicities perceived as having supported President Gbagbo, and that almost 700,000 people remain in refugee camps for displaced people in the country's remote far west.''  The AP highlights the fact that although Ouattara is telling the world that he is seeking reconciliation; in fact Ouattara is allowing ``a pervading culture of criminality to continue.''  For example, in the financial capital of Abidjan, warlords have taken over parts of the city and death squads roam the streets looking for Gbagbo supporters. In addition, they are committing ``armed robberies, kidnapping and killings almost daily'' without any sign of ceasing. At the very least rebel leader Ouattara has no control over his rebel troops, which in the recent past committed atrocities and massacres on their march to Abidjan, and at the worst he is tacitly approving their actions by not intervening.  AP also reports that ``even the French Embassy sent a security message to its citizens warning that `incidents of unequal gravity are still being reported.' '' And this is 3 months after the French themselves militarily overthrew President Gbagbo and installed Ouattara! The French are indeed now reaping what they have sown.  I point out again that Amnesty International alleges that these forces under Ouattara's command are continuing to engage in ``documented crimes under international law and human rights violations and abuses, including extrajudicial executions and other unlawful killings, rape and other sexual violence, torture, other ill-treatment and arbitrary arrest and detention; as well as the consequences of high levels of displacement, pervasive insecurity, and intentional destruction of homes and other buildings not justified by military necessity.''  The AP story summarizes the current situation by quoting the conclusion of the Amnesty International report which states that ``if [this situation is] not addressed quickly, the very serious consequences of the recent wave of insecurity and displacement will have further repercussions during the coming years and may fuel growing discontent and unrest, undermining efforts to promote reconciliation in a country torn apart by a decade of ethnic strife and violent conflict.''  This is my ninth time speaking on the Senate floor about the ongoing bloodbath of unspeakable acts of violence that are occurring in the once beautiful and prosperous country of Cote d'Ivoire. I again call for the intervention of the African Union--and not the French--to bring an end to the violence there, and call for new elections that will this time prevent the electoral fraud by Ouattara that allowed him to claim victory. I also call for the release of President Gbagbo and his wife Simone who are being held incommunicado by Ouattara, and either allow President Gbagbo to seek reelection for President or be allowed to go into exile. I have been in communication with a sub-Saharan African country which has agreed to grant asylum to the Gbagbos, and I call upon our State Department to facilitate such a move as it did for former Haitian President Duvalier in 1986.  The killing must stop. My recommendations are a path to stop the killing.                          ____________________
