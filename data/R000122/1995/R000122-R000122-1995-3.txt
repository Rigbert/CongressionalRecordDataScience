Speaker, I have heard some callously suggest that if you shut down the Government no one would notice.  Well, Mr. Speaker, nothing could be further from the truth.  In my home State of Rhode Island, 27 Almacs supermarket stores have gone out of business during the holiday season.  Normally, these 2,000 workers from Almacs would be eligible for emergency assistance from the Labor Department. But, with the shutdown, there is no one to process the State's application for assistance, and as a result, there will be no help for the families of Almacs workers during the holidays. And that, Mr. Speaker, is a shame.  The Speaker could have prevented the shutdown and responded to last year's call for an end to gridlock. Because right now gridlock is back.  The Republicans have a 7-year budget plan that is just too extreme, and they know it.  I am glad the President did the right thing to protect the education, health care, and the environment.  Mr. Speaker, I urge you to end the politics and start serious negotiations.                          ____________________
