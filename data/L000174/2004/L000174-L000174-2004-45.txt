President, as in years past, I am offering today two pieces of legislation that would close a loophole in the 1996 Telecommunications Act, and as in years past I am pleased that I am joined by Senators Jeffords and Dodd.  The catalog of complaints about the 1996 act continues to grow, and as it becomes more apparent that this flawed statute is in need of repair, I grow ever more proud that I was one of five Senators to have voted against that law.  In the coming Congress, we will be revisiting the 1996 Act. While we should rightly examine the various provisions related to telephone competition, broadband, and subscriber television rates, there are other important issues that we need to address.  The 1996 Telecommunications Act contained a provision that allowed the Federal Communications Commission to preempt the decisions of local authorities as to the placement of cell phone towers. In 1997, the Federal Communications Commission seized on the legislative loophole, proposing an expansive new rule that prevented State and local zoning laws from regulating the placement of cellular and broadcast towers based on environmental considerations, aviation safety, or other locally determined matters. Local and State governments were no longer empowered to shape the appearance of their communities.  I fought this proposed rule and was joined by many Vermonters, including former-Governor Dean, the Vermont Environmental Board, mayors, zoning officials, and numerous others. We took our case to the Supreme Court and filed an amicus brief, arguing that the preemption of that local power to regulate land use was a clear violation of the U.S. Constitution. It is unfortunate that the Court would not hear that case. It is time to give that control back to the local governments by enacting my legislation.  The two bills that we are reintroducing today will not tip the scales, but they will even them out a bit. They will allow local officials to use State and local regulations to work with the Federal Government in order to develop the best solutions for the placement of cell phone and broadcast towers.  Communities across the country understand the growing demand for cellular services will result in new towers, and they welcome the improvement in service that this increased infrastructure will bring. However, they also want to make sure that their towns do not become little more than pincushions for new cellular towers. These goals are not mutually exclusive.  I thank again Senator Jeffords and Senator Dodd, and I urge my colleagues to join us in supporting this legislation. I ask unanimous consent that the text of these two bills be printed in the Record.  There being no objection, the bills were ordered to be printed in the Record, as follows:                                S. 2963       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of      the United States of America in Congress assembled,     SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.       This Act may be cited as the ``Local Control of Broadcast      Towers Act''.     SEC. 2. FINDINGS AND PURPOSE.       (a) Findings.--Congress makes the following findings:       (1) The placement, construction, and modification of      broadcast transmission facilities near residential      communities and facilities such as schools can greatly reduce      the value of residential properties, destroy the views from      properties, produce radio frequency interference, raise      concerns about potential long-term health effects of such      facilities, and reduce substantially the desire to live in      the areas of such facilities.       (2) States and local governments have traditionally      regulated development and should be able to exercise control      over the placement, construction, and modification of      broadcast transmission facilities through the use of zoning      and other land use regulations relating to the protection of      the environment, public health and safety, and the general      welfare of the community and the public.       (3) The Federal Communications Commission establishes      policies to govern interstate and international      communications by television, radio, wire, satellite, and      cable. The Commission ensures compliance of such activities      with applicable Federal laws, including the National      Environmental Policy Act of 1969 and the National Historic      Preservation Act, in its decision-making on such activities.       (4) The Commission defers to State and local authorities      which regulate the placement, construction, and modification      of broadcast transmission facilities through the use of      zoning, construction and building, and environmental and      safety regulations in order to protect the environment and      the health, safety, and general welfare of communities and      the public.       (5) On August 19, 1997, the Commission issued a proposed      rule, MM Docket No. 97-182, which would preempt the      application of most State and local zoning, environmental,      construction and building, and other regulations affecting      the placement, construction, and modification of broadcast      transmission facilities.       (6) The telecommunications industry and its experts should      be expected to have access to the best and most recent      technical information and should therefore be held to the      highest standards in terms of their representations,      assertions, and promises to governmental authorities.       (b) Purpose.--The purpose of this Act is to confirm that      State and local governments are the appropriate entities--       (1) to regulate the placement, construction, and      modification of broadcast transmission facilities consistent      with State and local zoning, construction and building,      environmental, and land use regulations;       (2) to regulate the placement, construction, and      modification of broadcast transmission facilities so that      their placement, construction, or modification will not      interfere with the safe and efficient use of public airspace      or otherwise compromise or endanger the health, safety, and      general welfare of the public; and       (3) to hold accountable applicants for permits for the      placement, construction, or modification of broadcast      transmission facilities, and providers of services using such      facilities, for the truthfulness and accuracy of      representations and statements placed in the record of      hearings for such permits, licenses, or approvals.     SEC. 3. PROHIBITION ON ADOPTION OF RULE REGARDING PREEMPTION                    OF STATE AND LOCAL AUTHORITY OVER BROADCAST                    TRANSMISSION FACILITIES.       Notwithstanding any other provision of law, the Federal      Communications Commission shall not adopt as a final rule or      otherwise directly or indirectly implement any portion of the      proposed rule set forth in ``Preemption of State and Local      Zoning and Land Use Restrictions on Siting, Placement and      Construction of Broadcast Station Transmission Facilities'',      MM Docket No. 97-182, released August 19, 1997.     SEC. 4. AUTHORITY OVER PLACEMENT, CONSTRUCTION, AND                    MODIFICATION OF BROADCAST TRANSMISSION                    FACILITIES.       Part I of title III of the Communications Act of 1934 (47      U.S.C. 301 et seq.) is amended by adding at the end the      following:     ``SEC. 340. STATE AND LOCAL AUTHORITY OVER PLACEMENT,                    CONSTRUCTION, AND MODIFICATION OF BROADCAST                    TRANSMISSION FACILITIES.       ``(a) Authority To Require Least Intrusive Facilities.--       ``(1) In general.--A State or local government may deny an      application to place, construct, or modify broadcast      transmission facilities on the basis that alternative      technologies, delivery systems, or structures are capable of      delivering broadcast signals comparable to that proposed to      be delivered by such facilities in a manner that is less      intrusive to the community concerned than such facilities.       ``(2) Considerations.--In determining under paragraph (1)      the intrusiveness of technologies, delivery systems, or      structures for the transmission of broadcast signals, a State      or local government may  consider the aesthetics of such      technologies, systems, or structures, the environmental      impact of such technologies, systems, or structures, and      the radio frequency interference or radiation emitted by      such technologies, systems, or structures.       ``(3) Burden of proof.--In any hearing for purposes of the      exercise of the authority in paragraph (1), the burden shall      be on the applicant.       ``(b) Radio Interference.--A State or local government may      regulate the location, height, or modification of broadcast      transmission facilities in order to address the effects of      radio frequency interference caused by such facilities on      local communities and the public.       ``(c) Authority To Require Studies and Documentation.--No      provision of this Act     may be interpreted to prohibit a State or local government      from--       ``(1) requiring a person seeking authority to place,      construct, or modify broadcast transmission facilities to      produce--       ``(A) environmental, biological, and health studies,      engineering reports, or other documentation of the compliance      of such facilities with radio frequency exposure limits,      radio frequency interference impacts, and compliance with      applicable laws, rules, and regulations governing the effects      of such facilities on the environment, public health and      safety, and the general welfare of the community and the      public; and       ``(B) documentation of the compliance of such facilities      with applicable Federal, State, and local aviation safety      standards or aviation obstruction standards regarding objects      effecting navigable airspace; or       ``(2) refusing to grant authority to such person to place,      construct, or modify such facilities within the jurisdiction      of such government if such person fails to produce studies,      reports, or documentation required under paragraph (1).       ``(d) Construction.--Nothing in this section may be      construed to prohibit or otherwise limit the authority of a      State or local government to ensure compliance with or      otherwise enforce any statements, assertions, or      representations filed or submitted by or on behalf of an      applicant with the State or local government for authority to      place, construct, or modify broadcast transmission facilities      within the jurisdiction of the State or local government.       ``(e) Broadcast Transmission Facility Defined.--In this      section, the term `broadcast transmission facility' means the      equipment, or any portion thereof, with which a broadcaster      transmits and receives the radiofrequency waves that carry      the services of the broadcaster, regardless of whether the      equipment is sited on one or more towers or other structures      owned by a person or entity other than the broadcaster, and      includes the location of such equipment.''.                                S. 2964       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of      the United States of America in Congress assembled,     SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.       This Act may be cited as the ``Local Control of Cellular      Towers Act''.     SEC. 2. FINDINGS AND PURPOSES.       (a) Findings.--Congress makes the following findings:       (1) The placement, construction, and modification of      personal wireless services facilities (also known as wireless      facilities) near residential communities and facilities such      as schools can greatly reduce the value of residential      properties, destroy the views from properties, produce radio      frequency interference, raise concerns about potential long-     term health effects of such facilities, and reduce      substantially the desire to live in the areas of such      facilities.       (2) States and local governments have traditionally      regulated development and should be able to exercise control      over the placement, construction, and modification of      wireless facilities through the use of zoning and other land      use regulations relating to the protection of the      environment, public health and safety, and the general      welfare of the community and the public.       (3) The Federal Communications Commission establishes      policies to govern interstate and international      communications by television, radio, wire, satellite, and      cable. The Commission ensures the compliance of such      activities with a variety of Federal laws, including the      National Environmental Policy Act of 1969 and the National      Historic Preservation Act, in its decision-making on such      activities.       (4) Under section 332(c)(7)(A) of the Communications Act of      1934 (47 U.S.C. 332(c)(7)(A)), the Commission defers to State      and local authorities that regulate the placement,      construction, and modification of wireless facilities through      the use of zoning and other land use regulations.       (5) Alternative technologies for the placement,      construction, and modification of wireless facilities may      meet the needs of a wireless services provider in a less      intrusive manner than the technologies proposed by the      wireless services provider, including the use of small towers      that do not require blinking aircraft safety lights, break      skylines, or protrude above tree canopies.       (6) It is in the interest of the Nation that the      requirements of the Commission with respect to the      application of State and local ordinances to the placement,      construction and modification of wireless facilities (for      example WT Docket No. 97-192, ET Docket No. 93-62, RM-8577,      and FCC 97-303, 62 FR 47960) be modified so as--       (A) to permit State and local governments to exercise their      zoning and other land use authorities to regulate the      placement, construction, and modification of such facilities;      and       (B) to place the burden of proof in civil actions, and in      actions before the Commission and State and local authorities      relating to the placement, construction, and modification of      such facilities, on the person that seeks to place,      construct, or modify such facilities.       (7) PCS-Over-Cable, PCS-Over-Fiber Optic, and satellite      telecommunications systems, including Low-Earth Orbit      satellites, offer a significant opportunity to provide so-     called ``911'' emergency telephone service throughout much of      the United States without unduly intruding into or effecting      the environment, public health and safety, and the general      welfare of the community and the public.       (8) The Federal Aviation Administration must rely upon      State and local governments to regulate the placement,      construction, and modification of telecommunications      facilities near airports or high-volume air traffic areas      such as corridors of airspace or commonly used flyways. The      proposed rules of the Commission to preempt State and local      zoning and other land-use regulations for the siting of such      facilities will have a serious negative impact on aviation      safety, airport capacity and investment, the efficient use of      navigable airspace, public health and safety, and the general      welfare of the community and the public.       (9) The telecommunications industry and its experts should      be expected to have access to the best and most recent      technical information and should therefore be held to the      highest standards in terms of their representations,      assertions, and promises to governmental authorities.       (b) Purposes.--The purposes of this Act are as follows:       (1) To repeal certain limitations on State and local      authority regarding the placement, construction, and      modification of personal wireless services facilities under      section 332(c)(7) of the Communications Act of 1934 (47      U.S.C. 332(c)(7)).       (2) To permit State and local governments--       (A) to regulate the placement, construction, or      modification of personal wireless services facilities with      respect to their impacts on land use, including radio      frequency interference and radio frequency radiation, in      order to protect the environment, public health and safety,      and the general welfare of the community and the public;       (B) to regulate the placement, construction, and      modification of personal wireless services facilities so that      they will not interfere with the safe and efficient use of      public airspace or otherwise compromise or endanger the      public health and safety and the general welfare of the      community and the public; and       (C) to hold accountable applicants for permits for the      placement, construction, or modification of personal wireless      services facilities, and providers of services using such      facilities, for the truthfulness and accuracy of      representations and statements placed in the record of      hearings for permits, licenses, or approvals for such      facilities.     SEC. 3. STATE AND LOCAL AUTHORITY OVER PLACEMENT,                    CONSTRUCTION, AND MODIFICATION OF PERSONAL                    WIRELESS SERVICES FACILITIES.       (a) Limitations on State and Local Regulation of      Facilities.--Subparagraph (B) of section 332(c)(7) of the      Communications Act of 1934 (47 U.S.C. 332(c)(7)) is amended--       (1) by striking clause (iv);       (2) by redesignating clause (v) as clause (iv); and       (3) in clause (iv), as so redesignated--       (A) in the first sentence, by striking ``may, within 30      days'' and all that follows through the end of the sentence      and inserting ``may commence an action in any court of      competent jurisdiction. Such action shall be commenced within      30 days after such action or failure to act unless the State      concerned has established a different period for the      commencement of such action.''; and       (B) by striking the third sentence and inserting the      following: ``In any such action in which a person seeking to      place, construct, or modify a personal wireless services      facility is a party, such person shall bear the burden of      proof, regardless of who commences such action.''.       (b) Prohibition on Adoption of Rule Regarding Relief From      State and Local Regulation of Facilities.--Notwithstanding      any other provision of law, the Federal Communications      Commission shall not adopt as a final rule or otherwise      directly or indirectly implement any portion of the proposed      rule set forth in ``Procedures for Reviewing Requests for      Relief From State and Local Regulation Pursuant to Section      332(c)(7)(B)(v) of the Communications Act of 1934'', WT      Docket No. 97-192, released August 25, 1997.       (c) Authority Over Placement, Construction, and      Modification of Facilities.--Such section 332(c)(7) is      further amended--       (1) by redesignating subparagraph (C) as subparagraph (D);      and       (2) by inserting after subparagraph (B) the following new      subparagraph (C):       ``(C) Additional limitations.--       ``(i) Authority to require least intrusive facilities.--       ``(I) In general.--A State or local government may deny an      application to place, construct, or modify personal wireless      services facilities on the basis that alternative      technologies, delivery systems, or structures are capable of      delivering a personal wireless services signal comparable to      that proposed to be delivered by such facilities in a manner      that is less intrusive to the community concerned than such      facilities.       ``(II) Considerations.--In determining under subclause (I)      the intrusiveness of technologies, delivery systems, or      structures for personal wireless services facilities, a State      or local government may consider the aesthetics of such      technologies, systems, or structures, the environmental      impact of such technologies, systems, or structures, and the      radio frequency interference or radiation emitted by such      technologies, systems, or structures.       ``(III) Burden of proof.--In any hearing for purposes of      the exercise of the authority     in subclause (I), the burden shall be on the applicant.       ``(ii) Radio interference.--A State or local government may      regulate the location, height, or modification of personal      wireless services facilities in order to address the effects      of radio frequency interference caused by such facilities on      local communities and the public.       ``(iii) Authority to require studies and documentation.--No      provision of this Act may be interpreted to prohibit a State      or local government from--       ``(I) requiring a person seeking authority to place,      construct, or modify personal wireless services facilities to      produce--       ``(aa) environmental, biological, and health studies,      engineering reports, or other documentation of the compliance      of such facilities with radio frequency exposure limits,      radio frequency interference impacts, and compliance with      applicable laws, rules, and regulations governing the effects      of such facilities on the environment, public health and      safety, and the general welfare of the community and the      public; and       ``(bb) documentation of the compliance of such facilities      with applicable Federal, State, and local aviation safety      standards or aviation obstruction standards regarding objects      effecting navigable airspace; or       ``(II) refusing to grant authority to such person to place,      construct, or modify such facilities within the jurisdiction      of such government if such person fails to produce studies,      reports, or documentation required under subclause (I).       ``(iv) Construction.--Nothing in this subparagraph may be      construed to prohibit or otherwise limit the authority of a      State or local government to ensure compliance with or      otherwise enforce any statements, assertions, or      representations filed or submitted by or on behalf of an      applicant with the State or local government for authority to      place, construct, or modify personal wireless services      facilities within the jurisdiction of the State or local      government.''.                                 ______                                       By
