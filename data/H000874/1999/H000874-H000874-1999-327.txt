Speaker, let's lift FEC reform out of legislative limbo where it has been for twenty years. Before we leave for the year let's pass H.R. 2668, a bill to streamline FEC procedures and improve FEC reporting.  The bill is not controversial--it has broad support on both sides of the aisle and it is needed. There is simply no reason not to pass this bill today.  In September I wrote to Speaker Hastert requesting that this bill be placed on the suspension calendar. It is a good bill--sponsored by House Administration Chair Bill Thomas--and voted unanimously out of the House Administration Committee earlier this year.  The bill contains most of the provisions in the bill introduced earlier this year. It was prepared with the support and assistance of the six Republican and Democratic FEC Commissioners. In addition to the support of the Commission, H.R. 2668 is supported by Members on both sides of the aisle.  It would: Improve disclosure of State activity; make it easier for contributors to comply with the law; remove obsolete provisions; and broaden candidate's commercial lending options.  Earlier this year, we voted on this bill on the floor of the House. Like almost every one of my Democratic colleagues and a broad group of Republicans, I voted against the bill. I voted against FEC reform because it would have blocked a vote on the bi-partisan campaign finance reform bill sponsored by Reps. Shays and Meehan. FEC reform deserves our support on its own merits. It should not continue to be used as a pawn in the larger debate.  In my opinion, FEC reform should not have been a part of that debate. That is because--as Chairman Thomas has repeatedly stressed, H.R. 2668 is not about campaign finance reform--H.R. 2668 is about making the routine procedural reforms that are needed over the course of time by all agencies.  Unlike other Executive branch agencies that request and receive noncontroversial legislative changes to aid in the efficient and effective operation of the agency--changes requested by the FEC simply don't happen.  For over twenty years, the FEC has annually sent to Congress requested statutory changes. And each year--just like in our recent campaign finance debate--provisions that are needed and have no real opposition become tangled up in our debate about how to ensure the integrity of our campaign finance system.  But this year we can do it differently. We have a solid FEC reform bill that combines needed changes into one package. We have bipartisan support for the bill.  If we fail to act it means that the work that we did in the House Administration Committee to create this worthwhile bill was just a cynical game to defeat comprehensive campaign finance reform. I have asked Speaker Hastert to bring H.R. 2668 to the floor on the suspension calendar--and I urge him to do so again today. FEC reform standing alone is worthwhile. We have the chance to pass it and we should.                          ____________________
