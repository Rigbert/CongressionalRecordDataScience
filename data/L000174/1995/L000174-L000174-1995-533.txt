President, there is an important question hanging over us like Damocles' sword today. It will loom over us as we consider the budget. It will confront us directly as we debate the reorganization of our foreign affairs agencies. The question is ``Is America going to lead?''  This is not a question that keeps people awake at night anymore. After all, [[Page S6710]] people ask, ``We won the cold war, didn't we? There is no longer any real threat to America's security, is there?''  Mr. President, there have been few times in history when the United States can less afford to be complacent. The world today is anything but a predictable, peaceful place. While we are fortunate that the military threat to our security has receded, it is more true today than ever that American prosperity is linked to conditions in the rest of the world.  Millions of American jobs depend upon persuading other countries to open their borders to U.S. exports, and helping them raise their incomes so they can afford to buy our exports. Ensuring that we have clean air and clean water depends upon international action to protect the environment. Keeping Americans healthy depends on joint action to fight the spread of infectious diseases in other countries. Imagine if we are unable to contain the recent outbreak of a deadly virus in Zaire--very quickly you would see Senators clamoring for more aid to stop it from reaching our shores.  Stemming the flow of illegal immigrants and refugees to the United States depends on promoting democracy and economic development in the countries from which the refugees are fleeing. These are just a few examples of why we continue to have an enormous stake in what happens in the rest of the world.  Fortunately, the United States, the only remaining superpower with the largest economy and the most powerful military, can influence what happens in the rest of the world.  But influence is not automatic. It requires effort, and it costs money.  Perhaps most important, the United States needs to maintain its leadership in and its financial contributions to the international organizations that make critical contributions to promoting peace, trade, and economic development. Organizations like the United Nations, the World Trade Organization, the International Monetary Fund and the World Bank, to name a few. These organizations are the glue that holds our international system together. They may not always act in precisely the way we would like, but they are dedicated to spreading the values that Americans hold dear--freedom, democracy, free enterprise, and competition.  The American people also want to help alleviate the suffering of people facing starvation or other calamities, like refugees fleeing genocide in Rwanda, or the hundreds of thousands of victims of landmines--the people who are injured and killed every 15 minutes around the clock, around the world, from the 80 to 100 million antipersonnel landmines spread in 60 to 65 countries.  Finally Mr. President, the polls show that most Americans believe we should help developing countries and countries making the transition from communism to democracy and market economics. It is through this aid that we fight poverty, that we stabilize population growth, that we educate people who have never known anything except tyranny in the basics of representative government, and that we encourage countries to open their economics to trade and competition.  We do these things, not out of a sense of altruism, but because it is in our national interest. Yet, in the rush to reduce Federal spending, some are dismissing spending on international affairs as a luxury we cannot afford, or even a waste.  The United States cannot pay these costs alone, but no one is asking us to. The United States now ranks 21st among donors in the percentage of national income that it devotes to development assistance. Twenty-first. Right behind Ireland. We are not even the largest donor in terms of dollar amount anymore. Japan, which has a keen sense of what is in its national interest, has passed us. They passed the United States in this area. Do you think Japan is doing this out of a sense of altruism? Ha. They do it because they know it creates jobs and it helps their economy.  Six years ago, when I became chairman of the Foreign Operation Subcommittee, the foreign operations budget was $14.6 billion. We cut that budget by 6.5 percent, not even taking into account inflation, while the remainder of the discretionary spending in the Federal budget increased by 4.8 percent. Those cuts were a calculated response to the end of the cold war. Foreign aid today is substantially less than it was during the Reagan and Bush administrations. Our entire foreign aid program, including funding for the Eximbank and foreign military financing and other activities that have as much to do with promoting U.S. exports as with helping other countries, today accounts for less than 1 percent of the total Federal budget.  We must recognize that there is a limit to how far we can cut our budget for international affairs, and still maintain our leadership position in the world. Just when many people though U.S. influence was reaching new heights, we are seeing the ability of the United States to influence world events eroding.  This budget proposal amounts to a classic example of penny-wise and pound-foolish. Our allies are scratching their heads, wondering why the United States, with the opportunity to exercise influence in the world more cheaply than ever before, is turning its back and walking away.  We are inviting whoever else wants to--friend or foe--to step into the vacuum and pursue their interests at our expense.  Mr. President, the United States stands as a beacon of liberty and hope for people throughout the world. But we should be more than a beacon. A beacon is passive. We should be proactive, reaching out to defend our interests and to help our less fortunate neighbors. We should continue to invest in the world. We should continue to lead.  If there is going to be a leader for democracy, if there is going to be a leader for economic development, if there is going to be a leader for human rights, if there is going to be a leader setting the goal, as an American I prefer that it be our country. And as a U.S. Senator I know of no country better suited to do that.  Mr. President, I want to say a few words about Republican proposals to reform the U.S. foreign affairs agencies. Senator Helms, the distinguished chairman of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, has launched a broad proposal to reform foreign policymaking in the Federal Government. This proposal includes provisions for completely restructuring the way we administer our foreign aid programs. Senator Helms asserts that U.S. foreign policymaking has become so decentralized that it no longer serves the national interest. He proposes to merge most foreign affairs functions into the Department of State.  As the former chairman and now ranking Democrat on the Foreign Operations Subcommittee, I have had some opportunity to be involved in the U.S. Government's conduct of foreign policy, and I have some thoughts about Senator Helms' proposal.  While I have long advocated better coordination among the executive branch agencies in foreign policymaking, I believe Senator Helms' proposal would result in U.S. national interests being less well, not better, served.  Why is the Foreign Agricultural Service administered by the Department of Agriculture and not by the State Department? Because farmers know they can count on USDA to represent their interests better than the Department of State and all experiences have proven that.  Why, 15 years ago, did we take the commercial function away from the State Department and create a Foreign Commercial Service in the Department of Commerce? It was because State had for years neglected export promotion, sacrificed export interests to its foreign policy priorities, and treated its commercial officers as second-class employees. It was because the American business community was clamoring for something better, knowing that if we could increase our exports we would increase jobs here in the United States.  The reason we have separate foreign service bureaucracies is that many of our foreign policy interests are actually domestic policy interests that are best pursued abroad by technical experts from domestic policy agencies, not be foreign policy generalists from the State Department. I do not know about farmers from other States, but I can tell you that Vermont farmers are not at all anxious to see the State Department expand its influence over [[Page S6711]] U.S. foreign agricultural policy. They fear that shifting power from domestic agencies to the State Department will not strengthen representation of United States interests in United States policy but rather will strengthen representation of French interests and Argentine interests and Russian interests.  Let me focus on the specific question of restructuring America's foreign assistance program. I have been advocating reform of our foreign aid program ever since the fall of the Berlin Wall, so I welcome this opportunity for discussion of this issue.  Senator Helms says that our foreign aid program should further our national interests. I absolutely agree. I do not know of anyone who disagrees.  But I do not agree with his definition of the problem. The problem is not that the Agency for International Development is ignoring America's national interests. The problem is that since 1961 when the Foreign Assistance Act was enacted, much of our foreign aid was allocated to winning allies in the fight against communism.  All you had to do was say, ``I am anti-Communist, pro-American,'' no matter what kind of a dictator you were, money flowed to you.  Billions went to right-wing dictatorships with little or not commitment to democracy or improving the living conditions of their people, or even allowing business competition. Much of that aid failed by the standards we apply today. But it is unfair and disingenuous to judge AID's effectiveness today against the failures of the past when our goals were fundamentally different.  AID needs a new legislative mandate. We meet to get rid of cold war priorities and replace them with priorities for the 21st century.  The Secretary of State has full authority under statute to give policy direction to AID, and the State Department influences AID's activities every day. If AID's projects deviate from State Department policy, it is not because AID is out of control, it is because the people at State are not paying enough attention to what AID is proposing to do.  Senator Helms also does not give sufficient credit to the Clinton administration for its efforts to improve AID performance. Over the past 2 years, we have seen dramatic progress at the Agency for International Development and the Treasury and State Departments in redefining our foreign aid priorities and focusing resources where they can achieve the most in advancing U.S. interests abroad, in spite of the constraints of an obsolete Foreign Assistance Act.  AID Administrator Brian Atwood has made   extensive changes at AID. He initiated an agency-wide streamlining effort that has resulted in the closure of 27 missions and a reduction of 1,200 staff. He is installing state-of-the-art data processing systems that link headquarters in Washington with project officers in the field in real time. This will ensure that information available at one end of the management pipeline is also available at the other, increasing efficiency and improving decisionmaking.  Mr. Atwood has decentralized decisionmaking so the people closest to problems have a full opportunity to design solutions. AID is improving its performance because, for the first time since the mid-1980's, it has hands-on leadership that is committed to making our foreign aid programs effective.  Can AID improve its management performance further? Yes. But would the State Department do better? I doubt it. I believe that abolishing AID and asking regional assistant secretaries at the State Department to manage its functions would be a serious mistake. These assistant secretaries are chosen for their expertise in broad foreign policy. Many do not have experience managing money and programs. And they are overworked now trying to deal with the daily emergencies and complexities of our political relationships with countries in their regions.  Even former Secretary of State Lawrence Eagleburger, a Republican whom I respect and whose counsel I have sought, expressed doubt about this proposal in his testimony before the Foreign Relations Committee on March 23. ``The State Department is not well suited, either by historical experience or current bureaucratic culture, to assume many of these new responsibilities,'' Secretary Eagleburger said. And he was trying to be supportive of the Helms proposal.  I would put the matter a little less delicately: The State Department's specialty is making policy; it has never and probably never will manage programs well. Secretary Eagleburger offered the hope that, with every careful selection of Under Secretaries, it might do better. I am reluctant to trade a bureaucracy that is doing reasonably well and getting better at delivering foreign aid for one that has no competence on the outside chance that it might get better. If we disperse responsibility for foreign aid among assistant secretaries of State, I bet that we will start hearing more stories about misguided and failed projects, not fewer, and more questions about why we have foreign aid, not fewer.  AID today is performing a wide array of tasks that enjoy overwhelming support among the American people:  Every year, AID manages programs worth a billion dollars aimed at protecting the Earth's environment. Does protecting the Earth's forests, oceans, and atmosphere matter to us? Does it further our foreign policy interests? A century from now we are not going to have any foreign policy if we do not join with other countries today to protect the environment.  Every year, AID manages hundreds of millions of dollars in international health programs. Is this money wasted? We might as well ask whether AIDS and tuberculosis are infectious.  Every year, AID commits a large part of its budget to promoting free markets and democratic development in countries where the United States has important interests. This is not diplomacy. It is hands-on assistance that requires people with special expertise on the ground who can get the job done. Working with foreign governments and private organizations on the nuts and bolts of solving real problems. That is what AID does.  Mr. President, we have a strong need to rewrite the Foreign Assistance Act to redefine the framework for foreign aid. AID can continue to downsize and improve its efficiency. But we should not abolish an agency that is aggressively adapting itself to the changed world we live in and to the shrinking foreign aid budget.  Let me close with this, a personal observation.  I have served here during the administrations of President Ford, President Reagan, President Bush, and President Clinton. Each one of those, each President, Republican and Democrat alike, has come to Members of the Congress, Republican and Democrat alike, and sought bipartisan support on foreign policy. We follow the dictates of Senator Vandenberg that politics end at the water's edge.  We have had some major debates on this floor, and we have had major debates in the Cabinet room of the White House. But we have come together. We have observed a number of things, not the least of which is that the President of the United States is our chief foreign policy spokesperson.  Throughout all of my years in the Senate, it has been an unwritten rule that, when the President of the United States is abroad, when he is making foreign policy or conducting foreign policy, he receives support at home. If we disagree with him, we wait until he gets home and we tell him so. I am concerned, when the President of the United States recently went abroad for meetings in Russia and Ukraine, that many would not wait until he came back but had to take to the floors of the House and the Senate to criticize what he was doing. I think that is wrong. We never did that with President Bush. We never did that with President Reagan. We never did that with President Carter. We never did that with President Ford. And we never did that before I was here, to my knowledge, with other Presidents. It is wrong. It gives the wrong signal. It does not mean that we passively agree with everything and anything that any President says. Of course not. We wait until he at least gets back to the country to tell him so. We do not undermine him or say things here in this country that almost guarantees that he cannot be successful in the other country.  Frankly, Mr. President, the President of the United States and the [[Page S6712]] President of Russia ought to meet on a regular basis every year concerning the nuclear warheads of both sides. We should not set as a standard that the only time they can meet is if they come back with some enormous agreement. As a practical matter, that guarantees failure. They have to meet with or without agreement because there is too much at stake, and we ought to take the lessons of those Congresses in the past to at least let the President come home before we tell him we disagree with him. Let us not have foreign leaders when he is meeting with them see a cacophony of criticism coming, often from those who are not really fully informed of what is going on.  Mr. President, I thank my distinguished colleagues for allowing me to have this time.  I yield the floor.                            ____________________
