 President, I would say to my friend, the majority leader, we are prepared to vote right now.  A number of Members are prepared to have a vote immediately. I think we all understand what we are voting on. I am not sure many of our Members think any further debate about the whole issue of whether to go to the Defense bill at this particular time would be enlightened by any additional debate.  We have a number of Members who have plans who know how to vote and would be happy to vote.
