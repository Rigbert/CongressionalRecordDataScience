Speaker, last week, the Senate acted forcefully by passing legislation to renew emergency unemployment insurance. I would encourage this House to follow that example so we may provide a vital lifeline to over 2 million Americans to provide for their families. These are hardworking Americans who are out there every day looking for employment or receiving education to be better prepared to reenter the workforce.  In Ohio, 75,200 unemployed workers need these extended benefits they earned. As our economy continues recovering from the greatest recession in modern history, let us give them what they earned.  We must avoid making this a partisan issue. Workers in both Democratic and Republican districts desperately need this critical lifeline. The House must act today. Let the Speaker bring the Senate bill up for a vote here so the House can finally pass legislation.  Let us do what is sensible and allow these Americans to keep our economic recovery going by not falling into the ranks of poverty themselves. These hardworking Americans have earned their benefits.                [From The New York Times, Aug. 30, 2012]            Majority of New Jobs Pay Low Wages, Study Finds                         (By Catherine Rampell)       While a majority of jobs lost during the downturn were in      the middle range of wages, a majority of those added during      the recovery have been low paying, according to a new report      from the National Employment Law Project.       The disappearance of midwage, midskill jobs is part of a      longer-term trend that some refer to as a hollowing out of      the work force, though it has probably been accelerated by      government layoffs.       ``The overarching message here is we don't just have a jobs      deficit; we have a `good jobs' deficit,'' said Annette      Bernhardt, the report's author and a policy co-director at      the National Employment Law Project, a liberal research and      advocacy group.       The report looked at 366 occupations tracked by the Labor      Department and clumped them into three equal groups by wage,      with each representing a third of American employment in      2008. The middle third--occupations in fields like      construction, manufacturing and information, with median      hourly wages of $13.84 to $21.13--accounted for 60 percent of      job losses from the beginning of 2008 to early 2010.       The job market has turned around since then, but those      fields have represented only 22 percent of total job growth.      Higher-wage occupations--those with a median wage of $21.14      to $54.55--represented 19 percent of job losses when      employment was falling, and 20 percent of job gains when      employment began growing again.       Lower-wage occupations, with median hourly wages of $7.69      to $13.83, accounted for 21 percent of job losses during the      retraction. Since employment started expanding, they have      accounted for 58 percent of all job growth.       The occupations with the fastest growth were retail sales      (at a median wage of $10.97 an hour) and food preparation      workers ($9.04 an hour). Each category has grown by more than      300,000 workers since June 2009.       Some of these new, lower-paying jobs are being taken by      people just entering the labor force, like recent high school      and college graduates. Many, though, are being filled by      older workers who lost more lucrative jobs in the recession      and were forced to take something to scrape by.       ``I think I've been very resilient and resistant and      optimistic, up until very recently,'' said Ellen Pinney, 56,      who was dismissed from a $75,000-a-year job in which she      managed procurement and supply for an electronics company in      March 2008.       Since then, she has cobbled together a series of temporary      jobs in retail and home health care and worked as a part-time      receptionist for a beauty salon. She is now working as an      unpaid intern for a construction company, putting together      bids and business plans for green energy projects, and has      moved in with her 86-year-old father in Forked River, N.J.       ``I really can't bear it anymore,'' she said, noting that      her applications to places like PetSmart and Target had gone      unanswered. ``From every standpoint--my independence, my      sense of purposefulness, my self-esteem, my life planning--     this is just not what I was planning.''       As Ms. Pinney's experience shows, low-wage jobs have not      been growing especially quickly in this recovery; they      account for such a big share of job growth mostly because      midwage job growth has been so slow.       Over the last few decades, the number of midwage, midskill      jobs has stagnated or declined as employers chose to automate      routine tasks or to move them offshore.       Job growth has been concentrated in positions that tend to      fall into two categories: manual work that must be done in      person, like styling hair or serving food, which usually pays      relatively little; and more creative, design-oriented work      like engineering or surgery, which often pays quite well.       Since 2001, employment has grown 8.7 percent in lower-wage      occupations and 6.6 percent in high-wage ones. Over that      period, midwage occupation employment has fallen by 7.3      percent.       This ``polarization'' of skills and wages has been      documented meticulously by David H. Autor, an economics      professor at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology. A      recent study found that this polarization accelerated in the      last three recessions, particularly the last one, as      financial pressures forced companies to reorganize more      quickly.       ``This is not just a nice, smooth process,'' said Henry E.      Siu, an economics professor at the University of British      Columbia, who helped write the recent study about      polarization and the business cycle. ``A lot of these jobs      were suddenly wiped out during recession and are not coming      back.''       On top of private sector revamps, state and local      governments have been shedding workers in recent years. Those      jobs lost in the public sector have been primarily in mid and     higher-wage positions, according to Ms. Bernhardt's analysis.       ``Whenever you look at data like these, there is this      tendency to get overwhelmed, that there are these inevitable,      big macro forces causing this polarization and we can't do      anything about them. In fact, we can,'' Ms. Bernhardt said.      She called for more funds for states to stem losses in the      public sector and federal infrastructure projects to employ      idled construction workers. Both proposals have faced      resistance from Republicans in Congress.                          ____________________
