Mr. Chairman, I yield myself such time as I may consume.  Mr. Chairman, I do thank the gentleman from California for making my case. This is an agency that is off track. This is an agency, as I have said before, and I am not pointing fingers at any individual, that went from 2 percent to 14 percent. They spent money inappropriately. What we have to do is to gain the faith back from the sportsmen.  This is different than all the instances that the gentleman talked about the GAO investigating, the planes, et cetera. This is different. Every sportsman from 1937 took their money voluntarily and contributed 11 percent of the cost of that product to go into a fund to be redistributed back to the States to keep up the projects for fishing and hunting and other activities on our lands. That is what it was for. They did that voluntarily.  What we found out as this investigation went forward, we were finding out disgruntled sportsmen deciding that maybe they ought not to pay the tax, maybe we ought not to go forward with the program.  What I am trying to do with this legislation is to make sure there will be no money spent on things that were spent in the past such as travel, such as alcohol, such as things that the Congress would not appropriate money for, reestablishing the strength and trust of this trust fund.  In turn, as I have said before, if we adopt my amendment, they are at the same level that they said and required from me, $19 million to manage the program. We will lose, after 1 year, ten employees because they are bloated right now. The second year we will lose 10 more. That is 20 total. Then it is based upon the cost index, and they can get more if there is more need, or in fact if there is not a need they will get less. We are not gutting this program. In fact, we are encouraging the program.  The sportsmen I have heard from support what we are trying to do under this legislation. I urge my colleagues to support the legislation.  Mr. Chairman. I include the following exchange of letters for the Record.                                      Committee on Ways and Means,                                     House of Representatives,                                    Washington, DC, April 3, 2000.     Hon. Don Young,     Chairman, Committee on Resources,     Washington, DC.       Dear Chairman Young: I understand that on Thursday, March      30, 2000, the Committee on Resources reported H.R. 3671, the      ``Wildlife and Sport Fish Restoration Programs Improvement      Act of 2000.'' As approved, the bill amends the Wildlife      Restoration Act and Sport Fish Restoration Act programs and      makes several changes relating to the expenditures of funds      arising from dedicated excise taxes on recreational sporting      and fishing equipment and supplies, generally.       As you know, each trust Fund in the Trust Fund Code      includes specific provisions within the jurisdiction of the      Committee on Ways and Means which limit purposes for which      trust fund monies may be spent. Statutorily, the Committee on      Ways and Means generally has limited expenditures by cross-     referencing provisions of authorizing legislation. Currently,      with respect to the Aquatic Resources Trust Fund (the      ``Aquatic Fund''), the Trust Fund Code provisions approve all      expenditures out of the Aquatic Fund permitted under      authorization Acts, but only as those Acts were in effect on      the date of enactment of the Transportation Equity Act for      the 21st Century. Further, if unauthorized expenditures are      made, no further tax revenues will be deposited to the Trust      Fund. Thus, an Act not referenced in the Trust Fund Code must      be approved by the Committee on Ways and Means before the      authorizations are funded.       I now understand that you are seeking to have the bill      considered by the House as early as this week. In addition, I      have been informed that your Committee will seek an amendment      incorporating language which I am supplying (attached) to      make the necessary Trust Fund Code amendments to allow the      proposed expenditures to occur.       Based upon this understanding, and in order to expedite      consideration of H.R. 3671, it will not be necessary for the      Committee on Ways and Means to markup this legislation. This      is being done with the further understanding that the      Committee will be treated without prejudice as to its      jurisdictional prerogatives on such or similar provisions in      the future, and it should not be considered as precedent for      consideration of matters of jurisdictional interest to the      Committee on Ways and Means in the future.       Finally, I would appreciate your response to this letter,      confirming this understanding with respect to H.R. 3671, and      would ask that a copy of our exchange of letters on this      matter be placed in the Record during consideration of the      bill on the Floor. Thank you for your cooperation and      assistance on this matter.           With best personal regards,                                                      Bill Archer,                                                         Chairman.       Attachment.   Amendment to H.R. 3671, as Reported Offered By Mr. Young of Alaska       Page 28, after line 24, insert the following:     SEC.   . CONFORMING AMENDMENT.       Section 9504(b)(2)(A) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986      is amended by striking ``(as in effect on the date of the      enactment of the TEA 21 Restoration Act)'' and inserting      ``(as in effect on the date of the enactment of the Wildlife      and Sport Fish Restoration Programs Improvement Act of      2000)''.                                  ____                                         House of Representatives,                                       Committee on Resources,                                    Washington, DC, April 3, 2000.     Hon. Bill Archer,     Chairman, Committee on Ways and Means,     Washington, DC.       Dear Mr. Chairman: Thank you very much for your letter      regarding an amendment to H.R. 3671, the Wildlife and      Sportfish Restoration Programs Improvement Act of 2000. I      appreciate your cooperation in providing a cross-reference in      the Internal Revenue Code to allow our amendments to the      Dingell-Johnson Sport Fish Restoration Act in H.R. 3671 to be      executed and fully funded through the Aquatic Resources Trust      Fund.       As you noted in your letter, I propose that this change be      accomplished through a manager's amendment to H.R. 3671,      which will be made in order by a rule for consideration of      the bill. I concur that your acquiescence to this amendment      not be considered prejudicial to your jurisdiction over this      or any similar measure in the future, nor would it be      considered as precedent for any future changes in trust fund      accounts.       Thank you again for your timely assistance in moving H.R.      3671 to the Floor. Enactment of H.R. 3671 will ensure that      the taxes paid by sportsmen and women will be used      appropriately for fish and wildlife conservation projects      with minimal administrative expenditures.           Sincerely,                                                        Don Young,                                                         Chairman.
