 President, today I am reintroducing a private relief bill on behalf of Jorge Rojas Gutierrez, his wife, Oliva Gonzalez Gonzalez, and their son, Jorge Rojas Gonzalez. The Rojas family, originally from Mexico, is living in the San Jose area of California.  The story of the Rojas family is compelling, and I believe they merit Congress' special consideration for such an extraordinary form of relief as a private bill.  Jorge and his wife, Oliva, originally came to the United States in 1990 when their son Jorge Rojas, Jr. was just 2 years old. In 1995, they left the country to attend a funeral, and then re-entered the United States on visitor's visas.  The family has since expanded to include two sons, Alexis Rojas, now 18 years old, Matias, now a year old, a daughter Tania Rojas, now age 16, and a granddaughter, Mina Rojas, who is less than a year old.  The Rojas family first attempted to legalize their status in the UnitedStates when an unscrupulous immigration consultant, who was not an attorney, advised them to apply for asylum. Unfortunately, without proper legal guidance, this family did not realize at the time that they lacked a valid basis for asylum. The asylum claim was denied in 2008, leaving the Rojas family with no further options to legalize their status.  Since their arrival in the United States more than 20 years ago, the Rojas family has demonstrated a robust work ethic and a strong commitment to their community in California. They have paid their taxes and worked hard to contribute to this country.  Jorge is a hard-working individual who has been employed by Valley Crest Landscape Maintenance in San Jose, California, for the past 16 years. Currently, he works on commercial landscaping projects. Jorge is well-respected by his supervisor and his peers.  In addition to supporting his family, Jorge has volunteered his time to provide modern green landscaping and building projects at his children's school in California. He is active in his neighborhood association, working with his neighbors to open a library and community center in their community.  Oliva, in addition to raising her three children, has also been very active in the local community. She works to help other immigrants assimilate to American life by acting as a translator and a tutor for immigrant children in local schools and after school programs in Northern California.  Before her youngest son was born, Oliva volunteered with the People Acting in Community Together, PACT, organization, where she worked to prevent crime, gangs and drug dealing in San Jose neighborhoods and schools.  Both Jorge and Oliva are active volunteers with the Second Harvest Food Bank, assisting in distributing food to the needy at a community center.  Perhaps one of the most compelling reasons for permitting the Rojas family to remain in the United States is the impact that their deportation would have on their three children. Two of the Rojas children, Alexis and Tania, are American citizens. Jorge Rojas, Jr. has lived in the United States since he was a toddler.  For Alexis, Tania, and Jorge, this country is the only country they really know.  Jorge Rojas, Jr., who entered the United States as an infant with his parents, recently became a father. He is now 22 years old and working at a job that allows him to support his daughter, Mina. Jorge graduated from Del Mar High School in 2007 and is taking classes at San Jose City College.  Alexis, age 18, graduated from Del Mar High School and is now a student at West Valley College in Saratoga, California. He is interested in studying linguistics. Tania, age 16, still attends Del Mar High School and plans to graduate next year. Their teachers describe them as ``fantastic, wonderful and gifted'' students.  It seems so clear to me that this family has embraced the American dream and their continued presence in our country would do so much to enhance the values we hold dear.  When I first introduced this bill, I received dozens of letters from the community in Northern California in support of this family. Enactment of the legislation I have reintroduced today will enable the Rojas family to continue to make significant contributions to their community as well as the United States.  I ask my colleagues to support this private bill.  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be printed in the Record.  There being no objection, the text of the bill was ordered to be printed in the Record, as follows:                                 S. 445       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of      the United States of America in Congress assembled,     SECTION 1. PERMANENT RESIDENT STATUS FOR JORGE ROJAS                    GUTIERREZ, OLIVA GONZALEZ GONZALEZ, AND JORGE                    ROJAS GONZALEZ.
