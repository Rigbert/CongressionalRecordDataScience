 As all of the Members of this House know, Mr. Cantor's predecessor, Mr. Blunt, and I are very good friends and worked closely together. We often disagree on policy, but we have had a long-term ability to work together closely on behalf of the institution, on behalf of the House. The relationship I think was one that was to the benefit of the House of Representatives and to our Members.  I want to thank Mr. Cantor for visiting with me and talking about how we go forward working together on behalf of the American people and on behalf of this institution. We know that we'll disagree, perhaps more times than not, on major issues, but we also know that the objective that he has and the objective I have and the Members of this House on both sides of the aisle have is a stronger country, with greater opportunity for our people.                              {time}  1345  I want to congratulate him on his selection as the Republican whip and reiterate his comment that I look forward to working with him in a constructive and positive way.  Madam Speaker, on Monday the House is not in session. On Tuesday the House will meet at 12:30 p.m. for morning hour and 2 p.m. for legislative business, with votes postponed until 6:30 p.m. On Wednesday and Thursday the House will meet at 10 a.m. for legislative business. On Friday, no votes are expected.  We will consider several bills under suspension of the rules. The complete list of suspensions, as is the practice, will be announced by the close of business today.  We will also consider a bill to expand the State Children's Health Insurance Program. We will also consider a House resolution requiring committees to hold hearings upon receipt of certain reports from an inspector general or the Comptroller General of the United States. The President-elect has made it very clear he wants to look at programs and ensure that the money is being spent effectively and that the programs the money supports are effective.  In addition, we will consider the TARP Reform and Accountability Act, which we hope will set parameters, accountability, transparency and expectations for help with the mortgages for any legislation that might be submitted either by the Bush administration or the Obama administration as it relates to the second phase, the second $350 billion previously authorized in the Troubled Asset Recovery Program.  I thank the gentleman for yielding.
