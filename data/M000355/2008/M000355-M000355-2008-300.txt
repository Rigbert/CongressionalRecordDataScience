 President, the Republican conference, at noon today, paused for a prayer for our friend and colleague, Ted Kennedy. As the majority leader has indicated, we are, in spite of our political differences, one large family.  Senator Kennedy enjoys great respect and admiration on this side of the aisle. He is, indeed, one of the most important figures to ever serve in this body in our history, and Republican Senators recognize that as well.  On a personal basis, he came down to the University of Louisville, at my request, a couple years ago to speak to students and the general public on the campus. It was a speech of Presidential quality. He knew I had been an intern in the office of Senator John Sherman Cooper, who represented my State in the Senate for almost 20 years and who was a fast friend of his brother, President Kennedy, and of his. He brought down with him to U of L that day a framed picture of his brother with Senator Cooper, carefully inscribed at the bottom with the most appropriate inscription you can imagine. He did not miss a thing.  Our prayers go out to Vicki and to the family.  On behalf of every member of the Republican conference of the Senate, I say to you, Ted, you enjoy our admiration and our respect, and our wishes for a speedy recovery.  I yield the floor.
