 President, I rise today to bring to my colleagues' attention the work of the Ursuline Sisters of Louisville, which will soon receive a special recognition from the Commonwealth of Kentucky for their decades of service.  The Ursuline Sisters began their ministry in Kentucky in 1858 when three Sisters from Germany, led by Mother Salesia Reitmeier, answered a call to teach at St. Martin School in Louisville. Within 2 weeks of their arrival, the Sisters were teaching 50 students and had plans to construct a convent and boarding school on the corner of Chestnut and Shelby streets in Louisville, KY. The building was completed in 1859 and became the home of the Ursuline Academy. The new boarding school for girls offered classes from elementary through high school.  Soon the Ursuline Sisters were asked to operate and staff other schools. They established Sacred Heart Academy in 1877. Within 100 years of their establishment in Kentucky, the Ursuline Sisters had staffed or were staffing 23 parochial schools in the Louisville area, as well as schools in other States. They owned and operated Ursuline College, Ursuline Academy, Sacred Heart Academy, Sacred Heart Model School and the Ursuline Speech Clinic. The original Motherhouse and Convent for the Ursuline Sisters is located near the original school in downtown Louisville that was established by those three German immigrants 152 years ago and is listed in the National Park Service's National Register of Historic Places.  These Sisters serve as educators, spiritual ministers, health care professionals, and administrators. They operate programs for the poor and disenfranchised and continue to search for ways to assist others to grow personally and spiritually.  On July 25, 2010, the Ursuline Sisters' history of ministry and service will be recognized by the Commonwealth of Kentucky with the placement of a historical marker outside that original location on Chestnut Street. This marker will note the founding and mission of the Ursuline Sisters and inform people of the contributions these Sisters have made to the community.  While the true record of their good deeds will continue to be chronicled in a place not of this Earth, it is entirely appropriate for the Commonwealth to take note of the good work the Ursuline Sisters have done for my hometown. And I hope my colleagues will join me in congratulating the Ursuline Sisters for all their hard work of ministering to mind, body and spirit.                          ____________________
