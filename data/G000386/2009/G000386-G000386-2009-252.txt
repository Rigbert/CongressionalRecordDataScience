 President, I would like to point out, as I did in my debate, that we have a much larger False Claims Act bill pending in the Judiciary Committee. I think what the Senator from Arizona brought up is a legitimate subject for discussion, but it ought to be discussed in the wider global issue of the False Claims Act and not in a fraud bill where we are just trying to make some very short changes in the False Claims Act.  I ask my colleagues to vote against the Kyl amendment.
