The vacancy rate in the judiciary is at a 13-year low. It was at a high at the end of President Clinton's term because the Republican majority in the Senate had blocked over 60 of President Clinton's nominees, usually by either threatening filibusters or not even allowing them to have a vote.  In the 17 months that the Democrats were in charge of the Senate, we confirmed 100 of President Bush's nominees, which brought down that rate. In the 17 months the Republicans have been in charge, they have confirmed another 68. So the vacancy rate is at a 13-year low. In fact, I say to my friend from Nevada, President Bush, in less than 3 years, has seen more of his nominees confirmed than President Reagan did in his first 4 years, with a Republican majority in those 4 years, and he was the all-time champ.
