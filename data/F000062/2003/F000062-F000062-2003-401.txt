 President, today I rise to recognize the efforts of the more than 60,000 men, women, and children who will be meeting at the Los Angeles Memorial Coliseum at Exposition Park on Saturday, May 10, 2003, to celebrate the 10th anniversary of the Revlon Run/Walk and to raise funds for women's cancers. The largest 5K event in the Nation, the Revlon Run/Walk, presented by the Entertainment Industry Foundation, EFT, and cochaired by Ellen Barkin, Ronald O. Perelman and Lilly Tartikoff, will raise funds to target research that will contribute to the development of important new therapies, such as Herceptin to treat breast cancer, the first in the wave of new targeted cancer treatments.  To date, the Revlon Run/Walk in Los Angeles and New York has raised more than $27 million since its beginning in Los Angeles a decade ago. The Revlon Run/Walk in Los Angeles will be hosted by Debra Messing and Billy Crystal along with Revlon spokespersons Karen Duffy and Jaime King.  The Los Angeles area beneficiaries for 2003 include: The Revlon/UCLA Women's Cancer Research Program, National Women's Cancer Research Alliance (NWCRA), the Wellness Community, WIN Against Breast Cancer, USC/Norris Comprehensive Cancer Center and Hospital Ovarian & Breast Cancer Program, the UCLA Digital Mammography Program, T.H.E., The Help Everyone, Clinic, Inc., Los Angeles Breast Cancer Alliance, John Wayne Cancer Institute, Breast Cancer Research Program, Women of Color Breast Cancer Survivors Support Program, Team Survivor Los Angeles, Providence Saint Joseph Foundation, Art of Healing--Women's Health, Gilda Radner Ovarian and Breast Cancer Detection Program at Cedars Sinai Medical Center, Asian Pacific Health Care Venture, Inc. (ACPHCV), and weSpark.  Today, 1 in 27 American women will die of breast cancer. According to the American Cancer Society, every 2.5 minutes a woman is diagnosed with breast cancer, every 13 minutes a woman dies of breast cancer, and this year alone 54,100 women will lose their lives to breast and ovarian cancer. For a woman with ovarian cancer today, there is still no method of early detection.  In my home State of California, the American Cancer Society is predicting this year that more than 26,300 women will be diagnosed with breast and other women cancers and more than 5,500 grandmothers, mothers, wives, daughters, sisters, cousins, and friends will die.  The facts serve as a reminder that there is still so much to be done. Mammograms are a proven method of early detection. Unfortunately a large portion of women are not getting screened.  The continuing fight requires many levels of commitment and I want to congratulate all those individuals involved in this worthwhile event as they celebrate both Mother's Day and the 10-year anniversary of the Revlon Run/Walk. The thousands running in LosAngeles represent the millions hoping for an end to cancer. I, too, look forward to a day without cancer.                          ____________________
