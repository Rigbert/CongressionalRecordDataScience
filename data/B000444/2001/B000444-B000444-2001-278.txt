 President, today I am proud to introduce the ``Offender Reentry and Community Safety Act of 2001,'' a bill I first introduced last July. The bill is also a part of S. 16, the Democrat's omnibus crime legislation.  Too often we have short-term solutions for long-term problems. All too often we think about today, but not tomorrow. It's time that we start looking forward. It's time that we face the dire situation of prisoners re-entering our communities with insufficient monitoring, little or no job skills, inadequate drug treatment, insufficient housing and deficient basic life skills.  According to the Department of Justice, 1.25 million offenders are now living in prisons and another 600,000 offenders are incarcerated in local jails. A record number of those inmates--approximately 585,400 will return to communities this year. Historically, two-thirds of returning prisoners have been rearrested for new crimes within three years.  The safety threat posed by this volume of prisoner returns has been exacerbated by the fact that states and communities can't possibly properly supervise all their returning offenders, parole systems have been abolished in thirteen states and policy shifts toward more determinate sentencing have reduced the courts' authority to impose supervisory conditions on offenders returning to their communities.  State systems have also reduced the numbers of transitional support programs aimed at facilitating the return to productive community life styles. Recent studies indicate that many returning prisoners receive no help in finding employment upon release and most offenders have low literacy and other basic educational skills that can impede successful reentry.  At least 55 percent of offenders are fathers of minor children, and therefore face a number of issues related to child support and other family responsibilities during incarceration and after release. Substance abuse and mental health problems also add to concerns over community safety. Approximately 70 percent of state prisoners and 57 percent of federal prisoners have a history of drug use or abuse. Research by the Department of Justice indicates that between 60 and 75 percent of inmates with heroin or cocaine problems return to drugs within three months when untreated. An estimated 187,000 state and federal prison inmates have self-reported mental health problems. Mentally ill inmates are more likely than other offenders to have committed a violent offense and be violent recidivists. Few states connect mental health treatment in prisons with treatment in the return community. Finally, offenders with contagious diseases such as HIV/AIDS and tuberculosis are released with no viable plan to continue their medical treatment so they present a significant danger to public health. And while the federal prison population and reentry system differs from the state prison population and reentry systems, there are nonetheless significant reentry challenges at the federal level.  We need to start thinking about what to do with these people. We need to start thinking in terms of helping these people make a transition to the community so that they don't go back to a life of crime and can be productive members of our society. We need to start thinking about the long-term impact of what we do after we send people to jail.  My legislation creates demonstration reentry programs for federal, state and local prisoners. The programs are designed to assist high-risk, high-need offenders who have served their prison sentences, but who pose the greatest risk of reoffending upon release because they lack the education, job skills, stable family or living arrangements, and the substance abuse treatment and other mental and medical health services they need to successfully reintegrate into society.  Innovative strategies and emerging technologies present new opportunities to improve reentry systems. This legislation creates federal and state demonstration projects that utilize these strategies and technologies. The projects share many core components, including a more seamless reentry system, reentry officials who are more directly involved with the offender and who can swiftly impose intermediate sanctions if the offender does not follow the designated reentry plan, and the combination of enhanced service delivery and enhanced monitoring. The different projects are targeted at different prisoner populations and each has some unique features. The promise of the legislation is to establish the demonstration projects and then to rigorously evaluate them to determinewhich measures and strategies most successfully reintegrate prisoners into the community as well as which measures and strategies can be promoted nationally to address the growing national problem of released prisoners.  There are currently 17 unfunded state pilot projects, including one in Delaware, which are being supported with technical assistance by the Department of Justice. My legislation will fund these pilot projects and will encourages states, territories, and Indian tribes to partner with units of local government and other non-profit organizations to establish adult offender reentry demonstration projects. The grants may be expended for implementing graduated sanctions and incentives, monitoring released prisoners, and providing, as appropriate, drug and alcohol abuse testing and treatment, mental and medical health services, victim impact educational classes, employment training, conflict resolution skills training, and other social services. My legislation also encourages state agencies, municipalities, public agencies, nonprofit organizations and tribes to make agreements with courts to establish ``reentry courts'' to monitor returning offenders, establish graduated sanctions and incentives, test and treat returning offenders for drug and alcohol abuse, and provide reentering offenders with mental and medical health services, victim impact educational classes, employment training, conflict resolution skills training, and other social services.  This legislation also re-authorizes the drug court program created by Congress in the 1994 Crime Law as a cost-effective, innovative way to deal with non-violent offenders in need of drug treatment. This is the same language as the ``Drug Court Re-authorization and Improvement Act'' that I introduced with Senator Specter last Congress.  Rather than just churning people through the revolving door of the criminal justice system, drug courts help these folks to get their acts together so they won't be back. When they graduate from drug court programs they are clean and sober and more prepared to participate in society. In order to graduate, they are required to finish high school or obtain a GED, hold down a job, and keep up with financial obligations including drug court fees and child support payments. They are also required to have a sponsor who will keep them on track.  This program works. And that is not just my opinion. Columbia University's National Center on Addiction and Substance Abuse (CASA) found that these courts are effective at taking offenders with little previous treatment history and keeping them in treatment; that they provide closer supervision than other community programs to which the offenders could be assigned; that they reduce crime; and that they are cost-effective.  According to the Department of Justice, drug courts save at least $5,000 per offender each year in prison costs alone. That says nothing of the cost savings associated with future crime prevention. Just as important, scarce prison beds are freed up for violent criminals.  I have saved what may be the most important statistic for last. Two-thirds of drug court participants are parents of young children. After getting sober through the coerced treatment mandated by the court, many of these individuals are able to be real parents again. More than 500 drug-free babies have been born to female drug court participants, a sizable victory for society and the budget alike.  This bill re-authorizes programs to provide for drug treatment in state and federal prisons. According to CASA, 80 percent of the men and women behind bars in the United States today are there because of alcohol or drugs. They were either drunk or high when they committed their crime, broke an alcohol or drug law, stole to support their habit, or have a history of drug or alcohol abuse. The need for drug and alcohol treatment in our nations prisons and jails is clear.  Providing treatment to criminal offenders is not ``soft.'' It is a smart crime prevention policy. If we do not treat addicted offenders before they are released, they will be turned back onto our streets with the same addiction problem that got them in trouble in the first place and they will re-offend. Inmates who are addicted to drugs and alcohol are more likely to be incarcerated repeatedly than those without a substance abuse problem. This is not my opinion, it is fact. According to CASA, 81 percent of inmates with five or more prior convictions have been habitual drug users compared to 41 percent of first-time offenders. Re-authorizing prison-based treatment programs is a good investment and is an important crime prevention initiative.  This legislation is just a first step--but a necessary one. Someday, we will look back and wonder why we didn't think of this sooner. For now, we need to implement these pilot projects, help people make it in their communities and make our streets safer at the same time. I am certain that in the end we will revel in the results.  I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be printed in the Record.  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the Record, as follows:                                 S. 194       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of      the United States of America in Congress assembled,     SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.       This Act may be cited as the ``Offender Reentry and      Community Safety Act of 2001''.     SEC. 2. FINDINGS.       Congress finds the following:       (1) There are now nearly 1,900,000 individuals in our      country's prisons and jails, including over 140,000      individuals under the jurisdiction of the Federal Bureau of      Prisons.       (2) Enforcement of offender violations of conditions of      releases has sharply increased the number of offenders who      return to prison--while revocations comprised 17 percent of      State prison admissions in 1980, they rose to 36 percent in      1998.       (3) Although prisoners generally are serving longer      sentences than they did a decade ago, most eventually reenter      communities; for example, in 1999, approximately 538,000      State prisoners and over 50,000 Federal prisoners a record      number were returned to American communities. Approximately      100,000 State offenders return to communities and received no      supervision whatsoever.       (4) Historically, two-thirds of returning State prisoners      have been rearrested for new crimes within 3 years, so these      individuals pose a significant public safety risk and a      continuing financial burden to society.       (5) A key element to effective post-incarceration      supervision is an immediate, predetermined, and appropriate      response to violations of the conditions of supervision.       (6) An estimated 187,000 State and Federal prison inmates      have been diagnosed with mental health problems; about 70      percent of State prisoners and 57 percent of Federal      prisoners have a history of drug use or abuse; and nearly 75      percent of released offenders with heroin or cocaine problems      return to using drugs within 3 months if untreated; however,      few States link prison mental health treatment programs with      those in the return community.       (7) Between 1987 and 1997, the volume of juvenile      adjudicated cases resulting in court-ordered residential      placements rose 56 percent. In 1997 alone, there were a total      of 163,200 juvenile court-ordered residential placements. The      steady increase of youth exiting residential placement has      strained the juvenile justice aftercare system, however,      without adequate supervision and services, youth are likely      to relapse, recidivate, and return to confinement at the      public's expense.       (8) Emerging technologies and multidisciplinary community-     based strategies present new opportunities to alleviate the      public safety risk posed by released prisoners while helping      offenders to reenter their communities successfully.      SEC. 3. PURPOSES.       The purposes of this Act are to--       (1) establish demonstration projects in several Federal      judicial districts, the District of Columbia, and in the      Federal Bureau of Prisons, using new strategies and emerging      technologies that alleviate the public safety risk posed by      released prisoners by promoting their successful      reintegration into the community;       (2) establish court-based programs to monitor the return of      offenders into communities, using court sanctions to promote      positive behavior;       (3) establish offender reentry demonstration projects in      the states using government and community partnerships to      coordinate cost efficient strategies that ensure public      safety and enhance the successful reentry into communities of      offenders who have completed their prison sentences;       (4) establish intensive aftercare demonstration projects      that address public safety and ensure the special reentry      needs of juvenile offenders by coordinating the resources of      juvenile correctional agencies, juvenile courts, juvenile      parole agencies, law enforcement agencies, social service      providers, and local Workforce Investment Boards; and       (5) rigorously evaluate these reentry programs to determine      their effectiveness in reducing recidivism and promoting      successful offender reintegration.
