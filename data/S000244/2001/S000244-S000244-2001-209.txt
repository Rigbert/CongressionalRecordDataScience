Speaker, I yield myself 1 minute.  Mr. Speaker, the last two speakers, both of whom were on the Democratic side of the aisle, show very clearly the difference in values that are being enunciated in the two bills before the House today.  On one hand, we hear support for the Greenwood bill, which really allows the FDA to license an industry for profit and clone human embryos.  On the other hand, we hear those in favor of the Weldon bill, myself included, who say that we ought to ban the cloning of human embryos and the experimentation thereon.  This is a question of values. I would point out that the previous speaker, the gentleman from New York, during the Committee on the Judiciary debate, said, ``I have no moral compunction about killing that embryo for therapeutic or experimental purposes at all.''  Mr. Speaker, I think those who are interested in values should vote against Greenwood and should vote in favor of the Weldon bill.  Mr. Speaker, I yield 1 minute to the gentleman from Pennsylvania (Mr. Pitts).
