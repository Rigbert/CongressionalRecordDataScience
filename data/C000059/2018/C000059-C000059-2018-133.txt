Speaker, I rise today to honor and pay tribute to former California State Senator Craig Biddle, who passed away on Sunday, September 23, 2018 in Florida. Craig served the people of California and Riverside County in many ways throughout his life and he will be deeply missed.  While growing up, Craig developed a deep passion for playing the French horn. He even spent three summers at the Interlochen Center for the Arts in Michigan and intended to spend his life as a musician. Then, while attending Occidental College, he turned his focus and attention to the law. He eventually sold his horn to pay for the first semester of law school at USC. After graduating, he moved from South Pasadena to Riverside, where he became a deputy district attorney. He served there four years, before becoming a public defender.  Craig decided to leap into politics and had his sights set on becoming district attorney. In an effort to bolster his name recognition for a future district attorney campaign, he decided to run for the California Assembly as a Republican. In an unexpected turn of events, Craig wound up winning that race and was elected to serve in the Assembly. Craig would later become the Assembly majority leader from 1969 to 1971. He then resigned to run for the state Senate. Craig won that race and represented the Riverside area in the Senate for one term. Throughout his legislative career, Craig was an effective advocate for laws requiring the use of breathalyzer tests for suspected drunk drivers and for clean air policies that required cars to undergo smog checks. After leaving office, Craig started a law firm in Sacramento, which he ran before retiring in 1995.  Craig is survived by his wife Patricia Kelley and three children, Eric, Nancy and Lisa Biddle Canez. He had four grandchildren. I want to extend my heartfelt condolences to the Biddle family, his friends, and everyone who had the pleasure of knowing him. Although Craig may be gone, the many life-changing contributions he made in Riverside County and throughout California will have a lasting impact.                          ____________________
