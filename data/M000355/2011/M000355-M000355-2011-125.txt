 President, I rise today to pay tribute to a devoted mother, parent, and fixture of the Colony Elementary School lunchroom staff, Ms. Jenny Bowling of Laurel County, KY. Jenny's love for cooking and sharing great food with people led to a long and fulfilling 38-year career as a cook and lunchroom manager at Colony Elementary.  Jenny began her career as a lunchroom cook in May of 1959 so that she could be close to her three children, who were enrolled at Colony Elementary at the time. She grew close to the teachers and other school staff over the years. She also served as the lunchroom manager. This included cooking as well as running the cafeteria, keeping payroll records and processing the free lunch forms.  In addition, Jenny was an avid volunteer within the school. Jenny was a member of the PTO and rarely missed a meeting. The value and importance of school involvement to Jenny was irreplaceable, a tradition that is still very much alive within her today--Jenny still volunteers every year at Colony Elementary's annual Thanksgiving celebration by assisting in the lunchroom preparation of the traditional turkey and stuffing meals. Jenny passionately served the children and staff of Colony Elementary for almost four decades before she retired in 1997.  Ms. Jenny Bowling's lifetime commitment to serving Colony Elementary with smiles and home-style meals is truly admirable and an inspiration to the citizens of our great Commonwealth. The Laurel County Sentinel Echo published an article highlighting and thanking Jenny for her service to the people of Kentucky. I ask unanimous consent that the full article be printed in the Record.  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in the Record, as follows:              [From the Laurel County Sentinel Echo, 2011] Homestyle Traditions: Jenny Bowling Keeps Cafeteria Recipes Alive in                           Her Kitchen at Home                          (By Magen McCrarey)       In May 1959, Jenny Bowling pulled a hairnet over her soft      locks to prepare for 38 years working within school      cafeterias.       ``At the time we peeled our own potatoes,'' Bowling      recalled.       Today, she observes that lunch is just not made like it      used to be with instant boxed potatoes, nutritional charts to      follow and new regulations. Bowling reminisced about the days      she spent at Colony Elementary School with fellow cooks, Ada      Clay and Thelma Lincks, and soon after, Opal Nicholson and      Maggie Wilkerson, rolling out dough for yeast rolls, mixing      cornmeal and flour for cornbread and putting their own      personal touch on recipes.       Working at Colony in western Laurel County was ideal for      Bowling, being a short distance away from her home while her      three children were enrolled in classrooms just down the hall      from the lunchroom.       Over the years, Bowling became close to the school staff      and to the teachers especially. Her time was not always spent      with her hands in the dough; she kept records of payroll,      processed the free lunch forms and ensured that the cafeteria      ran smoothly in her position as lunchroom manager.       ``People who weren't in the lunchroom had no idea the      bookwork involved,'' she said.       Children at the school who could not afford to pay for      their lunch would be hired as help for the cafeteria, Bowling      said, to help serve food, and, on occasion, wash dishes in      exchange for payment.       Bowling made only $25 a week to help with the bills, while      her husband, Oscar, was out on the road driving a truck to      help support the four. Her youngest son at the time, Larry,      had not started school yet and so $10 of her pay was handed      to a babysitter.       Being involved with the school was very important to      Bowling. As an avid PTO volunteer and member, she rarely      missed a meeting. School involvement is still something she      continues to value, even now that her children have graduated      and have children of their own.       ``My oldest, Charlotte, is 60 years old,'' she noted.       Bowling continues to volunteer at Colony Elementary's      annual Thanksgiving celebration. Bowling assists in the      lunchroom preparations for the traditional turkey and      stuffing feast, although she's still adjusting to the new way      of doing things which usually involves using up-to-date      machines for mass meal production.       ``The equipment is so new and different,'' she commented.       Instead of children dropping pocket change and crumpled      dollar bills for the lunchroom staff to count and pencil in,      computers are now used to calculate change and handle      payments.       ``The last year I was there they started using computers,''      Bowling said. She retired in 1997.       Even though the old homestyle recipes are no longer      prepared at the school's cafeteria, Bowling still keeps the      recipes alive in her own kitchen. Every Sunday, Bowling cooks      for her family.       ``I love to cook if people like to eat.''                          ____________________
