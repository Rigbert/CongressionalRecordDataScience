I urge adoption of my amendment.  Ms. McCOLLUM. Mr. Chair, I rise in opposition to the gentleman's amendment.  The Acting CHAIR. The gentlewoman from Minnesota is recognized for 5 minutes.  Ms. McCOLLUM. Mr. Chair, I rise in strong opposition to this amendment. I am actually quite surprised that we find ourselves here tonight attempting to overturn the National Park Service recent policy changes to stop allowing the Confederate flag to be displayed or sold in national parks.  Mr. Chair, just yesterday, this House passed amendment after amendment supporting the removal of the symbol of racism from our national parks, which are visited every day by Americans and foreign visitors of every race.  We have read about the divisive tactics happening in the South Carolina statehouse as they debate the removal of the Confederate flag after the murder of nine Black parishioners.  I never thought that the U.S. House of Representatives would join those who would want to see this flag flown by passing an amendment to ensure the continuing flying of the Confederate flag. I strongly urge every Member to stand with the citizens of all races and to remove this symbol of hatred from our National Park Service.  I reserve the balance of my time.
