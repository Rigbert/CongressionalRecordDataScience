Chairman, I rise in strong opposition to the amendment offered by the gentlemen from New York, Mr. Nadler, and Mr. Crowley. This amendment would cut $10 million dollars from the National Science Foundation's (NSF) polar research and Antarctic logistics programs, which are part of the Research and Related Activities account. The Science Committee and this House have affirmed the importance of an active U.S.presence in Antarctica. Stable funding for these programs is necessary because of the long lead time required for polar operations. If this amendment passes, funding will have to be shifted from other NSF basic research programs to support polar operations already in the pipeline.  Mr. Chairman, we can all sympathize with the plight for those who have contracted AIDS, but I do not think that it is in the best interests of AIDS patients to cut funding for basic science programs that may one day provide a cure for this and other debilitating diseases. The types of basic research NSF funds in the biological and other sciences is a vitally important part of a balanced federal research portfolio.  The basic research being conducted through NSF adds to our store of knowledge in valuable, and often unpredictable, ways. We cannot foresee where the next AIDS breakthrough will come, but I think it is safe to say that basic research funded by NSF will be shown to have contributed greatly in the effort.  I do not believe it is their intention, but the amendment offered by the gentlemen from New York potentially could prolong the time needed to develop an effective treatment for this insidious disease, harming the people it is intended to help. NSF-funded research is an important weapon in the battle against AIDS and other serious diseases. If this House really wants to help AIDS patients, it will vote a resounding ``no'' on this amendment.
