 Mr. Speaker, we have a number of people coming shortly, but first I'd like to say some words about the dean of our California delegation, Jerry Lewis.  Jerry was first elected in 1978 to the United States House of Representatives. We're losing a great man with the retirement of a good friend to all of us, and certainly a mentor to me, Jerry Lewis.                              {time}  1530  From his early days in Congress, Jerry Lewis has worked tirelessly for the good of the Nation and for the well-being of his constituents. Whether it was securing water supplies for southern California, rebuilding our defense programs, supporting the nascent unmanned aerial vehicle, eliminating wasteful spending, or improving the quality of life for thousands of Inland Empire residents, Jerry Lewis has been the definition of a leader and a patriot.  His great depth of knowledge will be sorely missed by the entire House and especially the House Appropriations Committee, where he served as the chairman and ranking member. I know all of us are grateful for Jerry's years of service to our country, and we'll miss his vision, his leadership, his sense of humor, and certainly his intellect.  I congratulate Jerry on his retirement. And while he will be deeply missed in Washington, D.C., he has much to look forward to as he enjoys retired life with his wonderful wife, Arlene, his children, and his grandchildren.  Next I would like to take a moment to say a few words about the former California attorney general, Congressman Dan Lungren. Congressman Lungren was first elected to Congress in 1978, where his legal background was instrumental in his leadership on judiciary, criminal justice, and immigration issues. He was called back to State service in 1989 and successfully ran for attorney general, where he served from 1991 to 1999.  As attorney general, Congressman Lungren helped author, and later defended in court, California's landmark Three Strikes and You're Out law. During his tenure and due to his tough on crime policies, crime plunged 30 percent to historic lows in California.  After a few years in the private sector and the aftermath of September 11, 2001, Congressman Lungren decided to return to Congress and was reelected in 2004. Since his return, Congressman Lungren has used his time and talents as a member of the Judiciary and the Homeland Security Committees.  Throughout his career, Congressman Lungren has been supported by his wonderful wife, Bobbi, and their family.  Thank you, Congressman Lungren. Your contributions to both California and our country will be long remembered. And I know you're very proud of your alma mater, Notre Dame, as they head toward another national championship.  Now I would like to return to California again with David Dreier, who is the current chairman of our California Republican delegation. David was elected as part of the Reagan revolution in 1980. He has remained true to the principles of free markets, free trade, limited government, strong national defense, and personal freedom during his 31 years of service.  Congressman Dreier holds the distinction of being the youngest chairman of the House Rules Committee and the first from California. As chairman of the Rules Committee, Congressman Dreier has been instrumental in restoring regular order to the House, ensuring Members' voices are heard on legislation, and supporting the ideals of civil debate in the House.  Congressman Dreier has also been a leader in reforming Congress to increase transparency, demand accountability, and ensure dignity of the United States House of Representatives.  In 2001, Mr. Dreier was unanimously selected by his California colleagues to chair the State's Republican congressional delegation, where he leads California's House Republicans on critical statewide issues. Congressman Dreier's leadership, especially as chairman of the House Rules Committee, will be sorely missed.  Next is someone I have also worked with for many years. We had worked together to address California water supply issues and reform the Endangered Species Act, Congressman Wally Herger.  Wally has been a tremendous asset to his constituents and certainly to this body. During his time in Congress, Congressman Herger has been a vocal and active supporter of efforts to enhance and improve flood control and water storage infrastructure to meet the public health and safety needs of growing communities in northern California. He's also been a strong supporter of improved forest management to protect communities from catastrophic wildfire and provide local economic development opportunities. Accordingly, he has been a champion of several pieces of commonsense forest health legislation, including the Herger-Feinstein Quincy Library Group Forest Recovery Act of 1998 and the Secure Rural Schools and Community Self-Determination Act of 2000.  Congressman Herger was instrumental in the reauthorization expansion of the 1996 welfare reform law. The reauthorization measure enacted in 2006 strengthened the 1996 law to help even more parents on welfare go to work and further strengthened their families.  In the 112th Congress, Congressman Herger was selected chairman of the House Ways and Means Subcommittee on Health and was a leader in fighting the government takeover of health care.  In addition to many accomplishments in Congress, Congressman Herger and his wife, Pamela, are proud parents and grandparents of 9 children and 12 grandchildren. Congressman Herger's spirit, tenacity, intelligence, and leadership have been the hallmark of a distinguished career, and we certainly salute him as he retires.  And I'm now happy to yield to Mr. Herger.
