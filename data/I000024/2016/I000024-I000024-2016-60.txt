President, today I congratulate Ray Harry on his recent retirement after 40 years at Southern Company.  Ray started with Southern Company back in 1976 as an environmental licensing specialist at Gulf Power in his home State of Florida. Since then, he has held numerous senior positions dealing with environmental policy both at Gulf Power and at Southern Company itself. Most recently, he served as senior director of governmental affairs in the company's Washington, DC, office, responsible for the direction and management of all Federal environmental issues. He represented Southern with great distinction before Federal policymakers in both Congress and the executive branch, with international policymaking bodies such as the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change, and as part of various coalitions and trade associations in Washington, DC.  During his many years of service, I had the privilege of getting to know Ray and of working with him on a number of important environmental issues facing our country. He was always honest, straightforward, and eager to share his deep experience and policy expertise. More than that, his soft-spoken manner and quick, wry sense of humor made him a pleasure to be around. I congratulate Ray on his retirement and wish him and his wife, Sheila, all the best in their coming adventures.                          ____________________
