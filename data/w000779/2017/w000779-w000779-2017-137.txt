President, I think I have made the case.  To my colleagues, what the American people have told us--and they certainly said this during this last work period--is that they understand that the big challenges in this country require bipartisan approaches. That is what President Reagan understood when he brought together Democrats and Republicans for comprehensive tax reform.  We need to pass this amendment to strike the reconciliation instructions from the budget because they send all of the wrong signals with respect to tax reform.  The American people understand what it takes to tackle big issues. They understand that tax reform should be about the middle class. It should not be about the 1 percent, and it should not be about causing a huge, new sea of red ink.  I urge my colleagues to support my amendment to strike the reconciliation instructions from the budget.
