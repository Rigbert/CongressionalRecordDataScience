President, this General Accounting Office report makes it very clear that relative to all the other countries in the world, our taxpayers are not getting a fair shake. So this is ultimately about cutting back on subsidies the President says are not needed in order to create markets and to prevent the taxpayers of this country from being fleeced.  I thank my colleague. I know Senator Schumer has been patient.
