 President, I know I am safe in saying the majority leader wants to finish this bill this week. I do understand that part of the problem lies on this side of the aisle with the proliferation of amendments prior to the agreement we entered into limiting the amendments. We will be working hard on this side of the aisle to narrow the list and put us in a position to complete action on this bill this week.                          ____________________
