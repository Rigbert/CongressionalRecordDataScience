 President, I rise today to introduce the Military Honors Preservation Act of 1998 which will ensure that those who have served this nation with distinction will not see their service medals devalued by the crimes of others.  This bill simply states that a member of the United States armed forces may not enter a federal, state, or local penitentiary for the purpose of presenting a medal to a person incarcerated for committing a serious violent felony. My hope is that this bill will be seen as it is intended: an attempt to secure the well deserved sense of honor of those who have served in our nation's armed forces. Service to our nation and the opportunity to receive recognition for that service is a duty and a privilege not to be taken lightly.  I decided that this legislation was necessary when I heard of the unbearable pain suffered by the family of Leah Schendel, a 78-year old woman who was attacked in her Sacramento, California home just before Christmas in 1980. Mrs. Schendel was brutally beaten and sexually assaulted. This vicious attack caused a massive heart attack that killed her. The man who perpetrated this horrific crime, Manuel Babbitt, was convicted and sentenced to die--he is currently sitting on death row in San Quentin Prison.  This past March, the suffering of Mrs. Schendel's family was renewed when they learned that the man who had so viciously brutalized their loved one was being honored by the United States Marine Corps, in San Quentin! In a ceremony at the prison, Mr. Babbitt was awarded a Purple Heart for injuries he suffered during the Vietnam War. For Mrs. Schendel's family, this medal ceremony was a slap in the face. It said to them that the government was more concerned with honoring a convicted criminal than respecting the feelings of his victims.  I believe that there is no higher calling for an American than to serve our nation. I have worked hard to make sure that California veterans, who have been overlooked or fallen through thecracks of the system, get the recognition and benefits they deserve. However, I believe that someone who, in his or her post-service life, shows such a blatant disregard for the laws of this nation and makes a mockery of the high standards of the United States military should not be accorded recognition.  Just like the right to vote, or the right to a military burial in Arlington Cemetery, I believe anyone who has committed a heinous crime forfeits the right to be honored by the American people. Please join me in supporting this bill for the sake of Leah Schendel, and for every American veteran who should rightly feel that they are a hero.  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be printed in the Record.  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the Record, as follows:                                S. 2050       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of      the United States of America in Congress assembled,     SECTION 1.
