President, I just ask I be recognized after the distinguished Senator from Washington.  I understand the Senator from Mississippi has some housekeeping matters to take care of first, but after that is done and after the distinguished Senator from the State of Washington, I ask I might be recognized as in morning business. That is a unanimous-consent request.
