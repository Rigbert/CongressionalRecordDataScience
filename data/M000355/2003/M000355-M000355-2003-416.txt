 I don't know whether there are other amendments on that side of the aisle that will have a need for debate at some length. But the amendment to which the Democratic leader referred is obviously one a number of people are going to want to speak to. I think we will be able to go to it sometime in the early evening because there are people here who are going to want to speak on that amendment. I know people on your side are going to want to speak on that amendment.  I am still optimistic that we can press on into the evening. It is still our hope to finish the bill.
