 President, we are working our way quickly toward final passage. I just wanted to take a minute and thank our chairman, Senator Bond, from Missouri, who has done a remarkable job with a very complex bill that has numerous agencies with it, the first time the Senate has considered a bill with Transportation and HUD and Judiciary. I wish to compliment him and his staff and thank all of our staffs for the tremendous work they did in moving this bill forward.  I thank the Chair.
