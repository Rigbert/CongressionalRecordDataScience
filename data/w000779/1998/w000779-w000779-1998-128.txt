President, for the last three years, this Congress struggled with many of the difficult issues in the Amtrak reauthorization bill. We finally reached an agreement late last year and sent legislation to the President for his signature, which he signed on December 2, 1997.  In the process, my state, and its neighbors, lost a valuable service on the route of the Pioneer. I fought hard to keep that service running but citizens of eastern Oregon continue to feel frustrated over the loss of this service.  I want Amtrak to succeed and I want to make sure that the legislation we enacted last year is properly implemented. The Administration is late in submitting its nominations for the Amtrak Reform Board which was created in last year's bill. Although I hear that the Administration has begun the process of picking candidates for the seven positions that are required by law, I am concerned that the names under consideration will not represent the various regions of the country that make up the Amtrak system. If the restoration of the Pioneer is to receive fair consideration, it must be by a Board of Directors that reflects the regional needs of all sections of the country. My friend, the Majority Leader, who also sits on the Commerce Committee has made clear on more than one occasion that if Amtrak is only a series of regional corridors and not a national system, it will not continue to receive the support of Congress.  While I believe the new Amtrak Board should meet the qualifications spelled out in the Act, they should also have a sense of geographical balance. I fear the loss of support for a national system if we wind up with a Board that represents only one region of the country. In particular, the west and mid-western states again appear to be left out of consideration as sources of Amtrak director candidates.  As a member of the Senate Commerce Committee, I will be looking for regional balance when these nominations are submitted and encourage my colleagues to do so as well.                          ____________________
