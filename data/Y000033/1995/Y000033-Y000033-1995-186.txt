Mr. Chairman, I rise in support of the amendment to the amendment offered by the gentleman from Pennsylvania [Mr. Murtha].  Mr. Chairman, in the last several years the members of our subcommittee have done everything we possibly could to keep this from becoming an American war, and the gentleman from Wisconsin [Mr. Neumann] has been a very strong advocate of that. However, we do have to recognize, as the gentleman from Pennsylvania mentioned, our commitment to the United Nations. I would mention in addition our very strong treaty commitment to our NATO allies, and, if our NATO allies become embroiled or endangered, we do have a commitment to come to their rescue.  So, Mr. Chairman, I believe the amendment offered by the gentleman from Pennsylvania to the amendment offered by the gentleman from Wisconsin is a good amendment. It makes the overall legislation acceptable and certainly would, I believe, fit within the realm of the Constitution, and so I would hope also that the gentleman would be willing to accept this amendment and that we can just get on to the next item.  Mr. Chairman, I yield back the balance of my time.
