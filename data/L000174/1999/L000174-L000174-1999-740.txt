President, on March 17, Senator George Mitchell received the Medal of Freedom at the White House.  The day was picked especially because Irish Americans had gathered at the White House, but also Irish from both Northern Ireland and the Republic of Ireland were in attendance.  All together, with the President of the United States, we honored the extraordinary achievements of the United States Senate's former majority leader.  Marcelle and I were in attendance with great pride in watching our friend, Senator Mitchell. We were honored also to be with his wife, Heather, and other members of his family. Having served with him, I know he is an extraordinarily capable, patient, and talented person. No one else could have done what he did.  Senator Mitchell received a standing ovation for his words that evening--words that came from his heart and mind.  I ask unanimous consent that his words be printed in the Record.  There being no objection, the remarks were ordered to be printed in the Record, as follows:   Remarks by Senator George J. Mitchell on Receipt of the Medal of                 Freedom, the White House, March 17, 1999       Thank you, Mr. President, for your generous remarks, and      for your commitment to peace and reconciliation in Northern      Ireland. You are the only American President ever to have      placed Northern Ireland high on our national agenda, the only      President ever to have visited there while in office. The      people of Ireland, North and South, know of your concern for      their future; and they are deeply grateful. In behalf of      peace loving people everywhere, I thank you.       I also want to thank you for giving me the chance to serve      in Northern Ireland. I must admit that I didn't always feel      this way. During the years that I sat and listened to the      same arguments, over and over again, I had other, less      charitable thoughts about you and about my role there.       It was difficult and demanding, but it also was deeply      rewarding. For me to have played a part in trying to end an      ancient conflict, trying to make possible a more safe and      secure life for generations to come; for me to have come to      know, to admire, and to love the people of Northern Ireland--     these are rewards which cannot be measured, or even      described.       I can only say that my heart is overflowing with      gratitude--to you, Mr. President; to the political leaders      and to the people of Northern Ireland; to Prime Ministers      Ahern and Blair and their predecessors; to Mo Mowlam and      David Andrews and their predecessors and colleagues; to my      colleagues, John de Chastelain and Harri Holkeri; to my      staff, Martha Pope, David Pozorski, and Kelly Currie; and      especially to my wife, Heather, who was patient      and understanding through three-and-a-half long, lonely      years.       On an occasion like this, it is tempting for me to take a      nostalgic look back on my life.     But instead we must look forward, with urgency, not to my      life, but to the lives of the people of Northern Ireland.       The events of the past year have shown the great promise of      peace. But they also have shown that huge obstacles remain to      a durable and sustainable peace. On Good Friday of last year,      the political leaders of Northern Ireland showed the world      the meaning of political courage. Many of these leaders are      present, and I'd like to recognize some of them: David      Trimble, John Hume, Seamus Mallon, Reg Empey, Gerry Adams,      John Alderdice, Sean Neeson, David Ervine, Monica McWilliams      and Gary McMichael.       Ladies and gentlemen, these are the heroes of the Northern      Ireland Peace process. These are the men and women who      deserve the medals and the applause. They are my friends, and      yours. Please join me in letting them know how much you value      their Good Friday agreement.       I'd like to address those leaders directly. You've heard      the applause. Perhaps better than anyone, I know how well      deserved it was. But even before the applause fades, the      future intrudes.       Getting the agreement was historic. But, as you know, by      itself it doesn't provide or guarantee peace. It makes peace      possible. Whether it will be realized is up to you.       The Good Friday Agreement transformed Northern Ireland. It      also transformed you. You are no longer just the leaders of      your parties, or members of the assembly. You are the vessels      into which the people of Northern Ireland have poured their      hopes and dreams. You sought public office and with it comes      power and responsibility. You have the awesome responsibility      of life or death. What you do, or don't do, could mean life      or death for many of your fellow citizens.       As he left London to join us at the talks last April, Tony      Blair said he felt the hand of history on his shoulder. It's      still there, on your shoulders.       For a moment, come back in time with me to December 16,      1997, the last negotiating session of that year. We met in      the small conference room at Stormont. We had tried for two      intense weeks to get agreement on a statement of the key      issues to be resolved, and we had failed. We were all      bitterly frustrated and deeply discouraged.       As we walked out into the windswept and rainy night, it      seemed so hopeless, so impossible. And yet, less than four      months later, you reached agreement.       How did you do it? You did it because each of you took a      risk for peace, each of you acted with wisdom and courage.      And you did it because you knew, in your hearts, that the      alternative was unacceptable.       It stills is. The alternative to peace in Northern Ireland      is unacceptable. It should be unspeakable, unthinkable. The      continued punishment beatings and the savage murder of      Rosemary Nelson, who on Sunday was blown to death just a few      yards from her eight year old daughter's school, are like      alarm bells ringing in the night. They warn that the cancer      of violence and sectarian hatred lurks just below the surface      and could erupt at any time into wide-spread conflict.       History might have forgiven failure to reach an agreement,      since no one thought it possible. But once the agreement was      reached, history will never forgive the failure to carry it      out. The people of Northern Ireland don't want to slip back      into the cauldron of sectarian conflict. You can prevent it.       Those who oppose the agreement have failed to bring it      down. As Seamus Mallon has said, the only people who can      bring the Good Friday down are those who supported it. You      cannot let that happen.       I know you. I trust you. I believe in you. And I say to you      that the problems you now face are no greater or more      difficult than those you faced, and dealt with, last year.      You must once more rise above adversity. You must again defy      history.       You must come together, now and as often as necessary until      peace is assured. Then you will deserve and receive the honor      that will transcend all others: the satisfaction of knowing      that, in the most difficult and dangerous of circumstances,      you have bestowed on your countrymen the ultimate prize peace      and reconciliation.       After you reached agreement on Good Friday, we were      exhausted, elated, and emotional. I conclude tonight by      repeating what I told some of you then.       The agreement was for me the realization of a dream that      had sustained me for three-and-a-half years. Now, I have a      new dream. In a few years, I will take my young son to      Northern Ireland. We will roam the country, taking in the      sights and sounds of one of the most beautiful landscapes on      earth, feeling the warmth and generosity of a great people.      Then, on a rainy afternoon, we will go to the Northern      Ireland Assembly. We will sit quietly in the visitors'      gallery and watch and listen as you debate the ordinary      issues of life in a democratic society: education, health      care, agriculture, tourism. There will be no talk of war, for      the war will have long been over. There will be no talk of      peace, for peace will be taken for granted.       On that day, the day on which peace is taken for granted in      Northern Ireland, I will be truly and finally fulfilled.
