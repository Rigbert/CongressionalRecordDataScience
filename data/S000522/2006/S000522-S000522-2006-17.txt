Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.  Mr. Speaker, in describing American foreign policy after World War II, General George Marshall said, ``Our policy is directed not against any country or doctrine, but against hunger, poverty, desperation and chaos. Its purpose should be the revival of a working economy in the world so as to permit an emergence of political and social conditions in which free institutions can exist.''  Mr. Speaker, the Democratic Republic of the Congo has seen more than its fair share of hunger, poverty, desperation and chaos. Since 1998, an estimated 4 million people have died as a result of war, famine and disease, and thousands more die each and every day. More than 40,000 women and children have been systematically raped and tortured at the hands of the armed forces of the Congo, perpetrators of genocide from neighboring Rwanda and an increasing intricate array of militia groups.                              {time}  1930  Life expectancy in Congo has plummeted to 49 years, and years of war and rampant corruption have decimated an economy that should have been one of Africa's strongest.  Fortunately, hope for an end to the constant conflict and chaos that have plagued the Congo since independence has been raised following the historic elections that took place in July and October of this year. An estimated 70 percent of eligible voters turned out to vote in the face of great difficulties, and international monitors agreed that the election results were uncompromised by irregularities.  But the conduct of elections represent only an initial step towards normalcy. A legitimate result in the October runoff that is accepted by both parties and the population at large is vitally important. Further, the establishment of inclusive political institutions, the restoration of critical infrastructure and essential public services, and the creation of viable economic opportunities for development will be critically important if Congo is to flourish.  During a recent visit to Kinshasa earlier this month, U.N. Under Secretary of Humanitarian Affairs Jan Egelund asserted that ``the Congolese people were still suffering one of the world's worst humanitarian crises.'' Unfortunately, this is a fact that has largely escaped the attention of many of us, particularly as we focus on other well-deserved crises such as that which is occurring in Darfur and northern Uganda and, as a result of U.S. policy towards Congo, really has gone adrift and needs to be re-energized.  S. 2125 recognizes the importance of a coherent, forward-leaning U.S. policy toward the Congo. It identifies key U.S. policies in Congo, including the promotion of free, fair and democratic elections in the future; support for security sector reform and disarmament;demobilization, repatriation, reintegration and rehabilitation programs; and the promotion of accountability for those who have committed atrocities and gross human rights violations.  It also asserts that the United States will work to ensure that a stable Congolese government is committed to the principles of good governance and resource management, rule of law, and peaceful coexistence with its regional neighbors. The bill suggests that the U.S. partner with other governments with similar goals for the Congo.  Finally, it compels the U.S. to work to strengthen the mandate of the United Nations peacekeeping force in the Congo, MONUC, to include specific authority to prevent and effectively counter imminent threats, protect civilians, enhance intelligence gathering capabilities, and monitor arms trafficking, and of course, also to look into the terrible problem of child soldiers.  S. 2125 further authorizes $52 million for fiscal years 2006 and 2007, an increase of $5 million, to carry out these objectives and expresses support for additional funding in future years. However, the bill makes it clear that U.S. assistance to Congo cannot continue in perpetuity. It calls on the Secretary of State to withhold such assistance if the government is not making sufficient progress towards accomplishing the stated U.S. foreign policy goals.  Mr. Speaker, this is a timely bill. While providing a road map for U.S. policy towards Congo during this critical stage in its transition, it rightly places the burden of success on the Congolese themselves. After all, solutions for Congo's ills cannot be imposed from the outside. The Congolese themselves must seize the opportunity for peace and prosperity that is before them. Still, this bill helps support them in that effort.  Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of our time.
