  Mr. DeFAZIO. So in the middle of a busy legislative week, the Republicans are going to bring up a bill to require the President to submit a balanced budget. It would be good if first perhaps they looked in the mirror, because this comes from the same House Republicans who in the last Congress passed the Ryan budget which got great accolades from the right.  Unfortunately, the Ryan budget, even with directed scoring, that is, made-up numbers, the pretend ``if you cut taxes, you'll increase revenues,'' wouldn't pretend to balance a budget until 2040--and that was after it did away with Medicare, student financial aid, and a few other domestic programs.  Now let's get real around here. One-third of the deficit is due to high unemployment. We need a strategy to put Americans back to work. That requires investment--investment in education, investment in our roads, bridges, highways, transit systems, jetties, levees, dams, and harbors across the country. That would put Americans back to work. That would get this country moving again, not a bunch of fake bills about a budget that they have no intention of balancing.                          ____________________
