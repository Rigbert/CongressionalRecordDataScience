Mr. Chairman, I yield myself such time as I may consume.  Mr. Chairman, many of us are supporting numerous sections of the bill before us because it is time to crack down on illegal immigration. It is therefore ironic and I believe very unfortunate that the very deepest cuts imposed by the bill as presently written is not on illegal immigrants, it is not even on legal immigrants, but it is on refugees.  Refugees would be cut from an authorized level of 110,000 last year to 50,000 in 1998 and succeeding years, a reduction of 55 percent, compared to less than 25 percent for other legal immigrants.  Mr. Chairman, the refugee cap would be a dramatic departure from U.S. human rights policy. As chairman of the Subcommittee on International Operations and Human Rights, the committee that has prime jurisdiction over our refugee policy, and also over the budget from the authorizing level perspective, and also over human rights in general around the world, I would submit that it would be a tragedy and just plain wrong to slash refugee admissions to the United States and to depart from what is now the current law adopted back in 1980 of an annual consultation between the Congress and the executive branch to prescribe the correct number of admissions for that year.  Our first refugee laws were enacted just after World War II, when it became clear that we had effectively sentenced hundreds of Jewish refugees to death by forcing them back to Europe. The most dramatic instance was the voyage of the St. Louis, many of whose 1,000 passengers died in concentration camps after being excluded from the United States in 1939.  Let us be very clear about what we are talking about. The four largest groups of refugees admitted to the United States are all people who are in deep trouble because they share our common values about human rights and freedom: First, Jews and evangelical Christians and Ukrainian Catholics from the former Soviet Union. There has been a lot of talk about how these people are not really refugees. But my subcommittee and also the Commission on Security and Cooperation in Europe, which I also chair, has held several hearings on the resurgence of repression aimed at people of faith and people who, just because they are Jews or Christians or evangelicals, find themselves at the wrong end of their government.  Mr. Chairman, those hearings made it crystal clear that it is not the time now to stop worrying about resurgent anti-Semitism and ultra-nationalism. The communists may be back in power. We heard from Mr. Kovalev, Yeltsin's human rights leader, but sacked because of his criticisms in Chechnya. Just a couple of weeks ago, he came to our commission, he is still a member of the Duma, and he said within 6 months democracy could be lost in Russia. Recently the President of Belarus stated that modern governments had a lot to learn from Adolf Hitler.                                  2000  Second, Mr. Chairman, are old soldiers and religious refugees from places like Vietnam. These are the people who served years in reeducation camps for their pro-American and pro-democracy activities. There are many thousands of them still in the pipeline, but the proposed refugee cap would effectively require that the Vietnamese refugee program be shut down.  I have been to the camps in Southeast Asia and looked into the eyes of these people who fought with us in Vietnam. Yet, they are on line to be forcibly repatriated, minimally the cap keeps open that possibility of bringing them here or to some other country of asylum. These people are our friends and they are our former allies. They risked their lives for freedom, and Americans do not abandon those who risk their lives for freedom.  Mr. Chairman, the next largest refugee groups are victims of ethnic cleansing, in Bosnia, in the few thousand refugees again, mostly political prisoners, and persecuted Christians who we managed to get out of Cuba every year. The refugee camp would almost certainly require cuts in these groups as well.  Opponents of this amendment complain that refugees cost money. Well, everything costs some money. But again we are talking about a humanitarian pro-human rights policy that helps those who are fleeing tyranny, who have a well-founded fear of persecution. We ought not remove the welcome mat to these very important people.  Mr. Chairman, finally, this amendment is backed by a whole large number of individuals and organizations, like the United States Catholic Conference, the Council of Jewish Federations, the Lutheran Immigration and Refugee Services, the Hebrew Immigrant Aid Society, Church World Services, the U.S. Committee for Refugees, Americans for Tax Reform, the Family Research Council, and the list goes on and on. I urge support for this amendment.  Mr. Chairman, I reserve the balance of my time.
