 I would like to thank him also for his willingness to work as a bipartisan team, which, as he said, we have done. I think the dividends have been great for our committee in that we have been able to get an authorization bill passed, we have been able to effect some changes. We have been able to work together. Our staffs work together. In particular, I would like to thank Majority Staff Director David Grannis, and I would like to thank Minority Staff Director Martha Scott Poindexter for her work in this regard.  I think it is extraordinarily important that Americans know there is in the Senate of the United States a team of oversight that is, in fact, working together on a true bipartisan basis.  So I say to the Senator, Mr. Vice Chairman, thank you so much for that--it has been wonderful for me--and particularly for your friendship as well.  I yield the floor.
