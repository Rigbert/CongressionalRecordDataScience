Chair, I rise in support of H.R. 5175, and strongly believe that the legislation is vital to our democracy.  While I believe that personal speech should be protected by the First Amendment of the U.S. Constitution, I feel that corporate speech was never meant to be protected and extending Constitutional safeguards to it is corrosive to our democracy. By providing unprecedented transparency, H.R. 5175 goes a long way to hold corporations who participate in U.S. elections accountable to the American people.  At its core, H.R. 5175 protects the constitutional right of voters to know the identity of the organizations spending money to influence their elections and the sources of the money they are spending.  Without the establishment of strong new disclosure rules, the Supreme Court's decision in Citizens United v. FEC will give corporations incredible power to influence elections. That is why I believe that H.R. 5175 is necessary to ensure that people know who is trying to influence our country's elections.  I also believe that this legislation prevents those who should not interfere in our elections, such as corporations controlled by foreign interests, from doing so.  This legislation strikes the appropriate balance and I urge my colleagues to support this important measure.                          ____________________
