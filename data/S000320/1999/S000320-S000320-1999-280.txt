 President, the legislation that abolished the Civil Aeronautics Board in 1978 and deregulated the airline industry has been a huge success. Americans are flying more, and more Americans are flying; at the same time, air fares have dropped and air travel has become safer. The average price of an airline ticket has decreased approximately 33 percent in real terms since market forces replaced the whims of federal bureaucrats in setting fares. The number of passengers flying domestic routes has more than doubled to approximately 600 million annually. It is not surprising, then, that air travel is no longer an exclusive privilege of the elite and today is accessible to most Americans.  While deregulation of the airline industry overall has yielded the benefits that free markets promise, there are growing pains. As the number of air passengers increases, so has the number of consumer complaints against air carriers. Some members of Congress have concluded that competition does not work for commercial aviation. They have stepped forward with proposals to reimpose federal control over air fares and carrier routes, to offer taxpayer subsidies to fledgling air carriers to compete against industry goliaths, or to levy a variety of new fines that would add to the Department of Transportation's duty the role of meter maid. We should be wary of any such effort to reintroduce the heavy hand of government under the auspices of protecting airline passengers.  Mr. President, lets not rush to throw out the baby with the bath water and undo twenty years of unprecedented growth and consumer savings under deregulation. Now is the time to reinvigorate competition in the air passenger market, even if the air carriers do not welcome it. The best way to increase competition is to regulate less, not more. Regulations that serve as barriers to the commercial aviation market should be removed. Regulations that promote the division of the marketplace into regional cartels should be abandoned. Regulations and FAA management practices that delay the installation of new technology that facilitates competition should be streamlined.  I believe that we can also increase competition in the airline industry by providing the traveling public with more useful information and by giving consumers ownership of the commodity they have purchased--their seat on an airplane. Today, I am introducing legislation that will provide passengers with greater information about their air fare and flight and with greater flexibility over unused or partially used fares.  The price of an airline ticket is as much a mystery as the Pyramids or the Hanging Gardens. In fact, The New York Times reported that on a single flight, passengers paid 27 different fares, ranging from $87 to $728. We should not adopt any measure that discourage air carriers from discounting fares or that chill the benefits airline consumers are now receiving. Air carriers, however, should not be allowed to continue bait-and-switch advertising. If an air carrier offers a discounted fare, my bill permits all passengers to make a confirmed reservation at that same price for a twenty-four hour period.  Under my bill, consumers will get more ticket and flight information. Airlines will be required to notify passengers about flight delays, cancellations, or diversions. Air carriers must also disclose if the passenger will be traveling on a carrier other than the one from whom the consumer purchased the ticket or if the flight will require the passenger to change planes.  At the same time, my bill will ensure that air carriers are penalized for canceling flights, bumping passengers, and holding travelers hostage on board an aircraft with inpunity. Whenever an airline passenger is unable to make a flight, the passenger will have the opportunity to board a similar flight on a standby basis. Whenever an airline cancels a flight for their convenience, it will have to offer to compensate each passenger. Whenever an airline keeps passengers on board an aircraft that sits on the tarmac for more than two hours, it will have to offer to compensate each passenger.  The Airline Deregulation Act of 1978 started a revolution in the airline industry, a revolution that according to a Brookings Institution study has benefitted consumers by $18.4 billion. That revolution is unfinished. I want to take the next step and promote new competition in the passenger aviation marketplace. My bill does this by taking away much of the mystery associated with flying.  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be printed in the Record.  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the Record, as follows:       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of      the United States of America in Congress assembled,     SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.       This Act may be cited as the ``Airline Deregulation and      Disclosure Act of 1999''.     SEC. 2. AIRLINE PASSENGER PROTECTION.
