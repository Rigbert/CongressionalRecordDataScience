 President, I yield 1 minute, if I may--I know it is out of order. Our friend from Maryland has asked for 1 minute. I would be delighted to yield that to him, and then I would ask, after that, to yield 1 minute to my friend from Florida. And then I think, in the order, Senator Reed is in the queue for 5 minutes, and then the Senator from Illinois, and then the Senator from North Dakota. I ask unanimous consent that be the order.
