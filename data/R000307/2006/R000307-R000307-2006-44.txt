President, I rise today in strong opposition to the amendment proposed by Senator Menendez.  While the Senator from New Jersey no doubt has the best of intentions in working to increase grant funding for high population areas, I do not believe that reducing funding for the majority of States in our great Nation is a viable way to protect against terrorism.  If we, as a country, are going to be adequately prepared for another terrorist attack, we must not forget that we are vulnerable on all fronts.
