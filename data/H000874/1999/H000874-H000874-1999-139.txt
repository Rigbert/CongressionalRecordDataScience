Chairman, I move to strike the last word.  Mr. Chairman, last Congress the House authorized the Money Laundering Financial Crimes Strategy Act of 1998, of which the gentlewoman from New York, Ms. Velazquez, was a cosponsor, along with the distinguished gentleman from Alabama (Mr. Bachus), who will also be speaking. I do notknow whether the gentlewoman from New Jersey (Mrs. Roukema) was a cosponsor as well. Apparently.  I understand what the gentleman from Arizona (Mr. Kolbe) is saying, but I am rising in support of this amendment. This bill created a national strategy to fight money laundering at the local level and attack drug trafficking at its source. Let me say to the gentlewoman from New York so she understands, the gentleman from Arizona has been an extraordinarily strong supporter of the financial crimes enforcement unit that is in this bill, FinCEN, that the gentlewoman is probably familiar with. So the gentleman has been very concerned about money laundering. I know the gentleman has a concern also about the levels in the bill. He and I at least momentarily disagree, and I think we can do this at this point in time.
