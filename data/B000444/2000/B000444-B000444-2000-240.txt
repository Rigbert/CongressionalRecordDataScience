 President, I rise today to salute a true champion of humanity. A man whose whole life has been a gift of service without material reward. A man whose work has as much meaning for the poor and disenfranchised in Sudan as it does for the poor and disenfranchised in his Wilmington community. A man whose faith in the human spirit abounds. A man that I proudly call my friend, the Executive Director of Delaware's Ministry of Caring, Brother Ronald Giannone.  This week, business and community leaders and hundreds of Brother Ronald's closest friends from across the State of Delaware will gather to celebrate his fiftieth birthday. This Golden Birthday bash principally is to thank him fifty-times over for his countless years of service to our community. We will salute him because of who Brother Ronald is, what he represents and how much he means to improving the quality of life in my home State.  Let me be specific. Brother Ronald is the kind of guy who when asked by a man or a woman down on his or her luck, ``Can you spare a dime?'' responds with a meal, a place to stay and a rigorous routine of training and education to help keep that man or woman from the throes of homelessness and despair. He is hope to the hopeless, an oasis of strength and inspiration for all those who benefit from his generosity.  For these reasons, Brother Ronald is a true Delaware treasure, but still there is so much more. Brother Ronald is an exemplary administrator. There is, quite simply, no other organization like his Ministry of Caring. His 32 full-time facilities address every need of an individual or family who finds themselves homeless, destitute and/or in transition. He clothes, he shelters, he feeds, he takes care of children, he helps develop skills, he finds jobs, he provides medical care, he cares. He teaches those who need his assistance all the things they must do to be self-sufficient. And for those who seek to provide real change, he exemplifies just what it takes to make real differences in one life.  Still, it does not stop there. Brother Ronald understands that while he feeds someone in the Emmanuel Dining Room, someone else is starving in Sudan. Consequently, his work and Ministry extend far beyond American borders and into the lives of people throughout the world. Few people could have such grand vision and still focus so directly on those suffering in their own hometown. Such is the case with Brother Ronald.  Though I could say much more about this outstanding American, I will add only this. In the words of my hero, my dad, Joseph R. Biden, Sr., ``it is a lucky man that wakes up each morning, puts his feet on the floor, goes to work and believes that it matters.'' Even luckier is the man that does these things, and inspires everyone around him to believe the same. Happy 50th Birthday, Brother Ronald.                          ____________________
