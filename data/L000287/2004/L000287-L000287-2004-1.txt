Mr. Speaker, each and every day more and more information comes to light, and every single day we see more and more proof that there was no justification for this war in Iraq, no justification.  Did this administration and this President mislead, deceive, lie; or did they just fail to tell the truth? There was never ever any growing threat or any growing danger to our Nation. This President and his administration owe the community of nations, members of Congress, the American people, and the families of those who lost their lives in Iraq an apology.  This administration should come clean and tell the truth, nothing but the truth, the whole truth.  Now we learn that Iraq's weapons of mass destruction were destroyed after the first Gulf War. At the time we invaded Iraq, Iraq not only lacked any weapons of mass destruction; it lacked the capability to build them, and this administration knew it. They knew it. It is time to tell the truth and nothingbut the whole truth. The truth will set you free.                          ____________________
