President, I want to acknowledge Wendy Wertheimer, an outstanding Federal employee who has spent decades working to advance the domestic and international HIV/AIDS research effort. Wendy is about to complete nearly 30 years of Federal service that began in the Senate and is now coming to an end at the National Institutes of Health.  Like many bright young people in Washington, Wendy began her career right here in the U.S. Senate, working for Senator Jacob Javits. Later she joined the legislative staff of what was then called the Senate Labor and Human Resources Committee, led by Chairman Edward Kennedy and Ranking Member Jacob Javits. Wendy's first assignment was the Venereal Diseases Control Act, which many on staff saw as a form of hazing for a new, young staff member. But Wendy was personally connected to the issue. Her grandfather had been the chair of Dermatology and Syphilology at a hospital in Pittsburgh and had conducted early clinical studies of syphilis. She embraced the assignment, and the bill passed with bipartisan support. It was the first bill Wendy had ever worked on--she was off to a good start.  In 1979, the American Social Health Association established the first advocacy group for venereal disease control and research, and Wendy was offered a job as its director of government affairs. After hearing the news, Wendy's mother was horrified and told her she will never get another date because everyone will assume that she has a venereal disease. Wendy accepted the job anyway and became the first venereal disease, or VD, advocate in Washington. She was a pioneer in the field and began working on a number of new education and research training programs, including the National VD Hotline.  On June 5, 1981, the first cases of what we now know as AIDS were reported by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. By the end of 1981, five to six new cases of the disease were being reported each week and an epidemic of fear was breaking out. The American Social Health Association became one of the first organizations to advocate bringing attention to this disease, and Wendy found herself on the frontlines combatting the HIV/AIDS pandemic. In 1991, she was recruited by the NIH to help establish the Office of Research on Women's Health. And since 1992, Wendy has been the senior advisor, responsible for planning, policy, legislation and communications at the Office of AIDS Research at the NIH.  It is hard to imagine, but when Wendy Wertheimer began at the NIH, an AIDS diagnosis meant a sure and agonizing death. We have come a long way since the disease was first reported, and in many ways progress on HIV/AIDS is one of the most remarkable success stories in the history of biomedical research. Wendy Wertheimer shares in this success and the research accomplishments that led to lifesaving treatments and a hopeful future about what more can be achieved.  For more than two decades, Wendy has worked with Dr. Jack Whitescarver--the longest serving director at the Office of AIDS Research at NIH--who is also retiring this year. And here is what he said:       We have made critical and even breathtaking progress in      AIDS research against many odds. We have been challenged to      confront and address stigma, homophobia, racial disparities,      and criticisms of the AIDS research investment. We have come      a long way, but the AIDS pandemic is far from over and      remains a threat to global populations. Any declaration that      the end is near is premature, inaccurate, and perilous to      progress against the pandemic.  He is right. Being HIV-positive is not the death sentence it once was, but the battle is far from over. And although Dr. Whitescarver and Wendy Wertheimer are retiring, the fight goes on, and the work continues. I want to thank them for all they have done and all they will do to combat this terrible disease. They have set a high bar for the dedicated public servants who follow them.  I will close with this. I strongly believe in the role of public service to create change and make a difference. Wendy Wertheimer's years of service reflect these values. I am honored to congratulate her on a job well done, and I am lucky to count her as a friend.                          ____________________
