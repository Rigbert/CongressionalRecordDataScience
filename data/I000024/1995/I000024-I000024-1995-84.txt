President, I feel confident that the American people are not going to buy into this lie. I know it is a very short message. I know the Democrats are rejoicing. They think they fooled the American people into thinking that the Republicans are going to cut Medicare in order to have tax cuts. There is no connection, as far as tax cuts are concerned.  I hope that anyone in America that is looking at that and saying ``we do not want tax cuts'' will stop and remember what happened in 1993. In 1993, President Clinton came out with the largest single tax increase in the history of public finance in America or anyplace in the world. These are not the words of conservative Republican Jim Inhofe. These are the words of a Democrat on the floor of the U.S. Senate.  I suggest to you that anybody who was opposed to that major tax increase that we did not need in 1993 ought to be supporting a tax cut. All we are trying to do is repeal a lot of the damage that was done to the American people in 1993. We may not be able to get by with this, until we change the personality in the White House. Nonetheless, we should not connect what we are trying to do to save Medicare with the fact that we would like to have tax relief for the American people--not the superrich, we are talking about the American people and child deductions and that sort of thing.  I feel confident that we are going to be able to sell that message because it is right and honest. We are getting more and more support around the country from liberal editorial boards who are saying: ``That is enough; we are not going to perpetrate a lie on the American people such as the Democrat leadership is trying to perform.''  You know, it was Winston Churchill who said, ``Truth is incontrovertible. Panic may rescind it, ignorance may deride it, malice may destroy it, but there it is.''   I think we will find truth and truth will prevail.  I yield the floor.
