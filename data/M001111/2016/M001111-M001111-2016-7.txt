 President, I come to the floor this afternoon to join my colleagues who have already noted that we are now at an unbelievable, unprecedented 195 days--over 6 months--since the President nominated Judge Merrick Garland to the Supreme Court.  Do you know what else could have happened in this time period? We could have gone through the confirmation process for the last Republican-nominated Justice twice and still have 11 days leftover. We could have sailed around the world almost four times or flown to the moon and back 30 times, but Senate Republicans have refused to even hold one hearing for Judge Merrick Garland.  By allowing this absurd political game to continue, Republicans are preventing the rest of us from upholding our constitutional duty to consider the Supreme Court nominee. Senate Republicans will not say that their historic obstruction is because they are opposed to Judge Garland; they are just refusing to consider him, even though many Republicans have met with him and admitted that Judge Garland's distinguished career and work history show that he is, without a doubt, someone who deserves fair consideration by all of us here in the U.S. Senate. He deserves a hearing and a vote. I should add that by refusing to do their jobs and by saying they want to leave it to the next President, Republicans are telling the American people they would rather save the seat for their Presidential nominee to fill than give a strong nominee a fair hearing and a vote. We all know what that means.  This is far too important to the people of this country to hold off any longer. They have now seen the results of a short-handed Supreme Court with split decisions and continued uncertainty about important issues. The Court is now days away from beginning its October session. With every day that goes by and every Supreme Court decision that comes down without a full bench, the need for action is clearer and clearer. This gridlock and dysfunction that has dominated too much of our time and other work here in the Congress should be pushed aside right now. Republicans blocked the Zika emergency funding bill for 7 months, and the gridlock has once again brought us far too close to another manufacturing crisis--a government shutdown.  I hope Republicans will realize how ridiculous this partisan gridlock is. After 195 days of being one Justice short on the Supreme Court of the United States, I urge our colleagues to fulfill our constitutional responsibility, hold a hearing for Judge Merrick Garland, and give him a vote. We owe that to the people we represent, and it is simply the right thing to do.  Washington State families should have a voice. Families across America should have a voice. They have waited long enough--nearly 200 days--to have nine Justices serving on the highest Court in the land, and they deserve better.                   Shooting in Burlington, Washington  Mr. President, while I have the floor, I want to bring another issue to my colleagues' attention, and that is the anguish of the people in a community in my home State of Washington, the city of Burlington. This is yet another community that is hurting after another senseless act of violence in a mall--a shooting that left five people dead. This is a headline that has become all too common in our country.  I urge everyone listening today to keep the victims, their families, their friends, and their coworkers in their thoughts and prayers. I implore everyone in this Chamber to come together and address the scourge of gun violence that has devastated one too many communities once again. Enough is enough.  I thank the Presiding Officer and yield the floor.
