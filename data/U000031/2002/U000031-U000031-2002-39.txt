Speaker, I thank the gentleman from Florida for participating again tonight and for his leadership, which was certainly appreciated last week in committee.  Next I would like to yield to my friend, a member of the subcommittee that I chair, the Subcommittee on Telecommunications and the Internet, the gentleman from Nebraska (Mr. Terry).
