President, this past Sunday marked the beginning of National Crime Victims' Rights Week. We set this week aside each year to focus attention on the needs and rights of crime victims. I am pleased to takethis opportunity to introduce legislation with my good friend from Massachusetts, Senator Kennedy, and our cosponsors, Senators Corzine, Kerry, Murray, and Schumer. Our bill, the Crime Victims Assistance Act of 2003, represents the next step in our continuing efforts to afford dignity and recognition to victims of crime.  My involvement with crime victims began more than three decades ago when I served as State's Attorney in Chittenden County, VT, and witnessed first-hand the devastation of crime. I have worked ever since to ensure that the criminal justice system is one that respects the rights and dignity of victims of crime, rather than one that presents additional ordeals for those already victimized.  I am proud that Congress has been a significant part of the solution to provide victims with greater rights and assistance. Over the past two decades, Congress has passed several bills to this end. These bills have included: the Victims of Crime Act of 1984; the Victims' Bill of Rights of 1990; the Victims' Rights and Restitution Act of 1990; the Violence Against Women Act of 1994; the Mandatory Victims Restitution Act of 1996; the Victim Rights Clarification Act of 1997; the Crime Victims with Disabilities Awareness Act of 1998; the Victims of Trafficking and Violence Protection Act of 2000; the Victims of Terrorism Tax Relief Act of 2001; and the September 11th Victim Compensation Fund of 2001.  The legislation that we introduce today, the Crime Victims Assistance Act of 2003, builds upon this progress. It provides for comprehensive reform of the Federal law to establish enhanced rights and protections for victims of Federal crime. Among other things, our bill provides crime victims with the right to consult with the prosecution prior to detention hearings and the entry of plea agreements, and generally requires the courts to give greater consideration to the views and interests of the victim at all stages of the criminal justice process. Responding to concerns raised by victims of the Oklahoma City bombing, the bill provides standing for the prosecutor and the victim to assert the right of the victim to attend and observe the trial.  Assuring that victims are provided their statutorily guaranteed rights is a critical concern for all those involved in the administration of justice. Our bill would establish an administrative authority in the Department of Justice to receive and investigate victims' claims of unlawful or inappropriate action on the part of criminal justice and victims' service providers. Department of Justice employees who fail to comply with the law pertaining to the treatment of crime victims could face disciplinary sanctions, including suspension or termination of employment.  In addition to these improvements to the Federal system, the bill proposes several innovative new programs to help States provide better services to victims of State crimes. The bill authorizes technology grants for local authorities to develop state-of-the-art notification systems to keep victims informed of case developments and important dates. Grants would also be available to improve compliance with State victim's rights laws, encourage further experimentation with the community-based restorative justice model, streamline access to victim services through the use of case managers, and expand the capacity of victim service providers to serve victims with limited English proficiency.  Finally, the Crime Victims Assistance Act would improve the manner in which the Crime Victims Fund is managed and preserved. Most significantly, the bill would eliminate the annual cap on spending from the Fund, which has prevented millions of dollars of Fund deposits from reaching victims and supporting essential services. We should not be imposing artificial caps on VOCA spending while substantial unmet needs continue to exist. The Crime Victims Assistance Act would replace the cap with a self-regulating system, supported by crime victim groups, that would ensure the stability and protection of Fund assets, while allowing more money to be distributed for victim programs.  These are all matters that can be considered and enacted this year with a simple majority of both Houses of Congress. They need not overcome the delay and higher standards necessitated by proposing to amend the Constitution. They need not wait the hammering out of implementing legislation before making a difference in the lives of crime victims.  I have on several occasions noted my concern that we not dissipate the progress we could be making by focusing exclusively on efforts to amend the Constitution. Regretfully, many opportunities for progress have been squandered. One notable exception was the passage, as part of the USA PATRIOT Act of 2001, of several significant amendments to the Victims of Crime Act that Senator Kennedy and I had proposed in an earlier version of the Crime Victims Assistance Act. I am glad that we could get those important provisions signed into law, but we still have more to do.  I look forward to continuing to work with the Administration, victims groups, prosecutors, judges and other interested parties on how we can most effectively enhance the rights of victims of crime. Congress and State legislatures have become more sensitive to crime victims rights over the past 20 years and we have an opportunity to make additional, significant progress this year to provide the greater voice and rights that crime victims deserve. It is my hope that Democrats and Republicans, and supporters and opponents of the proposed constitutional amendment, will join in advancing the Crime Victims Assistance Act through Congress. We can make a difference in the lives of crime victims right now.  I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill and the section-by-section analysis be printed in the Record.  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in the Record, as follows:                                 S. 805       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of      the United States of America in Congress assembled,     SECTION 1.
