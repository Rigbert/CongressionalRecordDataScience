We don't know of anyone else who wished to speak on it, other than the manager of the bill.  I hope, if we can go into an extremely brief quorum call, we can come up with a time agreement very quickly.  Mr. McCONNELL. Mr. President, I hope we can move on with this very quickly.

The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.  Mr. McCONNELL. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for the quorum call be rescinded.
