Chairman, I yield myself such time as I may consume.  Mr. Chairman, I have not come to the well before. I have spoken from there. I want to impress upon the Members, I think this is a very important and perfidious amendment.  The House better come to its senses, those of us who are new and those of us who have been here. Ladies and gentleman of the House, this is serious business we are about. The American public sent us to do serious things. The American public expected of us responsibility. The American public expected us to think about what we are doing.  It is quite obvious that we, yes, have a new group elected that wants to have a revolution and does not like certain agencies in the Government of the United States. I understand that. That is a fair thing to come to Washington with, and it is fair to act to do away with those agencies. But let me tell you what is not fair: to come and attack those people who have been working on behalf of the policies this Congress adopted.  The gentleman from Ohio [Mr. Hoke] spoke earlier and made a totally inaccurate representation. He flashes around a paper. He would not yield to me. Yes, 6 to 12 AFT individuals. And he said it was for ATF. In fact the majority of people there were local law enforcement people from the South.
