 President, the Senate will have before it a series of amendments to the lands bill made by Senator Coburn. I rise to oppose specifically two of these amendments, amendment No. 683 and amendment No. 675, and I do so on behalf of myself and my friend and colleague from California, Senator Boxer.  These amendments would essentially throw out a legal settlement agreement concerning the restoration of the San Joaquin River. The settlement agreement ends 18 years of costly litigation. It is the product of 4 years of negotiation by the Bush administration, the State of California, dozens of water agencies, the Friant water users--it affects Friant, and Friant is a Division of the Central Valley Project and 15,000 farmers draw their water from this Division; it is big, it is important, it is critical--and by environmental and fishing groups.  This was a suit brought by the Natural Resources Defense Council against the Federal Government saying that what was happening at Friant Dam was not sufficient in the release of water to protect the salmon.  I wish to have printed in the Record at the end of my remarks a letter by the Governor of the State of California, Arnold Schwarzenegger, supporting the settlement agreement, and a letter from the U.S. Department of Justice supporting the settlement agreement. I also commend to my colleagues a Congressional Research Service Memorandum entitled ``Institutional and Economic Context of the San Joaquin River Restoration Settlement,'' spelling out the institutional and economic context of this settlement agreement.
