 Again, briefly, I was not going to ask it, but I am constrained to ask it. Is there any chance, Mr. Leader, that we will be able to consider the Labor-Health bill on the floor? It is the only appropriation bill, as you well know, that we have not passed through the House. We have done the other 10.  Do you have any expectation that that bill might be on the floor either next week or the week thereafter?  I yield to my friend.
