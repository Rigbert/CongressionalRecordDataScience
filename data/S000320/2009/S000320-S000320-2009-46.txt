 President, I rise today with great concern regarding the nomination of Mr. David Ogden to serve as the Deputy Attorney General of the United States. There is no doubt that Mr. Ogden has a long record of legal experience. He also, however, brings a long history of representation of the pornography industry and the opposition to laws designed to protect children from sexual exploitation.  He opposed the Children's Internet Protection Act of 2000 that would restrict children's exposure to explicit online content. Mr. Ogden filed an amicus brief supporting the American Library Association in a case that challenged mandatory anti-obscenity Internet filters in public libraries. He treated pornography like informative data, writing that the ``imposition of mandatory filtering on public libraries impairs the ability of librarians to fulfill the purposes of public libraries--namely, assisting library patrons in their quest for information. . . .''  Mr. Ogden also argued against laws requiring pornography producers to verify that models were over 18 at the time their materials were made. Think of that. He challenged the Child Protection and Obscenity Enforcement Act of 1988 and a companion law adopted in 1990, the Child Protection Restoration and Penalties Enhancement Act. Mr. Ogden argued that requiring pornography producers to personally verify that their models were over age 18 would ``burden too heavily and infringe too deeply on the right to produce First Amendment-protected material.''  Among the many cases in which Mr. Ogden has advocated interests of the pornography industry, none is more egregious than the position he took in Knox v. the United States.  The facts in the next case are straightforward. Steven Knox was convicted of receiving and possessing child pornography under the Child Protection Act after the U.S. Customs Service found in Mr. Knox's apartment several videotapes of partially clothed girls, some as young as age 10, posing suggestively. Serving as counsel on an ACLU effort, Mr. Ogden argued to strike down the 1992 conviction of Mr. Knox. On behalf of the ACLU and other clients, Mr. Ogden submitted a Supreme Court brief advocating the same statutory and constitutional positions as the Clinton Justice Department. Mr. Ogden's arguments stated that while nudity was a requirement for prosecution, nudity alone was insufficient for prosecutions under child pornography statutes. Put simply, Mr. Ogden argued that the defendant had been improperly convicted because the materials in his possession would only qualify as child pornography if children's body parts were indecently exposed.  In response, on November 3, 1993, the Senate, right here, passed a resolution by a vote of 100 to 0 condemning this interpretation of the law by Mr. Ogden. President Clinton then publicly rebuked the Solicitor General, and Attorney General Reno overturned his position. Now the Senate is being asked to confirm as Deputy Attorney General someone who advocated the same extreme position on a Federal child pornography statute that the Senate unanimously repudiated 16 years ago.  The Supreme Court has ``recognized that there is a compelling interest in protecting the physical and psychological well-being of minors. This interest extends to shielding minors from the influence of literature that is not obscene by adult standards.'' Pornography should not be regarded as immune from regulation simply because it is deemed ``free speech.''  Furthermore, child pornography in any form should not be tolerated. How can Mr. Ogden's clear position on the right to unfettered access to pornography not interfere with the Justice Department's responsibility to protect children from obscene material and exploitation?  When asked about this very issue at the Senate hearing on his nomination, Mr. Ogden said he hoped he would not be judged by arguments made for clients. If we cannot judge him on his past positions, what can we judge him on? Past performance is a great indicator of future action.  David Ogden is more than just a lawyer who has had a few unsavory clients. He has devoted a substantial part of his career, case after case for 20 years, in defense of pornography. Ogden has profited from representing pornographers and in attacking legislation designed to ban child pornography. Should a man with a long list of pornographers as past clients, with arecord of objection to attempts to regulate this industry in order to protect our children, be confirmed for our Nation's second highest law enforcement position? Is he the best choice to actively identify and prosecute those who seek to harm our children?  Highlights of the Department of Justice's budget request for the year 2010 indicate an increased focus on educating and rehabilitating criminals, while neglecting funding for vital child-safety programs such as the Adam Walsh Act. I believe Mr. Ogden's past positions, coupled with the Department's growing trend to prioritize criminal rehabilitation over child safety, cause me great concern this afternoon.  There is not a quick and easy solution to the problems of child exploitation, but I can state unequivocally that we need a proactive and aggressive Department of Justice to take the steps necessary to attack this problem and demonstrate that protecting our children is a top priority. I am not certain David Ogden will bring that leadership to the Department; therefore, I must oppose this nomination.  This vote is made with the belief that a person's past legal positions do mean a great deal. I think if most Americans knew what this man has worked for and whom he has willingly represented, support for his nomination would disappear. I do not believe his legal philosophy, illustrated in the clients he freely chose to represent, reflects the majority's views on the issue of child exploitation. I know certainly they do not reflect mine.                           Tragedy in Alabama
