 I am speaking of Heimerdinger Cutlery, a family-owned business that celebrates 150 years as a Louisville institution this month. Heimerdinger was first listed in the Louisville city directory in 1861 as ``A. Heimerdinger: Cutler and Sewing Machine Repair.''  In the 150 years since, Heimerdinger Cutlery has become one of Louisville's premier shops for kitchen and pocket knives, scissors, shaving needs, sharpening stones, magnifiers and many other items as well as a first stop for learning about blade quality. It is one of the oldest family-owned cutlery stores in the Nation.  Heimerdinger Cutlery celebrated its 150th anniversary with a special ceremony and ribbon cutting earlier this month in Louisville, kicking off a week-long celebration event for its customers. This celebration included a special promotion honoring America's servicemen and women.  Residents of the Louisville area were also able to meet and learn from one of the editors of Knife World Newspaper, who came to Heimerdinger Cutlery to assess the value of older, collectible knives and sign books. Heimerdinger Cutlery also celebrated its anniversary with products from another Louisville institution, Louisville Stoneware.  Heimerdinger Cutlery is currently owned and operated by two proud Louisvillians, Carl and Glenna Heimerdinger, who carry on the family business started in 1861 by Carl's great-great grandfather August Heimerdinger, originally born in Germany. When August started the company, he focused on scissors, butcher knives and sewing machine repair.  Over the years, Heimerdinger Cutlery expanded into barber and beauty supplies and secured the original patent on grass shears. In 1996, to celebrate their 135th anniversary, Heimerdinger Cutlery had a ``Hanging of the Shears Day,'' and placed a 6-foot-long, 70-pound, working pair of shears on display in their store.  I congratulate Carl and Glenna Heimerdinger for the success of their Louisville institution. Businesses like theirs are the reason the city of Louisville and the Commonwealth of Kentucky will continue to thrive and grow. Here's hoping for many more years of success to Heimerdinger Cutlery of Louisville.                          ____________________
