 Lynn and asked him two questions: Who at Dayton--that means the financial center at Dayton--had knowledge of the Castle Air Force Base report on Miller? Who in the finance center management was responsible for totally ignoring this very dangerous red warning flag? I ended my letter to Mr. Lynn this way:       Bill, the responsible person or persons in your      organization need to be held accountable for ignoring obvious      and repeated warning signals about SSGT Miller's      trustworthiness and giving him unrestricted access to your      department's money vault.  I asked for answers to these two questions by September 23, 1998. That would have been 5 days after I wrote the letter. None ever arrived, as far as I know.  When I did not get a prompt response to my January 19 letter to Mr. Lynn on straight pay, I raised those same issues with Secretary Cohen. I did that at a hearing before the Budget Committee on March 2, 1999. This is what Secretary Cohen said at the time:       There is no authorized procedure called Straight Pay.  Now, get that. You have straight pay that people talk about, and you have a Secretary of Defense saying there is no authorized procedure called straight pay.       The process described is not correct and is not authorized.  These answers do not square with the evidence I have tried to lay out.  Then, on March 9, came further explanation from Chief Financial Officer Lynn. He said essentially the same thing but with a slightly different twist:       The Straight Pay policy you refer to in your letter is not      used at our Columbus Center. . . .  There are some words left out. It goes on to say:       ``Straight Pay,'' as reported to you, does not exist at the      Columbus Center.  This letter No. 10 explains that in great detail, and I ask unanimous consent to have printed in the Record letter No. 10.  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in the Record, as follows:                                   Under Secretary of Defense,                                    Washington, DC, March 9, 1999.     Hon. Charles B. Grassley,     U.S. Senate,     Washington, DC.       Dear Senator Grassley: This is in reply to your recent      letter on my decision to raise the prevalidation dollar      threshold for payments of contracts paid using the      Mechanization of Contract Administration System (MOCAS) at      the Defense Finance and Accounting Service (DFAS) Columbus      Center.       In the prevalidation plan that we submitted to Congress, we      stated we would gradually lower the threshold until all      payments were prevalidated by July 2000. We took an      aggressive approach in our attempt to reach the goal of 100      percent prevalidation before July 2000. Contracts awarded      before FY 1997 are now prevalidated at the current statutory      level of $1,000,000. Since March 1997, we have attempted to      prevalidate all contracts above $2,500 that were issued in FY      1997 and later.       Unfortunately, we could not sustain the new prevalidation      level in MOCAS and meet our obligations under the Prompt      Payment Act. The imposition of the $2,500 prevalidation      threshold, together with other factors, caused critical      delays in our connector payments. In December 1998, after      carefully considering the need to reduce our payment backlogs      while complying with the Prompt Payment Act, I temporarily      raised the prevalidation dollar threshold to $500,000 for      centrally administered contracts paid through MOCAS. I also      recently extended this threshold increase until June 1999.      However, we still plan to meet our July 2000 goal to      prevalidate all payments. We will continue to lower the      prevalidation threshold, but at a deliberate pace to achieve      our goal     of prevalidating all payments by July 2000 and ensuring      compliance with the Prompt Payment Act.       The ``Straight Pay'' policy you refer to in your letter is      not used at our Columbus Center. Before a payment is made in      Columbus using MOCAS, the system must have entries that      validate a contract exists, an invoice has been presented,      and goods or services have been received or accepted.      Increasing the prevalidation threshold does not waive the      requirement to have these items before a payment is made. In      addition, MOCAS does not allow one person to enter all three      data elements into the system. I have enclosed a description      of the MOCAS payment process. I believe that after you review      our contract payment process, you will agree that some      critical elements of the process were not provided to you and      that ``Straight Pay,'' as reported to you, does not exist at      the Columbus Center.       You also expressed concern that with the threshold raised      to $500,000, DFAS experience the same type of fraud in MOCAS      that SSgt Miller perpetuated using the Integrated Accounts      Payable System (IAPS) in Dayton. The MOCAS payment      environment is significantly different from the IAPS      environment. The MOCAS system architecture does not permit      multiple levels of access. The internal controls built into      MOCAS that force separations of functions all but eliminate      the possibility of one person creating fraudulent payments.       I am still committed to reaching the goal of total      prevalidation by July 2000. As we improve our systems      capability, we will combine to aggressively reduce the      threshold until all payments are prevalidated. I appreciate      your interest and look forward to working with you to improve      our operations.           Sincerely,                                                  William J. Lynn.
