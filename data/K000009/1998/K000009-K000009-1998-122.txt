Speaker, I rise today to honor a very special constituent and friend of mine, Ohio Supreme Court Justice Alice Robie Resnick, on the occasion of the Ohio Women's Bar Association's creation of its highest award for professional excellence in her name. It gives me great pleasure to wish Justice Resnick my warmest congratulations on this truly special occasion.  Alice Robie Resnick was the fourth woman to be elected to statewide office in Ohio when elected to the Supreme Court of Ohio in 1988. She has been extremely dedicated to improving the legal profession, the judiciary and assisting the status of women in Ohio during her thirty year career as a lawyer and judge.  In December, 1991, Justice Resnick, along with U.S. Magistrate Judge Patricia Hemann and Cleveland attorney Pamela Hultin, initiated the formation of the Ohio Women's Bar Association. The Ohio Women' Bar Association is the only statewide bar association within Ohio solely dedicated toward advancing the interests of women attorneys while encouraging the networking and creation of a statewide mentor program for women attorneys.  In recognition for Justice Resnick's education, professional endeavors and commitment as a leader in the legal field in Ohio, and award in her name. This award will be bestowed upon a deserving attorney for each year to follow.  On May 8, 1998, Ohio Women's Bar Association President Kirsti S. Talikka will be presenting Justice Resnick with the Ohio Women's Bar Association's Justice Alice Robie Resnick Award of Distinction, at its annual meeting in Dayton, Ohio.  It gives me great pleasure to rise today, Mr. Speaker, and join the OWBA in congratulating Justice Resnick and wishing her continued success.                          ____________________
