The vacancy rate we reduced from 10 percent at the end of President Clinton's term to less than four percent in 2008 has now risen back to over 10 percent. In contrast to the sharp reduction in vacancies we made during President Bush's first 2 years when the Democratically controlled Senate confirmed 100 of his judicial nominations, only 60 of President Obama's judicial nominations were allowed to be considered and confirmed during his first 2 years. We have not kept up with the rate of attrition, let alone brought the vacancies down significantly.  By now, judicial vacancies should have been cut in half, but they have not been. Unlike in the first 2 years of President Bush's first term when with a Democratic majority the Senate reduced vacancies from 110 to 60, judicial vacancies topped 90 in August 2009 and have remained above that level ever since. After tonight's confirmation, they will still number 95, putting at risk the ability of Americans to have a fair hearing in Court.  The Senate must do better. The Nation cannot afford further delays by the Senate in taking action on the nominations pending before it. Judicial vacancies on courts throughout the country hinder the Federal judiciary's ability to fulfill its constitutional role. They create a backlog of cases that prevents people from having their day in court. This is unacceptable.  We can consider and confirm this President's nominations to the Federalbench in a timely manner. President Obama has worked with Democratic and Republican home state Senators to identify superbly qualified, consensus nominations. The nominations on the Executive Calendar should not be controversial. They all have the support of their home State Senators, Republicans and Democrats. All have a strong commitment to the rule of law and a demonstrated faithfulness to the Constitution.  During President Bush's first term, his first four tumultuous years in office, we proceeded to confirm 205 of his judicial nominations. We confirmed 100 of those during the 17 months I was chairman during President Bush's first 2 years in office and by this date in President Bush's third year had confirmed 110. So far in President Obama's third year in office, the Senate has only been allowed to consider 73 of his Federal circuit and district court nominees. We remain well short of the benchmark we set during the Bush administration. When we approach it we can reduce vacancies from the historically high levels at which they have remained throughout these first three years of the Obama administration to the historically low level we reached toward the end of the Bush administration.  I have thanked the ranking Republican on the Judiciary Committee, Senator Grassley, for his cooperation this year. I was pleased to see him taking credit for what he called ``our rapid pace.'' I was encouraged by his commitment to ``continue to move consensus nominees through the confirmation process.'' My friend from Iowa is fond of pointing to the vacancies for which there are not nominees. Of course, some of that is attributable to a lack of cooperation by certain home state Senators with the White House. Nonetheless, I agree with the Senator from Iowa that we can do little about confirming nominations we do not have before us. What we can do is proceed expeditiously with the qualified nominations the President has sent to the Senate.  In that regard, I would temper my friend's extolling our achievements this year by observing that every judge confirmed so far this year could and should have been confirmed last year. Every one of them was unanimously reported last year and would have been confirmed had Republicans not objected and created a new rule of obstruction after midterm elections. We have long had the ``Thurmond rule'' to describe how Senator Thurmond shut down the confirmation process in advance of the 1980 presidential election. Last year's shutdown was something new. I cannot remember a time when so many consensus nominees were left without Senate action at the midterm point of a Presidency. That new level of obstruction has contributed to our being so far behind and judicial vacancies having been perpetuated at so high a level for too long.  I thank Chief Judge Lamberth for his efforts on behalf of his Court, on behalf of the people of the District of Columbia, and on behalf of our justice system. The American justice system is not some discretionary luxury. It serves an essential function in our democracy. I thank all the women and men who work every day in our courts to guarantee justice for the American people.  I am glad that Amy Jackson's wait is finally over and congratulate her and her family on her confirmation.                               Exhibit 1                                       U.S. District Court for the                                         District of Columbia,                                 Washington, DC, November 4, 2010.     Re Judicial Vacancies--United States District Court for the          District of Columbia.     Hon. Harry Reid,     Majority Leader, U.S. Senate, The Capitol, Washington, DC.     Hon. Mitch McConnell,     Minority Leader, U.S. Senate, The Capitol, Washington, DC.       Dear Senator Reid and Senator McConnell: On behalf of the      judges of the United States District Court for the District      of Columbia, I request that the Senate act soon to fill the      vacancies that exist at our Court.       Of our 15 authorized judgeships, we currently have four      vacancies. One has been vacant since January 2007. With the      additional vacancy that will result from Judge Ricardo M.      Urbina's assumption of senior status, effective January 31,      2011, this Court faces the prospect of having only 10 of its      15 authorized judgeships filled. The severe impact of this      situation already is being felt and will only increase over      time. The challenging caseload that our Court regularly      handles includes many involving national security issues, as      well as other issues of national significance. A large number      of these complex, high-profile cases demand significant time      and attention from each of our judges.       Without a complement of new judges, it is difficult to      foresee how our remaining active judges will be able to keep      up with the heavy volume of cases that faces us. A 33 percent      vacancy ratio is quite extraordinary.       Two nominees (Beryl Howell and Robert Wilkins) have been      reported out of the Senate Judiciary Committee and await      floor votes; two nominees (James Boasberg and Amy Jackson)      have had their hearings and hopefully will soon be reported      out of Committee.       We hope the Senate will act quickly to fill this Court's      vacancies so the citizens of the District of Columbia and the      Federal Government and other litigants who appear before us      continue to enjoy the high quality of justice they deserve.           Sincerely,                                                Royce C. Lamberth,                                                      Chief Judge.
