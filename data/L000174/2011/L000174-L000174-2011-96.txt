At the age of 17 years, 4 months, and 13 days, Kristen Kelliher became the youngest female to climb the highest peaks in all 48 States in the continental United States. Her journey began in 2002 as she and her family started climbing during family vacations. Soon she progressed to scaling the tops of America's most challenging peaks, including Mount Hood and Mount Rainer. Along the way, she endured injuries and logistical setbacks, but she never let those stop her from reaching her goal. She saved the best for last. Surrounded by 30 family members on a sunny September day, she summited Vermont's Mount Mansfield, in Stowe. She is a dynamic role model to all Vermonters, young and old.  Along with excelling on the hiking trails, Kristen is also an honor student and a three-sport athlete. She plans to graduate early and climb the last two peaks--Hawaii's Mauna Kea, and Alaska's Mount McKinley--next year. Kristen is modest when praised about her achievement and says she only hopes to inspire others to reach goals they once thought unattainable. Vermonters are proud to recognize Kristen Kelliher's strength, skill and stamina, and we congratulate her on this great accomplishment. I ask unanimous consent to have printed in the Record an article about her achievement, from The Boston Globe.  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in the Record, as follows:                 [From the Boston Globe, Oct. 14, 2011]                     Climbing Into the Record Book                          (By Josephe P. Kahn)       Norwich, VT.--On a warm, sunny afternoon last month,      Kristen Kelliher hiked to the top of Mount Mansfield, the      highest point in her home state of Vermont. Accompanied by 30      family members and friends, she was greeted at the summit by      a banner celebrating her achievement, one that landed      Kelliher in the record books.       That day, at age 17 years, 4 months, and 13 days, she      became the youngest female to ``highpoint''--stand atop the      highest peak--in all 48 states in the continental United      States.       Climbing Mount Mansfield, all 4,393 feet of it, was a piece      of cake, though, compared with what Kelliher accomplished      this year. Beginning in June, she conquered three peaks that      rank among America's most challenging: Oregon's Mount Hood,      Montana's Granite Peak, and Washington's Mount Rainier, whose      imposing height (14,410 feet) and treacherous weather      conditions make any ascent risky.       The previous female record holder, Danielle Birrer, was 18      years, 4 days old when she set the record in 2000. In all,      only 404 climbers of any age or gender have achieved the 48-     state feat, according to the Highpointers Club, a Colorado      organization that compiles such statistics.       In the meantime, Kelliher has set her sights on Hawaii and      Alaska--and an even more exclusive club, the 50-staters. Of      its 214 members, fewer than 15 are female.       ``I've wanted to do this since I was 9,'' Kelliher said in      an interview at the high school she attends across the      Vermont border in Hanover, N.H., where she is in her senior      year. A three-sport athlete and honors student, Kelliher was      preparing to play in a varsity field hockey game.       Inspired by an article about a record-setting 12-year-old      male highpointer, Kelliher, who has been hiking and skiing      all her life, decided to try for the girls' record at an age      when many girls might consider hiking more of a chore than a      challenge.       ``I'm kind of competitive. OK, a lot,'' Kelliher said,      breaking into smile. ``It sounded like a cool goal. I      thought, I could do that, too.''       Her climb into the record books has not been uneventful,      uninterrupted, inexpensive, or worry-free, however,      particularly on her family's part.       Conquering Rainier in July took three attempts, each with      its own challenges. Her first expedition--accompanied by her      stepfather, Bill Bender, a solar-energy company owner, and      led by a professional guide team--ended in disappointment.      After returning to base camp, Kelliher learned that while her      group had technically ``summited,'' they had stopped short of      reaching Rainier's actual highpoint, because of bad weather.      The mountain's true highpoint, known as Columbia Crest, was a      40-minute round trip from where her party turned around, even      though the group received papers certifying that they had      summited.       It took two more attempts, each costing several hundred      dollars in guide fees and equipment rentals, for Kelliher to      cross Washington off her list: number 46, and counting.       "I was so upset,'' she recalled of the stomach-sinking      moment when she found she had fallen short. ``If I am going      for a record, I have to get to the top. Technically, nobody      would have known. But morally it wasn't quite right.''       Her stepfather says it's in her nature to persevere where      others might not.       ``Mentally as well as physically, Kristen's very tough,''      he said. Climbing Mount Hood, Kelliher incurred painfully      swollen shins that stayed unhealed through her first Rainier      climb. ``You never heard her complain, though'' Bender said.      Instead, Kelliher grew even more determined after other      climbers seemed doubtful she could make it up Rainier,      period, potentially forcing them to turn back, too.       What has recently become a celebration of one teen's      extraordinary feat is also a family saga, one that has taken      Kelliher, her parents, and three siblings to remote corners      of America that few seek out, much less scale with backpacks      and ice axes.       Their first conquest happened almost by accident, on a 2002      cross-country road trip, when the family hiked up South      Dakota's Harney Peak. Highpointing wasn't even in their      vocabulary yet.       In 2004, urged on by Kelliher, they began targeting other      states more systematically. First came New England (all      except Vermont, which she saved for last), then six mid-     Atlantic states. An 18-state odyssey in 2005 took them      through the Deep South, Midwest, and Southwest. In 2006, they      knocked off 11 more states. In most cases, the family--     including Kelliher's older brother, Ryan, now 19, and two      half-brothers, Billy, 10, and Danny, 7--drove from state to      state, camping along the way and hiking together up all but      the steepest peaks.       ``This trip has taken places we just wouldn't have gone to      otherwise,'' said her mother, Mary Bender, a pediatrician.      Asked whether her daughter's quest to set a record had been      their driving force, she nodded and laughed. ``Although I      will say that if Kristen had set out to see every shopping      mall in America, that wouldn't have worked for us.''       Only once, in June 2006, did the family highpoint twice      (Illinois and Indiana) in a single day. States like Florida,      whose 345-foot highpoint, Britton Hill, is America's lowest,      were no challenge at all. Five, including Rhode Island, never      rise above 900 feet.       On the other extreme are 11 state highpoints soaring 11,000      feet and higher, many of which are difficult to access.      Wyoming's Gannett Peak, for instance, which Kelliher and      Bender climbed in August 2010, is reachable only by a 46-mile      round trip hike. Lugging backpacks crammed with climbing      equipment and camping gear, the two spent six long days      getting to the top and back.       Highpoints, said Bill Bender, ``are all kind of weird in      their own way. You have to be a little eccentric to do      this.'' He has never calculated the overall cost of their      highpointing excursions, which until recently have been      budgeted as ordinary family vacations. However, flying to the      last few Western states and paying for guides and equipment      have nudged their spending into ``the many thousands. I'm not      sure we want to know the total. Except for the last handful,      though, it's been fairly inexpensive.''       Tim Webb, president of the 3,000-member Highpointers Club,      says his organization attracts a diverse mix of hikers,      wilderness backpackers, and serious mountaineers, each with      different objectives.       ``We get a broad spectrum, including lots of families who      plan vacations around highpointing,'' Webb notes.      Accumulating even 40 states, for which his club awards a      special pin, is ``a pretty significant accomplishment,'' he      adds.       Early on, the Benders were unsure Kelliher would remain      interested in pursuing all 48. By 2007, Kelliher having      completed 10 trips and 42 highpoints, only two Eastern      states, New York and Vermont, were left. Then came a two-year      hiatus.       ``Kristen was still growing, and she needed to grow into      the bigger mountains,'' her stepfather recalled.       She began last year taller, stronger, and more resolute      than ever. ``If I wanted to do this [set the record],''      Kelliher said, ``I knew I'd have to start moving.''       Now it's on to 50, and another possible age record. Next      February, after completing high school a semester early,      Kelliher will tackle Hawaii's 13,796-foot Mauna Kea, a      relatively easy climb. Last is Alaska's 20,320-foot Mount      McKinley (also known as Denali), the most challenging of all.      For every 1,000 climbers who go up, three fail to make it      down alive.       Kelliher has signed with a guide team for next May and will      pay for the trip's $17,000 cost herself. Already filling out      college applications, she's looking for corporate sponsorship      or grant money to help.       ``It's definitely scary,'' her mother said. ``If Kristen      can figure out how to fund it, in her 17-year-old way, I      won't stop her, though. And if she can't, well, then I don't      have to worry about her being killed in an avalanche.''       Kelliher says she will not be discouraged if her group      fails to conquer Denali.       Yet if she succeeds, it just might inspire another fourth-     grader to work harder--and climb higher--to achieve goals she      once thought were unreachable.                          ____________________
