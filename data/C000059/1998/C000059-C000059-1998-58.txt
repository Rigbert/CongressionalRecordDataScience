Now, I know from my experience in the restaurant industry, many restaurants today are fast food establishments, and if you are adding that restaurant to the component, which I believe it is, I suspect that the number of dining restaurants, sit-down establishments is much lower than the number that is being thrown out here today.  I point out another subject. When I was in the restaurant business, I paid ASCAP and BMI fees because I had live entertainment, and I used to tape music. So if I used FM radio on the interim, it would not have raised my BMI or ASCAP fees at all.  But those restaurants that just have FM radio, public access, and television, which are very few, by the way, it seems to me the only reason that we pursue the Sensenbrenner amendment and not the McCollum amendment.  From my perspective, real estate companies who have background music, or you mentioned dentists' offices, moving around to pursue collecting fees from these businesses is, I think, poor business on their part, but certainly intrusive to all small business.  I would encourage everyone here to vote against the McCollum amendment and vote for Sensenbrenner.
