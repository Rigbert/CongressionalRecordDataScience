Speaker, on behalf of Rep. John Conyers and myself, I wish to extend our thanks and gratitude to Lynn Alcock, who is retiring this week after over 30 years of service as the calendar clerk on the House Judiciary Committee. Lynn has served admirably chairmen from both political parties, beginning with Chairman Peter Rodino and staying through the chairmanships of Jack Brooks, Henry Hyde, and now my three-plus years. These chairmen, I believe, came to the same conclusion I did: Lynn is a tremendous asset who cannot be replaced.  Lynn hails from the Buckeye State of Ohio and began her congressional service in April of 1969 at the American Law Division of the Congressional Research Service, a nonpartisan congressional research arm of the Library of Congress. Three years later, Lynn began working for House Information Resources before coming to her job ``home'' since December of 1973--the House Judiciary Committee.  Lynn is one of only a few who have worked for the House Judiciary Committee during both the impeachment of President Nixon and the impeachment of President Clinton. Her efforts making the Committee's work on these events available to the public will be particularly helpful to historians and scholars interested in these important events.  Mr. Speaker, Lynn has served the House Judiciary Committee, the Congress, and the American people for over 30 years with dedication, excellence, and integrity. We thank her and know that she will be missed.                          ____________________
