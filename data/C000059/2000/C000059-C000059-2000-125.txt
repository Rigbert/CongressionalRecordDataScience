Speaker, today I commend the ``all volunteer'' Riverside National Cemetery Support Committee. President Dwight D. Eisenhower once remarked that, ``Whatever America hopes to bring to pass in the world must first come to pass in the heart of America.'' The volunteerism shown by the Cemetery Support Committee, for the past 22 years, is a prime model of President Eisenhower's belief.  The Cemetery Support Committee was established in 1978 with a simple mission, but one with heart behind it, to preserve and enhance the Riverside National Cemetery as a National Shrine. What has come to pass is no less than amazing.  The Riverside National Cemetery is currently the second largest resting place in our national cemetery system, with 125,000 men and women of our armed forces standing silent vigil with us today. Ten short years into the new millennium, it is expected to be the largest cemetery in the national system. And in six decades it will have more than 1.4 million honored veterans. That will make Riverside National Cemetery larger than the Arlington National Cemetery--the most widely recognized, which is already at capacity with a quarter of a million veterans.  The Cemetery Support Committee's work has made Riverside National Cemetery much more than the facts stated above--they have created a solemn historical place where Americans today and tomorrow can go to reflect upon the memory and sacrifices of past and present generations who fought for America, democracy and freedom. Four to five thousand people each Memorial Day and Veterans Day attend ceremonies organized by the Committee and held at the Riverside NationalCemetery. They have raised private funds to purchase numerous items for the beautification of the cemetery, such as flower cones used at the Veterans' grave-sites by family and loved ones. Fund-raising has also been undertaken for the procurement and site construction of memorials to be placed in the cemetery--the most recent being the Veterans Memorial dedicated on May 27, 2000; and future ones being POW/MIA, Chapliancy Corp. and Medics & Corpsmen memorials.  Those who have worked so selflessly to create a place that is, as the Cemetery Support Committee likes to say, ``inspiring and stimulating our youth to become worthy citizens of this great country,'' have devoted their hearts to making the Riverside National Cemetery the National Shrine that it is today and well into tomorrow. I would like to take a moment to specifically recognize the current Board Members of the Cemetery Support Committee. They are: Jewel Beck, 1995; Paul Adkins, Chairman, 1998; Tom Hohmann, Secretary, 1992; Alta Marlin, Vice Chairwoman, 1989; Gery Porter, Treasurer, 1995; Walt Schiller, 1978; Judith Stemberg, 1989; Mike Warren, 1992; John Campbell, 1982; Guenther Griebau, 1999; Carolyn Jaeggli, 1986; Audrey Peterson, 1994; Elsie Porter, 1985; Pat Smith, 1998; and James Valdez, 1978.  Therefore, Mr. Speaker, I will close by asking that each American awake each day dedicated to giving back to our families, friends, communities and nation as the Riverside National Cemetery Support Committee has done. As a people we must ``never forget'' those who have died and fought to make America great. God bless you and God bless America.                          ____________________
