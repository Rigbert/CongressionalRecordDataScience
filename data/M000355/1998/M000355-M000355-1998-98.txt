 President, finally, let me thank Senator Leahy for his cooperation and friendship as we put this bill together. In addition to thanking my friend and colleague, Senator Leahy, I also want to express my appreciation to Tim Rieser, Cara Thanassi, and J.P. Dowd of Senator Leahy's staff, and Steven Cortese and Jennifer Chartrand of the full committee, and Billy Piper, Shannon Bishop on my staff, and my long time foreign policy advisor, Robin Cleveland, as well as Senator Stevens. Thanks to all of these people for their participation in the development of this legislation.
