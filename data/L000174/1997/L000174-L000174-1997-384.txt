President, there has been a lot of discussion, just now again, quoting Judge Silberman. What is needed--I would note, he wrote to the distinguished chairman, Senator Hatch, and said that we should have 11 active judges. We talk about this as though the nominee was going to be the 12th judge. In fact, the nominee is the 11th judge.  I ask unanimous consent that a letter dated March 4, 1997, by Judge Silberman, in which he said, ``. . . I still believe that we should have 11 active judges,'' be printed in the Record at this point.  There being no objection, the letter was ordered to be printed in the Record, as follows:                                            U.S. Court of Appeals,                                 District of Columbia Circuit,                                    Washington, DC, March 4, 1997.     Hon. Orrin G. Hatch,     Dirksen Senate Office Building,     Washington DC.       Dear Chairman Hatch: You asked me yesterday for my view as      to whether this court needs 11 active judges and whether I      would be willing to communicate that view to other senators      of your committee. As I told you, my opinion on this matter      has not changed since I testified before Senator Grassley's      subcommittee in 1995. I said then, and I still believe, that      we should have 11 active judges.       On the other hand, I then testified and still believe we do      not need and should not have 12 judges. Indeed, given the      continued decline in our caseload since I testified, I      believe that the case for a 12th judge at any time in the      foreseeable future is almost frivolous. As you know, since I      testified, Judge Buckley has taken senior status and sits      part-time, and I will be eligible to take senior status in      only three years. That is why I     continue to advocate the elimination of the 12th judgeship.           Sincerely,                                            Laurence H. Silberman,                                               U.S. Circuit Judge.
