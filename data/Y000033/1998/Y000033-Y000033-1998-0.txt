Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent to take from the Speaker's table the Senate concurrent resolution (S. Con. Res. 129) to correct a technical error in the enrollment of H.R. 3910, and ask for its immediate consideration in the House.  The Clerk read the title of the Senate concurrent resolution.
