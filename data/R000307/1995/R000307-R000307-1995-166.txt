Chairman, I thank the gentleman for yielding.  Mr. Chairman, I would like for all colleagues to return with me now as we return to the not so thrilling days of yesteryear, when out of the past came the thundering hoofbeats of one horse and one gentleman astride that horse; that is, the unfunded mandates horse. He was the Lone Ranger, and that is the gentleman from California [Mr. Condit].  He formed a group that was a lonely posse. There were several of us that were riding shotgun with him. We told him to be careful, just like Miss Kitty always tells me when I leave Dodge City, ``Pat, be careful,'' but he was not careful. He forged ahead and he was aggressive. He told the Big Seven it was not really good enough. He did not get a lot of encouragement.  Mr. Chairman, I quite frankly did not think we could get this job done, but the gentleman from California [Mr. Condit] really persevered, so I want to pay him a great deal of tribute. I am allegedly the co-chairman of the Unfunded Mandates Caucus, but he was the foreman, and he did all the work, so I thank the gentleman from California [Mr. Condit].
