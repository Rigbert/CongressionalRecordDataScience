I thank you very much. And I think you very correctly pointed out how important it is to stay positive, and Dr. Roe certainly did the same, especially bringing his expertise as a medical doctor to this very important fight for human rights and for protection of both the mother and the child. So I thank them both for their contributions.  And I yield to Dr. Broun now such time as he might consume.
