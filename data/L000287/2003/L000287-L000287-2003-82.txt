Mr. Speaker, I rise really to express my deep appreciation for both the gentleman from Missouri (Mr. Skelton) and the gentleman from California (Mr. Hunter) for the fabulous job they do on behalf of the men and women who make up our Armed Forces. The gentleman from California (Mr. Hunter) and I have talked about the fact that I am very proud at this moment in our history to have the privilege to chair the subcommittee of appropriations that does the funding for the men and women who are now serving us overseas.  This evening we will have before us a budget that is probably the finest budget in terms of national security that I have seen in all the years I have been in Congress, and we will have the opportunity in that budget to express our strong support for those men and women who are doing this work on our behalf and on behalf of freedom in the Middle East this evening.  But particularly relative to this resolution are these two gentlemen, the gentleman from Missouri (Mr. Skelton) and the gentleman from California (Mr. Hunter), who have come together to provide a vehicle for us to express our deep appreciation, our deepest appreciation, for the work that they are about. Indeed, it is America's challenge to preserve freedom and provide leadership for freedom in the world. The men and women who are serving us this evening who we are praising by way of this resolution are right at the point of the strength of America as we go out carrying forward that responsibility we have to be the world's force for peace as well as for freedom. I thank them so much for what they are doing.  I appreciate the gentleman yielding me this time.
