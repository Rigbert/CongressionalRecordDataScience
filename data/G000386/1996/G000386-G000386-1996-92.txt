 But I want to take time to respond to the sadness he expressed that organizations like the National Taxpayers Union would be concerned about the waste in this bill, as they see it and as I see it, the fact that we should not have corporate welfare subsidies, and that they are reflecting their membership at the grassroots level, that he is sad for that, or at least for what he considers to be a negative impact that that process has on the legislative process.  He should not be saddened in any way because basically what we are talking about here is a constitutional right that is in the first amendment. It is in the first amendment and about which you do not hear much. You always hear about freedom of speech, freedom of religion, freedom of press, but you do not read much about the right to petition your Government for redress of grievances.  All these organizations are doing, in opposing this legislation, is speaking for their grassroots membership who feel that Washington is wasting money on a corporate welfare subsidy. We ought to encourage that process. We should not be saddened by that process. It is what has made America great for the 209-year history of our constitutional Government. I want to encourage it.  If I had letters from the National Taxpayers Union in opposition to this legislation, that is not any more illegitimate than the Senator from Alaska or the Senator from Hawaii having letters from the maritime industry, the individual corporations, or from the maritime unions in support of the legislation.  Everybody has a right to voice their opinion on legislation. We ought to spend our time listening and encouraging that process. We should not be discouraging that process. The more open Government can be, the stronger our Government will be. And there is so much cynicism at the grassroots that we do not listen to our people that it is weakening the very foundation of our system of representative government. Each one of us has a responsibility to encourage that process of representative government and to listen.  It is better to listen to a Taxpayers Union member in my State of Iowa than their national organization. It is better to listen to the individual who does not belong to any organization than it is to listen to organizations in town. But the right of association guarantees those same people at the grassroots who feel that they do not have time to work the governmental process to work through organizations. That is just as true of the members of the National Taxpayers Union as it is the employees of John Deere in Waterloo, IA, working through their UAW people in Washington, DC; albeit, it is better if each of us listened to the individual and not have it filtered through the organization.  The issue was brought up by the Senator from Alaska of how this saves money. If you compared the cost of existing programs, this bill will cost less. I do not dispute that. I have never disputed that. But can we spend even less and get the job done? I feel we can. And if we can, we should.  It was disputed that I had the authority to use numbers for savings. We know what cargo preference costs. We know that because after my railing about it for several years, the Office of Management and Budget started ferreting out the information where it is hidden in the appropriations of different departments, and bringing it together in one figure. It is in the President's budget document. So that $600 million figure I did not make up. It is a study figure from the President's budget.  Now, whether or not these good-Government groups like the National Taxpayers Union should be sending these letters, I suggest to the leadership of this bill that it would not have been necessary for that point of view to be considered this late in the legislative process. They and other organizations in opposition to this legislation, a year ago, asked to be part of a public hearing where only the proponents of this legislation were allowed to appear--only the proponents of the legislation. The opposition was not heard.  If the committee process had worked the way it should have worked--without having both pro and con in a hearing, to have a fair hearing. They tried to get a second hearing since then, and for a long period of time was promised such a hearing, but it did not come off. So these problems would not have existed in getting their point of view out if they had been heard in the first place.  So that it is plain, very plain that these organizations did ask to appear. From the director of government relations of Citizens for a Sound Economy, I will read part of this letter:       To date, the subcommittee on Surface Transportation of the      Merchant Marine has held one hearing on the act, failing to      invite any of the many individuals and organization opposed      to the bill. We believe that consideration of the act without      the benefit of open debate will prevent the Senate from      making an informed decision in this matter.  Americans for Tax Reform say:       I strongly urge you to hold hearings on this entire bill      before the full committee in which those opposed to continued      maritime subsidies are allowed to state their views.  We also have Citizens Against Government Waste. To the chairman of the committee:       Therefore, we urge that no Senate consideration of either      H.R. 1350 or S. 1139 be allowed until the first Senate      commerce committee holds open hearings allowing independent      experts and critics to testify.  Then a letter from my colleagues:       We therefore request that before either H.R. 1350 or S.      1139 be considered by the Senate that you hold a series of      full committee hearings to explore the work devoted to the      Rubin memo and the MIT study, and to hear the concerns and      successes.  Suggestions from a growing number of critics of maritime subsidies--a letter on March 12 of this year was sent to the chairman of the committee and signed by Bob Dole, John Ashcroft, Don Nickles, Nancy Kassebaum, Hank Brown, myself, Jon Kyl, Jesse Helms, and Rod Grams, the distinguished Presiding Officer right now. We did not get into the hearing room, obviously.  I ask unanimous consent these letters be printed in the Record.  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in the Record, as follows:                                     Americans for Tax Reform,                                     Washington, DC, May 10, 1996.     Hon. Lary Pressler,     U.S. Senate,     Washington, DC.       Dear Senator Pressler: The so-called ``Maritime Reform and      Security Act of 1995'' (H.R. 1350 and S. 1139) is now pending      in the Senate--without a single opportunity for those who      oppose the continued corporate maritime subsidies in the bill      to testify before the Subcommittee on Surface Transportation      and Merchant Marine. Americans for Tax Reform strongly      opposes the continuation of commercial maritime subsidies in      any form and strongly urges you to hold hearings before the      full Commerce Committee on all of the provisions of this      bill.       Numerous independent studies have illustrated the needless      and excessive cost of commercial maritime subsidies to the      U.S. taxpayer. For example, a 1989 Department of      Transportation report done by MIT entitled ``Competitive      Manning on U.S.-flag Vessels'' exposed serious waste in this      program and determined that maritime subsidies could be      reduced by half if there was, in fact a military need for      these ships. Even Al Gore has concluded that these subsidies      should be abolished.       Like many proponents of increased government intervention,      supporters of this legislation assert that it is necessary      for national security reasons. However, S. 1139 is not likely      to be at all effective in accomplishing that task. In fact,      the Department of Defense's Mobility Requirements Study,      Bottom UP Review Update concluded that even without      subsidies, the US shipping fleet would be adequate in the      event it was needed in time of conflict. If the United States      military can meet its requirements without these subsidies,      why are we asking the American taxpayer to foot the bill?       The subsidies contained in the Maritime Reform and Security      Act of 1995 are particularly egregious examples of bloated      federal government spending taxpayers' money on a project      that is wholly unnecessary. This Congress has shown its      willingness to eliminate ridiculous pork-barrel spending. Why      are you even considering extending a program that costs      American taxpayers more than $100,000 per job subsidized      annually?       I strongly urge you to hold hearings on this entire bill      before the full committee, in which those opposed to      continued maritime subsidies are allowed to state their case.           Sincerely,                                                 Scott P. Hoffman,     Director of Operations.                                                                    ____                                                  U.S. Senate,                                   Washington, DC, March 12, 1996.     Hon. Larry Pressler,     Chairman, Senate Commerce Committee.       Dear Chairman Pressler: Last year, you joined us in a      letter to Budget Chairman Domenici calling for the      ``elimination of wasteful maritime programs.'' As you can see      from the enclosed materials, public interest groups also      oppose maritime subsidies, including:     (1) Citizens Against Government Waste     (2) National Taxpayers Union     (3) Citizens for a Sound Economy     (4) Heritage Foundation     (5) Competitive Enterprise Institute     (6) Cato Institute     (7) Progressive Policy Institute of the Democratic Leadership          Conference, and     (8) Ralph Nader's Essential Information Group       Unfortunately, these and other critics of maritime      subsidies were not called to testify at the single hearing by      the Subcommittee on Surface Transportation and Merchant      Marine. Now H.R. 1350 and S. 1139, the Maritime Reform and      Security Act of 1995, are pending on the Senate Calendar.       The committee was denied the benefit of important      independent analyses of maritime subsidies, including the MIT      report entitled ``Competitive Manning on U.S.-flag Vessels''      which exposed serious waste and determined maritime subsidies      could be cut in half.       The committee also was denied the benefit of extensive work      by 16 executive branch agencies summarized in the 1993      ``Decision Memorandum on Maritime Issues'' from Robert Rubin      to President Clinton. Fifteen of 16 executive branch agencies      concluded that as few as 20 vessels--not 50--should be      subsidized. The memo states that the ``Secretary of Defense,      the Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, and the Commander      of the Transportation Command have already concluded that      future requirements will not exceed 20-30 liner vessels. DOD      will have no need for bulk vessels.''       It was also concluded that ``subsidies are needed primarily      to offset the higher wages of U.S. mariners'' and that      ``subsidizing carriers simply to preserve jobs would leave      the Administration hard pressed to explain why it should not      also subsidize every other industry that suffers job      losses.''       We therefore request that before either H.R. 1350 or S.      1139 be considered by the Senate, that you hold a series of      full committee hearings to explore the work devoted to the      Rubin memo and the MIT study, and to hear the concerns and      suggestions from the growing number of critics of maritime      subsidies.           Sincerely,         Bob Dole, John Ashcroft, Don Nickles, Nancy Landon            Kassebaum, Hank Brown, Chuck Grassley, Jon Kyl, Rod            Grams, Jesse Helms.                                                                    ____                                              Council for Citizens                                     Against Government Waste,                                                    March 7, 1996.     Hon. Larry Pressler,     Chairman, Senate Commerce Committee, Washington, DC.       Dear Mr. Chairman: The 600,000 members of the Council for      Citizens Against Government Waste (CCAGW) strongly oppose      H.R. 1350 and S. 1139, the Maritime Reform and Security Act      of 1995. These bills neither reform nor sustains security for      America's hard working taxpayers. This legislation is another      example of entrenched corporate political pork.       Because only maritime supporters were invited to attend the      single hearing held by the Subcommittee on Surface      Transportation and Merchant Marine, and critics of the      programs were barred from testifying, your full committee was      denied the benefit of independent analyses which would expose      the enormous waste involved in federal maritime programs.      There are far less costly and more effective means of      protecting America's national security interests.       Therefore, we urge that no Senate consideration of either      H.R. 1350 and S. 1139 be allowed until the full Senate      Commerce Committee holds open hearings that allow independent      experts and critics to testify.       This legislation actually undermines our national defense      because it:       1. allows vessel operators to be exempt from      requisitioning;       2. permits operators to withhold their U.S.-flag vessels      from war duty by subcontracting far less costly foreign-flag      vessels, an still receive U.S.-flag vessels, and still      receive U.S.-flag premium rates;       3. provides the least militarily useful ships (i.e., large      non-self-sustaining container);       4. allows the transfer of U.S.-flag vessels to foreign      flags without approval, and,       5. reduces the capacity of the U.S. merchant marine fleet      by allowing operators to double-dip taxpayers through      multiple subsidies (direct--lump sum; indirect-cargo      preference premium rates and subsidized service in the      domestic trade and leasing subsidized ships without      restrictions to foreign citizens).       This legislation will discourage new investment and      innovation by erecting artificial, anti-competitive barriers      that give the upper hand to operators servicing domestic      trades in 1995, and barring subsidies to any newcomers even      if they are more efficient and can provide more militarily      useful vessels.       Your full committee should review the MARAD-sponsored MIT      report, ``Competitive Manning on U.S.-flag Vessels.'' This      report exposed wasteful maritime practices and found that      subsidies could be cut down to as little as $1.1 million per      vessel.       We also request that your committee study the work of 16      executive branch agencies summarized in the ``Decision      Memorandum on Maritime Issues'' from Robert Rubin to      President Clinton. Fifteen agencies sided with the Defense      Department's conclusion that as few as 20 vessels--not the 50      required by S. 1139--are needed for national security and      should be subsidized. And they concluded ``DOD will have no      need for bulk vessels,'' which means cargo preference      subsidies should be eliminated.       Just as telling is the fact that these agencies concluded      that ``subsidies are needed primarily to offset the higher      wages of U.S. mariners'' and that ``subsidizing carriers      simply to preserve jobs would leave the Administration hard      pressed to explain why it should not subsidize every other      industry that suffers job losses.''       Your committee should also hear from the Department of      Transportation's Inspector General, who concluded that the      entire Maritime Administration and all of its U.S.-flag      subsidies should be terminated, a conclusion similar to that      reached by Vice President Al Gore's National Performance      Review Transportation Task Force.       Strengthening our national defense is a goal CCAGW strongly      supports, but forcing taxpayers to subsidize high-priced      seafarers and militarily useless vessels during a time we are      eliminating the jobs of our men and women serving in the Navy      makes no sense at all. There is not one of these sealift      billets that our Navy personnel, with little or no training,      could handle.       S. 1139 and H.R. 1350 is corporate welfare that must be      stopped. We stand ready to assist you in these hearings and      in making the necessary changes to these bills.           Sincerely,                                                 Thomas A. Schatz,     President.                                                                    ____                                 Citizens for a Sound Economy,                                   Washington, DC, March 15, 1996.     Hon. Larry Pressler,     Chairman, Committee on Commerce, Science, and Transportation,          U.S. Senate, Washington, DC.       Dear Mr. Chairman: On behalf of Citizens for a Sound      Economy's 250,000 members across America, I urge you to give      the opponents of H.R. 1350 and S. 1139, the Maritime Reform      and Security Act of 1995, a fair chance to voice their      concerns. To date, the Subcommittee on Surface Transportation      and Merchant Marine has only held one hearing on the Act,      failing to invite any of the many individuals and      organizations opposed to the bill. We believe that      consideration of the Act without the benefit of an open      debate will prevent the Senate from making an informed      decision in this important matter. Especially at a time when      Congress is attempting to come to grips with excessive      spending, pro-spending legislation should not be immune from      criticism.       Citizens for a Sound Economy strongly opposes the Maritime      Reform and Security Act of 1995. We believe that Congress      should put the era of costly Cold-War level maritime      subsidies behind it. The primary beneficiary would be current      and future generations of American taxpayers, who would not      have to pay the price of billions of dollars in new, unneeded      subsidies. We believe that America needs to rely on more      competitive, least-cost solutions to national security issues      and concerns. Among other needed reforms, this entails ending      spending on excessive salaries and benefits for U.S.-flag      seafarers and other unwarranted expenses associated with      often unwarranted vessels.       We would like to emphasize that a wide spectrum of policy      analysts and public officials seriously question and oppose      the continuation of the maritime subsidies and intervention      of all sorts. For one, Vice President Gore's National      Performance Review recommended that all maritime subsidies be      ended, saving Americans $23 billion over ten years. A study      by the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, ``Competitive      Manning on U.S.-flag Vessels,'' pointed to the extensive      waste and abuse in the maritime programs and suggested ways      to get more value for less taxpayer dollars. This study was      commissioned by none other than the Maritime Administration.      The Defense Department notes that only 8 percent of the      supplies delivered to the Persian Gulf during the Gulf War      came on U.S. commercial vessels. The U.S. Transportation      Inspector General recently recommended that the Maritime      Administration and all maritime subsidy programs be      eliminated.       Harold E. Shear, former U.S. Navy Admiral and Maritime      Administrator, has concluded that ``Nearly 50 years of      subsidies have not prevented the demise of the U.S. merchant      marine . . . Subsidies do nothing more than cause      inefficiency, mediocrity, lack of incentive and dependence on      Uncle Sam.'' In 1993, 15 out of 16 government agencies sided      with now-Secretary of the Treasury Robert Rubin's option to      President Clinton to drastically revamp the Maritime      subsidies. The rationale for Mr. Rubin's option, as reported      to the President, was as follows:       ``Subsidies for the U.S. flag fleet have always been      justified by their role in providing a sealift capacity for      use in military emergencies. With the end of the Cold War,      DOD's sealift requirements have declined. Although DOD's      bottom-up review is not complete, the Secretary of Defense,      the Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, and the Commander      of the Transportation Command have already concluded that      future requirements will not exceed 20-30 liner vessels. DOD      will have no need for bulk vessels. All agencies therefore      oppose renewal of direct subsidies for bulkers. This option      would meet DOD's maximum military requirements. [S. 1139      requires 50 vessels].''       The Wall Street Journal's Review and Outlook section noted      on June 6, 1995:       ``Rob Quartel, a former FMC [Federal Maritime Commission]      member, figures that all maritime subsidies together cost at      least $375,000 per seagoing worker. It would be a lot cheaper      to pay the sailors not to work. Eliminating these subsidies      would not only force the maritime industry to become      competitive, but also would contribute to the balanced budget      effort. Mr. Quartel figures, based on dynamic scoring, that      eliminating subsidies would save $7 billion between 1996 and      2002, and generate new economic activity that would raise an      extra $28 billion in tax revenue. Even in Washington terms,      $35 billion is real money.''       Mr. Chairman, the list of dissenting voices to this legacy      of subsidies from World War II and the Cold War goes on and      on. We ask that you carefully weigh the costs and the      benefits associated with the Maritime Reform and Security Act      of 1995, and all other maritime subsidies. The American      people deserve fair hearings on this issue where both points      of view are represented.           Sincerely,                                                  Shane Schriefer,     Director of Government Relations.                                                                    ____                                                Baltimore, MD,                                                     June 8, 1996.     Senator Charles E. Grassley,     Senate Office Building,     Washington, DC.       Dear Senator Grassley, Thank you for your letter of May      30th asking me to check off certain items that I support on      an enclosed form.       You note that my signature is on a form submitted by the      American Security Council. I only signed that form to gain      time for mature study of a then pending bill which could have      resulted in subsidies for VLCCs! And now that I see how my      name is being used I much regret it.       I was invited to help that council formulate positions, and      I met with their representative. I enclose a copy of a letter      [please forgive bottom margins] that I sent to him that      indicates where I stand. My qualification to comment is shown      in my biology in Who's Who in America. I have not heard from      them since. But I am not surprised that my opinions do not      suit them.       So I prefer NOT to use your form. My views require a more      complex presentation--more than in the ``tip of the iceberg''      letter enclosed.       I do believe that this country needs and should pay for      only that part of a U.S. merchant marine that is configured      in type and numbers to support our authenticated defense      requirements. I am opposed to the continuation of federal      programs. mostly designed to line the pockets of unions,      owners, and shipbuilders unwilling to give up grossly      inefficient practices. We desperately need a fresh start; not      a continuing jobs program.           Sincerely,                                                 George P. Steele.                                           Vice Admiral (Retired).
