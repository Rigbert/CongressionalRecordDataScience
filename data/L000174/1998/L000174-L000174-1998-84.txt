President, five years ago, Mr. Irving Gross of Londonderry, Vermont returned to his father's birthplace, Skierniewice, Poland for the first time. During his trip he visited the city's Jewish cemetery. Like many other Jewish cemeteries in Poland, Skierniewice's had been destroyed by the Nazis and ravaged by time. The grounds were unkempt and monuments and headstones were broken, overturned or missing completely.  Today, through the efforts of Mr. Gross, Mr. Tadeusz Zwierzchowski, a former member of the Polish underground and a Skierniewice resident, and local Skierniewice authorities, the cemetery has been rehabilitated. It now stands as a memorial to the Polish Jews who perished under Nazi persecution and serves as a powerful reminder to the residents of Skierniewice of the vibrant Jewish culture that once enriched their city and their lives.  Mr. President, I would like to recognize all those who participated in this important effort to commemorate the role of the Jewish people in Polish culture and their plight during the Holocaust. In bearing witness to the past, the residents of Skierniewice have made a valuable contribution to their city's future.                          ____________________
