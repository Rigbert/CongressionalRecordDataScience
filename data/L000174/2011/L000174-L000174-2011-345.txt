We have two amendments that have not gotten any committee hearings. We have one on this side that has been voted on by a bipartisan majority, Republicans and Democrats, twice out of committee, twice on the floor, and that can't go forward.  It is my inclination to object further. I realize the difficulty that would put my friend from Nevada in, so I will not object. But I do feel this ruins the chances to make the PATRIOT Act one that could have had far greater bipartisan support, and we have lost a wonderful chance. But I understand we have to do what the Republicans want in this bill, so I will withdraw my objection.
