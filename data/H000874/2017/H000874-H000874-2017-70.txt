Speaker, we are going to debate the substance of the bill; we are going to debate it fully. We think it will not hold up well under that debate. Therefore, we will have a significant difference.  He is right. The best economy anybody in this House has experienced--the best economy--was the last 4 years of the Clinton administration, period. Guess what we had? We had a little bit of a tax increase. We increased the gasoline tax, and we tried to pay to for infrastructure. We haven't increased it since then.  The Republicans said: You do that, oh, the economy is going to go down the drain. The best economy any Republican has experienced in their lifetime is under Bill Clinton. We balanced the budget 4 years in a row under Bill Clinton, the only President you can mention that balanced.  It never balanced under Ronald Reagan. It never balanced under George H.W. Bush. It never balanced under George Bush. As a matter of fact, as soon as they took office, they made sure we wouldn't have further balances because they cut taxes in 2001 and 2003, but they didn't cut spending.  He talks about President Obama. I know the majority leader will be interested in these statistics. I didn't count January of 2017 because, after all, that was the Obama economy. Trump had not done anything on the economy, but let's start with February 2017.  Under Donald Trump, 232,000 jobs were created. That is great. That is good. I would say that the Obama economy is still working.  Same exact month a year earlier, not 232, but 237,000 jobs were created under Barack Obama.  March 2017, 50,000 under Trump. March 2016, 225,000 jobs created under Barack Obama.  April 2017, 207,000 jobs. Barack Obama was a little down that month, 153,000 jobs.  145,000 under Trump, 43,000.  Then June of 2017, 210,000 under Donald Trump, 297,000 jobs under Barack Obama.  July of 2017, we are getting more recent. Under Trump--now he has been inoffice a little longer--138,000. What was it under Barack Obama? 291,000 jobs--double.  August of this year, just a few months ago, 169,000 under Donald Trump; 176,000.  Last month we had hurricanes. I will give the majority leader that. We lost 33,000 jobs. Under Barack Obama, same month a year ago, 249,000 jobs created.  As a matter of fact, under Barack Obama, we created 11,773,000 jobs.                              {time}  1145  Under George Bush, 2 million--excuse me--lost under George Bush, private sector jobs, a loss, after the 2001 and 2003 tax cuts, lost 1,159,000 jobs. The last 12 months of the George Bush administration, 2001 and 2003 tax cuts, we couldn't change economic policy. We were in charge for the last 2 years, couldn't change it, lost 4,568,000 jobs.  Now, as a matter of fact, I have done a little thing for 68 years. Over 68 years, we had 36 years of Republican Presidents and 32 years of Democratic Presidents. Under Republican Presidents, from Truman to Obama, there were 35,448,000 jobs created, Mr. Leader. Under Democrats, in 32 years, 62,669,000 jobs.  Now, I would like to go on to another subject, as we could go on debating this all day, but I will yield to my friend.  Mr. McCARTHY. I thank the gentleman for yielding, because you did ask a question in there.  When you talked about Bill Clinton, you asked: What did he have?  Well, when he first came in, he had Democrats in the majority, but all that growth happened because he won a Republican House and a Republican Senate. That is when we turned it around with John Kasich as the budget chair. That is when we balanced the budget in those 4 years.  We had to send him welfare reform how many times?  Three times. He vetoed it all the other times and claimed some glory.  But also there is another question you asked. I love a good debate. I love to pick just facts when you don't want to look at the whole picture. The best thing to even just look at if you want to go: Did the election matter? Did the election matter to the American public?  Well, I heard a lot of pundits on the other side say: Oh my God, if President Trump got elected, the market is going to crash.  You know what? Most everyone in America that invests for retirement invests in the market, and President Donald Trump has given them all a raise because we set new records, more than 60 times; that is because of the belief of what they think he could achieve.  When you look at what he has been able to do with regulation, unbelievable.  The few headlines you didn't announce during Obama, when you were doing those jobs, you didn't say anything about Nabisco leaving the country, or Burger King went and domiciled someplace else. Why?  What was the answer that President Obama would have when companies were leaving America because the taxes were too high? We will pass a law to say they can't.  You know the difference that election has made?  We just proposed a tax bill. Companies are now coming to the Oval Office to say: We are coming back. And all that means is more jobs, more money for Americans.  I understand that we are going to probably have a philosophical difference of agreement. I believe Americans should keep more of what they earn. I know what you said a few weeks ago. My friend cast his vote in favor of a budget that calls for ``$3.9 trillion in revenue enhancements.''  You know who I think needs the revenue?  The American public. That is why we doubled the standard deduction, and that is for every American. On day 1 they will get more in their check.  Small businesses, lowest tax in 40 years. All that money that those companies were being pushed out are going to come back.  We can argue all you want about this, but for 31 years we have had this argument. I think the American public is waiting for us to lead.
