Norco has been fortunate to have dynamic and dedicated community leaders who willingly and unselfishly give their time and talent and make their communities a better place to live and work. Herbert Higgins is one of these individuals. On December 4, 2007, Herb will be honored at a dinner in honor of his retirement from the Norco City Council.  Herb has served on the Norco City Council for 8 years and served as mayor in 2002 and 2005. Prior to being a councilmember, Herb served on the Planning Commission from 1998 to 1999. Councilman Higgins has also served on the Audit Committee, the Norco Chamber of Commerce, the Riverside Child Safety Committee, the Water Task Force, and the Western Riverside Regional Wastewater Authority.  Mr. Higgins has achieved several accomplishments during his tenure on the Norco City Council including: initiating the charter system of government for the city of Norco, instigating the testing of Wyle Labs for the health of our children, developing the Community Action Group and starting the All Volunteer Programs in Norco and the Volunteer Appreciation Dinner.  Herb's tireless passion for community service has contributed immensely to the betterment of the community of Norco, California. Herb has been the heart and soul of many community organizations and events, and I am proud to call him a fellow community member, American and friend. I know that many community members are grateful for his service and salute him as he retires. I wish him and his lovely wife Doris all the best.                          ____________________
