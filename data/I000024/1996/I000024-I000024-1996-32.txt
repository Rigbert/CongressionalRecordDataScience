President, I rise today to recognize the dedication, public service, and patriotism of Rear Adm. Thomas F. Hall, U.S. Navy, Chief of Naval Reserve. Admiral Hall retires from the Navy on October 1, after a distinguished 37-year career of service to our Nation.  A native of Barnsdall, OK, Admiral Hall reported to the U.S. Naval Academy in 1959, graduated in 1963 and was designated a naval aviator in 1964. After earning his Wings of Gold, Admiral Hall chose to join the maritime patrol forces flying the new P-3 Orion. Excelling in flight training, he graduated No. 1 in his class, and was named the outstanding student. Admiral Hall continued to distinguish himself throughout his flying career amassing almost 5,000 pilot hours.  His initial fleet assignment was with Patrol Squadron 8, flying combat missions in Southeast Asia. Subsequent tours included the U.S. Naval Academy, as a Company Officer and Executive Assistant to the Commandant of Midshipmen, Patrol Squadron 23, completion of the command and staff course at the Naval War College, graduating with distinction, and assignment to the Bureau of Naval Personnel, were his billets included aviation staffs placement officer, head of air combat placement, and assistant head of aviation junior officer assignment. Admiral Hall returned to VP-8 as executive officer and then assumed duties as Commanding Officer. Admiral Hall also completed the course of instruction at the National War College, again graduating with distinction, and served on the staff of the Chief of Naval Operations where he served as Head of the Program Objective Memorandum Development section, as Chief of Staff to Commander Fleet Air Keflavik, and as a fellow to the CNO's strategic studies group. In addition to command of VP-8, Admiral Hall has also served in command of Naval Air Station Bermuda, the Icelandic Defense Forces, and most recently, command of the Naval Reserve.  Since September 1992, Admiral Hall has been the Chief of Naval Reserve, leading the Naval Reserve Force through its largest drawdown, while maintaining readiness and significantly increasing reserve contributory support to the fleet. Under Admiral Hall's leadership, the total force policy became a reality--Regular Navy and Naval Reservists working side-by-side, in operations worldwide, meeting the Navy's forward presence requirements.  In August 1989, Admiral Hall was promoted to Rear Admiral--lower half--and in July 1992 to his present rank of Rear Admiral--upper half. Admiral Hall wears the Defense Superior Service Medal, Legion of Merit, Meritorious Service Medal, Meritorious Unit Commendation, and various unit and campaign awards, holds a masters degree in management from George Washington University and attended Harvard University senior executives program. In July 1992, Admiral Hall was awarded the Icelandic Order of the Falcon, Commander's Cross with star, by the President of Iceland.  Our Nation, his wife Barbara, and his son Tom, can be immensely proud of the Admiral's long and distinguished career and his service to our country. I wish Admiral Hall and his family best wishes in his retirement.                          ____________________
