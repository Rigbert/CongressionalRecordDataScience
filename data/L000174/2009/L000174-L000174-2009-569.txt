Enzi, on the floor. I would object to a time agreement such as this, I would object to any time agreement on it as it now stands. With the modification, there is a major change in the privacy aspects of the modification that comes under the jurisdiction of the Senate Judiciary Committee. It is different than what we have proposed.  I would have no objection to the list, with the exception of the Enzi amendment. I would wonder if it would be possible for the leader to get the whole list and allow the Senator from Wyoming and I some time to talk about his amendment. I say this only because the Senator from Wyoming is on the floor. I would not have said this if he were not here and not able to respond.
