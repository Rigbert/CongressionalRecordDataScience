Chairman, this would just make it difficult and impossible for Federal agencies to dispose or willingly or equitably exchange or convey lands to States, local governments, private landowners, and others.  I just may point out the Federal Government currently can't manage its existing land, which is over 640 million acres or approximately 3 out of every 10 acres in the United States.  I urge my colleagues to vote against this amendment, and I yield back the balance of my time.
