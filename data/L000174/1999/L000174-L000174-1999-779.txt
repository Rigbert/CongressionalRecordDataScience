President, I am pleased to introduce implementing legislation for the Protocol Relating to the Madrid Agreement Concerning the International Registration of Marks (Protocol). Last Congress, I introduced an identical bill, S. 2191 which unfortunately the Senate did not consider.  This bill is part of my ongoing effort to update American intellectual property law to ensure that it serves to advance and protect American interests both here and abroad. The Protocol would help American businesses, and especially small- and medium-sized companies, protect their trademarks as they expand into international markets. Specifically, this legislation will conform American trademark application procedures to the terms of the Protocol in anticipation of the U.S.'s eventual ratification of the treaty. Ratification by the United States of this treaty would help create a ``one stop'' international trademark registration process, which would be an enormous benefit for American businesses. This bill is one of many measures I have introduced and supported over the past few years to ensure that American trademark holders receive strong protection in today's world of changing technology and complex international markets.  When I introduced this legislation last year, I also cosponsored S. 2193, legislation to implement the Trademark Law Treaty. S. 2193 simplified trademark registration requirements around the world by establishing a list of maximum requirements which Treaty member countries can impose on trademark applicants. The bill passed the Senate on September 17, 1998, and was signed by the President on October 30, 1998. I am proud of this legislation since all American businesses, and particularly small American businesses, will benefit as a result.  I have in the past supported legislation critical to keeping our trademark laws up-to-date. For example, last year I introduced S. 1727, which authorized a comprehensive study of the effects of adding new generic Top Level Domains on trademark and other intellectual property rights. This bill became law as part of the Next Generation Internet Research Act, S. 1609, which was signed into law on October 28, 1998. I also supported the Federal Trademark Dilution Act of 1995, enacted in the 104th Congress to provide intellectual property rights holders with the power to enjoin another person's commercial use of famous marks that would cause dilution of the mark's distinctive quality.  Together, these measures represent significant steps in our efforts to ensure that American trademark law adequately serves and promote American interests.  The legislation I introduce today would ease the trademark registration burden on small- and medium-sized businesses by enabling businesses to obtain trademark protection in all signatory countries with a single trademark application filed with the Patent and Trademark Office. Currently, in order for American companies to protect their trademarks abroad, theymust register their trademarks in each and every country in which protection is sought. Registering in multiple countries is a time-consuming, complicated and expensive process--a process which places a disproportionate burden on smaller American companies seeking international trademark protection.  Since 1891, the Madrid Agreement Concerning the International Registration of Marks (Agreement) has provided an international trademark registration system. However, prior to adoption of the Protocol, the U.S. declined to join the Agreement because it contained terms deemed inimical to American intellectual property interests. In 1989, the terms of the Agreement were modified by the Protocol, which corrected the objectionable terms of the Agreement and made American participation a possibility. For example, under the Protocol, applications for international trademark extension can be completed in English; formerly, applications were required to be completed in French. It should be noted that the Protocol would not require substantive changes to American trademark law, but merely to certain procedures for registering trademarks. This implementing legislation is identical to legislation that passed the House last year and has been reintroduced this year as H.R. 769, by Representatives Howard Coble (R-NC) and Howard Berman (D-CA). Indeed, H.R. 769 has already been reported favorably by the House Judiciary Subcommittee on Courts and Intellectual Property.  To date, the Administration has resisted accession to the treaty because of voting rights disputes with the European Union. The EU has sought to retain an additional vote for itself as an intergovernmental entity, in addition to the votes of its member states. I support the Administration's efforts to negotiate a treaty based upon the equitable and democratic principle of one-state, one-vote. However, in anticipation of the eventual resolution of this dispute, the Senate has the opportunity to act now to make the technical changes to American trademark law so that once this voting dispute is satisfactorily resolved and the U.S. accedes to the Protocol, ``one-stop'' international trademark registration can become an immediate reality for all American trademark applicants.  I ask unanimous consent that a copy of the bill and the sectional analysis be placed in the Record.  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in the Record, as follows:                                 S. 671       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of      the United States of America in Congress assembled,     SECTION 1.

The Commissioner is also obliged to notify the      International Bureau whenever the international application      has been ``. . . restricted, abandoned, canceled, or has      expired . . .'' within a specified time period.       The holder of an international registration may request an      extension of its registration by filing with the PTO or the      International Bureau.       The holder of an international registration is entitled to      the benefits of extension in the United states to the extent      necessary to give effect to any provision of the Protocol;      however, an extension of an international registration shall      not apply to the United States if the PTO is the office of      origin with respect to that mark.       The holder of an international registration with an      extension of protection in the United States may claim a date      of priority based on certain conditions.       If the PTO Commissioner believes that an applicant is      entitled to an extension of protection, he or she publishes      the mark in the ``Official Gazette'' of the PTO. This serves      notice to third parties who oppose the extension. Unless an      official protest conducted pursuant to existing law is      successful, the request for extension may not be refused. If      the request for extension is denied, however, the      Commissioner notifies the International Bureau of such action      and sets forth the reason(s) why. The Commissioner must also      apprise the International Bureau of other relevant      information pertaining to requests for extension within the      designated time periods.       If an extension for protection is granted, the Commissioner      issues a certificate attesting to such action, and publishes      notice of the certificate in the ``Gazette.'' Holders of      extension certificates thereafter enjoy protection equal to      that of other owners of registration listed on the Principal      Register of the PTO.       If the International Bureau notifies the PTO of a      cancellation of some or all of the goods and services listed      in the international registration, the Commissioner must      cancel an extension of protection with respect to the same      goods and services as of the date on which the international      registration was canceled. Similarly, if the International      Bureau does not renew an international registration, the      corresponding extension of protection in the United States      shall cease to be valid. Finally, the holder of an      international registration canceled in whole or in part by      the International Bureau may file an application for the      registration of the same mark for any of the goods and      services to which the cancellation applies that were covered      by an extension of protection to the United States based on      that international registration.       The holder of an extension of protection must, within      designated time periods and under certain conditions, file an      affidavit setting forth the relevant goods or services      covered an any explanation as to why their nonuse in commerce      is related to ``special circumstances,'' along with a filing      fee.       The right to an extension of protection may be assigned to      a third party so long as the individual is a national of, or      is domiciled in, or has a ``bona fide'' business located in a      country that is a member of the Protocol; or has such a      business in a country that is a member of an      intergovernmental organization (like the E.U.) belonging to      the Protocol.       An extension of protection conveys the same rights as an      existing registration for the same mark if the extension and      existing registration are owned by the same person, and      extension of protection and the existing registration cover      the same goods or services, and the certificate of extension      is issued after the date of the existing registration.     Section 3. Effective Date       This section states that the effective date of the act      shall commence on the date on which the Madrid Protocol takes      effect in the United States.                                 ______                                       By
