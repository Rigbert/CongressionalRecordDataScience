 President, I thank the Chair for being so gracious as to not only sit there, but to pay attention to what I had to say. I am flattered he would listen. I hope that he and others will engage their significant legislative skills in trying to work out a feasible war powers mechanism--whether it is exactly what I have proposed or something else--so we avoid the kind of gridlock that has occurred already in the last several years.  I thank the Chair. I thank my good friend from California who has been waiting to be recognized.  I yield the floor.
