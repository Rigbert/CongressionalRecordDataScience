Speaker, it is with great pride that I rise today to pay tribute to the 113th Engineer Battalion of the Indiana National Guard and welcome them home after 1 year of serving our country heroically in Iraq.  Upon arrival, the 113th was nicknamed the ``Ironman Battalion'' because of their links to Northwest Indiana's steel industry. Throughout the past year, these ironmen and -women have shown a dedication and commitment to their country that is truly as strong as steel.  Today, Mr. Speaker, I am pleased to announce that soldiers of the 113th are coming home, coming home to be with their family and friends, coming home to be with their wives, husbands, sons, daughters, mothers and fathers.  The service of these men and women has not been without sacrifice. Over 40 Purple Hearts have been awarded to the 113th Battalion, each serving as a reminder of the danger our soldiers face every day.  Mr. Speaker, I welcome these soldiers home. I thank them for their service and sacrifice to our Nation, and I pledge that our support for them will remain equal to the sacrifice they have shown to our country.                          ____________________[Page H11508]From the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]   HONORING THE 113TH ENGINEER BATTALION, INDIANA ARMY NATIONAL GUARD  (
