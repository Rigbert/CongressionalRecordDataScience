 President, I rise today to reintroduce the Prevention of Antibiotic Resistance Act, along with my colleague Senator Susan Collins. This bill will help to prevent the rise of antibiotic resistant pathogens by ensuring that antibiotics are used prudently and judiciously in the agriculture industry.  Antibiotic resistance is a growing public health threat. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, CDC, estimate that antibiotic-resistant bacteria cause at least 23,000 deaths and 2 million infections each year in the United States. The CDC also estimates that antibiotic resistance costs the United States $20 billion in excess health costs each year. These statistics will only worsen if we do not take meaningful steps to reduce inappropriate and unnecessary antibiotic use.  The agriculture industry has long used antibiotics to increase and maintain animal weight gain and feed efficiency. The industry has also relied on administering antibiotics to stave off infections associated with poor biosecurity or sanitation in barns and feedlots. However, based on what we know now about antibiotic resistance, these practices no longer make sense.  I am particularly concerned about the rise of antibiotic resistance in foodborne pathogens. Foodborne illness is already a pressing public health problem, and the United States must ensure that agricultural antibiotic use practices do not lead to antibiotic resistance in foodborne bacteria.  Already, the CDC estimates that 410,000 antibiotic resistant Salmonella and Campylobacter infections occur each year. In fact, nearly 1 in 4 Campylobacter infections analyzed by the CDC is drug-resistant.  The CDC has also discovered that multidrug-resistant Salmonella results in more virulent infections, causing higher rates of hospitalization and bloodstream infections than normally expected with Salmonella infections. Clearly, more needs to be done to fight antibiotic resistance. This legislation will ensure that all medically important antibiotics approved for use in livestock feed and water pose no risk to human health due to the development of antibiotic resistance.  In 2013, the Food and Drug Administration, FDA, took a critically important first step by issuing Guidance for Industry 213, a policy that will eliminate the use of antibiotics for feed efficiency or weight gain uses in food-animal production. I am glad that the pharmaceutical and agriculture industries plan to adopt FDA's policy. This is a victory for public health, and I am eager to see this policy fully implemented.  However, FDA's judicious antibiotic use policy has a gap that must be addressed in order to fully protect public health. You see, many of the antibiotics previously approved for disease prevention and control are at high risk of abuse or misuse.  Some of these approved uses are at similar low doses as the production uses being phased out by FDA judicious use policies. Other uses do not have a defined duration of use or aren't approved at a therapeutic dose expected to treat a specific bacterial pathogen.  In fact, the FDA has informed my staff that there are likely 107 antibiotics approved for disease prevention or control that fall into these categories. This is a problem as some producers may rely on these drugs far too often as a way to maintain animal production or to prevent recurrent infections when these important issues could be solved with better sanitation, biosecurity, and animal husbandry.  This legislation would require pharmaceutical companies to submit additional information to the FDA to demonstrate that a disease prevention or control use of the drug does not pose a risk to human health due to the development of antibiotic resistance. It would apply only to antibiotics approved for disease prevention or control that are at high risk of overuse.  If there is no risk to human health, the drug sponsor would also have to provide evidence to revise the conditions of using an antibiotic for disease prevention or control to ensure the drug is only used judiciously and sparingly. These revised drug approvals would be required to specify a therapeutic dose, be shown to control a specific bacterial infection, be targeted only to the group of animals at risk of developing a specific infection, and specify a defined duration of use.  The bill also includes a sense of the Senate that all medically important antibiotics should be used only on the order of a licensed veterinarian who has a valid veterinarian-client-patient relationship with a producer.  This means that the veterinarian is familiar with the animals to which he or she is prescribing an antibiotic. Veterinary oversight is a key component of ensuring that antibiotics are not used inappropriately or unnecessarily.  This legislation, therefore, would allow for medically important antibiotics to be used to prevent or control infections when absolutely necessary and when it does not pose a risk to human health. In addition to protecting human health, this legislation will help to preserve the efficacy of antibiotic for veterinarians, so that the drugs will continue to be effective for treating livestock and poultry when no other alternatives to these drugs exist.  Antibiotic resistance is a growing public health threat. If we do not act now, many more Americans will suffer and, in some cases, die from infections that are no longer treatable. This legislation will protect public health whileallowing the agriculture sector to use antibiotics when absolutely necessary to preserve animal health. I ask my colleagues to work with me to enact this important bipartisan bill.                                 ______                                       By
