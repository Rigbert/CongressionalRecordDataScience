 President, for the information of all Senators, tomorrow, following morning business, the Senate will resume consideration of the intelligence reform bill. I would like to say to Chairman Collins and Ranking Member Lieberman, I think they had a good debate today and have gotten a good start, and we will continue the amending process tomorrow. The chairman and ranking member will be here to work through any amendments, and we hope to have them begin to be offered tomorrow. We encourage all Senators to contact the bill managers as early as possible and see if we can move forward on this very important legislation which the majority leader and the Democratic leader wish us to finish before we go home for the elections.                         Order for Adjournment  Mr. McCONNELL. Mr. President, if there is no further business to come before the Senate, I ask unanimous consent that the Senate stand in adjournment under the previous order, following the remarks of Senator Snowe or any other remarks of the chairman of the committee.
