I hope and I pray nothing happens in this country between now and the time we take these bills up. It reflects so badly on the U.S. Senate that we have been given fair warning by this administration that we face one of the most serious security threats since 9/11 and the Senate is unwilling--there has been an objection to even considering the Homeland Security bills at this moment when, in fact, we have nothing else to do here. I hope that history proves that this was not a wrong decision, but it is a decision which, sadly, we will have to live with until the leadership of this Senate decides to return.  At this point, I yield the floor.
