President, before addressing the President's budget, I wish to address an issue that is more personal and a lot closer to home. Chicago lost a great friend yesterday, and I lost a great friend as well. Bob Collins, top-rated radio personality in the city of Chicago, died in an airplane crash that was reported around the Nation.  Bob Collins was an extraordinary person. When you think of what creates a community, it is a person such as Bob Collins. His voice every morning in Chicago was a blend of wisdom and humor that really set people off on a good day. I can recall visiting his studios so many times and feeling right at home.  Bob was a typical Chicagoan, a typical Midwesterner, and I think that is the reason for his success. Our thoughts, of course, today are with his family and his wife Christine, but we should reflect for a moment on the great contribution which this man made in over 25 years at radio station WGN.  Great cities are made up of great people and Chicago is no exception. Bob Collins, at WGN Radio since 1974, was a combination of town crier, court jester, wise counselor, and fellow common man. A Shakespeare quote comes to mind: ``He was wont to speak plain and to the purpose.''  He started at age 13 at a radio station in Lakeland, FL. When he was 14, he had his own show, and radio was still at that time everyone's link to the world. Until the day he died, he remained Chicago residents' link to each other and to a wider community.  What was it about Bob Collins that made hundreds of thousands of Chicagoans tune in virtually every weekday morning? What was it about Bob Collins that enabled him not only to follow his fabled predecessor Wally Phillips, but to create his own following?  Well, like Bob, it is fairly simple. In an age of political extremes and shock radio, we found in Bob Collins an observant, thoughtful, plain spoken but fair and common man who never lost touch with the community he loved. He connected with us and with the families across Illinois and Chicago who were his loyal fans. Shaving in the morning, drinking coffee, fighting the daily commute, Bob was there at our side.  In addition to winning our ears and hearts, Bob's unparalleled ability to mix humor, human interest stories, and intelligent, thoughtful news won him award after award. His commitment to Chicago did not end when the microphone was turned off. He was always the champion of the little guy. He received the Salvation Army award known as ``The Other Award'' because of his spirit and his dedication.  His hobbies included motorcycling and flying. He was a man who enjoyed life and every minute of it. WGN's Spike O'Dell signed on this morning and announced: WGN Radio, Chicago. This is the Bob Collins Show.'' These words remind us that mornings in Chicago will always belong to Bob Collins, and he will continue to ride and fly and laugh through all of our memories.  Thank you, Uncle Bobby. Chicago is going to miss you.                          ____________________
