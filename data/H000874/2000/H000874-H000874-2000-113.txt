Speaker, I thank the gentleman for yielding to me.  I would say to the gentleman from Florida (Chairman Young) for whom I have, as he knows, great respect and affection, and I share that as well for the ranking member.  I want to tell him, with all due respect, I am the ranking member of the Treasury Postal bill, and I am going to have to go to the Web site because I have not seen the conference report. There was no conference. I would tell my friends, there was no conference on the Treasury Postal bill, whatever is in the Treasury Postal bill, we are learning secondhand.  This is not the way my colleagues ought to run this House and respectone another as Members. This is a wrong way to proceed, and we ought to reject and start back at the very beginning. This is not the way to treat one another. If we want bipartisanship, if we want to positively represent the citizens of this country, if we want to come to this place and be honest with one another, this is not the way to do it.  I am the ranking member. I have not seen this bill, and I must go to the Web site to see this bill. Reject this bill.
