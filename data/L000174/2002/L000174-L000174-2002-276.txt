President, yesterday I was honored to attend the 21st Annual National Peace Officers Memorial Day Services at the Capitol.  Sadly, last year was the deadliest year in law enforcement history since 1974. In 2001, 230 law enforcement officers were killed in the line of duty including 72 fallen heroes who were killed on September 11.  These brave public servants risked and sacrificed their own lives so that others might live. Each one of us owes these courageous men and women, and their families, a debt of gratitude that we can never fully repay.  During Police Memorial Week, I hope that Congress will act on two pieces of legislation to appropriately honor the families of brave public safety officers who sacrificed their own lives for their fellow Americans.  First, I urge the House of Representatives to take up the Mychal Judge Police and Fire Chaplains Public Safety Officers' Benefit Act of 2002, S. 2431.  The Senate passed this bipartisan legislation more than a week ago. It is needed to amend the Public Safety Officers' Benefit Program to permit the families of 10 public safety officers killed on September 11 to retroactively receive $250,000 each in Federal death benefits.  Senator Campbell and I introduced this bipartisan measure, cosponsored by Senators Schumer, Clinton, Biden and Feingold, to retroactively restructure the Public Safety Officers' Benefit Program to provide benefits to fallen officers who died without a surviving spouse, child, or parent.  I commend Representatives Manzullo and Nadler for their bipartisan leadership on the House version of this bill, H.R. 3297.  Named for Chaplain Mychal Judge, who was killed while responding with the New York City Fire Department to the September 11 terrorist attacks on the World Trade Center, our bipartisan legislation recognizes the invaluable service of police and fire chaplains in crisis situations by allowing for their eligibility in the Public Safety Officers' Benefit Program.  Father Judge, while deemed eligible for public safety officer benefits, was survived by his two sisters who, under current law, are ineligible to receive death benefits. This is simply wrong and must be remedied.  Indeed, Father Judge is among 10 public safety officers killed on September 11 whose survivors are ineligible for Federal death benefits because they are not surviving spouses, children, or parents of the officers. This bill would retroactively correct this injustice by expanding the list of those who may receive public safety officer benefits to the beneficiaries named on the most recently executed life insurance policy of the deceased officer. This change would go into effect on September 11 of last year to make sure the families of Father Judge and the nine other fallen heros receive their public safety officer benefits.  By taking up the Senate-passed Mychal Judge Police and Fire Chaplains Public Safety Officers' Benefit Act during Police Memorial Week, the House of Representatives can provide much-needed relief for 10 families of public safety officers who sacrificed their lives on September 11.  Second, I hope that later today the Senate will consider the Law Enforcement Tribute Act, S. 2179, introduced by Senator Carnahan.  The Senate Judiciary Committee unanimously approved this legislation to create a $3 million Department of Justice grant program to help States, local governments and Indian tribes establish permanent tributes to fallen public safety officers. I am proud to be an original cosponsor of Senator Carnahan's bill to honor officers killed in the line of duty.  During Police Memorial Week, the Senate should pass Senator Carnahan's legislation to provide Federal resources to our States and local communities to pay proper tribute to the brave public safety officers.  I hope Congress will act expeditiously on these two important pieces of legislation to salute public safety officers across the country and honor the brave men and women who gave the ultimate sacrifice to serve and protect us.                          ____________________
