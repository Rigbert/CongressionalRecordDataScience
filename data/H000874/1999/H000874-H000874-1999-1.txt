Sadly, as the 21st Century approaches, many of America's most previous sound recordings, recorded on perishable media, may be lost forever unless we act to preserve them for the use and enjoyment of future generations.  Today I am introducing, along with the gentleman from Ohio (Mr. Ney), the gentleman from Florida (Mr. Davis), the gentlemen from Tennessee (Messrs. Clement, Gordon, Wamp, Tanner, Ford, Duncan, and Jenkins), the gentleman from New York (Mr. Serrano), and the gentlewoman from Missouri (Ms. McCarthy), an important measure designed to help preserve this irreplaceable aspect of America's cultural heritage. I hope all Members will join us in support of this effort.  In 1988, Congress wisely enacted the National Film Preservation Act, which established a program in the Library of Congress to support the work of actors, archivists and the motion-picture industry to preserve America's disappearing film heritage. The bill we introduce today, the National Recording Preservation Act, follows the trail blazed by the Library's successful film program.  The measure would create a National Recording Registry at the Library to identify, maintain and preserve sound recordings of cultural, aesthetic, or historic significance. Each year the Librarian of Congress will be able to select up to 25 recordings or groups of recordings for placement on the Registry, upon nominations made by the public, industry or archive representatives; recordings will be eligible for selection ten years after their creation.  A National Recording Preservation Board will assist the Librarian in implementing a comprehensive recording preservation program, working with artists, archivists, educators and historians, copyright owners, recording-industry representatives, and others. A National Recording Preservation Foundation, chartered by the bill, will encourage, accept and administer private contributions to promote preservation of recordings, and public accessibility to the Nation's recording heritage, held at the Library and at other archives throughout the United States.  The bill authorizes appropriations of up to $500,000 per year for seven years to fund the Library's preservation program, and up to $500,000 yearly for the same period to match the non-federal funds raised by the Foundation for preservation purposes.  I include for the Record a letter received from Dr. James H. Billington, the Librarian of Congress, expressing his strong support for this measure, which will be introduced in the Senate by the senior senator from Louisiana (Mr. Breaux):  Madam Speaker, my co-sponsors and I fervently hope that by enacting this modest bill, the Congress, working with the private sector to leverage the available resources, can spark creation of a comprehensive, sensible and effective program to preserve our Nation's sound-recording heritage for our children and grandchildren. We look forward to its quick enactment.                                               Library of Congress                                       Bicentennial 1800-2000,                                 Washington, DC, November 9, 1999.     Hon. Steny H. Hoyer,     Committee on House Administration, House of Representatives,          Longworth House Office Building, Washington, DC.       Dear Mr. Hoyer: Thank you for seeking comments from the      Library of Congress on your draft legislation to create a      National Sound Recording Board and Foundation. We have had      great success with a similar program to preserve the nation's      film heritage, and I believe your legislation will allow the      Library to build on that success in developing a national      program for sound recordings.       The key components of the legislation--a national recording      registry, an advisory     board bringing together experts in the field, and a      fundraising foundation--have all been reviewed by the staffs      of the Library's Motion Picture, Broadcasting and Recorded      Sound Division and American Folklife Center, as well as our      legal staff, and appear to provide the necessary elements of      a comprehensive program to ensure the survival, conservation,      and increased public availability of America's sound      recording heritage.       I am pleased that the legislation includes a directive for      a comprehensive national recording preservation study and      action plan, such as the one produced in 1993 under      Congressional directive, which laid the framework for a      national film preservation program. This study would serve as      the basis for a national preservation plan, including setting      standards for future private and public preservation efforts,      and will be conducted in conjunction with the state-of-the-     art National Audio-Visual Conservation Center we are      developing in Culpeper, Virginia. The Center and the program      created by your legislation will each benefit from the      existence and work of the other.       I support the bill in both goal and substance. I will need      your support, however, in assuring that any funds      appropriated for the Board or Foundation are new funds added      to the Library's base. We cannot afford to absorb these      costs, as happened this year with funds for the National Film      Preservation Foundation. Please thank your staff members, Bob      Bean and Michael Harrison, for their hard work and extensive      consultation with the Library in developing this legislation.      Please let me know if Congressional staff would like to visit      the Library's sound recording program to see what we do      currently and how your legislation might be implemented.           Sincerely,                                              James H. Billington,     The Librarian of Congress.                          ____________________
