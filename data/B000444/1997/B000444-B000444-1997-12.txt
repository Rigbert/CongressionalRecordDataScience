 Later in the month the committee will hear examinations of cost and burden-sharing, of the qualifications for membership of the three candidate countries--Poland, the Czech Republic, and Hungary, and of the new relationship between NATO and Russia. The final hearing will be reserved for public testimony from individuals and groups with special interest in the NATO enlargement issue.  Through these hearings, the Committee on Foreign Relations hopes to inform not only the entire Senate on this critically important issue, but also the American public.  Mr. President, as my colleagues know, I have spoken many times in some detail on this floor about the issue of NATO enlargement. As the Committee on Foreign Relations launches its series of hearings, I would like briefly to recapitulate why I believe NATO enlargement is in the best interest of the United States.  Europe remains a vital area of interest for the United States for political, strategic, economic, and cultural reasons. A sizable percentage of the world's democracies are in Europe, and the continent remains a major global economic player and partner of the United States. The European Union, with a combined population a third larger than ours, has a combined gross domestic product that exceeds ours.  While the United States has a larger and less balanced trading relationship with Asia than with Europe, we invest far more in Europe. Several new democracies in Central and Eastern Europe have highly educated work forces, already boast rapidly expanding economies, and already attract considerable American investment. Moreover, most Americans trace their ethnic and cultural roots to Europe, and millions retain personal ties to it.  Other than North America, no other part of the world can match Europe's combination of political, economic, military, and cultural power. By any geopolitical standard, it would be a catastrophe for U.S. interests if instability would alter the current situation in Europe.  Of course no one believes that the Russian Army is poised to pour through the Fulda Gap in Germany--NATO's horror scenario for 45 years. Rather, the threats to stability in Europe have changed, but they are, if anything, even more real than those of the cold war: ethnic and religious hatred as horrifyingly shown in the hundreds of thousands killed, raped, made homeless, or otherwise brutalized in Bosnia, and the well-organized forces ofinternational crime, whose tentacles extend from Moscow and Palermo to New York and Los Angeles.  Unfortunately, the history of the 20th century has demonstrated that out of enlightened self-interest the United States must play a leading role in organizing the security of Europe. In two world wars and lately in Bosnia without American leadership the countries of Europe have been unable to resolve their differences peacefully.  Translated into 1997 terms it means that we must lead the Europeans to create a new security architecture to guarantee stability to the areas most vulnerable to disruption, namely Central and Eastern Europe, where newly independent states are striving to create and soldify political democracy and free markets. It is a difficult process, which if not put into a larger framework could spin out of control.  It is in this context that the enlargement of NATO must be seen. During the cold war, NATO provided the security umbrella under which former enemies like France and Germany were able to cooperate and build highly successful free societies.  It was the framework in which former pariahs like Germany, Italy, and Spain could be reintegrated into democratic Europe. And it was NATO that kept the feud between Greece and Turkey from escalating to warfare.  The enlargement of NATO can now serve to move the zone of stability eastward to Central Europe and thereby both prevent ethnic conflicts from escalating and forestall a scramble for new bilateral and multilateral pacts along the lines of the 1930's from occurring.  In fact, it is already happening. In anticipation of NATO membership, several Central and East European countries have recently settled long-standing disputes.  If NATO were not to enlarge, however, the countries between Germany and Russia would inevitably seek other means to protect themselves. The question for today is not, as is often assumed, enlarge NATO or remain the same. The status quo is simply not an option.  Finally, there is the moral argument for enlargement. For 40 years the United States loudly proclaimed its solidarity with the captive nations who were under the heel of communist oppressors. Now that most of them have cast off their shackles, it is our responsibility to live up to our pledges to readmit them into the West through NATO and the European Union when they are fully qualified.  NATO enlargement, of course, like any venture, is not cost-free. Earlier this year the Pentagon issued a study that estimated the cost to the United States to be around $200 million per year for 10 years. Other estimates by the Congressional Budget Office and by the Rand Corp. have varied considerably, according to risk assumptions. At the July NATO Summit in Madrid, the North Atlantic Council directed the Alliance to come up with a definitive cost estimate for the NATO ministerial meeting in December.  Whatever the final, authoritative cost estimate turns out to be, we must be certain that our current allies, and our future allies, pay their fair share of the enlargement costs.  Similarly, before we in the Senate vote on whether or not to admit Poland, the Czech Republic, and Hungary to NATO, we must settle what we plan to do in Bosnia after the expiration of the mandate for SFOR in June 1998. That in itself is an immensely complicated topic, for which there is inadequate time to discuss today. After my latest trip to Bosnia at the end of August, I am more convinced than ever that we are making progress and that we must not abandon the international effort to reach a lasting, peaceful, and just solution for that troubled land. But whatever post-SFOR plan we hammer out, it must be done on the basis of sharing the risks and costs with our European allies and with non-NATO contributors to SFOR.  NATO enlargement need not adversely affect our relations with Russia. In fact, we must redouble our peaceful engagement with Russia in the hope that its nascent democracy and free market system will mature sufficiently so that some day it may fully join the Western world. The NATO-Russia Founding Act of May 1997 is a significant step in the right direction.  Enlargement plans have been accompanied by a redefinition of NATO's mission and force posture. The alliance's primary mission remains the same: treating an attack on one member as an attack on all, and responding through the use of armed force if necessary.  NATO's new strategic concept emphasizes rapid and flexible deployment. The three new members, plus other countries like Slovenia and Romania in the near future, will enhance NATO's ability to project power, if necessary, into crisis areas like the Middle East.  In addition, in the current post-cold war situation, missions like peacekeeping, sometimes in cooperation with non-NATO powers, have become possible. The SFOR joint effort in Bosnia with Russia and several other non-NATO countries, which I mentioned earlier, is an excellent example.  NATO enlargement corresponds to America's security requirements in the 21st century. As long as the costs of enlargement are equitably shared among current and future NATO members, and as long as we have agreed upon a fair and coherent plan for Bosina after SFOR, I believe that my Senate colleagues will vote to ratify NATO enlargement when it comes before us next spring.                               Exhibit 1Statement by Secretary of State Madeleine K. Albright before the Senate               Foreign Relations Committee, October 7, 1997       Chairman Helms, Senator Biden, members of the committee: It      is with a sense of appreciation and anticipation that I come      before you to urge support for the admission of the Czech      Republic, Hungary and Poland to NATO.       Each of us today is playing our part in the long unfolding      story of America's modern partnership with Europe. That story      began not in Madrid, when the President and his fellow NATO      leaders invited these three new democracies to join our      Alliance, nor eight years ago when the Berlin Wall fell, but      half a century ago when your predecessors and mine dedicated      our nation to the goal of a secure, united Europe.       It was then that we broke with the American aversion to      European entanglements, an aversion which served us well in      our early days, but poorly when we became a global power. It      was then that we sealed a peacetime alliance open not only to      the nations which had shared our victory in World War II, but      to our former adversaries. It was then that this committee      unanimously recommended that the Senate approve the original      NATO treaty.       The history books will long record that day as among the      Senate's finest. On that day, the leaders of this body rose      above partisanship and they rose to the challenge of a      pivotal moment in the history of the world.       Mr. Chairman, I believe you are continuing that tradition      today. I thank you for your decision to hold these hearings      early, for the bipartisan manner in which you and Senator      Biden are conducting them, and for the serious and      substantive way in which you have framed our discussion.       I am honored to be part of what you have rightly called the      beginning of the process of advice and consent. And I am      hopeful that with your support, and after the full national      debate to which these hearings will contribute, the Senate      will embrace the addition of new members to NATO. It would be      fitting if this renewal of our commitment to security in      Europe could come early next year, as Congress celebrates the      50th anniversary of its approval of the Marshall Plan.       As I said, and as you can see, I am very conscious of      history today. I hope that you and your colleagues will look      back as I have on the deliberations of 1949, for they address      so many of the questions I know you have now: How much will a      new alliance cost and what are its benefits? Will it bind us      to go to war? Will it entangle us in far away quarrels?       We should take a moment to remember what was said then      about the alliance we are striving to renew and expand today.       Senator Vandenberg, Chairman Helms' extraordinary      predecessor, predicted that NATO would become ``the greatest      war deterrent in history.'' He was right. American forces      have never had to fire a shot to defend a NATO ally.       This Committee, in its report to the Senate on the NATO      treaty, predicted that it would ``free the minds of men in      many nations from a haunting sense of insecurity, and enable      them to work and plan with that confidence in the future      which is essential to economic recovery and progress.'' Your      predecessors were right. NATO gave our allies time to rebuild      their economies. It helped reconcile their ancient      animosities. And it made possible an unprecedented era of      unity in Western Europe.       President Truman said that the NATO pact ``will be a      positive, not a negative, influence     for peace, and its influence will be felt not only in the      area it specifically covers but throughout the world.'' And      he was right, too. NATO gave hope to democratic forces in      West Germany that their country would be welcome and secure      in our community if they kept making the right choices.      Ultimately, it helped bring the former fascist countries into      a prosperous and democratic Europe. And it helped free the      entire planet from the icy grip of the Cold War.       Thanks in no small part to NATO, we live in a different      world. Our Soviet adversary has vanished. Freedom's flag has      been unfurled from the Baltics to Bulgaria. The threat of      nuclear war has sharply diminished. As I speak to you today,      our immediate survival is not at risk.       Indeed, you may ask if the principle of collective defense      at NATO's heart is relevant to the challenges of a wider and      freer Europe. You may ask why, in this time of relative      peace, are we so focused on security?       The answer is, we want the peace to last. We want freedom      to endure. And we believe there are still potential threats      to our security emanating from European soil.       You have asked me, Mr. Chairman, what these threats are. I      want to answer as plainly as I can.       First, there are the dangers of Europe's past. It is easy      to forget this, but for centuries virtually every European      nation treated virtually every other as a military threat.      That pattern was broken only when NATO was born and only in      the half of Europe NATO covered. With NATO, Europe's armies      prepared to fight beside their neighbors, not against them;      each member's security came to depend on cooperation with      others, not competition.       That is one reason why NATO remains essential, even though      the Cold War is over. It is also one reason why we need a      larger NATO, so that the other half of Europe is finally      embedded in the same cooperative structure of military      planning and preparation.       A second set of dangers lies in Europe's present. Because      of conflict in the Balkans and the former Soviet Union,      Europe has already buried more victims of war since the      Berlin Wall fell than in all the years of the Cold War. It is      sobering to recall that this violence has its roots in the      same problems of shattered states and hatred among ethnic      groups that tyrants exploited to start this century's great      wars.       Finally, Mr. Chairman, and most important, we must consider      the dangers of Europe's future. By this I mean direct threats      against the soil of NATO members that a collective defense      pact is designed to meet. Some are visible on Europe's      horizon, such as the threat posed by rogue states with      dangerous weapons that might have Europe within their range      and in their sights. Others may not seem apparent today, in      part because the existence of NATO has helped to deter them.      But they are not unthinkable.       Within this category lie questions about the future of      Russia. We have an interest in seeing Russian democracy      endure. We are doing all we can with our Russian partners to      see that it does. And we have many reasons to be optimistic.      At the same time, one should not dismiss the possibility that      Russia could return to the patterns of its past. By engaging      Russia and enlarging NATO, we give Russia every incentive to      deepen its commitment to democracy and peaceful relations      with neighbors, while closing the avenue to more destructive      alternatives.       We do not know what other dangers may arise 10, 20, or even      50 years from now. We do know enough from history and human      experience to believe that a grave threat, if allowed to      arise, would arise. We know that whatever the future may      hold, it will be in our interest to have a vigorous and      larger alliance with those European democracies that share      our values and our determination to defend them.       We recognize NATO expansion involves a solemn expansion of      American responsibilities in Europe. It does not bind us to      respond to every violent incident by going to war. But it      does oblige us to consider an armed attack against one ally      an attack against all and to respond with such action as we      deem necessary, including the use of force, to restore the      security of the North Atlantic area.       As Americans, we take our commitments seriously and we do      not extend them lightly. Mr. Chairman, you and I do not agree      on everything, but we certainly agree that any major      extension of American commitments must serve America's      strategic interests.       Let me explain why welcoming the Czech Republic, Hungary      and Poland into NATO meets that test.       First, a larger NATO will make us safer by expanding the      area in Europe where wars simply do not happen. This is the      productive paradox at NATO's heart: By imposing a price on      aggression, it deters aggression. By making clear that we      will fight, if necessary, to defend our allies, it makes it      less likely our troops will ever be called upon to do so.       Now, you may say that no part of Europe faces any immediate      threat of armed attack today. That is true. And I would say      that the purpose of NATO enlargement is to keep it that way.      Senator Vandenberg said it in 1949: ``[NATO] is not built to      stop a war after it starts, although its potentialities in      this regard are infinite. It is built to stop wars before      they start.''       It is also fair to ask if it is in our vital interest to      prevent conflict in central Europe. There are those who imply      it is not. I'm sure you have even heard a few people trot out      what I call the ``consonant cluster clause,'' the myth that      in times of crisis Americans will make no sacrifice to defend      a distant city with an unpronounceable name, that we will      protect the freedom of Strasbourg but not Szczecin,      Barcelona, but not Brno.       Let us not deceive ourselves. The United States is a      European power. We have an interest not only in the lands      west of the Oder river, but in the fate of the 200 million      people who live in the nations between the Baltic and Black      Seas. We waged the Cold War in part because these nations      were held captive. We fought World War II in part because      these nations had been invaded.       Now that these nations are free, we want them to succeed      and we want them to be safe, whether they are large or small.      For if there were a major threat to the security of their      region, if we were to wake up one morning to the sight of      cities being shelled and borders being overrun, I am certain      that we would choose to act, enlargement or no enlargement.      Expanding NATO now is simply the surest way to prevent that      kind of threat from arising, and thus the need to make that      kind of choice.       Mr. Chairman, the second reason why enlargement passes the      test of national interest is that it will make NATO stronger      and more cohesive. The Poles, Hungarians and Czechs are      passionately committed to NATO and its principles of shared      responsibility. Experience has taught them to believe in a      strong American leadership role in Europe. Their forces have      risked their lives alongside ours from the Gulf War to      Bosnia. Just last month, Czech soldiers joined our British      allies in securing a police station from heavily armed      Bosnian Serb extremists.       Mr. Chairman, I know you have expressed concern that      enlargement could dilute NATO by adding too many members and      by involving the alliance in too many missions. Let me assure      you that we invited only the strongest candidates to join the      Alliance. And nothing about enlargement will change NATO's      core mission, which is and will remain the collective defense      of NATO soil.       At the same time, it is important to remember that NATO has      always served a political function as well. It binds our      allies to us just as it binds us to our allies. So when you      consider the candidacy of the Czech Republic, Hungary and      Poland, Mr. Chairman, I ask you to consider this:       When peace is threatened somewhere in the world and we      decide it is in our interest to act, here are three nations      we have been able to count on to be with us. In the fight      against terror and nuclear proliferation, here are three      nations we have been able to count on. In our effort to      reform the UN, here are three nations we have been able to      count on. When we speak out for human rights around the      world, here are three nations we will always be able to count      on.       Here are three nations that know what it means to lose      their freedom and who will do what it takes to defend it.      Here are three democracies that are ready to do their      dependable part in the common enterprise of our alliance of      democracies.       Mr. Chairman, the third reason why a larger NATO serves our      interests is that the very promise of it gives the nations of      central and eastern Europe an incentive to solve their own      problems. To align themselves with NATO, aspiring countries      have strengthened their democratic institutions. They have      made sure that soldiers serve civilians, not the other way      around. They have signed 10 major accords that taken together      resolve virtually every old ethnic and border dispute in the      region, exactly the kind of disputes that might have led to      future Bosnias. In fact, the three states we have invited to      join NATO have resolved every outstanding dispute of this      type.       I have been a student of central European history and I      have lived some of it myself. When I see Romanians and      Hungarians building a genuine friendship after centuries of      enmity, when I see Poles, Ukrainians and Lithuanians forming      joint military units after years of suspicion, when I see      Czechs and Germans overcoming decades of mistrust, when I see      central Europeans confident enough to improve their political      and economic ties with Russia, I know something remarkable is      happening.       NATO is doing for Europe's east precisely what it did--     precisely what this Committee predicted it would do--for      Europe's west after World War II. It is helping to vanquish      old hatreds, to promote integration and to create a secure      environment for economic prosperity. This is another reminder      that the contingencies we do not want our troops to face,      such as ethnic conflict, border skirmishes, and social unrest      are far more easily avoided with NATO enlargement than      without it.       In short, a larger NATO will prevent conflict, strengthen      NATO, and protect the gains of stability and freedom in      central and eastern Europe. That is the strategic rationale.      But I would be disingenuous if I did not tell you that I see      a moral imperative as well. For this is a policy that should      appeal to our hearts as well as to our heads, to our sense of      what is right as well as to our sense of what is smart.       NATO defines a community of interest among the free nations      of North America and Europe that both preceded and outlasted      the Cold War. America has long stood for the proposition that      this Atlantic community should not be artificially divided      and that its nations should be free to shape their destiny.      We have long argued that the nations of     central and eastern Europe belong to the same democratic      family as our allies in western Europe.       We often call them ``former communist countries,'' and that      is true in the same sense that America is a ``former British      colony.'' Yes, the Czechs, Poles, and Hungarians were on the      other side of the Iron Curtain during the Cold War. But we      were surely on the same side in the ways that truly count.       As Americans, we should be heartened today that so many of      Europe's new democracies wish to join the institutions      Americans did so much to build. They are our friends and we      should be proud to welcome them home.       We should also think about what would happen if we were to      turn them away. That would mean freezing NATO at its Cold War      membership and preserving the old Iron Curtain as its eastern      frontier. It would mean locking out a whole group of      otherwise qualified democracies simply because they were      once, against their will, members of the Warsaw Pact.       Why would America choose to be allied with Europe's old      democracies forever, but its new democracies never? There is      no acceptable, objective answer to that question. Instead, it      would probably be said that we blocked the aspirations of our      would-be allies because Russia objected. And that, in turn,      could cause confidence to crumble in central Europe, leading      to a search for security by other means, including costly      arms buildups and competition among neighbors.       We have chosen a better way. We have chosen to look at the      landscape of the new Europe and to ask a simple question:      Which of these nations that are so clearly important to our      security are ready and able to contribute to our security?      The answer to that question is before you today, awaiting      your affirmation.       I said at the outset, Mr. Chairman, that there are weighty      voices on both sides of this debate. There are legitimate      concerns with which we have grappled along the way, and that      I expect you to consider fully as well. Let me address a few.       First, we all want to make sure that the costs of expansion      are distributed fairly. Last February, at the behest of      Congress and before the Alliance had decided which nations to      invite to membership, the Administration made a preliminary      estimate of America's share. Now that we have settled on      three candidates, we are working with our allies to produce a      common estimate by the December meeting of the North Atlantic      Council. At this point, the numbers we agree upon as 16      allies are needed prior to any further calculations made in      Washington.       I know you are holding separate hearings in which my      Pentagon colleagues will go into this question in detail. But      I will say this: I am convinced that the cost of expansion is      real but affordable. I am certain our prospective allies are      willing and able to pay their share, because in the long run      it will be cheaper for them to upgrade their forces within      the alliance than outside it. As Secretary of State, I will      insist that our old allies share this burden fairly. That is      what NATO is all about.       I know there are serious people who estimate that a larger      NATO will cost far more than we have anticipated. The key      fact about our estimate is that it is premised on the      current, favorable security environment in Europe. Obviously,      if a grave threat were to arise, the cost of enlargement      would rise. But then so would the cost of our entire defense      budget.       In any case, there are budgetary constraints in all 16 NATO      democracies that will prevent costs from ballooning. That is      why the main focus of our discussion, Mr. Chairman, and in      our consultations with our allies, needs to be on defining      the level of military capability we want our old and new      allies to have in this favorable environment, and then making      sure that they commit to that level. We must spend no more      than we must, but no less than we need to keep NATO strong.       Another common concern about NATO enlargement is that it      might damage our cooperation with a democratic Russia.      Russian opposition to NATO enlargement is real. But we should      see it for what it is: a product of old misperceptions about      NATO and old ways of thinking about its former satellites in      central Europe. Instead of changing our policies to      accommodate Russia's outdated fears, we need to encourage      Russia's more modern aspirations.       This means that we should remain Russia's most steadfast      champion whenever it seeks to define its greatness by joining      international institutions, opening its markets and      participating constructively in world affairs. It means we      should welcome Russia's decision to build a close partnership      with NATO, as we did in the NATO-Russia Founding Act.       But when some Russian leaders suggest that a larger NATO is      a threat, we owe it candor to say that is false--and to base      our policies on what we know to be true. When they imply that      central Europe is special, that its nations still are not      free to choose their security arrangements, we owe it to      candor to say that times have changed, and that no nation can      assert its greatness at the expense of its neighbors. We do      no favor to Russian democrats and modernizers to suggest      otherwise.       I believe our approach is sound and producing results. Over      the past year, against the backdrop of NATO enlargement,      reformers have made remarkable gains in the Russian      government. We have agreed to pursue deeper arms reductions.      Our troops have built a solid working relationship on the      ground in Bosnia. Russia was our full partner at the Summit      of the Eight in Denver and it has joined the Paris Club of      major international lenders.       What is more, last week in New York we signed documents      that should pave the way for the Russian Duma to ratify the      START II treaty. While this prospect is still by no means      certain, it would become far less so if we gave the Duma any      reason to think it could hold up NATO enlargement by holding      up START II.       As you know Mr. Chairman, last week, NATO and Russia held      the first ministerial meeting of their Permanent Joint      Council. This council gives us an invaluable mechanism for      building trust between NATO and Russia through dialogue and      transparency.       I know that some are concerned NATO's new relationship with      Russia will actually go too far. You have asked me for an      affirmation, Mr. Chairman, that the North Atlantic Council      remains NATO's supreme decision making body. Let me say it      clearly: It does and it will. The NATO-Russia Founding Act      gives Russia no opportunity to dilute, delay or block NATO      decisions. NATO's allies will always meet to agree on every      item on their agenda before meeting with Russia. And the      relationship between NATO and Russia will grow in importance      only to the extent Russia uses it constructively.       The Founding Act also does not limit NATO's ultimate      authority to deploy troops or nuclear weapons in order to      meet its commitments to new and old members. All it does is      to restate unilaterally existing NATO policy: that in the      current and foreseeable security environment, we have no      plan, no need, and no intention to station nuclear weapons in      the new member countries, nor do we contemplate permanently      stationing substantial combat forces. The only binding limits      on conventional forces in Europe will be set as we adapt the      CFE treaty, with central European countries and all the other      signatories at the table, and we will proceed on the      principle of reciprocity.       Another important concern is that enlargement may create a      new dividing line in Europe between a larger NATO and the      countries that will not join in the first round. We have      taken a range of steps to ensure this does not happen.       President Clinton has pledged that the first new members      will not be the last. NATO leaders will consider the next      steps in the process of enlargement before the end of the      decade. We have strengthened NATO's Partnership for Peace      program. We have created a new Euro-Atlantic Partnership      Council, through which NATO and its democratic partners      throughout Europe will shape the missions we undertake      together. We have made it clear that the distinction between      the nations NATO invited to join in Madrid and those it did      not is based purely on objective factors--unlike the      arbitrary line that would divide Europe if NATO stood still.       Among the countries that still aspire to membership, there      is enthusiastic support for the process NATO has begun. Had      you seen the crowds that cheered the President in Romania in      July, had you been with me when I spoke to the leaders of      Lithuania and Slovenia, you would have sensed how eager these      nations are to redouble their efforts.       They understand a simple fact: With enlargement, no new      democracy is permanently excluded; without enlargement, every      new democracy would be permanently excluded. The most      important thing the Senate can do to reassure them now is to      get the ball rolling by ratifying the admission of the first      three candidates.       Mr. Chairman, a final concern I wish to address has to do      with Bosnia.       Some have suggested that our debate on NATO enlargement      simply cannot be separated from our actions and decisions in      that troubled country. I agree with them. Both enlargement      and our mission in Bosnia are aimed at building a stable      undivided Europe. Both involve NATO and its new partners to      the east.       It was our experience in Bosnia that proved the fundamental      premise of our enlargement strategy: there are still threats      to peace and security in Europe that only NATO can meet. It      was in Bosnia that our prospective allies proved they are      ready to take responsibility for the security of others. It      was in Bosnia that we proved NATO and Russian troops can work      together.       We cannot know today if our mission in Bosnia will achieve      all its goals, for that ultimately depends on the choices the      Bosnian people will make. But we can say that whatever may      happen, NATO's part in achieving the military goals of our      mission has been a resounding success. Whatever may happen,      our interest in a larger, stronger NATO will endure long      after the last foreign soldier has left Bosnia.       We can also say that NATO will remain the most powerful      instrument we have for building effective military coalitions      such as SFOR. At the same time, Bosnia does not by itself      define the future of a larger NATO. NATO's fundamental      purpose is collective defense against aggression. Its most      important aim, if I can paraphrase Arthur Vandenberg, is to      prevent wars before they start so it does not have to keep      the peace after they stop.       These are some of the principal concerns I wanted to      address today; I know you have many more questions and I look      forward to answering them all.       This discussion is just beginning. I am glad that it will      also involve other committees of the Senate, the NATO      Observers' Group and the House of Representatives. Most      important, I am glad it will involve the people of the United      States. For the commitment a larger NATO entails will only be      meaningful if the American people understand and accept it.       When these three new democracies join NATO in 1999, as I      trust they will, it will be a victory for us all, Mr.      Chairman. And on that day, we will be standing on the      shoulders of many.       We will be thankful to all those who prosecuted the Cold      War, to all those on both sides of the Iron Curtain who      believed that the goal of containment was to bring about the      day when the enlargement of our democratic community would be      possible.       We will be grateful to all those who championed the idea of      a larger NATO--not just President Clinton, or President      Havel, or President Walesa, but members of Congress from both      parties who voted for resolutions urging the admission of      these three nations. We will owe a debt to the Republican      members who made NATO enlargement part of their Contract with      America.       Today, all of our allies and future allies are watching you      for one simple reason. The American Constitution is unique in      the power it grants to the legislative branch over foreign      policy, especially over treaties. In this matter, Mr.      Chairman, members of the Committee, you and the American      people you represent are truly in the driver's seat.       That is as it should be. In fact, I enjoy going to Europe      and telling our allies: ``This is what we want to do, but      ultimately, it will be up to our Senate and our people to      decide.'' I say that with pride because it tells them      something about America's faith in the democratic process.       But I have to tell you that I say it with confidence as      well. I believe we will stand together, Mr. Chairman, when      the time comes for the Senate to decide, because I know that      the policy we ask you to embrace is a policy that the      Administration and Congress shaped together, and because I am      certain that it advances the fundamental interests of the      United States.       Thank you very much.                          ____________________
