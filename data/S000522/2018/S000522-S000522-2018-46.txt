Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentlewoman for her very strong and powerful statement.  Mr. Speaker, I now yield to Robert Pittenger from North Carolina, who is the author of the No Abortion Bonds Act, a bill that would close loopholes in the Tax Code that allow abortion providers to finance new clinics and facilities with local bonds that are exempt from Federal taxes. Congressman Pittenger serves on the Financial Services Committee.
