Chairman, I rise on behalf of this bill.  What is this bill? It is the bill that the gentleman from Georgia (Mr. Norwood) got on the floor and said he supports. It is a bill that, in 1999, 275 of us voted for in a bipartisan fashion, and in a bipartisan fashion for 24 months we have labored to pass that bill. We did pass it, and it was bottled up in conference committee because the Republican leadership did not want it to become law.  The gentleman from Georgia (Mr. Norwood) wants a bill that can be signed. I agree. But the way to get a bill that can be signed is to show where the bill ought to be, and those 275 of us for the underlying bill should vote for that bill today and send it to conference, have the conference work on it, and let the President come to the conference; not, with all due respect to my friend, the gentleman from Georgia (Charlie Norwood), one Member, but to the conference, to the Senate andHouse, after they have worked their will and passed a real Patients' Bill of Rights.                              {time}  1530  Let us adopt the base bill and reject the three amendments.  Mr. Chairman, the American people need and deserve a real Patients' Bill of Rights.  This legislation ensures that doctors make medical decisions, not insurance company bureaucrats.  It gives every American the right to choose his or her own doctor. It ensures broad access to specialists. It prohibits incentives to limit care. And, yes, it allows patients to hold managed care companies accountable when they make decisions that injure or kill.  Responsibility! What's more American than that? Yet, the Republican leadership has fought legal liability tooth and nail.  They said strong liability provisions would cause insurance premiums to skyrocket. But that didn't happen in Texas, where then-Governor Bush let a Patients' Bill of Rights become the law in 1997 without his signature.  They claimed that managed care liability would cause people to lose their insurance. But that didn't happen in Texas.  And they said strong liability provisions would open the floodgates of litigation. But that didn't happen. Only 17 lawsuits have been filed under the Texas law in 4 years.  Today, they're trying to gut meaningful reform with these amendments.  Arbitrary damage caps are a perfect example. I'm always amazed that some of the same people who think a jury is perfectly competent to decide whether a man or woman lives or dies is somehow incompetent to decide whether a person has been injured by negligence and the extent of the injured party's damage.  I urge my colleagues to vote for this bipartisan bill and to vote against these amendments. Let's level the playing field between patients and their doctors and managed care companies.
