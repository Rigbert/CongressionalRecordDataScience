Mr. Speaker, today I am introducing legislation to simplify the formula under which ski areas pay rental fees to the United States for the use of national forest lands.  Nationwide, there are 132 ski areas on national forest land occupying 90,000 acres, or a mere one-twentieth of 1 percent of the National Forest System. For this use, the ski industry paid an estimated $20 million in rental fees in 1994.  This new fee system passed the Senate during the 102d Congress but time ran out before the House could consider the legislation. At that time, a Congressional Budget Office review determined that the new fee system was revenue neutral to the United States. The new fee proposal is intended to return at least the same rental dollars to the U.S. Treasury as the current system created by the Forest Service. It will also guarantee increasing revenues in the future by utilizing ski area gross receipts as the measure for determining rental fees. Therefore, as ski area revenues grow, so will the return to the public for the use of those Federal lands.  Furthermore, this legislation will assist in meeting our goals of reducing the size of the Forest Service by eliminating significant management problems with their existing fee system. The existing system is encompassed in approximately 40 pages of the Forest Service manual and handbook. The new system would change that by reducing the fee calculation to a simple formula based on gross revenue from clearly defined sources. This new system will greatly reduce bookkeeping and administrative tasks for both the Forest Service and the ski areas.  This bill enjoys bipartisan support and I hope others will join us in supporting this sensible and efficient proposal which provides fairness to ski areas and the United States regarding rental fees and, at the same time, helps to downsize the Federal Government. This bill is intended to serve as a starting point to begin debate on this issue. I hope to hold hearings on this proposal soon after the recess and anticipate reporting this legislation out of our committee quickly.  Mr. Speaker, I would also like to advise the House that I intend to consider a proposal for ski area permittees to purchase the Forest Service land on which they operate. Such a move toward privatization would further our goal of downsizing government and thus reduce the size of the Forest Service budget. If we are going to achieve these goals, we need to consider every aspect of Federal land management. Therefore, the committee is in the process of reviewing a proposal to sell certain ski areas on the National Forest System to the private entities that operate them. While we are developing this proposal, we will be hearing from those ski areas that want to purchase the Federal land they operate on as well as State governments, local governments, and others affected by this proposal.  Presently ski areas have permits from the Forest Service that allow them to operate for up to 40 years. The Forest Service reviewed these areas and designated them as recreation sites utilizing the NEPA process. There is no question that the intention of the Forest Service is to maintain these sites as ski areas and that no other use is intended. This further supports the need for us to review privatization of these lands now dedicated to this recreational use. Many of these sites have been permitted ski areas for 30 years or more. If we have private individuals prepared to purchase the Federal lands that they operate a ski area on, it is logical that we appraise that land and sell it to the operator and remove the Federal management responsibility.  The new fee system legislation that I have introduced today is a first step toward reducing Federal management responsibility and costs associated with ski areas on Federal land. However, I also intend to consider the next logical step of removing all Federal management and costs.                          ____________________
