 Taxpayers need certainty and clarity from the enforcement agencies that they can rely upon, so they do not run afoul of the rules and operate plans in accordance with the requirements of the law. It would be unwise to exclude a particular type of arrangement from the rules governing tax shelters, however, based upon some the abuses we have seen. But we can urge the Treasury Department to provide clearer guidance on the many welfare benefit plan arrangements. I am willing to join you in writing the Treasury Department to ask them for clearer guidance as soon as practicable.
