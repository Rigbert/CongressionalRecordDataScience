Speaker, I rise today to pay tribute to a gentleman who has spent his life serving his country, his union, and his community. Until his recent retirement, Wesley Miller was the first and only recording secretary the Toledo area UAW-CAP Council has had in its 27 years. Wesley has also served as president of UAW local 48 at the National Castings Corp. and more recently, as president of that local's retiree chapter.  Born in Columbus, OH, Wesley had the good sense to move to Toledo in 1952. During the Second World War, he served his country as a staff sergeant in the Air Force stationed in New Guinea. Wesley married Clara Furgeson in 1960 and can boast of five children, nine grandchildren, four great grandchildren, and counting. Wesley's leadership in his union and his community has helped to improve the lives of all the citizens of Toledo.  Wesley Miller deserves our thanks and our best wishes.                          ____________________
