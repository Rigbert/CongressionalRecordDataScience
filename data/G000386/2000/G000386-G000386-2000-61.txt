 President, listen to the people who actually know how it is in the trenches collecting child support. Don't listen to inside-Washington special interests. Don't listen to academics who have no real world knowledge on this subject.  I would add a word about cracking down on the very wealthy individuals who abuse the bankruptcy system. If you listened to the Senator from Minnesota last night, you might have had the impression that the Homestead exemption is a giant loophole that this bill does not deal with. We have had the General Accounting Office look at the question of how frequently the Homestead exemption is abused by wealthy people in bankruptcy. The General Accounting Office found that less than 1 percent of bankruptcy filings in States where there are unlimited Homestead exemptions involving homesteads of over $100,000. That means 99 percent of bankruptcy filings were not abusive. So this is not a loophole. We might say it is a little tiny pinhole.  But there is a real problem with very wealthy people filing for bankruptcy under chapter 11, which is the chapter of the bankruptcy code normally left for corporations. Because chapter 11 is not designed for individuals, there are numerous loopholes that allow the wealthy to live high on the hog while paying nothing to their creditors. This bill before the Senate fixes this very major problem so these wealthy people will know they are no longer going to get off scot-free.  This bill combats abuse wherever we find it. The Homestead exemption is capped at $500,000 for homes purchased within 2 years prior to the declaration of bankruptcy. The chapter 11 loophole is closed. This is what real reform is all about.  In sum, in this conference report we preserve the proconsumer amendment adopted in the Senate. We crack down hard on abuses by the wealthy. We help child support claimants in a very major way. This bill is good for the American consumer.  I yield the floor.
