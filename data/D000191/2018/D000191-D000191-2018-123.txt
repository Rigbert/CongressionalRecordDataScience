Speaker, on March 21, 2018, I was unavoidably delayed and not present for the following votes. Had I been present, I would have voted: on Roll Call Vote 120, on Motion to Recommit With Instructions to H.R. 5247, I would have voted Aye, and on Roll Call Vote 121, on Passage of H.R. 5247, I would have voted No.                          ____________________
