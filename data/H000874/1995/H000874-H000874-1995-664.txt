Speaker, I yield 1 minute to the gentlewoman from Connecticut [Ms. Rosa DeLauro], one of our chief deputy whips.  Ms. DeLAURO. Mr. Speaker, I rise today in support of H.R. 1, the Congressional Accountability Act and to commend my friend and colleague from Connecticut [Chris Shays] for his determination to see this important legislation come to pass. I also want to pay tribute to former Democratic Congressman Dick Swett of New Hampshire who worked tirelessly in the last Congress on behalf of this common sense legislation. I might add that it was a Democratic Congress which acted to advance this legislation, only to see it blocked by Republicans in the other body.  The Congressional Accountability Act simply requires that Congress abide by all the laws it passes. It's a proposal that is long overdue and one that will move Government closer to the people.  Politicians have set an unequal standard that put them above the people. That was wrong. And, it helps to account for the growing disaffection in the country. By passing this legislation, the people are one step closer to reclaiming this body, which has historically been the people's House. Let's pass the Congressional Accountability Act.
