 President, I would like to start this morning by reading an excerpt from a 1998 memo from Gene Sperling to President Clinton. It relates to a minimum-wage proposal similar to the one we are considering today. Here is what he wrote:       Your entire economic team believes that this approach is      too aggressive and are concerned that . . . [it] could prove      damaging to employment prospects of low-skilled workers, as      well as to the general macroeconomic performance of the      economy.  But the memo noted there was a plus side to supporting that proposal. ``[It] would unify [the] liberal wing of the Democratic party.''  Today feels like deejaa vu all over again because even though our constituents keep telling us they expect Washington to focus on jobs, that is clearly not what they are getting from the Senate. Instead, Senate Democrats are pushing legislation today that would cost as many as 1 million jobs in this country--legislation that the left flank of their party demands. That is their response to the pleas of our constituents to do something about jobs--a proposal that nonpartisan analysts tell us could cost jobs.  But then again, these are the same Washington Democrats who have been at the helm of our economy for 5\1/2\ years, the same ones who have been bragging about a recovery for the past 4.  We learned this morning the economy grew by just 0.1 percent--0.1 percent. So I can assure you that if this is the Democrats' idea of a recovery, the people in my State at least are not terribly impressed.
