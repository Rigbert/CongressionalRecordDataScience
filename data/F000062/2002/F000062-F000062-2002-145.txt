 The report points that there will be a 20-percent increase in public drinking water wells contaminated with benzene if a significant amount of ethanol is used. Of course, benzene is a known carcinogen.  What is interesting in the study, it points out that ethanol causes the components of gasoline to break apart and therefore more easily seep into ground water from leaking tanks. We all know gasoline leaks. It is saying it aids in the release of benzene, a component of gasoline.  I wonder if the junior Senator from California heard of that California report.
