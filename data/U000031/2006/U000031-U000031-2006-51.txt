Chairman, I rise in support of the legislation  Mr. Chairman, I came to the Congress in 1987--the 100th Congress.  We had a number of stars in our freshman class--  Jim Bunning--A Hall of Fame baseball pitcher,  Fred Grundy--an accomplished actor,  Amo Houghton--The 1st CEO of a Fortune 500 Company elected to the Congress,  John Lewis--a hero of the Civil Rights movement who plotted and marched with Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr.  As colleagues, John Lewis and I have travelled the roads back to Birmingham, Montgomery and Selma. We stopped along the way numerous times and heard the stories relived.  We travelled the bus route of Rosa Parks and we stopped at the church which had been bombed killing those sweet little girls.  I credit those brave Members of Congress that took action in the 1960's that addressed some of the racism and bigotry that still stain and haunt our history of a just nation.  Passage of civil rights legislation which included the Voting Rights Act was the right step.  Today, it's still not hard to find racism and discrimination. Yes, folks are still trying to prevent Americans from participating in our electoral process.  About a year ago, I sat on the House floor with the Dean of the House and my respected colleague, John Dingell, from the great State of Michigan.  We looked at the Congressional Record and the names of Members of Congress that voted for and against the different civil rights bills of the 1960's.  I was surprised to see how some of our former colleagues voted.  And, my bet is, that some of those that voted no then, would have the courage to vote yes now. That they would see the positive impact that those bills have brought about.  Mr. Speaker, we are the Peoples House--but we cannot be the Peoples House if we construct barriers for the people to participate.  The Voting Rights Act provides protections and removes the barriers. It needs to be extended.
