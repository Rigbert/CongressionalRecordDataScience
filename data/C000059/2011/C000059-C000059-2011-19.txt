Speaker, I rise today to honor and pay tribute to Daniel ``Dan'' Sisemore who passed away on November 11, 2011 in Newport Beach, California. Dan was a pillar of the community in Corona, California and he will be deeply missed.  Dan Sisemore was born on November 9, 1934, in California. In 1952, Dan and his father began work in the construction industry. With just one truck they founded the company More Truck Lines. The business grew and in 1969 they started All American Asphalt with an asphalt plant in Westminster, California. The company has grown exponentially over the years and now owns an aggregate quarry in Corona, California and six asphalt plants throughout the region. All American Asphalt is not only a material supplier but also a fully integrated road construction firm. All American Asphalt employs 850 employees, all of whom took inspiration from the founder and leader: Dan Sisemore. Dan was a visionary in the industry and the quintessential American entrepreneur.  Dan's hobbies and interests included golf, fishing, hunting and horse racing. He enjoyed the desert and spending time with friends at the beach. The way in which Dan lived his life should serve as reminder to others that the power of an individual with drive, perseverance and a stellar work-ethic can do great things.  Dan was the loving husband to Betty, brother to Cindy, father to Toni, Tracy, Donna and Mark and devoted uncle to Bob and Don. He was affectionately known to his grandchildren as ``Papa.''  On Saturday, November 19, 2011, a memorial service celebrating Dan's extraordinary life will be held. Dan will always be remembered for his incredible contributions to business, his work ethic, generosity, and love of family. His dedication to his work, family and community are a testament to a life lived well and a legacy that will continue. I extend my condolences to Dan's family and friends; although Dan may be gone, the light and goodness he brought to the world remains and will never be forgotten.                          ____________________
