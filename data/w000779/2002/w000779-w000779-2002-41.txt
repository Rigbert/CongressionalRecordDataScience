Since 1995, the National Center for Assisted Living has sponsored National Assisted Living Week to emphasize the importance of this service that nearly 1 million seniors rely on for long-term care.  Assisted living offers hope to seniors who can no longer live independently at home but do not need the level of care provided by nursing facilities. In assisted living facilities, seniors find dedicated caregivers to provide assistance in the activities of daily living in a setting that truly becomes a home. It is predicted that the demand for assisted living will continue to grow as more and more seniors and their families seek out home-like independent living with the benefits of 24-hour supervision.  The theme of this year's National Assisted Living Week is ``Honoring the Spirit of Our Nation,'' which is intended to honor the Nation's rekindled interest in our heritage and values. It is an appropriate theme because it celebrates the residents' lifetime of memories, devotions, and patriotism and the dedication and service of assisted living caregivers. The theme for National Assisted Living Week will highlight the variety of ways assisted living meets the different needs of seniors in our Nation.  I am proud that Oregon has led our Nation in the concept of assisted living. Assisted living has developed differently in each State and its importance in meeting the needs of seniors continues. I believe offering these choices for seniors is important in order to provide them with security, dignity, and independence. It is also important for us to continue to support options that allow seniors and their families a choice of settings in order to assure that they get the level of care they need and deserve.                          ____________________
