Chairman, make no mistake, a pattern is clearly emerging. The Republican soldiers in the Gingrich revolution have no respect whatsoever for freedom of expression in this country. If they can find an opportunity to close down speech and ideas which they find repulsive, they will grab at it. Six screwballs decide to burn the American flag, and the Gingrich revolutionaries want to amend the Bill of Rights for the first time in our history. Garrison Keillor makes fun of them on Prairie Home Companion, they want to close down National Public Radio.  The gentleman from Oklahoma [Mr. Istook] becomes exercised because some lobby group does not agree with him. He wants to close down any opportunity for them to receive Federal funds. And today the gentleman from Texas [Mr. Bonilla], who has an axe to grind with the National Education Association, said, I know how to take care of them, hit them in their tax status.  If your ideas are so good, so right, so American, why are you so afraid of freedom of expression? The National Education Association has said things that I disagree with, as have many of the organizations here. But to go after these organizations, to close down their operations, make them more expensive, impose more taxes on them is downright unAmerican.  It is the nature of politics. It is the nature of Government to have the free exchange of ideas. Why is it once the Republicans get in control they want to turn off the microphones? They want to shut down the presses. They want to stop the free exchange of ideas.  What are you afraid of? Let us defeat this terrible amendment.
