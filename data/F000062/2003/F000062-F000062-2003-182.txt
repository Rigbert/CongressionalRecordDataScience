  If the Senator from Ohio agrees, I am very happy to have my amendment modified to provide that the voucher recipients and the students in the control group be given the same test that all District public schools students are given.  With respect to this being done in the education committee, I probably agree, except it would probably get bogged down one way. The reason it is in the appropriations bill is because the Mayor has come to us and asked us for the additional money. The additional money is what brought this on. Once the additional money was in the bill, then the terms of the money came to bear and the bill had to be written.  It is not easy. There are powerful forces against it. People do not want to try it. I do. I hope a majority want to try it. We have tried to do the best we can.  Even more importantly, what has been developed here is a relationship between the city and Members of this Senate with this Mayor. I happen to respect this Mayor. I am a taxpaying citizen of this District. I have been so for 10 years. I used to go down the street where there was a pothole so big somebody plugged it up with a mattress. I am very pleased to say, Mr. Mayor, that pothole is gone now. The District is in much better shape. People are coming back to the District. He wants this.  The question was also raised, it is easy to do it here. I am not in my own jurisdiction. I tried to point out, the mayor of Oakland came to me in my own jurisdiction to do something that was a new model; I agreed to it. I am going to look at new models and try to support them where I can, also support teachers, also support Title I, and also support public education.         Amendment No. 1787 to amendment No. 1783, As Modified  I ask the Member from Ohio if he would be in agreement that we submit a modification and ask our amendment be modified to reflect that the test be given annually?  Mr. DeWINE. I would certainly have no objection to that. It at best is ambiguous. It is always good to clarify.
