Instead, the country witnessed a party line vote as all 54 Republican members of the Senate present that day voted against confirming this highly qualified African-American jurist to the federal bench. I believe that vote to have been unprecedented--the only party line vote to defeat a judicial nomination I can find in our history.  There was brief debate on this nomination and two others the night before the vote. At that time, I attempted, as best I could through questions in the limited opportunity allotted, to clarify the record of this outstanding judge with respect to capital punishment appeals and to outline his background and qualifications.  I noted that Justice White had, in fact, voted to uphold the imposition ofthe death penalty 41 times. I observed that other members of the Missouri Supreme Court, including members of the Court appointed by Republican governors, had similar voting records and more often than not agreed with Justice White, both when he voted to uphold the death penalty and when he joined with a majority of that Court to reverse and remand such cases for resentencing or a new trial. Of the 59 capital punishment cases that Justice White has reviewed, he voted with the majority of that Court 51 times--41 times to uphold the death penalty and 10 times to reverse for serious legal error.  As best I can determine, in only six of these 59 cases did Justice White dissent from the imposition of a death penalty, and in only three did he do so with a dissent that was not joined by other members of the court. That is hardly the record that the Senate was told about Monday and Tuesday of the first week in October, when it was told that Justice White was an anti-death penalty judge, someone who was ``procriminal and activist with a slant toward criminals,'' someone with ``a serious bias against a willingness to impose the death penalty,'' someone who seeks ``at every turn'' to provide opportunities for the guilty to ``escape punishment,'' and someone ``with a tremendous bent toward criminal activity.''  The opposition to Justice White presented a distorted view by concentrating on two lone dissents out of 59 capital punishment cases. Making matters worse, the legal issues involved in those cases were not even discussed. Instead, the opposition was concentrated on the gruesome facts of the crimes.  I believe it was another member of the Missouri Supreme Court, one of those appointed by a Republican governor of Missouri, who wrote in his own sole dissent in a gruesome case of kidnaping, rape, and murder of a teenage girl:       Occasionally, the heinousness of a crime, the seeming      certainty of the same result if the case is remanded and the      delay occasioned by a second remand tempt one to wink at      procedural defects. Nevertheless, the cornerstone of any      civilized system of justice is that the rules are applied      evenly to everyone no matter how despicable the crime.--State      v. Nunley, 923 S.W.2d 911, 927 (Mo. 1996) (Holstein, J.,      dissenting).  Indeed, in his dissent in State v. Johnson, Justice White makes a similar point when he notes:       This is a very hard case. If Mr. Johnson was in control of      his faculties when he went on this murderous rampage, then he      assuredly deserves the death sentence he was given. But the      question of what Mr. Johnson's mental status was on that      night is not susceptible of easy answers. . . . This is an      excellent example of why hard cases make bad law. While I      share the majority's horror at this carnage, I cannot uphold      this as an acceptable standard of representation for a      defendant accused of capital murder.--State v. Johnson, 968      S.W.2d 123, 138 (Mo. 1998).  Although you would never know the legal issue involved in this case from the discussion before the Senate, the appellate decision did not turn on the grizzly facts or abhorrence of the crimes, but difficult legal questions concerning the standard by which an appellate court should evaluate claims of ineffective assistance of counsel. Justice White sought to apply the standard set by the United States Supreme Court in Strickland v. Washington, 466 U.S. 668 (1984), and reiterated in Kyles v. Whitley, 514 U.S. 419 (1995). Thus, the dispute between Justice White and the majority was whether an appellant may succeed if he shows that there was a ``reasonable probability'' of a different result, or whether he is required to show that the counsel's unprofessional conduct was outcome-determinative and thus the ``most likely'' reason why his defense was unsuccessful. Indeed, the case turns on an issue similar to that being currently considered by the United States Supreme Court this term. Far from creating a ``new ground'' for appeal or urging a ``lower legal standard'' of review, Justice White's dissent sought to apply what he understood to be the current legal standard to the gruesome facts of a difficult case.  Likewise troubling was the use by those who opposed the nomination of Justice White's dissent in the Kinder case, a 1996 decision. State v. Kinder, 942 S.W.2d 313 (Mo. 1996). That case also arose from brutal crimes, which were, or course, detailed for the Senate. What is troubling is the characterization of the legal issue on appeal by Justice White's detractors. Justice White did not say that the case was ``contaminated by racial bias'' because the trial judge ``had indicated that he opposed affirmative action and had switched parties based on that.'' The dissent did not turn on the political affiliation of the judge or his opposition to affirmative action. In fact, Justice White expressly stated that the trial judge's position on affirmative action was ``irrelevant to the issue of bias.''  Rather, the point of the dissent was that the majority opinion was changing the law of Missouri by reinterpreting state law precedent and restricting it in an artificially truncated way to avoid the recusal of the trial judge, which Missouri law at that time required.  The case led to long and complicated opinions by the majority and dissent. The opposition to Justice White chose to characterize the case as if the trial judge was accused of racial bias merely for not favoring affirmative action policies. In fact, the trial judge was facing an election and had issued a press release less than a week before the defendant's trial. The defendant was an indigent, unemployed African-American man. The judge's statement read, in pertinent part:       The truth is that I have noticed in recent years that the      Democrat party places too much emphasis on representing      minorities such as homosexuals, people who don't want to      work, and people with a skin that's any color but white. . .      . While minorities need to be represented, or [sic] course, I      believe the time has come for us to place much more emphasis      and concern on the hardworking taxpayers in this country.--     Kinder, 942 S.W.2d at 321.  As Justice White's dissent correctly points out, the holding of the case rewrote Missouri Supreme Court precedent instead of following it. Without regard to the principles of stare decisis, following precedent, and avoiding judicial activism, the majority reversed Missouri law (without acknowledging that fact) to achieve a desired result. The majority opinion rests on the narrow proposition that only ``judicial statements'' that raise a doubt as to the judge's willingness to follow the law provide a basis for disqualification, and ``distinguished'' this case from controlling precedent because the evidence of racial bias was contained in what the majority characterized as a ``political statement.'' Justice Limbaugh, who had dissented from the earlier Missouri Supreme Court decision on which Justice White relied, wrote the majority opinion in Kinder, which stated:       To the extent the comments can be read to disparage      minorities, there is little point in defending them, even as      the political act they were intended to be. But they are a      political act, not a judicial one, and as such, they do not      necessarily have any bearing on the judge's in-court      treatment of minorities.--Id. The majority opinion created a      rule that consciously disregards political statements of a      judge evidencing racial bias.  In his dissent, Justice White, quoting from the earlier Missouri Supreme Court decision, wrote: ```[F]undamental fairness requires that the trial judge be free of the appearance of prejudice against the defendant as an individual and against the racial group on which the defendant is a member.'' He noted that ``conduct suggesting racial bias `undermines the credibility of the judicial system and opens the integrity of the judicial system to question.''' Kinder, 942 S.W.2d at 341, citing State v. Smulls, 935 S.W.2d 9, 25-27 (Mo. 1986).  I believe that fairminded people who read and consider Justice White's dissent in Kinder will appreciate the strength of his legal reasoning. Certainly that was the reaction of Stuart Taylor, Jr. in his article in the October 16 National Journal and of Benjamin Wittes in his October 13 column in the Washington Post. Through the Kinder decision, the Missouri Supreme Court has created new law that provides very narrow restrictions on judges' conduct. Indeed, a Missouri criminal trial judge could now apparently lead a KKK rally one night and spout racial hatred, epithets and calls for racial conflict, and preside over the criminal trial of an African-American defendant the next morning--so long as he did not say anything offensive as a ``judicial statement'' in connection with the trial.  Fairness and credibility are important values for all government actions, and especially important to the guarantee of due process that makes ourjustice system the best in the world. Those same qualities of fairness, credibility, and integrity are essential to the Senate confirmation process.  It is worth noting that many of the same critics of Justice White's opinion in the Kinder case adopt the opposite posture and a different standard when it comes to evaluating Judge Richard Paez, a nominee who has been held up without a vote for 44 months. Judge Paez is roundly criticized for a reference in a speech he gave in which he commented on the early stages of an initiative effort that later became Proposition 209 in California. Those who led the Republican fight against Justice White reverse themselves when it comes to opposing the Hispanic nominee from California and criticize him for much more circumspect comments predicting the likely reaction to that initiative in the Hispanic community. These critics would not only disqualify Judge Paez from hearing a case involving Proposition 209, but would disqualify him from confirmation as a federal appellate judge.  Justice White's detractors contend that they oppose ``judicial activism,'' which they define as a judge substituting his personal will for that of the legislature. However, in none of the cases on which they rely is a statute implicated. Instead, in each of these cases Justice White appears to be following controlling precedent. In the Kinder case, it is the majority that changed the law of Missouri. Likewise in the Johnson case, it was the majority that reached out to distinguish that case and alter the way in which the governing legal standard for review was to be applied.  Finally, the third case on which the opposition to Justice White relies, State v. Damask, 936 S.W.2d 565 (Mo. 1996), is not concerned with legislative action either. In this case, the Court upheld the constitutionality of law enforcement checkpoints without warrants or reasonable suspicion. The majority reached out to distinguish the case from governing precedent, changed the rules under which it viewed the governing facts, and challenged the factual basis on which the lower courts had based their conclusions.  In his dissent in Damask, Justice White relied on the authority of the United States Supreme Court in Delaware v. Prouse, 440 U.S. 648 (1979). See also Galberth v. U.S., 590 A.2d 990 (D.C. App. 1991). His ruling expressly recognizes the importance of combating drug trafficking and, relying on the record of the cases, concludes that the checkpoints were the types of discretionary investigatory stops forbidden by governing precedent. Justice White worried that these operations had not been approved by politically accountable public officials and that the courts should not substitute their judgment for law enforcement authorities and public officials who were responsible and accountable for designing such operations. See State v. Canton, 775 S.W.2d 352 (Mo. App. 1989); State v. Welch, 755 S.W.2d 624 (Mo. App. 1988); Note, ``The Constitutionality of Drug Enforcement Checkpoints in Missouri,'' 63 Mo. L. Rev. 263 (1998). I wonder how we all might feel if instead of seizing marijuana, the armed men in camouflage fatigues shining flashlights into the faces of motorists in an isolated area late at night were seizing firearms.  Another decision that has not been mentioned in the course of this debate on Justice White's nomination is the decision of the people of Missouri to retain Justice White as a member of their Supreme Court. Although initially appointed, pursuant to Missouri law Justice White went before the voters of Missouri in a retention election in 1996. I am informed that he received over 1.1 million votes and a favorable vote of 64.7 percent.  All of the cases on which the opposition to Justice White relied were decided before his hearing and before he was twice reported favorably by a bipartisan majority of the Senate Judiciary Committee in May 1998 and July 1999. Although Justice White was first nominated to the federal bench in 1997, the Judiciary Committee did not receive negative comments about him until quite recently. No law enforcement opposition of any kind was received by the Committee of the Senate in 1997 or 1998.  This year, Justice White was renominated with significant fanfare in January and major newspapers in the state reported on the status on the nomination. I began repeated calls for his consideration by February. The Committee finally proceeded to reconsider and report his nomination, again, in July 1999. Still, the Judiciary Committee received no opposition from Missouri law enforcement.  The first contact the Judiciary Committee received from Missouri law enforcement was a strong letter of support and endorsement from the Chief of Police of the St. Louis Metropolitan Police Department. I thank Colonel Henderson for contacting the Committee and sharing his views with us. I have recently read that the Missouri Police Chiefs Association, representing 465 members across the state, does not get involved in judicial nominations. I understand that policy because it is shared by many law enforcement organizations that I know. I also appreciate that when asked by a reporter recently, the president of the Missouri Police Chiefs Association described Justice White as ``an upright, fine individual'' and that he knew Justice White personally and really had ``a hard time seeing that he's against law enforcement'' and never thought of him as ``procriminal.''  The Missouri State Lodge of the Fraternal Order of Police has indicated on behalf of its 4,500 dedicated law enforcement officer members in Missouri, that they view Justice White's record as ``one of a jurist whose record on the death penalty has been far more supportive of the rights of victims than of the rights of criminals.'' They see his record as having voted to reverse the death penalty ``in far fewer instances than the other Justices on the Court'' and note that he ``also voted to affirm the death penalty in 41 cases.'' The Missouri Fraternal Order of Police expresses its regret for ``the needless injury which has been inflicted on the reputation of Justice White'' and concludes that ``our nation has been deprived of an individual who surely would have proven to be an asset to the Federal Judiciary.'' I thank President Thomas W. Mayer and all the FOP members in Missouri for speaking out on behalf of this fine judge and sharing their perspective with us.  I certainly understand and appreciate Sheriff Kenny Jones deciding to write to fellow sheriffs about this nomination. Sheriff Jones' wife was killed in the brutal rampage of James Johnson, from whose conviction and sentence Justice White dissented on legal grounds concerning the lack of competent representation the defendant received during the trial. All Senators give their respect and sympathy to Sheriff Jones and his family.  I also understand the petition sent by the Missouri Sheriffs Association to the Judiciary Committee as a result of Sheriff Jones' letter to other Missouri sheriffs. In early October, the Judiciary Committee received that petition along with a copy of Justice White's dissent in the Johnson case with a cover letter dated September 27. It is a statement of support for Sheriff Jones and shows remarkable restraint. The 63 Missouri county sheriffs and 9 others who signed the petition ``respectfully request that consideration be given to [Justice White's dissenting opinion in Johnson] as a factor in the appointment to fill this position of U.S. District Judge.''  I want to assure the Missouri Sheriffs Association and all Senators that I took their concern seriously and reconsidered the dissent in that case to see whether I saw in it anything disqualifying or anything that would lead me to believe that Justice White would not support enforcement of the law. I respect them for having contacted us and for the way in which they did so. It is terribly hard to continue to honor those we have loved and lost by respecting the rule of law that guarantees constitutional rights to those accused, tried, and convicted of killing innocent members of our dedicated law enforcement community.  Whether the nomination of Justice White or consideration of the legal issues considered in his opinions ``sparked strong concerns'' among Missouri law enforcement officers, or whether controversy about this nomination was otherwise generated, I am not in position to know. I do know this: I respect and consider seriously the views of law enforcement officers. As a former State's Attorney and formerVice President of the National District Attorneys Association, I hear often from local prosecutors, police and sheriffs, both in Vermont and around the country. I work closely with local law enforcement and national law enforcement organizations on a wide variety of issues. I know from my days in local law enforcement that there are often disagreements between police and prosecutors and with judges about cases. I respect that difference and understand it.  With respect to the views expressed by law enforcement representatives on Justice Ronnie White's nomination, both for and against, I say the following: I have considered each of the letters produced during the course of the Senate debate and reconsidered the cases to which they refer. I respectfully disagree that those decisions present a basis to vote against the confirmation of Justice Ronnie White to the federal court. Far from presenting a pattern of ``procriminal jurisprudence'' or ``tremendous bent toward criminal activity,'' they are dissents well within the legal mainstream and well supported by precedent and legal authority. Further, if considered in the context of his body of work, achievements, and qualifications, they present no basis for voting against this highly qualified and widely respected nominee. I conclude, as did the Missouri State Lodge of the Fraternal Order of Police, that ``our nation has been deprived of an individual who surely would have proven to be an asset to the Federal Judiciary.''  With all due respect, I do not believe that any constituency or interest group, even one as important as local law enforcement, is entitled to a Senate veto over a judicial nomination. Each Senator is elected to vote his or her conscience on these judicial appointments, not any special interest or party line. When Senators do not vote their conscience, they risk the debacle that we witnessed on October 5th, when a partisan political caucus vote resulted in a fine man and highly qualified nominee being rejected by all Republican Senators on a party line vote.  It is too late for the Senate to undo the harm done to Justice White. What the Senate can do now is to make sure that partisan error is not repeated. The Senate should ensure that other minority and women candidates receive a fair vote. We can start with the nominations of Judge Richard Paez and Marsha Berzon, which have been held up far too long without Senate action. It is past time for the Senate to do the just thing, the honorable thing, and vote to confirm each of these highly qualified nominees. Let us start the healing process. Let us vote to confirm Judge Richard Paez and Marsha Berzon before this session ends.  I ask unanimous consent that a copy of the October 21, 1999 letter from the Missouri State Fraternal Order of Police be printed in the Record.  There being no objection, the letter was ordered to be printed in the Record, as follows:                                        Fraternal Order of Police,                                         Missouri State Lodge,                                                 October 21, 1999.     Sheriff Philip H. McKelvey,     President, National Sheriff's Association,     Alexandria, VA.       Dear Sheriff McKelvey: I am writing on behalf of the more      than 4,500 members of the Missouri State Fraternal Order of      Police to express my great consternation at your      organization's recent opposition to the confirmation of      Justice Ronnie White to the Federal bench, an opposition      which I sincerely hope was not simply politically motivated.       The record of Justice White is one of a jurist whose record      on the death penalty has been far more supportive of the      rights of victims than of the rights of criminals. While in      fact voting 17 times for death penalty reversals, he has      voted to do so in far fewer instances than the other Justices      on the Court. In addition, Justice White has also voted to      affirm the death penalty in 41 cases.       The Fraternal Order of Police is no stranger to fighting to      see that justice is served for slain law enforcement officers      and their families. Our organization has been at the      forefront of bringing to justice Munia Abu-Jamal,      establishing a nationwide boycott of individuals and      organizations which financially support the efforts of this      convicted cop killer. In addition, the FOP led the fight      against President Clinton's clemency of 16 convicted Puerto      Rican terrorists responsible for a wave of bombing attacks on      U.S. soil and the wounding of three New York City police      officers.       Unfortunately however, nothing can undo the needless injury      which has been inflicted on the reputation of Justice White,      and our nation has been deprived of an individual who surely      would have proven to be an asset to the Federal Judiciary.       On behalf of the membership of the Fraternal Order of      Police, I would encourage you to exercise greater judgment in      future battles of this sort. It is a great disservice to the      members of your organization, and the nation as a whole, to      choose to do otherwise.           Sincerely,                                                  Thomas W. Mayer,     President, Missouri State FOP.                          ____________________
