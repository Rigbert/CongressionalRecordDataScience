 I have been fortunate to serve in this Chamber for the past 38 years with principled leaders like Kent Conrad. I was elected to the Senate in 1974, the same year the Congressional Budget Act passed into law, and I have served here with all of the Budget Committee chairs--from Edmund Muskie to Patty Murray.  I think Kent Conrad is right that at this critical juncture we need to have a grown-up discussion about our Nation's finances--both about the debts we incur and the ways in which we pay for them. We have all heard a lot of talk in the last few years about getting our fiscal house in order. It makes for a great campaign slogan. But I am afraid that too many are not following through on their responsibility to govern.  After jumping from one manufactured crisis to another for the past few years, which has hurt the U.S. economy and America's standing in the world, it is time for reason and sanity to return to the Senate--on the budget process, on nominations, and on a whole host of other issues. Returning to regular order on the budget conference--and letting conference members from the House and the Senate work out a final agreement free from rigid ideological positions--would be a good first step to bringing some comity and order back to this body so we can serve the American people.  I remain ready to work with people on both sides of the aisle in the hopes that we can find a workable budget solution in the coming weeks, and I suggest that everyone heed the calls for bipartisanship and compromise made by Senator Conrad.  With that, I ask unanimous consent that Kent Conrad's full opinion piece from the October 24, 2013, Washington Post be printed in the Record.  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in the Record, as follows:               [From the Washington Post, Oct. 24, 2013]Opinion: A Fair Trade for Entitlement Reform Includes Increased Revenue                        (By Senator Kent Conrad)       Kent Conrad, a Democrat, represented North Dakota in the      Senate from 1987 to 2013.       The Post's Oct. 20 editorial on the budget challenge [``A      fiscal quid pro quo''] made important points but was way off-     base on the issue of revenue. It suggested that a fair trade      would be reductions to the ``sequester'' budget cuts in      exchange for reforms to Medicare and Social Security and said      that Democrats should not insist on additional revenue      because that's a non-starter with many Republicans. Democrats      would make a serious mistake by following that advice.       Our country needs more revenue to help us get back on      track. Citing Congressional Budget Office calculations, The      Post said that ``federal revenue as a share of [gross      domestic product (GDP)] will hit 18.5 percent by 2023, near      the upper-end of the postwar range.'' That's true, but the      last five times our country had a balanced budget, revenue      averaged 20 percent of GDP. The Bowles-Simpson plan, which      The Post strongly endorsed, achieved revenue of 20.6 percent      of GDP--not by raising tax rates but by broadening the tax      base and lowering tax rates.       Tax reform should be part of any budget deal. Tax reform is      necessary to unlock the full potential of our economy. The      current tax system is not fair and damages U.S.      competitiveness. A five-story building in the Cayman Islands      claims to be home to more than 18,000 companies. Is it the      most efficient building in the world? No! That and other tax      scams cost our country more than $100 billion each year, the      Senate Permanent Subcommittee on Investigations has found.       If we don't fix the revenue side of the equation at the      same time as we repair Social Security and Medicare, it will      never happen. To suggest, as The Post does, that Democrats      should trade adjustments to the sequester for reforms to      these programs assumes that the sequester affects only      Democratic priorities. More than half of the $1.2 trillion in      sequester cuts are to defense, long a Republican priority.       A fair trade would be modest additions to revenue as part      of a balanced plan. A revenue increase of $300 billion to      $400 billion over 10 years would amount to only 1 percent of      the $37 trillion the federal government is expected to      collect over that time. We can't do 1 percent? Of course we      can. And by reforming the tax code, we could do it without      raising tax rates on a single American.       A similar $300 billion to $400 billion in savings out of      Medicare and Medicaid would amount to about 3 percent of the      $11 trillion the federal government is expected to spend on      health care over that time. We can't do 3 percent? Of course      we can. And we must: Health spending is the fastest-growing      part of the federal budget, projected to increase from 1      percent of GDP in 1971 to more than 12 percent of GDP in      2050. And the trustees of the Medicare system say it will be      insolvent by 2026.       The Post was correct that adoption of a ``chained CPI,'' or      consumer price index, system of measuring inflation should be      part of any agreement. Most economists say that chained CPI,      which accounts for behavioral changes people make when faced      with increasing prices, is a more accurate way of measuring      inflation. Going to chained CPI would raise revenue because      our tax system is indexed for inflation, and it would cut      spending because many programs, including Social Security,      are indexed for inflation.       Federal spending has been cut by $900 billion in the Budget      Control Act, by $1.2 trillion in the sequester and by more      than $500 billion in the 2010 continuing resolution. That is      spending cuts of $2.6 trillion, while only $600 billion in      revenue has been added. That is hardly balanced.       To suggest that Democrats should give up on revenue because      it's a non-starter with many Republicans is like telling      Republicans they should give up on entitlement reform because      it is a non-starter with many Democrats. The truth is, both      sides need to give a little ground on their must-haves for      real progress to be made.       A mini-``grand bargain'' would require all of these      elements: changes to Social Security and Medicare to ensure      their solvency for future generations; a modest increase in      revenue so all parts of society participate in getting our      country back on track; and changes to the sequester cuts that      force nearly all of the deficit savings on less than 30      percent of the budget.       We can do this, but everyone must be prepared to give a      little so that our nation can gain a lot.                          ____________________
