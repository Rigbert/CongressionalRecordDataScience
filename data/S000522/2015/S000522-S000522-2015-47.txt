Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.  Mr. Speaker, I just want to finally say a very special thanks to Majority Leader Kevin McCarthy for arranging for this bill to come to the floor and of course to the Speaker, to Ed Royce, our distinguished chairman, and the ranking member for their strong support and cosponsorship of this resolution. It is bipartisan, and I think we are sending a clear and unambiguous message to the world, again, that Srebrenica was a genocide.  We must hold those to account who committed these atrocities. At least two of the major perpetrators, hopefully, will soon get justice, one at the end of this year and Mladic probably by 2017. The wheels of justice do turn slowly, but they are jailed right now. Above all, I think we need to pray for the victims.  Mr. Speaker, we need to pray for the loved ones who continue to suffer unspeakable agony. I do hope the American people and all of us in the House and in this town will--especially as this remembrance comes around beginning on July 11--keep these people who have suffered so much in our prayers.  Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.
