 Is this the best of the best?  Is this a knowledgeable candidate who understands the Federal law?  Is this a candidate who comes to us without conflicts of interest?  Is this a candidate who is willing to stand up and be the defender of all young children in schools?  To me and to many of my colleagues who have been out here speaking, she is not.  I want to thank all of my great colleagues who have been out here speaking from their heart about a passion that they have in this country for a candidate to lead the Department of Education who is qualified, who is prepared, who is ready to stand up and fight for every child no matter where they live or where they come from.  With that, Mr. President, I believe we are down to the last 15 minutes before the vote, with the time equally divided.
