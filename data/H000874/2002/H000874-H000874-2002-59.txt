Speaker, I thank my friend, the gentleman from California (Mr. Lantos), for yielding me this time.  I am pleased to join him and also my very close friend, the gentleman from Illinois (Mr. Hyde), in recognizing and remembering. As well, I am pleased to follow the remarks of my friend, the gentleman from New York (Mr. Gilman). All three of these gentlemen, Mr. Speaker, have been in the forefront of focusing on the foreign policy of the United States. All three have focused on the extension of liberty and justice and freedom throughout this world. All three have focused on human rights and the recognition of the rights of individuals. How appropriate it is that these three leaders lead us in this remembrance.  Mr. Speaker, none of us, none of us will forget where we were when we learned the news. None of us, I think, will forget those 84 minutes from 8:46 a.m. on September 11, 2001, when the North Tower was struck, to 84 minutes later when the crash of the jet from Pennsylvania precluded the success of the terrorists in striking this Capitol.  None of us, Mr. Speaker, will ever forget. In an instant on that Tuesday morning, now known simply as 9-11, the generation of Americans, this generation of Americans, suffered its Pearl Harbor. In an instant, or more accurately, I suppose, in 84 minutes, more than 3,000 innocent human beings, many of uncommon courage, were murdered by criminals of unbounded evil.  Words, Mr. Speaker, cannot convey the depth of pain inflicted on this Nation and its people 1 year ago. The pain endures and will remain. Today we remember all those who were taken on that horrific day. Our thoughts and our prayers are with those who survived and those who lost loved ones, as well as with the brave men and women this very hour defending freedom here at home and abroad.  In many ways, such unspeakable acts have clarified our purpose, steeled our resolve, and confirmed who we are.                              {time}  1315  We are a peaceful, tolerant and compassionate people. The evidence of that, Mr. Speaker, lies throughout our great Nation.  Since September 11 private charities have raised more than $2.4 billion, private charities, more than $2.4 billion to assist survivors. Former President Clinton and former Senate majority leader Bob Dole joined to raise $105 million to pay for college for the children and spouses of those killed or disabled. More than 3,000 people download applications for Americorps every week; more than 76,000 have requested Peace Corps applications; and more than 48,000 have signed up for Citizen Corps programs. Yes, Mr. Speaker, this is a generous, compassionate and giving Nation.  Closer to home, Donn Marshall of Marbury, Maryland, refused to let the savagery of 9-11 define the life and loss of his beloved wife, Shelley. Shelley was an employee of the Defense Intelligence Agency and she was one of the 20 Fifth Congressional District residents and 53 Marylanders who were taken from their family and friends by the mindless acts of savagery on 9-11. Rather than give in, however, to unblinking but justified anger, Donn has given his sorrow meaning.  In tribute to his wife, Shelley, he established the Shelley A. Marshall Foundation, an irrevocable trust that funds children's story hours at public libraries, creative writing contests at colleges, and tea parties at nursing homes that bring senior citizens and high school students together.  The aftermath of 9-11 has seen countless other acts, Mr. Speaker, of generosity, community and courage, in your district, Mr. Speaker, in mine, and in the districts of every Member of this House, which is to say in every corner of this Nation. From the local police officers and firefighters who raced towards danger at the Pentagon and Ground Zero in New York City, to the Facchina Construction Company in my district and those employees who completed their reconstruction work at the Pentagon 3\1/2\ months early, even after their La Plata headquarters was devastated and destroyed by a tornado just a few months ago, to the local artist in my district who raised $5,000 for the widows and children of firefighters from the sale of 9-11 T-shirts that he designed.  Mr. Speaker, the terrorists who sought to break our spirit only fortified that spirit. Their barbarism reminded us of our inevitable vulnerability but also reminded us that we are a part of something much greater than ourselves. We are the land of the free because, Mr. Speaker, we are the home of the brave.  More than 40 years ago President Kennedy stirred our Nation when he said that, ``The energy, the faith, the devotion that we bring to this endeavor will light our country and all who serve it.'' And he correctly concludedthat, ``The glow from that fire can truly light the world.''  The fire of freedom, Mr. Speaker, forged the American character and it burns deep within our soul. The ashes of tragedy have rekindled that spirit; and one year later, the world must know freedom's light still burns brightly and its eternal truth shall never, never, never be extinguished. May God, Mr. Speaker, continue to bless and guide America as we continue our commitment to a just Nation and the defense and extension of freedom.
