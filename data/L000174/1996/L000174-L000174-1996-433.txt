President, the bloody events that took place in the regions of Chechnya and Dagestan in recent months have alarmed us all. Terrorist acts by Chechen separatist rebels were answered with brutal shelling of rebel, hostage, and civilian positions by Russian troops. Although it is unclear how many people were killed during the fighting, Russian President Boris Yeltsin estimates that 153 Chechen separatists, 42 hostages, and 26 Russian soldiers died during the 10-day crisis.  In October 1991, Dzhokhar Dudayev, a Moslem Chechen leader, was elected president of Chechnya and soon declared independence from Russia. This decision was met with immediate resistance from Moscow and President Yeltsin declared a state of emergency in the region. Over the past several years, Russian military forces clashed repeatedly with Chechen nationalist forces loyal to Dudayev. After considerable bloodshed on both sides, a unilateral cease-fire was declared in April 1995. Unfortunately, it did not last and fighting soon resumed.  On January 6, 1996, the fighting in Chechnya again reached the world stage. Chechen separatists attacked a Russian airfield in Chechnya and destroyed two helicopter gunships. The rebels, under the command of Salam Raduyev, the son-in-law of Dudayev, withdrew from the airfield and proceeded to take more than 2,000 innocent men, women, and children hostage in a hospital in the town of Kizlyar in the neighboring region of Dagestan.  After negotiating with the Russians, Raduyev released the majority of the hostages in return for safe passage to Chechnya. The rebels and 120 hostages boarded buses bound for Chechnya, but the convoy was stopped a short distance from Chechnya by Russian forces near the town of Pervomayskoye. Negotiations to end the stalemate failed, and the rebels dug in for a siege. Rather than continue to work toward a peaceful solution to the crisis, the Russian military opened fire on the rebel positions in the town with tanks, howitzers, rockets, and small arms fire. Pervomayskoye is now totally destroyed.  I do not condone the terrorist acts employed by the Chechen rebels and abhor their use of civilians as shields. Terrorism is never a legitimate negotiating ploy, and I hope that those who are responsible for these acts are brought to justice.  I am, however, outraged about the use of excessive force by the Russian military against the rebels and the remaining hostages as well as the restrictions imposed on humanitarian groups who attempted to assist the wounded in Pervomayskoye. Humanitarian groups such as Doctors Without Boarders and the International Red Cross were not allowed to enter the town to aid injured civilians. At the same time, Russian soldiers were helicoptered out of the area to the nearest field hospitals.  The exact number of casualties remains in doubt because members of the Western press were not allowed near Pervomayskoye and the casualty reports from both sides are not reliable. The New York Times reported as late as January 21 that Russian soldiers confiscated film from Western photographers that were attempting to photograph the smoldering ruins of the town.   In response to the Russian shelling of Pervomayskoye, Turkish nationalists sympathetic to the Chechen cause highjacked a Russia-bound ferry in the Black Sea. The highjackers threatened to kill the more than 200 passengers and blow up the ferry in the Straits of Bosporus if the Chechens were not allowed to go free. After 3 days at sea, Turkish negotiators convinced the highjackers that they had gained the world's attention and nothing would be achieved by carrying out their threats. The highjackers then released their hostages and surrendered to Turkish authorities.  I applaud the Turkish Government for patiently working to find a peaceful solution to this crisis.  The United States Government is committed to promoting democracy in the New Independent States of the former Soviet Union and is investing millions of taxpayer dollars to help the NIS on the path toward democracy. I strongly support this goal. But, the Russian military campaign against the Chechens, especially during the past month, demonstrates to the world that Russia's transition to democracy and human rights remains fragile and unpredictable, and that Russian nationalism is on the rise.  The war in Chechnya is far from over and a solution is not likely to be found in the near future unless both sides are willing to abide by a cease-fire and negotiate in good faith. President Yeltsin should not view the defeat of Raduyev's small force as a victory. All sides lost.                          ____________________
