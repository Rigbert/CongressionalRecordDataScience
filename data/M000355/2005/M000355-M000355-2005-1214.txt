 President, I rise today to pay tribute to an ambassador of the law. Charles R. Simpson III, judge of the United States District Court for the Western District of Kentucky, is a renowned fixture of the legal community in his home state as well as a world traveler, in his capacity as a member of the Committee on International Judicial Relations of the Judicial Conference of the United States. In that role, he serves as both a student and a teacher in courtrooms all over the world.  Judge Simpson is also an old friend of mine. He graduated from my alma mater, the University of Louisville, where he received both his bachelor's degree in 1967 and his law degree in 1970. Soon afterwards, we both helped found the law firm of Levin, Yussman, McConnell & Simpson. Obviously it was not the last stop for either of us.  After serving the public in county government, where I also served, Judge Simpson was appointed to the District Court by President Ronald Reagan in 1986. He has retained that post for nearly 20 years, rising to become one of the most respected voices in Louisville and throughout the State. But he also wanted to take his legal knowledge and his love of Kentucky and spread it beyond America's borders.  Dating to a period in his youth when he studied painting and architecture in Europe, Chuck has enjoyed an adventurer's spirit. So he spearheaded the establishment of a sister-court relationship between his court and one in Croatia. Through this friendship, Croatians got a firsthand look at American jurisprudence, and Judge Simpson learned how the law deals with the difficulties of life in Eastern Europe.  Because of his groundbreaking efforts, Chief Justice of the United States William H. Rehnquist appointed Judge Simpson to the Committee on International Judicial Relations of the Judicial Conference of the United States in 2004. His wide travels have included countries such as Russia, Croatia, Slovenia and Cyprus.  Once on a visit to Ivanovo, Russia, Judge Simpson caused a minor international incident when he accidentally locked himself in the courtroom cage usually reserved for the defendant. Apparently, it was quite difficult to find the key. Everyone handled the situation with great humor, and Chuck struck a blow for diplomacy when his story made the front page of the local Ivanovo newspaper.  In 1999 Judge Simpson was named outstanding alumnus of the University of Louisville's Louis D. Brandeis School of Law, and in 2000 the Louisville Bar Association named him judge of the year. He and his wife Clare have three children, one of whom, their daughter Pam, has served with distinction for 2 years in my Washington office.  For his decades of service, the Kentucky Bar Association has named Chuck the 2005 outstanding judge of the year. They recognize that he is a superb representative of the American justice system to our friends across the world, and the knowledge he brings home from his travels enriches us all. Mr. President, today I ask my colleagues to join me in commending Judge Simpson for receiving this high honor, and for his service to the law and his country.                          ____________________[Page S6094]From the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]                TRIBUTE TO JUDGE CHARLES R.
