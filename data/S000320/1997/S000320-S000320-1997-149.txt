 President, I would like to thank the Senator from Rhode Island for his assistance with several issues affecting the U.S. courthouse to be constructed in Montgomery, AL. Last fall, $6 million was included in Public Law 104-208 to help offset cost escalations resulting from: An error made by GSA during its Time Out and Review exercise; inflation; required security upgrades; historic preservation; and, heating, ventilation, and air conditioning improvements.  Because this supplemental project funding cannot be obligated by GSA without authorization by the Committee on Environment and Public Works, I have worked closely with Senator Chafee and other members of the authorizing committee to secure their approval. Appropriately, Senator Chafee and others wanted to make sure that this additional funding would not cause the project in Montgomery to exceed the GSA benchmarking and project budgeting process. At my and Senator Chafee's request, GSA confirmed in a letter dated April 21, 1997, that this additional $6 million will not cause the Montgomery project to exceed its benchmark. That is, this additional funding is necessary for GSA to complete the very critical and basic features of a modern courthouse facility.
