 President, as elected representatives, we often get correspondence from people--from our respective States and elsewhere--expressing views and opinions on a whole range of issues.  Occasionally, a letter comes in that deserves to be shared with the entire Senate. I recently received such a letter from Mongolian Prime Minister Elbegdorj Tsakhia, who took power after democratic elections in that country earlier this year.  While some may not pay much attention to Mongolia--it is literally half a world away--it deserves America's thanks and praise. That country serves to remind us that the fundamental pillars upon which our democracy is constructed--individual rights, freedom of the press and religious tolerance--are not Western ideals but universal rights. As Prime Minister Elbegdorj points out, Mongolia enjoys a tradition of democracy and recognizes that it shares a responsibility to support freedom beyond its borders.  Today I want to personally thank Prime Minister Elbegdorj and the people of Mongolia for their country's contributions to the War on Terrorism in Iraq and for their steadfast support of democracy in Asia--and in Burma, in particular. Brave Mongolian soldiers serving in Iraq, and those who champion the cause of democracy closer to home, are a tribute to their country.  While I will include the text of the Prime Minister's letter in the Record following my remarks, I want to read one line that rings true:       Having lived under, and fought against, the tyranny of      Communism I can assure you of one thing: that no      dictatorship, no military regime, no authoritarian government      can stand against the collective will of a people determined      to be free.  Amen, Mr. Prime Minister.  I encourage you to do all you can to further strengthen democracy in your own country, and to continue to aggressively support Daw Aung San Suu Kyi and the people of Burma in their struggle for freedom.  I ask unanimous consent to print the letter in the Record.  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in the Record, as follows:                                   Prime Minister of Mongolia,                                               September 16, 2004.     Hon. Mitch McConnell,     U.S. Senate,     Washington, DC.       Dear Senator McConnell: On August 20, 2004 I was sworn in      as Mongolia's new Prime Minister. This election has seen      another peaceful transfer of political power in my country.      It represents Mongolians' continuing commitment to democracy      and human rights.       I have lived in the U.S. for the past several years and      during that time I earned degrees at the University of      Colorado and Harvard. I also served as a consultant to Radio      Free Asia in Washington, D.C. During my time in the U.S., I      followed your actions on promoting democracy and human rights      in Asia--in particular, Burma. I, like you, believe that Aung      San Suu Kyi and her National League for Democracy is the      legitimate representative of the Burmese people. The military      junta that is ruling Burma can only maintain their power      through barbaric acts of terror to instill fear in the      people.       Mongolia faces many serious economic and social challenges.      After our July elections, our parliament, like your Senate,      is a divided chamber. The Mongolian people have made their      electoral choices and now it is up to my government to make      it work. I believe the true test of any democracy is not just      the institutionalization of a process and policies that      protect individual liberties, freedom of speech, and      religious tolerance at home. It is how those values are      shared abroad. There can be no excuse made for Burma's      military junta. The Burmese people had an election and chose      to embrace freedom and democracy. I believe each country that      shares our values must take steps to help achieve the results      of the 1990 elections. I look forward to engaging in this      effort.       Despite the distance that separates our countries, our      shared values bring us close together. As you read this      letter, U.S. and Mongolian soldiers stand shoulder-to-     shoulder helping to build peace and stability in a new Iraq.       Thank you for your work to support democracy in Burma and      throughout Asia. Having lived under, and fought against, the      tyranny of Communism I can assure you of one thing: that no      dictatorship, no military regime, no authoritarian government      can stand against the collective will of a people determined      to be free.           Sincerely,                                                Elbegdorj Tsakhia.                          ____________________
