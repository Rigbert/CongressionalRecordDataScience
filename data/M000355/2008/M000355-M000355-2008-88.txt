 President, I think the majority leader made a good point. I think we have heard the speech. Of course, we will not be passing the bill before recess. This vote will be about whether we stay on the No. 1 subject in America and whether we then do the Defense bill.  It appears to me as if we have had the suggestion, and I say to my good friend, the majority leader, why do we not now have the vote?
