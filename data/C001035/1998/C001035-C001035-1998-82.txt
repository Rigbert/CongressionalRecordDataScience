President, in the short time that I will take to deliver these remarks, a woman will be diagnosed with breast cancer. And every 12 minutes, a woman will die from it.  Just this past year, breast cancer has touched my life twice: one member of staff, aged 37, and the spouse of another member of my staff both developed breast cancer. Watching these women in their daily struggles has been a heart-wrenching experience as well as a call to action.  I know that several of my colleagues' lives have also been personally touched by breast cancer. The senior Senator from Maine, Olympia Snowe, lost her mother to breast cancer at a tragically young age. Throughout her career in Congress, Senator Snowe has been a tireless advocate for breast cancer awareness and increased funding for research. Her leadership on this issue has been invaluable--even lifesaving--for countless women across the country.  Breast cancer is the most frequently diagnosed cancer in women in the United States. However, when breast cancer is detected early and treated promptly, suffering and the loss of life can be significantly reduced.  Approximately one out of every eight women will develop breast cancer during her lifetime. In 1998 alone, an estimated 180,200 women will be diagnosed with breast cancer. Even more disturbing, breast cancer is the leading cause of death among women aged 35 to 54.  Washingtonians will have the opportunity to call attention to breast cancer and raise much-needed research dollars when the Susan G. Komen Breast Cancer Foundation hosts its 9th annual National Race for the Cure on Saturday, June 6.  Those of us who work on Capitol Hill have an added opportunity to contribute to the cure for breast cancer thanks to a challenge grant from Eli Lilly and Company. The third annual Lilly Capitol Hill Challenge will match the registration fees for all members of Congress, their spouses, and staff who participate in the National Race for the Cure. Since 1996, Lilly and Capitol Hill have raised $200,000 for breast cancer prevention, research, and treatment--75% of which stays in the DC metropolitan area.  Two weeks ago, all the women in the Senate joined me in circulating a ``Dear Colleague'' letter encouraging Members of Congress and staff to take advantage of Lilly's generous offer and register for this year's race. And I would like to let my colleagues know that it is not too late to participate. Late registrations are being accepted up until Friday evening at 6:30 in the lobby of the Department of Commerce.  Today, I rise to the floor to once again encourage my colleagues to alert members of their staff, their families and friends to this valuable opportunity to support the Komen Foundation and Race for the Cure on June 6th.  Thank you, Mr. President. I yield the floor.                          ____________________
