 President, tomorrow morning at 10:00, we will have a cloture vote on the motion to proceed to the Marriage Protection Amendment. We have had a good debate during the last few days on that matter. It is my hope that cloture will be invoked in order to address this important issue.  As a reminder to Members, as I indicated, we have a joint meeting in the House at 11 o'clock to hear an address by the President of the Republic of Latvia. We will gather at 10:40 in the Chamber and proceed as a body to the House. After that is completed, we will debate the motions to proceed to the death tax relief bill and the Native Hawaiian bill.  Moments ago, I filed cloture on both those motions, the death tax and Native Hawaiians. Those votes will be occurring sometime on Thursday.                          ____________________[Page S5515]From the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]                                PROGRAM  Mr. McCONNELL.
