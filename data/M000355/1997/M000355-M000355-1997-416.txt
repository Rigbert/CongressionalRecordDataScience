 President, very briefly, I urge my colleagues to vote against the President's request for early release of population funds. Significant concessions have already been made by those of us who support the pro-life position. We agreed to raise the overall level of funding from $356 million in 1996 to $385 million, and the disbursal rate from 6 percent to 8 percent a month. Now the President wants to move up the date when disbursal begins. This would make $123 million more available for organizations that either support or lobby for the legalization of abortion.  The administration claims that 17 projects will be forced to close down if we delay funding until July. Yet, virtually every one of these programs could be funded because they are willing to abide by Mexico City conditions not to support abortion or lobby to legalize it. To protect a few groups who support abortion, the administration iswithholding support from many organizations willing to provide family planning services consistent with the Mexico City guidelines. They complain about a lack of funds, yet are willing to forgo an increase if it is linked to Mexico City.  I support family planning, but I cannot and will not vote to provide funds to organizations which, in the name of family planning, take the lives of innocent unborn children. I hope the resolution will be opposed.
