Medal of Honor recipient Colonel Lewis Millett passed away on November 14, 2009. He was a true American hero and today I ask the U.S. House of Representatives to honor and remember him and his 31 years of service.  Colonel Millett was born in Mechanic Falls, ME, on December 15, 1920. He enlisted in the Army Air Corps in 1940 and served as an air gunner, then joined the Canadian Army when it appeared the United States would not enter World War II.  Millett returned to the U.S. Army in 1942 upon the United States' entrance into World War II and served in the 1st Armored Division. After making sergeant, he was awarded a battlefield commission.  According to his Medal of Honor Citation, then-Captain Millett distinguished himself ``above and beyond the call of duty in action'' in Korea, after he and his men came under heavy enemy fire on February 7, 1951.  Captain Millett ordered and led a bayonet counterattack up the hill, killing enemy soldiers in hand-to-hand assault during which he was wounded by a grenade blast. Despite the adverse conditions Captain Millett's company had taken the hill by early afternoon.  Captain Millett was presented the Medal of Honor by President Harry S. Truman in July 1951. He retired as a colonel in 1973 after a 31-year career in which he served in World War II, the Korean conflict and the Vietnam conflict.  Other notable military decorations awarded to Colonel Millett include the Distinguished Service Cross, the Silver Star, two Legions of Merit, three Bronze Stars, four Purple Hearts and three Air Medals.  Colonel Millett's dedication to his country is a testament to a life of service and a legacy that lives on through his sacrifices. Today let us pledge to always remember Colonel Lewis Millett--the goodness he brought to our world and the sacrifices he made will never be forgotten.                          ____________________
