Speaker, reclaiming my time, I think the urgency of getting this job done is very, very great. If there were issues that were not discussed between this body and the other body, I think the gentleman's representation would be correct. But all of these issues were discussed.  I think a conference would merely delay passing powers that law enforcement vitally needs. We have done a good job in balancing the need for stronger law enforcement powers and civil liberties. I would urge support of this bill.  Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.
