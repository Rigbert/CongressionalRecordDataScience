 President, let me remind my colleagues that the Wellstone amendment was defeated 89-7. That would have taken $225 million out of the committee's proposal to fight the war on drugs in Colombia. The amendment of the Senator from Washington, my good friend, would leave only $200 million. It would, in fact, completely terminate this effort, as he candidly admits would be his desire. I hope the Gorton amendment will not be approved.  Mr. President, there are several amendments cleared on both sides which I would like to get out of the way at this point. Temporarily, I ask unanimous consent to lay aside the two amendments upon which we are about to vote.
