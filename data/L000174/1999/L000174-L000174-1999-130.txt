President, I am offended by this slick advertisement. It is clear that the executives on Madison Avenue who crafted this ad want lawmakers--you, me, and all of our colleagues--to believe that the employees of the Rutland Fire Clay Company support the Fairness in Asbestos Compensation Act and that this bill would have helped the Vermont firm avoid reorganization in bankruptcy. Nothing is further from the truth.  Thomas Martin, who is the President of the Rutland Fire Clay Company, and who is named in the advertisement, has written to me to set the record straight. Mr. Martin writes: ``I reviewed the bill and my opinion is it would not help Rutland Fire Clay Company reduce this [asbestos litigation] burden, nor would it help other small businesses with thousands of claims. . . . Under S. 758 costs would be apportioned to Rutland Fire Clay Company equally, and thus higher, than under the current system.''  Mr. Martin continues: ``The advertisement's heading gave the impression that our family business would be `ruined' and that our 22 employees would be out of work. The truth is that we have worked out a consensual bankruptcy plan which recognizes the value of Rutland Fire Clay Company and its employees. No jobs will be lost and we will continue to serve the fireplace and home repair markets as we have for 116 years.''  Finally, Mr. Martin notes: ``our firm in no way assisted in preparation of the CAR advertisement nor did we have any knowledge of it until your office sent me a copy.''  I ask unanimous consent that the full text of Thomas Martin's letter to me be printed in the Record at the conclusion of my remarks.
