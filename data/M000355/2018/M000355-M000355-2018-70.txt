 President, when he retired last month, Ronnie Ellis closed the book on his long and proud career in journalism. A native of Glasgow, KY, Ronnie spent his professional life writing about the issues important to his fellow Kentuckians and the Commonwealth he loves. In doing so, he shared firsthand insights with his readers about the happenings in their capital and earned a reputation as one of the most trusted voices in Frankfort.  Ronnie's first job in journalism came at the Edmonson News, a family-owned weekly publication in South Central Kentucky. He was so eager to put words in print that he even started working there before he had finished his studies at Western Kentucky University in nearby Bowling Green. He clearly had a knack for it. From there, Ronnie worked at both the, Glasgow Daily Times and Henderson Gleaner, two newspapers with historic roots in Western Kentucky.  In 2005, he moved to Frankfort and joined the Community Newspaper Holdings, Inc., CNHI, giving Ronnie the opportunity to have his articles printed in papers throughout the Commonwealth. His move to CNHI also brought a change in focus, Leading the organization's bureau in Frankfort, Ronnie kept a close eye on State government and politics. In addition to his written columns, he also became a frequent guest on Kentucky Educational Television's public affairs program, ``Comment on Kentucky.''  Through the years, I spoke with Ronnie about the issues of the day and their importance to our home State. He never shied away from the tough questions, and his professionalism helped set the standard for other journalists.  There is good news, however, for Ronnie's dedicated readers. We aren't losing his viewpoint forever. In the new year, Ronnie plans to continue writing a regular column for CNI. I would like to take this chance to join Ronnie's audience in thanking him for his years of reporting and wishing him a fulfilling retirement. I ask my Senate colleagues to join Elaine and me in thanking Ronnie for his commitment to journalism in Kentucky.                          ____________________
