 President, I rise today to recognize Linda A. (Susie) Carter who is retiring from the Social Security Administration after 29 years of Federal service.  Ms. Carter began her Social Security career as a clerk typist on August 29, 1965 in the Louisville Social Security office. She did not remain in this position long. Her excellent work earned her advancement to the claims typist position in March 1966, to claims development clerk in March 1967 and then to data review technician in October 1971. In December 1975 Ms. Carter was promoted to claims representative and in December 1980 she was reassigned to the operations analyst position where she assisted the Louisville District management staff and improved the overall quality of the work in the Louisville Social Security District.  In April 1984, Ms. Carter became an operations supervisor in the Louisville District office. Her performance has consistently been outstanding and she has won many performance-related awards during her Social Security career. Her service to the public, the citizens of Louisville, and especially Jefferson County has been a model of the best that government can bring to the people.  During her career, Ms. Carter helped implement major additions to Social Security programs. These include Medicare in July 1966 and the Supplemental Security Income Program in January 1974. There have also been many other changes during her career, such as the extension of coverage to include Federal employees and employees of nonprofit organizations, taxation of benefits, and more.  Mr. President, I ask you and my colleagues to join me in recognizing Linda A. Carter for 29 years of dedicated service to the Federal Government.                          ____________________
