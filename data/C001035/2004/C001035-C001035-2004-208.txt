There will be a motion to table the Byrd amendment. There will be 2 minutes equally divided and then a motion to table the Byrd amendment.  We have been able to work out an agreement on Senator Warner's amendment. That will be the second matter we deal with. He will send a modification to the desk, and it is my hope to be able to adopt that amendment by a voice vote and vitiate the rollcall request.  Then there will be consideration of an amendment from Senator Stevens having to do with the effective date. Again, we have worked out a compromise on that, working very hard throughout the weekend. I expect Senator Stevens will propose a modification to his amendment, and that will allow us to clear that amendment by a voice vote.  We then will proceed to the Stevens amendment dealing with classification, which has been debated extensively. That will require a rollcall vote, and I will be moving to table it.  We then will move to another Stevens amendment where, again, I am pleased to report there is another compromise. It has to do with the interagency counterterrorism plans. Again, an amendment will be sent to the desk incorporating the compromise. I believe Senator Stevens will be offering that. I anticipate being able to accept that on a voice vote.  So I want my colleagues to know that we have made considerable progress in accommodating concerns expressed by the Senator from Virginia and the Senator from Alaska. As a result, I see the need for two rollcall votes out of the five that were ordered. I hope that is how it will unfold.
