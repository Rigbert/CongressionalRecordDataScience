 President, I rise to urge my colleagues to support the Wyden-Grassle amendment banning secret holds. My colleagues should be aware of our efforts by now, but in case they are not, this is what we are trying to do. My good friend from Oregon and I are offering language that would require any Senator who wishes to place a hold on legislation or a nomination must notify the Senate and the American people of his or her action.  This can be done either through the Congressional Record or a statement on the floor. I want my colleagues to understand: This amendment does not, I repeat, does not ban holds. With our proposal, Senators can continue to place a hold on any legislation they wish. Our amendment simply requires that they be open about it.  I firmly believe this amendment will improve the daily workings of the Senate. First, it will make the Senate more accountable.  Too many Americans think that we in Congress don't take responsibility for what we do. This amendment will give Americans greater peace of mind that their public servants are responsible and accountable. And we cannot function effectively if we do not have the basic trust of the people we work for--our constituents.  I know in my own experience I have had to spend valuable time trying to find out who had put a hold on legislation of mine. Tracking down a hold is a tremendous waste of time and effort.  If someone has put a hold on one of my bills, under this proposal I can immediately go to that Senator and talk about his or her concerns and see if we can work things out. When we engage in reasoned debate and give and take on issues is when this body serves the best interests of the American people most effectively. I believe open holds will do much to facilitate this.  Members may think they could face retribution if they declare a hold.  However, Senator Wyden and I have both practiced open holds, and I can tell my colleagues that there is no reason for them to fear retribution or reprisal. I have never faced any repercussions from stating my intention to place a hold and I would imagine Senator Wyden would say the same.  Senators need to know that voting against this amendment will not make it go away, because Senator Wyden and I intend to pursue this reform until we succeed. And I know we will succeed because this is the right thing to do.  It is right to be open with the American people and it is right to be open with your fellow Senators. It is time we made this reform because the secrecy surrounding holds is not required by Senate rules or the Constitution or any other instrument of Government that I know of and it has been allowed to go on much too long. Our proposal is simple, reasonable and fair. I know there are some who say we need to study this issue a little longer. I reject that notion. This is not a complicated change we are proposing.  In closing, I just want to urge my fellow Senators again as emphatically as I can to support this amendment. Ihave heard many of my colleagues express to me and to Senator Wyden that they believe this reform is necessary. Now those of us who support openness and accountability in government have an opportunity to act on those convictions. I urge a yes vote on the Wyden-Grassley open holds amendment.                           amendment no. 3028 (Purpose: To provide $5,000,000 for research, development, test, and         evaluation for the Low Cost Launch Development Program)       At the end of subtitle B of title II, add the following:     SEC. 219 LOW COST LAUNCH DEVELOPMENT PROGRAM       (a) Amount From Air Force Funding--Of the total amount      authorized to be appropriated under section 201(3),      $5,000,000 is available for the Low Cost Launch Development      Program.
