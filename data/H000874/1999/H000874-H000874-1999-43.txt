Speaker, I rise in strong support for H.R. 2367, the Torture Victims Relief Act reauthorization.  I also want to commend my colleagues, Representative Chris Smith and Representative Joseph Crowley, who serve on the International Relations Committee, for bringing this bill to the floor, today.  The Center for Victims of Torture is one of over 175 centers which treats and supports victims of politically-motivated torture. It was established in 1985 and is the first of its kind in the United States.  The Center helps to rehabilitate survivors by addressing their physical and psychological needs in order to reintegrate them back into society. The treatment program assists their families who also suffer the effects of the torture. They have provided services for survivors from more than 45 countries and all continents. And the center treats American victims of torture overseas.  According to the Center for Victims of Torture, ``The debilitating nature of torture makes it extremely difficult for survivors to hold down jobs, study for new professions, or acquire other skills needed for a successful integration into the culture and economy. Torture is a crime against humanity; as a strategic tool of repression, it is the single most effective weapon against democracy. Its purpose is tocontrol populations by destroying individual leaders and frightening entire communities. Torture is rarely used to extract information from someone.''  I am a strong supporter of this program and am pleased that both the House and the Senate Foreign Operations Appropriations bills have provided $3 million for the United Nations Voluntary Fund for Victims of Torture and $7.5 million for the Foreign Treatment Centers for Torture Victims.  As a member of the Labor, HHS Appropriations Subcommittee, I am hopeful that once we draft our legislation, it will reflect the President's FY 2000 request of $7.5 million for Domestic Centers for Victims of Torture.  John F. Kennedy once said, ``I am certain that after the dust of centuries has passed over our cities, we, too, will be remembered not for victories or defeats in battle or in politics, but for our contribution to the human spirit.'' This program does just that. It works to rebuild the human spirit that was broken as an act of war and repression.  Again, Mr. Speaker, I support this legislation and encourage full funding for these programs. Because democracy is neither easy nor simple. It is, however, a goal that we must boldly pursue.                             General Leave
