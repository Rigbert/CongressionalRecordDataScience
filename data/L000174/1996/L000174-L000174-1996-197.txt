This language would require the Senate to streamline the transfer of excess and surplus computer equipment to our Nation's classrooms. It would require the Senate to follow the same guidelines that the Federal agencies must follow in accordance with the President's Federal Executive Order.  President Clinton has set forth an ambitious goal to bring computers to every school in America. Congress should lead the way. Thanks to Senator Murray's efforts, the Senate will be participating in this initiative.  Recently, I wrote several letters to the Sergeant at Arms to find out what our official Senate policy is concerning disposal of excess surplus computer equipment. I was surprised to hear that the Senate does not have an official policy. In the past the Senate has sold excess computer equipment or transferred it over to GSA for later sale. Since 1993, the Senate disposed of 4,400 pieces of computer equipment. Of that total 2,600 have been sold, 1,400 have been transferred to GSA, and 400 have been retained for parts. These computers would have been a wonderful resource to our Nation's schools.  I encourage my colleagues to join our efforts in creating a partnership with our nation's schools and bring computers to every classroom in America so that all students may have the benefits of our new educational technology.                          ____________________
