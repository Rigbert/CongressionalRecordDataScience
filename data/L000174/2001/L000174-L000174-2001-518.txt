President, the Senator from Alaska and the Senator from Vermont represent, population-wise, two of the smallest States in the Union. There are differences, of course, as the Senator from Alaska represents a State greater than much of the continental United States.  I have always thought the genius of the founders of this country, as the Senator from West Virginia has pointed out on many occasions, was when they set up the Senate and they said every State will have equal representation. Vermont has two Senators--not determined by landmass, because if Alaska had two Senators based on landmass no other State would have any Senators. California, larger than many countries, has two Senators. The Senate is one place where States are equal.  Frankly, I have never heard the Senator from Alaska--I have served with him for 26 years, and I served with him on the Appropriations Committee during that time--ask for something for himself, never. I have heard him fight for his own State, the same way I hope I fight for my State, or the Senator from West Virginia fights for his State, or the Senator from Nevada for his.  I point out to those who may be critical of the Senator from Alaska fighting for Alaska that never has the senior Senator from Alaska gone in there and sought anything for himself. But he has fought for the needs of his State. Those needs are great. Nobody--I visited Alaska on several occasions--can possibly conceive of the enormous needs of a State such as Alaska because of its size and diversity. I think of the horrendous winters we sometimes get in Vermont. They cannot begin to match what they have in Alaska.  Frankly, I have always been proud to serve with the Senator from Alaska. We are of different parties. We are in many areas of different political philosophies. But I consider him one of the closest friends I have in the Senate. I have been proud to serve with him on the Appropriations Committee.
