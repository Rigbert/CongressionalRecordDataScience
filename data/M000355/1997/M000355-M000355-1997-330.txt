 President, the University of Kentucky's basketball program has a rich and storied legacy; more wins than any team in college basketball history, six NCAA titles, more appearances in the NCAA tournament than any other program, and 38 Southeastern Conference titles. But, those statistics only begin to tell the tale. Even with all these successes, the 1996-97 edition of the Wildcats will carry a special place in the hearts of Kentucky fans. For the real story behind the UK basketball team is the love affair the fans have with the Big Blue's program.  It was not so long ago, Mr. President, that even one loss was enough to launch some in the Commonwealth into a fit of pique. So accustomed to winning, some Wildcat fanatics had grown unable to accept an occasional setback. Even worse, many had forgotten how to enjoy the hard-earned victories that talented Kentucky teams continually produced.  Today there is a new attitude in the bluegrass, Mr. President. An attitude which exults in victories and championships without believing the end of the world is near if their beloved Cats happen to come up short. An attitude derived from the players and coaches themselves. An attitude borne of hard work and the satisfaction brought by the unparalleled success that hard work has produced.  Never has this been more true than with this year's Kentucky squad. With the odds stacked against the team all year long, the fans were able to revel in a 35-5 season, a Southeastern Conference tournament title and a national runnerup trophy. Not bad for a squad that lost four players to the NBA draft, two starters to injury and returned only one starter from the previous year's national championship team. At times this year, many would agree that the MVP of the team was trainer ``Fast'' Eddie Jamiel.  These young men, Coach Rick Pitino, and Athletic Director C.M. Newton deserve special recognition for reminding us all that how you play the game is as important as the final result. Not once during a roller-coaster season did any player or coach complain about the difficulty of the challenges at hand. Excuses are for losers, and there are no losers associated with this Wildcat team of overachievers.  The Fabulous Five, the Fiddlin' Five, Rupp's Runts, the Unforgettables, the Untouchables, and now the Unbelievables. Other Kentucky teams had more talent but never has a Wildcat group worked as hard. This team had tremendous pride due to the fact that ``KENTUCKY'' was stitched in bold blue letters across their chests. They took that pride and used it to achieve more than any fan or so-called expert could have hoped for. I join Wildcat faithful across the Nation in saluting this year s gallant effort.                           ____________________
