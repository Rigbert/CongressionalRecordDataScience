We need to discuss it back and forth.  I would say to my friend, the gentleman from Oklahoma, for whom I have a great deal of respect, because he is one of the hardest working Members of this House, he has a good intellect and is industrious in applying that intellect, but I would say to my friend in this instance, he does reference language, but that language refers, as the gentleman knows, specifically and exclusively to taxpayers' money. The gentleman's amendment relates to nontaxpayers money, because it would not be necessary, because under present law, taxpayers' money is already legally precluded from being spent on lobbying activities.  The gentleman seeks to get at non-Federal taxpayers' money. That is the very significant and important distinction that the Court draws. It drew it in Russell versus Sullivan, it drew it in the Regan case that you referred to, and it has drawn it in every case that I have reviewed.  Mr. Speaker, I would say to my friend, I thank him for yielding, and look forward to reading the memorandum that he is going to provide me with, but that is the nub of this issue. We are not talking about taxpayers' funds, we are talking about private funds.
