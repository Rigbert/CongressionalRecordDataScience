I was quoting, not imputing. Mr. Jordan's comments seem to be pretty clear.  Before we conclude, the STOCK Act, Tim Walz had a bill that was ready for markup in the committee. We understand that was pulled.  As you know, that bill has 220 cosponsors and is a bipartisan sponsorship. It simply says that Members should not use insider information to trade with, information the general public may not have about legislation that may or may not be reported or passed to the floor. And I understand that was pulled. I think that was unfortunate.  Can the gentleman tell me what the status of that piece of legislation is?
