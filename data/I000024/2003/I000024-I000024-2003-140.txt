President, no one can truly put into words the magnitude of respect and admiration we feel for those who sacrifice their lives so that we might continue to live in freedom. However, I am honored today to try, since the young man whom I pay tribute to was a proud son of my home State the great State of Oklahoma.  Petty Officer 3rd Class Doyle Wayne Bollinger grew up in the community of Poteau, OK. A member of the Poteau Valley Baptist Church, he was remembered by those who knew him best as one with a generous heart--never thinking of himself, but devoting his time to the service of others.  Upon graduating from Poteau High School, Petty Officer Bollinger heard the call to serve his country. He joined the United States Navy, becoming a member of the Naval Mobile Construction Battalion 133, based in Gulfport, MS. In January of 2003, he and his fellow patriots were sent to Iraq, and possibly into harm's way.  On Friday, June 6, 2003 Petty Officer Bollinger was with his battalion, repairing a bridge across the Tigris River in Iraq. He was tragically killed when unexploded ordnance accidentally detonated nearby. At the age of 21 this man lost his life so that we might stand here today, without fear, and in freedom.  I cannot fully describe to you the pain in the hearts of his loved ones as they sat at his funeral on the grounds of Poteau High School, where they had watched him graduate only a few years earlier. Our thoughts and prayers are with them now. And though we are all grieved at the loss of this man, we shall never cease to be proud of him--Oklahoma's son--Petty Officer 3rd Class Doyle Wayne Bollinger.            In Memory of Private First Class Jerod R. Dennis
