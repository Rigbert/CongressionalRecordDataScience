Speaker, I rise today to honor and pay tribute to Thomas Day, Jr., who was tragically killed during the massacre at the Route 91 Harvest country music festival in Las Vegas, Nevada on Sunday, October 1, 2017. Tom was born and raised in my hometown of Corona, California. He will be greatly missed.  After graduating from Corona High School, Tom attended Riverside Community College and later went to work for the home building company, Portrait Construction, that was founded by his father. Those who worked with Tom knew him as someone who was easy to talk to and get along with. Tom Sr., Tom Jr. and the entire Day family have been active members of the Corona community for many years and made a number of contributions to many organizations in and around the city.  Tom Jr. had many passions in life. He loved sports and rooting for the Los Angeles Angels and Pittsburgh Steelers. He especially loved playing and coaching baseball. Attending concerts and music festivals with his children was a win-win for Tom because it allowed him to do two things he loved at one time--listen to music and spend time with his family. Tom was attending the Route 91 Harvest country music festival with his children when he was senselessly taken from us, along with so many others. Our hearts ache for all of those whose lives were cut short and forever impacted by the evil acts of that evening.  I had the distinct privilege of knowing Tom and the Day family for many years, and there are simply no words that soften the heartbreaking loss of Tom's kind and caring soul. I extend my heartfelt condolences to his daughters Whitney, Candice and Kelsey, his son Nolan, the extended Day family, as well as his friends and colleagues. Although Tom may be gone, I know that the joy and happiness he brought to those around him will endure.                          ____________________
