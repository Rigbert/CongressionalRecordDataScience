 President, I rise today in support of legislation to authorize the Secretary of the Interior and other Federal agency heads to carry out activities during fiscal years 2003 through 2005 to implement the Calfed Bay-Delta Program. This program is of tremendous importance to my home State of California. Its mission is to develop and implement a long-term comprehensive plan that will improve water management for the Bay-Delta and restore its ecological health.
