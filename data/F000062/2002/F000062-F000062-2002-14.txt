 President, I rise today to bring to the attention of my colleagues the work of the Center for Civic Education. The center offers outstanding professional development institutes for teachers of civics and government throughout the United States.  While the center is based in my home State of California, their programs are administered nationally by a network of State and congressional district coordinators. Many of you are familiar with We the People: The Citizen and the Constitution, a nationally acclaimed civic education program for upper elementary, middle, and high school students. I know that a number of you have met with the high school students who participate in the We the People national finals, a three-day academic competition in which students respond to questions on the U.S. Constitution and Bill of Rights.  The center-sponsored professional development institutes are offered at national, regional, and State levels. These institutes are designed to instruct teachers in the content and methodology required to deliver quality education in civics and government. Institutes are usually one week long and provide rigorous content knowledge, innovative teaching techniques, and authentic assessment practices. Regional institutes provide an opportunity for teachers from neighboring states to share best practices in civic education.  This past year, 27 regional and State institutes were held in Arizona, California, Colorado, Florida, Idaho, Indiana, Louisiana, Maryland, Massachusetts, Mississippi, Missouri, Montana, Nevada, New Mexico, New York, Oregon, South Carolina, Tennessee, Texas, Virginia, Washington, and Wisconsin. A Juvenile Justice Institute was offered for teachers of incarcerated youth, and a civics and government institute was held for university professors of education.  The center also sponsors a more intensive 3-week National Academy for teachers from across the country; the academy is held in California. Participants in the academy study major works of political theory such as Aristotle's Politics, Hobbes' Leviathan, Locke's Second Treatise, The Federalist, anti-federalist writings, and U.S. Supreme Court opinions. They also discuss relevant knowledge and creative ways to apply this experience when they return to the classroom.  National institutes for elementary school teachers and teachers interestedin advanced content knowledge were held for the first time this year. These institutes were conducted in Virginia and Missouri, respectively. In 2003, the center will increase the number of summer professional development institutes offered.  The poor performance of students on the 1998 National Assessment for Educational Progress, NAEP, Civics Report Card can be traced to inadequate teacher preparation and insufficient quantity of instruction. We know that outstanding programs and student outcomes are directly attributed to adequately prepared teachers.  Investment in professional development opportunities, such as the summer institutes and the National Academy sponsored by the Center for Civic Education, are helping to address this critical situation of teacher preparedness in the field of civics and government.  I commend the center for their efforts and applaud their investment in one of our most treasured resources, the American classroom teacher.                           ____________________
