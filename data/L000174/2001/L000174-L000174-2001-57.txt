I told them I totally agree with you on that, that we should have hearings on this--actually a number of these steps. One of the difficult things, as the Senator knows, is getting the Attorney General to come up here and testify. I think the last person to be able to even ask him a question in our committee was the senior Senator from Pennsylvania during the terrorism bill.  I only heard part of what the Senator was saying, but his usual fashion is to lay out the law and the history very clearly. I do believe we should have hearings. I intend to have a meeting with the FBI Director this afternoon. I am also going to talk to the Attorney General on this and a number of other issues, including some about which the Senator has expressed concern to me. He really should come up here before we finish for the year. We should discuss some of these issues.  I think the Senator from Pennsylvania is absolutely right in raising this. I appreciate him doing it. He does us all a service.
