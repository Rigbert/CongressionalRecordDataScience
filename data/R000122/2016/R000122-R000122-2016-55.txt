President, let me return the compliment to the Chairman of the committee, Senator Collins of Maine, for her extraordinary insight, leadership, and ability to bring us together. This bill reflects the priorities of members on both sides of the aisle, it reflects sound policy, and it was a pleasure to work with her.  I think that she will also commend our extraordinary staffs who provided support, working many times when we were not working to get the job done. I thank Dabney Hegg, Heideh Shahmoradi, Christina Monroe, Nathan Robinson, Jordan Stone, Jason Woolwine, Mike Clarke, Lydia Collins, and Gus Maples. These are professionals who are thoughtful, skillful, pleasant, and probably deserving of the real praise for work done on the floor.  Let me once again thank Senator Collins for her thoughtful leadership and her commitment to fairness and principle. I think that she is one of the major reasons we are here today.  Mr. President, I yield the floor.
