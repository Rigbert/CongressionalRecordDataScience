 REID. I appreciate the Senator asking. What we are going to do, as soon as the Senator completes his statement, we are going to work out a time agreement where Senator Dorgan's amendment will be voted on at or around 12:30 today. So Members should be aware that is what we are working toward. As soon as the Senator completes his statement, we will propound a unanimous consent request. I have checked with the Senator and I havechecked with the manager on our side and that seems to be OK with both of them.
