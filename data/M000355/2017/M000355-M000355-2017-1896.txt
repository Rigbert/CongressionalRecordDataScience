 I would remind everyone the previous Director is gone. The Deputy, the No. 2 person, is gone. I don't think it is a great idea for Senate Democrats to be holding this vacant over the weekend.          Unanimous Consent Agreement--Presidential Nomination  Mr. President, given what we have heard, following disposition of the Kelly nomination, I ask unanimous consent that the Intelligence Committee be discharged and the Senate vote on the motion to proceed to the consideration of the following nomination received today: Mike Pompeo to be Director of the Central Intelligence Agency--the motion to proceed. I further ask consent that following leader remarks on Monday, January 23, there be 6 hours of debate on the nomination, equally divided in the usual form, and that following the use or yielding back of time, the Senate vote on the nomination with no intervening action or debate; that if confirmed, the motion to reconsider be considered made and laid upon the table; that the President be immediately notified of the Senate's action; that no further motions be in order; and that any statements relating to the nomination be printed in the Record.
