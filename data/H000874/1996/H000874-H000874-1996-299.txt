Speaker, I thank the gentleman from Wisconsin for yielding this time to me.  Mr. Speaker, this is an unfortunate procedure. This is an unfortunate year. This is an unfortunate Congress.  I agree with the gentleman from Montana who spoke that the judgment that will have been made of this Congress, is that it is probably the worst-run Congress in 50 years. That is the sentiment expressed by Kevin Phillips, a very conservative Republican columnist; not my view, but I share that view. And today we see another result of that.                              {time}  1315  I do not believe, frankly, that the chairman of the committee would want this to happen. I have said that before. I do not think the Chair of any of our subcommittees would want that to happen. I am speaking of the Republican chairs. I frankly think it is central management that is to blame for this, but I want to say that I supported the last continuing resolution, a CR, as we call it, or perhaps ``completely ridiculous,'' as the American public must view it.  I supported it because obviously I want to see the 56,000 Federal employees that I represent remain on the job doing the work that America expects of them, and being paid for that work. But the fact of the matter is I am going to oppose this resolution, because what is happening is, in my opinion, part strategy and part an admission of failure; strategy to the extent that it is, as the gentleman from West Virginia, said, death by a thousand cuts; just drip, drip, drip, drip; cut, cut, cut, cut, education, environment, energy assistance for old people and poor people; drip, drip, cut, cut.  Mr. Speaker, this is not a responsible action to take. The Contract With America talked about personal responsibility. I have said it before, but in point of fact, we have abrogated our responsibility to the American public to handle the finances of this Nation responsibly. This is not responsible management of the Congress.  Mr. Speaker, these 1-week CR's are unprecedented. This is the 12th extension, because we cannot get our business done in this Congress. Mr. Speaker, it is not because the President is vetoing so many bills. In fact, this President has vetoed fewer bills than either George Bush or Ronald Reagan. Let us be responsible. Let us fund at least the balance of this fiscal year, halfway through it.
