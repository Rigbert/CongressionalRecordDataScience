 President, reserving the right to object, the men and women of our armed services should not be left to suffer at the hands of political obstruction. These troops are deployed in harm's way, and left behind are their families and colleagues training to replace them. It is irresponsible that their pay, to include imminent danger pay, would be delayed because the Democrats are insisting that we deal with illegal immigration exclusively on their terms.  Let me remind the Senate that we have an All-Volunteer Force that doesn't ask much of us, but we are obliged to pay and support them. We owe them the certainty of a full-year funding bill. Therefore, I object.
