 President, I rise today to commemorate the sixth anniversary of the re-independence of the Republic of Georgia.  Georgia has a rich cultural heritage spanning over 2,000 years, and recent history provides a remarkable story in the struggle against communism. First annexed by Russia in 1801, Georgia experienced a brief glimpse of independence in 1918 when Georgia relinquished its ancient monarchy for a democratically elected government. In 1921, however, the iron curtain descended on this small, yet proud country, and over the next 70 years suffered terribly under the heavy hand of Soviet communism and its centrally planned economy. Through it all, the Georgian people never gave up their hope or desire for freedom and independence.  On April 9, 1989, violence erupted in the Georgian capitol of Tbilisi, as Soviet troops swarmed the city and fell on 10,000 peaceful citizens demonstrating for independence. During the ensuing violence, more than 200 people were injured and 19 killed. Some, including women and children, were tragically beaten to death with shovels. This event marked the beginning of the end of Soviet domination. Exactly 2 years later, on April 9, 1991, Georgia officially declared its independence, a day which is remembered as the anniversary on which Georgia's long fight for freedom was again realized.  Since then, under the leadership of President Eduard Shevardnadze, Georgia has made remarkable strides toward a free market economy and democratic rule of law. A constitution founded on democratic principles and values has been adopted, and free and fair presidential and parliamentary elections were held. A new generation of young, energetic democratic leaders has emerged, led by 34-year-old Zurab Zhvania, Chairman of the Parliament,who I recently met with. On the economic front, Georgia's new currency, the lari, has remained stable since its introduction in 1995. The International Monetary Fund and the U.S. Department of State have praised Georgia's economic initiatives and their significant progress in developing a free-market economy. Several U.S. corporations have already established a presence in Georgia, spurring jobs and economic growth in both nations.  Mr. President, I encourage everyone to note this historic day, and congratulate Georgia on its extraordinary progress toward democracy and free-market principles.                          ____________________
