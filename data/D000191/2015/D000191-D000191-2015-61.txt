Chairman, we are not quite at the end of this epic, but I would like to take a moment.  First, I want to reflect on the chairman's brief eulogy for Howard Coble, who was a wonderful member of the committee; and Howard's embarked on his last great voyage. We all remember him warmly.  I would like to thank the chairman and the chair of the subcommittee for the way in which we moved forward. This bill was a product of many, many months of negotiation between Members and staff. I think we have a good policy-based product here, so I want to thank the chairman and the chairman of the subcommittee. I want to thank my ranking member of the subcommittee, Eleanor Holmes Norton.  I want to thank my committee staff on my side: Helena Zyblikewycz, Auke Mahar-Piersma--we are blessed with interesting names on our side--AndrewOkuyiga, Ben Lockshin, Jennifer Homendy, Ryan Seiger, Alexa Old Crow. Of course, my chief of staff Kathy Dedrick. We have had much mention of the last time we did one of these bills. Kathy staffed me when we did the last time long-term bill, which was quite a few years ago. Jen Gilbreath, Jaime Harrell, and Luke Strimer.  On the Republican side, I particularly want to thank Chris Bertram and Murphie Barrett and all the other Republican staff for their fabulous work.  I won't say all the meetings were warm and fuzzy, but we worked stuff out in the end. I think we got a good product. I think going through this legislative process was a demonstration that House Members can individually be relevant, offer their ideas. They might be rejected, they might be accepted, but I think this was a very good process.  With that, I yield back the balance of my time.
