Chairman, I ask unanimous consent that 15 minutes of my time be yielded to the gentleman from Alabama [Mr. Cramer], and that he have the right to yield portions of that time as he sees fit.  The CHAIRMAN pro tempore (Mr. Quinn). Is there objection to the request of the gentleman from Wisconsin?  There was no objection.
