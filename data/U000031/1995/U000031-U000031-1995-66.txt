Speaker, I rise today to pay tribute and give sincere thanks to a long time member of my congressional staff who has been an unflappable administrator, devoted public servant and loyal friend. Jack Baker, my 6th District Congressional District Director, is embarking on the well-deserved retirement he had originally planned for nearly 10 years ago.  As Jack leaves, he departs from a district operation that is strong and swift in response because of the rock solid foundation he laid nearly a decade ago when I tapped him as my one and only choice to build a top notch constituent service operation, second to none.  As we know all too well, public service can be a very demanding occupation. Throughout the many legislative battles we have experienced out in Washington over the last 9 years, it was a great comfort to me to know that Jack was back home dutifully at the helm of our district operation.  As captain of our constituent service ship, Jack has kept us on a steady course, never underestimating the value of the views of ordinary citizens; never failing to give it his all to respond to their needs. For Jack, no problem was too big or too small.  Jack leaves, I am quite sure, with many good memories and outlandish stories of his life in our congressional office: yes, truth sometimes is stranger than fiction as Jack could tell you.  Despite the many challenges of being a district director, and the curve balls frequently thrown, Jack always maintained a common sense approach, easy going manner, and a much welcomed and finely honed sense of humor. It is for those qualities that he is known and loved by the numerous people he has come in contact with over the course of his career in our office.  It is very rare to find an individual who can so effectively yet humbly perform his or her duties, day in and day out, without demanding anything more than the enjoyment that comes from serving others. Jack Baker, through thick and thin has always treated people with respect, dignity and decency. He leaves a tremendous void and will be sorely missed by the many who have enjoyed working with him as he oversaw and actively participated in the vast myriad of services provided by a congressional district office.  Jack, for many years you have enthusiastically and effectively served the people of the 6th District; you have warmed many hearts and made a difference to many people. I wish you and Teri many years of good health and happiness as you open a new chapter in your life together.                          ____________________
