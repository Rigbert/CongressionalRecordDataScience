Speaker, I rise today to pay tribute to a man of true faith--longtime servant of the church and our larger community in the greater Toledo area, the dear and beloved Rev. Edward O. Hug. He generously bestowed upon our community, particularly in the Catholic parishes throughout northwest Ohio to which he devoted his life for 47 years gentleness, dedication, and spiritual depth.  A man of God, Father Hug ministered to thousands, providing counsel, direction, and solace. His final parish was my own, Little Flower Catholic Church in Toledo.  As we remember Father Hug, his life, and his work and reflect upon his passing, I would like to quote from what has been regarded as one of Father Hug's finest sermons. In discussing life's passages, Father Hug told his congregation, ``we should never be afraid of dying. When a baby comes into this world, the baby says `I'm afraid to be born.' Then he comes out into the world and sees all the friendly faces and realizes the world is a wonderful place.'' It's the same with death. We're all afraid of dying, but when we die, we areentering a new life. And it's the most wonderful place to be.'' Upon his own death, to which he professed to look forward, Father Hug's words echo. We know that he is at peace after a long and heroic struggle, and he is happy.  Our entire community expresses heartfelt gratitude for the life and beneficence of Father Edward Hug. No man could have given others more. We extend our prayers to his family, his brothers Father Fritz and Father Relmond Hug, also men of the church, and Eldred Hug, his devoted sisters Virginia Kunisch and Marlene Alter, and the entire Hug family. Godspeed.                          ____________________
