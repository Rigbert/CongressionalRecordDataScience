Phillips who died on February 24, 2008 in Baghdad, Iraq.  Michael left for basic training on June 24, 2006. Upon finishing advanced infantry training, he was assigned to Bravo Company 1 of the 502nd Strike Brigade of the 101st Airborne Division.  On October 13, 2007, he and his teammates deployed to Iraq in support of Operation Iraqi Freedom. Just 4 months into his deployment an improvised explosive device tore through the door of the vehicle he was driving. Despite the severity of his injuries he continued to smile and reassure those taking care of him. Even in the most grim and serious times, Michael still fought and lifted up those around him.  He is survived by his parents Steven and Angelia Phillips, his brothers David and Anthony, and his sister Barbara--all of Ardmore, OK.  Michael excelled at drawing and had been offered admission to the San Francisco Art Institute, his mother said. But serving his country meant more than going to college, she said.  ``He came home one day and said he wanted to join the Army, and we got in the car and went down to the recruiting station,'' Anglia Phillips said. ``He said terrorism was like a virus. It had to be stopped. It had to be contained.'' Her son was reenlisting to join for 2 more years because ``he didn't want to leave his squad, his guys,'' she said.  Today we remember Army SPC Michael E. Phillips, a young man who loved his family and country, and gave his life as a sacrifice for freedom.                      Corporal Bryan J. Scripsick
