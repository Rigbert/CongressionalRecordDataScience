Corona, California has been blessed by dynamic and dedicated leaders who willingly and unselfishly give their time and talent and make their communities a better place to live and work.  Alan was five years old and attending kindergarten in Titusville, a small town in western Pennsylvania, when he first met a pretty young girl named Susan. For 58 years, Alan and Susan were best friends. For almost 39 years, they were husband and wife. Over the years, they have enjoyed a multitude of blessings, most importantly their son, Josh, and his wife, Jill, who have blessed Alan and Susan with two beautiful grandchildren. While Alan died long before we would have wished, Alan had some precious time to spend with his grandchildren. During those last months, Matthew and Garret witnessed the character of their ``Poppy'' that will serve them well for the rest of their lives. They learned that Alan was a man who loved to laugh but was not afraid to cry; that he would stand strong to defend the values that were important to him, but would melt in the face of another's sadness. The size of his heart belied his stature, and his generosity touched so many lives.  Since 1982, the Wakefields have owned ASJ Industrial Hose, whose name is an acronym for Alan, Susan and Josh. Alan would often say, ``Hose is my life.'' It was not, of course. His family was his life, along with the many friendships he formed over the years. He was also passionate about golf, was a gourmet cook, and an avid gardener who referred to plants by their Latin names. While Susan has been active in just about every organization in Corona with three or more members, Alan for the most part remained in the background; he was not ``a joiner.'' But a few years ago, he relented and joined the Corona Rotary Club, and was one of its most popular and active members.  Near the end of his life, visitors would find Alan to be more interested in what they were doing than talking about his health. When friends would mention they were considering a trip or a home improvement project, Alan would say, ``Do it. Do it now.'' He was speaking from a perspective that the rest of us could only imagine, and some of us sensed that he was suggesting something more than that. Don't put off those trips and projects, but more than that, don't put off telling someone you care, righting a wrong and keep focused on your life's priorities.  On behalf of all those who knew him, it is my honor to offer these remarks as a tribute to the life and legacy of my friend Alan Wakefield. His life and presence will be sorely missed and I extend my condolences to his dear family and friends.                          ____________________
