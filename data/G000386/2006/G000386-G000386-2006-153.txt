 President, I rise to pay tribute to Yvonne R. Goodman. Funeral services were held for her this morning. Yvonne served on my Washington, DC, staff in the Senate and in the House of Representatives for a total of 28 years, and she worked for my predecessor in the House of Representatives, Congressman H.R. Gross, for 25 years. She began helping me the first day I arrived on Capitol Hill and continued until she retired in 2002. In total, Yvonne served the people of Iowa for a remarkable 53 years. There is no doubt that Iowans benefited from her loyalty to their representatives in the Congress and her standard of excellence in her work. I was very fortunate to have her on my staff. Yvonne was from Osage, IA. She was a special person and a valuable and trusted employee. She made a great contribution with her selfless and dedicated public service. Her husband Jim is also a friend. He, too, worked in government and shared Yvonne's commitment to the people's business. Yvonne and Jim were an integral part of my office family for 28 years. They touched the lives of so many fellow staffers with their caring ways. They were gardeners who loved to share their beautiful flowers and plants. My wife Barbara joins me today in extending our sympathy to Jim and saluting the life and many good deeds of his beloved Yvonne.                          ____________________
