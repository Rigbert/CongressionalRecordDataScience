Chairman, I rise in support of the Obey amendment and I want to make an observation to the gentleman from Oklahoma [Mr. Istook], my friend with whom I serve on two of the subcommittees. The fact of the matter is, we have not had a bill since I have been a member of the Committee, January of 1983, in which this kind of language was protected. Not one in that 14 years. It was not protected last year or the year before that or the year before that or the year before that.  Mr. Chairman, what has happened not just in this bill, but in numerous bills, the authorizing committees have been ignored and we are trying to jam through legislative language on appropriations bills.  Mr. Chairman, we ought to reject it. Pass the Obey amendment.
