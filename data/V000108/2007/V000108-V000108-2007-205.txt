Linda Buzinec, the longtime Mayor of Hobart, IN. A close personal friend of mine, I can truly say that Linda is one of Northwest Indiana's most distinguished and honorable citizens, as well as one of its greatest leaders. She is one of the most involved citizens that I have ever known, especially when it comes to her service to the people of Hobart, IN. First elected to public office in 1988, Linda has been a constant fixture in Hobart, where she has always been fully committed to the people she was elected to serve. Most recently, Linda has served as Mayor of the City of Hobart for the past 12 years. Her efforts throughout her career in public service and the impact she has had onthe city and the people of Hobart will forever be remembered. To honor Linda, a reception will be held at the Avalon Manor in Hobart, IN, on Tuesday, November 27, 2007.   Linda Schmelter was born in Gary, Indiana, to Leonard and Ann Schmelter. A lifelong resident of Hobart, Linda attended Saint Bridget Elementary School and Hobart High School. Upon her graduation, prior to beginning her career as a public servant, Linda was employed by Hobart Federal Savings. Undoubtedly, this position helped Linda develop the communication and organizational skills that would be critical in her future roles as an elected official. Early on, Linda began her career in the public sector in Hobart as an employee of the Hobart Clerk-Treasurer's Office. Throughout the years, she also held positions with the Northern Indiana Public Service Company, NIPSCO, where she was stationed in both the Hobart and Gary locations.   In 1988, Linda was elected First District Councilperson, a position she held through 1995, when she was elected mayor. This began Linda's 12-year mayoral career. During that time, Linda's commitment and proven leadership skills led to many impressive advancements, many of which will have an immeasurable impact on the City and the people of Hobart for years to come. For all of Linda's leadership, hard work, and dedication to the people of Hobart, Linda was awarded the prestigious Sagamore of the Wabash Award in 2005 from former Governor Joseph E. Kernan.   Although Linda's responsibilities in her capacity as mayor have occupied a large amount of her time, Linda has always been active in various organizations throughout the years, including: the Kiwanis, the Hobart Industrial Economic Development Corporation, HIEDC, the Hobart Chamber of Commerce, the Hobart YMCA, and the School City Educational Foundation. She has served on several boards, including: the Workforce Development Board, the Crisis Center Board, and the Saint Mary Medical Board. A dedicated and lifelong Democrat, Linda has also served as Vice-Chair of the Hobart and Lake County Democratic Precinct Organizations and as Treasurer of the Indiana State Democratic Organization.   While Linda has passionately served the people of Hobart with unwavering dedication for many years, her commitment to her community is surpassed only by her love for her family. A loving wife, mother, and grandmother, Linda and her husband, George, have been married for over 26 years. They have one son, Michael, and two teenage grandchildren, whom they cherish and adore.   Madam Speaker, Linda Buzinec has selflessly given her time and efforts to the people of Hobart, Indiana, throughout her years of service. At this time, I ask that you and all of my distinguished colleagues join me in commending her for her years of service and dedication, and I ask that you join me in wishing her the best of health and happiness in the years to come.                          ____________________
