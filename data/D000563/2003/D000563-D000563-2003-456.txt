 This legislation addresses the issue from one perspective only. To deny to this person and other victims an opportunity for their day in court, to say we don't trust a jury in America, in any State in the Union, to make a decision on the death penalty in a criminal case, or we cannot trust a jury in Chicago to make a decision on what she is entitled to receive because of the injuries she endured in that one tragic moment in the hospital, that just defies logic.  It says to me that this bill is being brought to us by insurance companies, by drug companies, by HMOs, by medical device manufacturers, and it is not being brought to us with an eye toward solving a serious national problem of bringing down malpractice insurance rates.  I am going to reserve the remainder of my time. When I return, I will talk about an alternative bill that Senator Graham of South Carolina and I are offering, which addresses this in a more responsible and timely fashion. I reserve the remainder of my time.
