 We're ending now, but I know you have an extraordinarily able assistant sitting to your right who advises you on issues of great importance to our country. The gentleman to my right does the same thing for me.  The gentleman to my right went to Wake Forest. Maryland played Wake Forest last night, and I hope as we play Duke tonight that we are equally successful. Mr. Nevins, who is a graduate of Duke, it's going to be a little tougher game than Wake Forest. I understand that. But we look forward to trying to be successful in that effort.  Kyle Nevins is a wonderful member of the majority leader's staff. He worked for my dear and close friend, Roy Blunt, for some period of time, and he began working for Mr. Cantor in 2008 as his floor director. He's been a real delight to work with, and I know Mr. Burnes and my floor staff all appreciate all the work he has done.  While I want to be very effusive today, I want him to know that I will be rooting very vigorously against Duke tonight when they play Maryland.  I yield back the balance of my time.                          ____________________
