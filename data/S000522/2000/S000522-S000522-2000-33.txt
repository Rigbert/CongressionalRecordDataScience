Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentleman from New York (Mr. Gilman) for yielding me time.  Mr. Speaker, at the outset, let me give a special thanks to Bob Hand, who is a specialist on the Balkans, especially the former Yugoslavia and Albania, at the Helsinki Commission. As my colleagues know just a few moments ago, we passed H.R. 1064 by voice vote, legislation that I had introduced early last year. We went through many drafts and redrafts, and I would like to just thank Bob for the excellent work he and Dorothy Taft, the Commission's Chief of Staff, did on that legislation.  H.R. 1064 would not have been brought to the floor in a form we know the Senate will pass quickly and then forward for signature, without their tremendous work on this piece of legislation, and their organization of a whole series of hearings that the Helsinki Commission has held on the Balkans. We have had former Bosnian Prime Minister Silajdzic, for example, testify at several hearings.  The Congress itself has had so much input into this diplomatic process which we know as the ``Helsinki process,'' and they have done yeoman's work on that.  Mr. Speaker, I rise and ask my colleagues to support passage of H.J. Res. 100, recognizing the 25th anniversary of the signing of the Helsinki Final Act. I am pleased that we have more than 40 cosponsors on this resolution, and that includes all of our colleagues on the Helsinki Commission. The gentleman from Maryland (Mr. Hoyer), is the ranking Democratic Member, and my good friend and colleague.  Mr. Speaker, the Helsinki Final Act was a watershed event in European history, which set in motion what has become known as the Helsinki process. With its language on human rights, this agreement granted human rights the status of a fundamental principle regulating relations between the signatory countries. Yes, there were other provisions that dealt with economic issues as well as security concerns, but this country rightfully chose to focus attention on the human rights issues especially during the Cold War years and the dark days of the Soviet Union.  The Helsinki process, I would respectfully submit to my colleagues, was very helpful, in fact instrumental, in relegating the Communist Soviet empire to the dust bin of history. The standards of Helsinki constitute a valuable lever in pressing human rights issues.  The West, and especially the United States, used Helsinki to help people in Czechoslovakia, in East Germany and in all the countries that made up the OSCE, which today comprises 54 nations with the breakup of the Soviet Union and other States along with the addition of some new States.  Let me just read to my colleagues a statement that was made by President Gerald Ford, who actually signed the Helsinki Accords in 1975. He stated, and I quote, ``the Helsinki Final Act was the final nail in the coffin of Marxism and Communism in many, many countries and helped bring about the change to a more democratic political system and a change to a more market oriented economic system.''  The current Secretary General of the OSCE, Jan Kubis, a Slovak, has stated, and I quote him, ``As we remember together the signature of the Helsinki Final Act, we commemorate the beginning of our liberation, not by armies, not by methods of force or intervention, but as a result of the impact and inspiration of the norms and values of an open civilized society, enshrined in the Helsinki Final Act and of the encouragement it provided to strive for democratic change and of openings it created to that end.''  Mr. Speaker, the Helsinki Final Act is a living document. We regularly hold follow-up conferences and meetings emphasizing various aspects of the accords, pressing for compliance by all signatory states. I urge Members to support this resolution, and I am very proud, as I stated earlier, to be Chairman of the Helsinki Commission.  Mr. Speaker, I include for the Record the Statement made by the U.S. Ambassador to the OSCE, David T. Johnson, at the Commemorative meeting on the 25th Anniversary of the Helsinki Final Act      Statement at the 25th Anniversary of the Helsinki Final Act  (By Ambassador David T. Johnson to the Commemorative Meeting of the                      Permanent Council of the OSCE)       Madame Chairperson, as we look with fresh eyes today at the      document our predecessors signed on August 1, 1975, we are      struck by the breadth of their vision. They agreed to work      together on an amazing range of issues, some of which we are      only now beginning to address. The States participating in      the meeting affirmed the objective of ``ensuring conditions      in which their people can live in true and lasting peace free      from any threat to or attempt against their security;'' they      recognized the ``indivisibility of security in Europe'' and a      ``common interest in the development of cooperation      throughout Europe.''       One of the primary strengths of the Helsinki process is its      comprehensive nature and membership. Human rights, military      security, and trade and economic issues can be pursued in the      one political organization that unites all the countries of      Europe including the former Soviet republics, the United      States and Canada, to face today's challenges. Over the past      twenty-five years we have added pieces to fit the new      realities--just last November in Istanbul we agreed on a new      Charter for European Security and an adapted Conventional      Forces in Europe treaty.       But the most significant provision of the Helsinki      Agreement may have been the so-called Basket III on Human      Rights. As Henry Kissinger pointed out in a speech three      weeks after the Final Act was signed, ``At Helsinki, for the      first time in the postwar period, human rights and      fundamental freedoms became recognized subjects of East-West      discourse and negotiations. The conference put forward .  .       . standards of humane conduct, which have been--and still      are--a beacon of hope to millions.''       In resolutions introduced to our Congress this summer,      members noted that the standards of Helsinki provided      encouragement and sustenance to courageous individuals who      dared to challenge repressive regimes. Many paid a high price      with the loss of their freedom or even their lives. Today we      have heard from you, the representatives of the many who      have struggled in the cause of human rights throughout the      years since Helsinki. We are in awe of you, of the      difficult and dangerous circumstances of your lives, and      of what you have and are accomplishing.       Many of us here cannot comprehend the conditions of life in      a divided Europe. And those who lived under repressive      regimes could not have imagined how quickly life changed      after 1989. Political analysts both East and West were      astounded at the rapidity with which the citizens of the      former Iron Curtain countries demanded their basic rights as      citizens of democratic societies. What we have heard time and      again is that the Helsinki Final Act did matter. Leaders and      ordinary citizens took heart from its assertions. The      implementation review meetings kept a focus fixed on its      provisions.       Even before the Wall came down, a new generation of leaders      like Nemeth in Hungary and Gorbachev in the Soviet Union made      decisions to move in new directions, away from bloodshed and      repression. In the summer of 1989, the Hungarians and      Austrian cooperated with the West Germans to allow Romanians      and East Germans to migrate to the West. Looking at what was      happening in Europe, the young State Department analyst      Francis Fukuyama, wrote an article which captured the world's      attention. In ``The End of History,'' he claimed that what      was happening was not just the end of the Cold War but the      end of the debate over political systems. A consensus had      formed that democracy, coupled with a market economy, was the      best system for fostering the most freedom possible.       And then in the night of November 9, 1989, the Berlin Wall      opened unexpectedly. Citizens emerging from repressive      regimes knew about democracy and told the world that what      they wanted more than anything else was to vote in free and      fair elections. Only a year after the fall of the Wall, a      reunited Germany held elections at the state and national      level. Poland, Hungary, and the Baltic states carried out      amazing transformations beginning with elections which      brought in democratic systems. When Albania descended into      chaos in 1997, groups across the country shared a common      desire for fair elections. We have seen Croatia and the      Slovak Republic re-direct their courses in the past several      years, not by violence but through the ballot box. Just a few      weeks ago, citizens of Montenegro voted in two cities with      two different results--in both instances there was no      violence and the new governments are moving forward with      reforms to benefit their citizens. OSCE has time and again      stepped up to assist with elections and give citizens an      extra measure of reassurance that the rest of the world      supports them in the exercise of their democratic rights.       We are all aware that in the decades since Helsinki, we      have seen conflict, torture, and ethnic violence within the      OSCE area. Unfortunately, not all areas in the OSCE region      made a peaceful transition to the Euro-Atlantic community of      democratic prosperity. Some OSCE countries remain one-party      states or suffer under regimes which suppress political      opposition. Perhaps the most troubled region is the former      Yugoslavia. As Laura Silber has written in the text to the      BBC series ``The Death of Yugoslavia,'' ``Yugoslavia did not      die a natural death. Rather, it was deliberately and      systematically killed off by men who had nothing to gain and      everything to lose from a peaceful transition from state      socialism and one-party rule to free-market democracy.''       We need only look at the devastation of Chechnya and the      continuing ethnic strife in parts of the former Yugoslavia to      realize there is much still to be done in the OSCE region. We      must continue our work together to minimize conflict and      bring contending sides together, foster economic reforms      through enhanced transparency, promote environmental      responsibility, and or fight against organized crime and      corruption. Human rights remain very much on our agenda as we      seek to eradicate torture, and find new solutions for the      integration of immigrants, minorities and vulnerable peoples      into our political life.       ``Without a vision,'' wrote the prophet Isaiah so long ago,      ``the people will perish.'' We here today have a vision of      collective security for all the citizens of the OSCE region.      After twenty-five years, the goals embodied in the Helsinki      final act remain a benchmark toward which we must continue to      work. The Panelists have reminded us today that the Helsinki      Final Act has incalculable symbolic meaning to the citizens      of our region; we must continue to take on new challenges as      we strive to keep this meaning alive.
