Speaker, it is my distinct honor and pleasure to commend the following residents of Indiana's First Congressional District for their display of bravery, community service, and altruistic heroism in rescuing over one hundred senior citizens from a fire in the Lake County Nursing and Rehabilitation Center, in East Chicago, Indiana, on June 20, 1998: Foster Battle, Leroy Butts, Dion Cook, Dwayne Cook, Priscilla Cook, Jermaine Cousinard, Betty Gibbs, Johnny Gillis, Darcey Glenn, Mitch Glover, Andrew Gregory, Dwayne Jackson, Anna Rose Jefferson, Jackie Jones, Joey Jones, Johnny Jones, Tyrus Julkes, Bennie Sapp, Louis Sapp, Willie Scott, Alan Simmons, Tim Taylor, Waylane Upshaw, Louis Ward, and Arthur Washington. In recognition of their unselfish efforts, these valiant heroes were honored by the City of East Chicago in a ceremony on July 1st, in Riley Park.  Though five residents of the nursing home were hospitalized, there would have been many more injuries, and even death, if not for the dozens of neighbors, friends, and passers-by who rushed to the scene of the fire. Minutes before the fire trucks and firefighters arrived from the East Chicago Fire Department, the intrepid rescuers were breaking windows with their hands and feet to evacuate the 112 residents from the blazing nursing home. Placing their own lives in danger, these brave humanitarians repeatedly entered the building, evacuated residents, and aided firefighters in caring for the injured until medical help could arrive. If not for their heroic efforts, many more could have been injured, or might have perished, in the fire.  This neighborhood effort shows the importance of community and friendship to the people of Northwest Indiana. Without the teamwork, leadership, and effort shown by these heroes, an unthinkable tragedy might have occurred. Moreover, these dauntless efforts represent the real value, respect, and honor the region shows its senior citizens. This noble rescue shows what a neighborhood can accomplish when working in concert, as well as representing an ideal of every true American community in a crisis.  Mr. Speaker, I ask you and my other distinguished colleagues to join me in commending the brave efforts of these upstanding citizens, as well as the East Chicago Fire Department, for their extraordinarily heroic efforts, last month, which saved the lives of the 112 residents of the Lake County Nursing and Rehabilitation Center.                          ____________________
