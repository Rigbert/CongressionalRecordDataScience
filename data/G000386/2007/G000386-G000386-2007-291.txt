 President, I yield myself such time as I might consume. I only have 2\1/2\ minutes.                           Amendment No. 1039  On the very important amendment about making sure there is adequate cooperation and dialog between the Office of New Drugs and the Office of Postmarket Surveillance, I wish to make clear this amendment is not, as some have characterized it, about process. It seems to me this is the ultimate of insurance to do the right thing to protect the American people on the safety of drugs. It is based on so many examples I found over the last 3 years, where there was not the respect for the Office of Postmarketing Surveillance there ought to be from the Office of New Drugs.  A lot of safety issues would not have gotten out if we had not had a lot of red-blooded, patriotic whistleblowers who would come to Congress, such as Dr. Graham, for instance, in the case of Vioxx, such as Dr. Mosholder, in the case of depressants for children who were committing suicide. This ended up with Vioxx coming off the market. This ended up with black-box safety measures in the case of the antidepressants.  The Institute of Medicine has recognized the importance of these two groups within the FDA working very closely together on making a determination on postmarketing surveillance. That is what my amendment does. It makes sure this process works the way the Institute of Medicine indicated it should.  So as you consider voting on this amendment, I ask my colleagues--himself or herself--one basic question before voting: Since the Institute of Medicine recommends equality between the preapproval process--in other words, before a drug is marketed--and the postapproval process at the FDA, why not vote for this amendment and improve postmarketing safety for the American people?  I yield the floor.
