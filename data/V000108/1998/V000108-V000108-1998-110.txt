Speaker, it is my distinct pleasure to commend Dr. Panayotis Iatridis, a decorated physician who has devoted his life to the scholarly pursuit of medical education, on his 23rd anniversary as Assistant Dean and Director of the Northwest Center for Medical Education at the Indiana University School of Medicine. In honor of his 23 years of outstanding service, the Advisory Council for the Northwest Center for Medical Education will host a recognition dinner on the evening of Saturday, March 28, 1998, at the Radisson Hotel at Star Plaza in Merrillville, Indiana.  On July 1, 1975, Dr. Iatridis was named Director of the Northwest Center for Medical Education, where he had served as Associate Professor and Director of the Physiology Course for medical students since 1972. During his 25 years with the Northwest Center, he has been integrally involved in every aspect of its operation, including the curriculum, administration, and service to students. As a member of the faculty, Dr. Iatridis organized and implemented a variety of courses, seminars, educational programs, and conferences for medical students, graduate students, post-doctoral trainees, faculty, and physicians in Northwest Indiana. Perhaps Dr. Iatridis' most noteworthy contribution to the Northwest Center's curriculum came in 1990, with his development and implementation of the ``Regional Center Alternative Pathway'', which is the educational program for first- and second-year medical students. Dr. Iatridis is also responsible for all administrative and academic affairs of the Northwest Center, and he has devoted much of his time to assisting medical students through different aspects of counseling and advising, including pre-medical student counseling and research project advising.  In addition to his dedicated work with the Indiana University School of Medicine, Dr. Iatridis has utilized his talents for the betterment of the Northwest Indiana community. Some of the organizations he has served include the City of Gary Economic Development Commission, the Gary Community School Corporation, the Lake and Porter County Medical Society Care of the Indigent Committee, and the Northwest Indiana Forum Foundation. Dr. Iatridis has also served as a board member of the Porter County Mental Health Association, Vice-Chairman of the Lake County Community Health Association, Chairman of the Lake County Medical Advisory Committee of the Community Health Association, the Program Committee of the Gary Rotary Club, and the Porter Starke Infection Control Committee.  Dr. Iatridis has received numerous prestigious awards, honors, and recognitions for his many professional and public service achievements. In recognition of his professional accomplishments, he received a Special Recognition for Outstanding Contributions to Medical Education by the Asian-American Medical Society, in 1991; a commendation from the Asian-American Medical Society for Outstanding Contribution to Medical Education in Northwest Indiana, in 1997; and the Wisdom Award of Honor from the Wisdom Societyfor the Advancement of Knowledge, Learning, and Research in Education, earlier this year. For his service to the community, Dr. Iatridis earned the Hank Jacobsen Award from the Gary Rotary Club, in 1985; the Edgar L. Mills Community Service Award from the Post-Tribune, in 1987; and the Medal of St. Paul from the Archdiocesan of the Greek Orthodox Church of North and South America.  Mr. Speaker, I ask you and my other distinguished colleagues to join me in commending Dr. Panayotis Iatridis on the occasion of his 23rd anniversary as Assistant Dean and Director of the Northwest Center for Medical Education. His wife, Catherine, their two daughters, Yanna and Mary, and their two granddaughters, Katerina and Anastasia, should be proud of his achievements. Indeed, Dr. Iatridis' efforts have made an indelible mark on the advancement of medical education, as well as an improvement in the quality of life for everyone in Northwest Indiana.                          ____________________
