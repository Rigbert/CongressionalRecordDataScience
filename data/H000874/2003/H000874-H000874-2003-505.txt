Speaker, I yield to the gentleman from Texas (Mr. DeLay), the distinguished majority leader for purposes of inquiring about the calendar.  Mr. DeLAY. Mr. Speaker, I appreciate the Whip yielding to me, and I would note, Mr. Speaker, that the House has completed its business for the week.  While we expected to consider the Armed Services Tax Fairness Act today, some problems with the bill have arisen, and we intend to work through those problems over the next several days and hope to consider the bill in the very near future.  Mr. Speaker, if the gentleman would continue to yield.
