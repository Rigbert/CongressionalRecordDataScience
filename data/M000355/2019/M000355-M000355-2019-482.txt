 We will vote on considering a package of domestic funding bills, and if we take up the legislation, I intend to stay on it until we complete it.  On both sides of the Capitol, our Democratic colleagues have spent recent weeks insisting over and over that their 3-year-old quest to impeach the President will not prevent them from the substantive work American families need us to tackle. So far, the early returns haven't been too encouraging.  A few weeks ago, we saw the unusual spectacle of Senate Democrats voting to filibuster defense funding due to political fights with the White House. Democrats blocked a pay raise for our servicemembers because they would rather fight with the President.  We know that across the Capitol, for months now, Speaker Pelosi has been blocking the USMCA and blocking the 176,000 new American jobs it would create.  This week offers another test. Soon we will be voting on appropriations, and we will see whether our Democratic friends really can put aside their impeachment obsession long enough to get some real work done on the side. Actions speak louder than words.  First, I hope we will tackle a package of domestic funding bills. After that, we will turn to a defense vehicle. I urge our Democratic colleagues to drop the stall tactics that have left funding for our Armed Forces in limbo and join with Republicans to deliver the funding our military commanders need to keep us safe.                          ____________________
