Speaker, unfortunately, the House action tonight does not reflect those words from this morning's op-ed.  Mr. Speaker, we ought to have a responsible, bipartisan measure to provide the needed funds to address the border crisis, but we also must see this as a reminder of why we must pass comprehensive immigration reform.  Speaker Boehner, himself, said the House would act, saying last May:       The House remains committed to fixing our broken      immigration system.  This is not a fix. But tonight, we must address the crisis before us. Our Republican friends should work with Democrats on a solution that can pass the House--this probably can--pass the Senate--this cannot--and be signed by the President. Nobody here, as Congressman Fleming indicated, believes that will be the case.  Tonight will be a loss for rational humanitarian action and a victory for partisan, negative policy. How sad. How wrong. How disappointing to the American people.
