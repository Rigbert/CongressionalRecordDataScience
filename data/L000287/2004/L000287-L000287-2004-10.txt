Mr. Speaker, the Vice President of the United States said yesterday, ``It is absolutely essential that 8 weeks from today on November 2nd, we make the right choice, because if we make the wrong choice, then the danger is that we'll get hit again.'' The words of the Vice President, Vice President Cheney.  That is absolutely outrageous. It is unreal. It is unbelievable.  My fellow Americans, I want you to know that this administration will say anything, even do anything to stay in power. They will deceive, they will mislead, and they will steal. They will not tell the truth. There should be a sense of righteous indignation all across America, in the American media.  The Vice President of the United States is preaching the politics of fear. He is trying to scare the American people. We can do better, much better, with the politics of hope. For we are one people, one America, one family, one House. The American family. The American House. Shame on you, Mr. Vice President.                          ____________________
