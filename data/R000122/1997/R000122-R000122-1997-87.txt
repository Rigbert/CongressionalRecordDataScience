 Again, when we think about this legislation, we have to think about also that there are a complex set of incentives and disincentives for the best possible behavior by pharmaceutical and device companies. I don't think any of us would like to unwittingly create a situation in which devices approved for one use are cavalierly marketed by companies for other uses and are merely winked at when they do not fall within the category of the approval. So that is another important issue.  There is another aspect of this which I would like to raise with Senator Kennedy, and that is, I understand that Secretary Shalala has communicated concerns about this issue. I understand that she is concerned about this and her concern may be of such a level that it could suggest that she recommend to the President a veto of this legislation. A veto would be, I think, particularly unfortunate since we have worked so hard, we have made so much progress, and we have reached a point where we are very close to legislation which could virtually pass with unanimity in this body. It would be unfortunate that this type of provision of the bill would disrupt that process. I wonder if that is correct.
