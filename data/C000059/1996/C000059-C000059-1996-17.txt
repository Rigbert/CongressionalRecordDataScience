Speaker, I would like to thank my good friend, Chris Cox, for his foresight and hard work on this important piece of legislation. In addition, I would also thank subcommittee Chair Morella for shepherding this bill through the Science Committee.  In many cases hard metric conversion requires plants to retool their facilities to produce a product that is in no way improved. It is merely a slightly different dimension.  In the construction industry, virtually no domestic U.S. manufacturers produce hard metric products.  Only Canadian and other foreign firms have the production capacity to produce sufficient hard metric products.  H.R. 2779 would put teeth into the Metric Conversion Act's impractical, inefficient, loss of markets limitation by providing a mechanism by which a soft metric standard could be substituted when problems arise.  It does not seek to prevent a metric conversion for Federal projects. This bill clarifies the law to more closely pursue its intent, providing for the most efficient and least costly conversion possible.  H.R. 2779 has broad bipartisan support. Vice President Gore's National Performance Review recommended that Federal agencies avoid Government-unique products and requirements due to excessive expense and delays.  H.R. 2779 will do just that. It will eliminate the burdensome hard metric requirement in Federal construction. This alone will reduce Federal construction costs by 15 to 20 percent.  I urge my colleagues to support this important bipartisan proposal.
