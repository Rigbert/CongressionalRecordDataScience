 President, today we are taking a critical step toward saving Social Security. However, in considering this measure we are seeking to reaffirm provisions in the current law stating that money earmarked for Social Security should not be considered for purposes of the Federal budget. Furthermore, this measure would make it very difficult for this Congress and Administration, or future Congresses and Administrations, to use Social Security surpluses to achieve a balanced budget.  In his 1998 State of the Union address, the President pledged to save every penny of the Social Security surplus for Social Security. Many of us supported his pledge and worked not to spend Social Security surplus money. However, his fiscal year 2000 budget request would require the use of $158 billion in Social Security surplus money over the next five years.  The ``lockbox'' measure we are considering today would prohibit Congress or the President from spending Social Security trust fund money but would still allow Congress the flexibility needed in case unforeseen emergencies, such as a war or a recession, develop. It is vital that we take steps to exercise fiscal restraint so that we don't squander the surpluses necessary to enact improvements to the Social Security program which would enhance the retirement security of our children and grandchildren.  I believe that this is of critical importance in the path toward saving Social Security, so much so that I am missing a field hearing by the Senate Committee on Commerce, Science and Transportation back home in Iowa that Senator McCain was gracious enough to hold on the difficulties Iowa faces with competition in the airline industry. Unfortunately, I can't be there right now, but I hope my being here to cast this vote supporting this proposal is a testament to the importance of taking steps to bring us closer to saving Social Security.
