President, this is kind of a litmus test amendment. We have had it up a couple times before. We do intend to pick up votes each time. It is an amendment to get into some of the big spending we do around here. With the exception of trust votes and national defense, it says that any vote on appropriations that exceeds the previous year has to have a two-thirds majority.  This amendment is endorsed by a number of groups, including the American Conservative Union, Christian Coalition, and other groups. It will be a scored vote. It is a very significant vote. I think it is really the only meaningful vote to do something about curbing spending that we will have the entire day.  I reserve the remainder of my time.
