 President, I would be delighted to do that, but I want to warn anybody who comes to the floor, I came to the floor to deliver what I thought to be, if not enlightened, a comprehensive rationale for why I think we should act. I am happy to stay here as long as possible, and I am happy to delay giving that speech, but as long as the Senator realizes that when we finish our discussion, it is going to take me 20 to 25 minutes to deliver this speech.  One of the arguments here that no one has laid out sufficiently--I am not sure I am capable of it--is why we should do what the President is seeking to do, why we should do what NATO has voted to do, and why we should be either for or against doing that.  We did discuss here a very important subject about whether or not it is constitutionally permissible to use force absent congressional consent.  All I am suggesting is that the President and those of us who support the use of airpower in conjunction with NATO should lay out why that action is in America's interest. What are the costs, what are the risks, what are the benefits, and why should we do it? Those who disagree with our position should lay out in one place, where people can go to the Record, why they think we should not do that. There are legitimate arguments in opposition beyond the constitutional arguments in opposition to the use of force in Kosovo.  As long as the Senator understands that, I am happy to yield for questions. I do not want to keep him here to have to listen to my speech. When we conclude this colloquy, if I do not lose the floor, I will be delivering that speech.  I am happy to yield for a question.
