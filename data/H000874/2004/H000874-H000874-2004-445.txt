Speaker, I rise to pay tribute to Mike Bessler, the Chief Publications Clerk with the Office of Official Reporters under the Clerk of the House.  Mike will be retiring on July 30 after 23 years of service to the House making sure our committee transcripts are accurate, properly bound and delivered on time. I am pleased to have this opportunity to commend one of my constituents for his outstanding service to this institution.  Originally from the Bronx, New York, Mike served a 4-year tour in the Air Force, stationed at Wright Patterson in Ohio and Shemya in the Aleutian Islands.  He was finally discharged from Andrews Air Force Base, and with his wife, Peggy decided to stay in the Washington, D. C. area, where he spent over a decade in the private sector before being hired by the Office of Official Reporters in January 1981. He has served in that office with distinction ever since.  Mike has spent his years working closely with the House committees to ensure their satisfaction with the transcripts. Through his dedicated supervision of the Publications Office, he has been the quintessential dedicated public servant.  Those who worked with him are privileged to have worked with an individual of Mike's level of professionalism.  Mike and Peggy are the proud parents of two daughters, Michelle and Kelly, and doting grandparents of Erica, Ezra and Zoe.  Mike looks forward to spending time with them and enjoying gardening, home projects, and devoting more time to a lifelong fascination with film and movies.  Thank you, Mike, for your many years of dedicated, professional service to the House and the country. Best wishes to you and Peggy in your retirement.                          ____________________
