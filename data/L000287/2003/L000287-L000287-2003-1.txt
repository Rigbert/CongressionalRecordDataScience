Mr. Speaker, I want to thank the gentleman from Connecticut (Mr. Larson), the ranking member, for yielding me this time.  Mr. Speaker, I rise tonight in support of H.R. 3491, the National African American Museum History and Culture Act. First I would like to thank all of my colleagues who have labored long days, weeks, months, and even years to help realize a dream deferred for nearly 100 years, the establishment of a national museum that documents the significant contributions of African Americans.  It has been my honor and pleasure to work with the gentleman from the State of Georgia (Mr. Kingston), my dear friend, but tonight in addition to thanking the gentleman from Georgia (Mr. Kingston), I also want to thank the gentleman from Ohio (Chairman Ney) for not giving up, for not giving in, for not giving out. And I thank the gentleman from Connecticut (Mr. Larson), ranking member, for his commitment to making the National African American Museum a reality. I want to commend the gentleman from Ohio (Chairman LaTourette) and the gentlewoman from the District of Columbia (Ms. Norton), ranking member, for all of their help. It is important to thank Senator Brownback and Senator Dodd for championing this legislation in the other body. Tonight I also want to thank our former colleague, Congressman J.C. Watts for his effort on this bill.  The effort to create a National African American Museum has not been easy. It has been a long, hard, and tedious journey. We are here today because Members, staff, and many supporters really never gave up. They did not give out. They did not give in. I want to thank my staff, Tammy Boyd and others, who worked so hard.  When we began this journey, we often said that we must pace ourselves for the long haul and we must keep the faith. We paced ourselves for the journey. We diligently planted our seeds and tilled a sometimes hardened soil. And now the many supporters of the African American Museum can and will finally see the fruit of their labor.  The passage of this legislation will send a powerful message to supporters of the museum that we must organize and mobilize our effort to raise the necessary money to build a National African American Museum.  During every session of the Congress for the past 15 years, I have introduced legislation to establish a National African American Museum. This bill was passed in the Senate but not in the House in 1992, and another bill was passed in the House but not in the Senate in 1994. Today the bill will pass both Houses of Congress. This bill will be signed by the President of the United States into law, and we will build the National African American Museum.  The African American story must be told, and a National African American Museum in Washington, D.C. is critical to telling that story. African American history is the story of hundreds, thousands, and millions of ordinary men, women, and children struggling to survive in a land where they were denied the fundamental rights, dignity, and respect that belong to all human beings. This is the story that we must tell.  We have come a long way in our quest to become one Nation and one people. We have made such tremendous strides that the young people today cannot imagine living in a country where they could not eat where they wanted to eat or sit where they wanted to sit.                              {time}  2130  They cannot imagine a country where they could be beaten, shot, or even lynched because of the color oftheir skin. Yet, this was the country that I grew up in, and this is the history that we must tell.  The time is long overdue to recognize the contribution of one of the members of our American family. Mr. Speaker, the time is always right to reright, the cause is just, and the time is now. Let it be done on our watch. Let us create a National Museum of African American history and Culture. Again, I thank the gentleman from Ohio (Mr. Ney), the chairman, the gentleman from Connecticut (Mr. Larson), the ranking member, and all of the staff for bringing us to this point.  I urge all of my colleagues to support H.R. 3491, a National African American Museum.
