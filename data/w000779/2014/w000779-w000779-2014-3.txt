President, this objection is very unfortunate. The Oregon congressional delegation has teamed up in a bipartisan way to provide, among other things, trust land for the two remaining Native American tribes in our State that have no land base. These tribes have been waiting for over 100 years, and Senator Merkley and I, with the whole Oregon congressional delegation, intend to be back early next year working to pass these bills and stay at it until justice is done.                          ____________________
