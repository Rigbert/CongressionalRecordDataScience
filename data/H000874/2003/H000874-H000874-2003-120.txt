Speaker, if the gentleman would further yield, I thank the gentleman for his observation. I have had an opportunity to discuss this briefly with the chairman of the subcommittee, the gentleman from Kentucky (Mr. Rogers); and I would hope that the committee, having accepted the Senate's position, which I do not share, as I share the gentleman's view on this, will ensure that this committee program, not just for our response to terrorist activity, but in response to making sure that our firefighters and emergency medical response teams can be effective, that we can also keep them safe in the normalday-to-day, but risky, activities in which they undertake. I thank the gentleman.
