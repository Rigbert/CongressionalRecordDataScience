Mr. Speaker, today I have introduced legislation that will begin to address an inherent unfairness under present law that affects the surviving widows of our Nation's veterans. As you know, many of these veterans gave their lives for our country, yet their surviving spouses are now being denied benefits that were promised to them.  In 1970, Congress enacted legislation that guaranteed widows of military veterans who died from service-connected disability that their dependency and indemnity compensation [DIC] benefits would be reinstated upon the termination of the widow's subsequent marriage(s) by death or divorce.  The apparent rationale behind this reinstatement policy was twofold: first, to encourage DIC widows to remarry, thereby removing them from the DIC rolls and saving the Federal Government money; and second, bring veterans' benefits statutes in line with other Federal survivor programs, e.g. Federal Civil Service employees, Social Security annuitants, which granted reinstatement rights in this instance.  However, in 1990, Congress passed the Omnibus Budget Reconciliation Act of 1990 which abruptly terminated DIC reinstatement rights for widows who lost these benefits upon remarriage. To make matters worse, the Department of Veterans Affairs never formally notified DIC widows of their loss of reinstatement rights, thereby relegating notice to be disseminated by word-of-mouth or by notices in publications of military and retiree organizations.  As you would suspect, many widows continued to apply to the VA for reinstatement of their benefits, only to learn for the first time that their benefits were being denied. Imagine the shock and surprise of these widows who were never notified of the change in the law, many making financial planning decisions under the mistaken assumption that they would be eligible for reinstatement if their subsequent marriage ended by death or divorce.  Mr. Speaker, my bill will reinstate DIC eligibility for widows who were remarried before November 1, 1990 and whose second or subsequent marriage is terminated by death or divorce. Recognizing the budget restraints under which Congress must operate, I initially have set the compensation rate at 50 percent of the current DIC rate. The bill would also require the Department of Veterans Affairs to notify all current and previously eligible DIC widows of the change.  I urge all of my colleagues to please consider supporting this bill.                          ____________________
