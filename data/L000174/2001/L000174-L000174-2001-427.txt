President, today I recognize National Missing Children's Day and the great work of the National Center for Missing and Exploited Children, NCMEC. The NCMEC has made an unmatched contribution in the area of missing children recovery.  At their annual Congressional Breakfast this morning, the NCMEC honored law enforcement officers from around the country for their exemplary performance in recovering missing children and in apprehending child sex offenders. Last year, we honored a Vermonter at this event for his extraordinary work in tracking down a child exploitation offender.  In 1999, I helped pass legislation that authorized funding for the National Center for Missing and Exploited Children and I am pleased to see its continued success. Since 1984, when the Center was established, it has handled more than 1.4 million calls through its national Hotline 1-800-THE-LOST; trained more than 161,728 police and other professionals; and published more than 20 million publications that are distributed free of charge. The Center has worked with law enforcement on more than 75,283 missing child cases, resulting in the recovery of 50,605 children.  In 1998 the Center launched the CyberTipline which allows Internet users to report suspicious or illegal activity, including child pornography and online enticement of children for sexual exploitation. Since its launch in 1998, the CyberTipline has received close to 37,000 leads with many of those leading to arrests.  I applaud the ongoing work of the Center, its President, Ernie Allen, and all those dedicated employees and volunteers who make this good work possible. I wish them continued success in the area of missing children recovery.                          ____________________
