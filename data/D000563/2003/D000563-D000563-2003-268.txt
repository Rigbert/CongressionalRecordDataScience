 I have no doubt that she offered this amendment--I say through the Chair--to address some of the concerns raised in the committee.  I ask my friend from California to turn to page 2 of her amendment and consider paragraph B on page 2. I will read it. It says:       Use the same assessment every school year used for school      year 2003-2004 by the District of Columbia public schools to      assess the achievement of DC public school students.  I will ask the question, and then I will sit down.
