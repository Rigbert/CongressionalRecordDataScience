They only brought up half of the 2017 bills to the floor for a vote. Where are the other six?  If Republicans wanted to fund the government in a responsible and efficient way, they have failed.  This resolution will likely cost us millions of dollars more in delayed projects, contract breaches, and lost American jobs. Is this a sign of what is to come? What happens on April 28 when this filthy Band-Aid falls off?  If we can't pass bills under regular order this year--when we had a bipartisan budget agreement and a Republican majority--what will we do in May when we have not only the rest of the 2017 budget to fix but also the 2018 budget and the debt ceiling to address?  I wonder what chaotic path the Republican leaders will lead us down in the new year? This is certainly a sign, a terrible sign, of what is to come.
