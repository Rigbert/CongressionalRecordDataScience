 It was General Huptmann, I believe, who used this analogy, and maybe he used it with you. He said, ``Twelve months is like putting your hand in water for 12 months and you take it out and look down and nothing has changed.'' Twelve months in the Balkans does not mean anything. If we are going to be out in 12 months, those individuals that would be warring factions would be in a position to start up again.
