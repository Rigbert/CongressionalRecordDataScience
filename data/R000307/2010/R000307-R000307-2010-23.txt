President, much like Senator Cardin's amendment, my amendment also recognizes the need to ensure that the youngest in our population have access to health care. My amendment does this by exempting medical devices primarily to be used by or for pediatric patients. The CBO and the Joint Committee on Taxation both confirmed that these excise taxes will not be borne by the medical device industry. The tax will be passed on to patients in the form of higher prices and higher insurance premiums.  My amendment prevents this new tax from raising the cost for pediatric medical devices--those devices that treat the youngest in our population, children who have serious or life-threatening illnesses, such as a heart patient or a cancer patient.  I urge my colleagues to support the amendment.
