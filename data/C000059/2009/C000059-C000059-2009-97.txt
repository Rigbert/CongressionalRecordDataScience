Riverside has been fortunate to have dynamic and dedicated community leaders who willingly and unselfishly give their time and talent and make their communities a better place to live and work. Tedd Laycock is one of these individuals. On March 7, 2009, a dinner in honor of Chief Laycock will be held to celebrate his retirement from the City of Riverside Fire Department.  A lifelong resident of Riverside, Chief Laycock graduated from Ramona High School. After receiving his Associate of Science Degree in fire technology from Riverside City College, he went on to graduate from the University of Redlands with a Bachelor of Science in Business Administration.  In 1973, Chief Laycock began his career with the City of Riverside Fire Department as a firefighter. He was subsequently promoted to Engineer in 1980; to Captain in 1984; to Battalion Chief in 2002; and to Fire Chief on April 8, 2005. Chief Laycock's natural leadership ability has contributed to his excellence as a Fire Chief and established him as a pillar in the community. Chief Laycock retires after forty-six years of service to spend time with his grandchildren, two daughters, three sons, and his wife of ten years Cindy.  As a member of the Riverside community, Chief Laycock not only lived and worked there, but served those in his neighborhood. Chief Laycock has been a member of many local organizations such as the Uptown Kiwanis, the Latino Network and the Greater Riverside Hispanic Chamber of Commerce. Twice, in 1994 and 1996, Chief Laycock was awarded the honor of the Exchange Club's Firefighter of the Year Award.  Chief Laycock's tireless passion for community service has contributed immensely to the betterment of the community of Riverside, California. I am proud to call Tedd a fellow community member, American and friend. I know that many community members are grateful for his service and salute him as he retires.                          ____________________
