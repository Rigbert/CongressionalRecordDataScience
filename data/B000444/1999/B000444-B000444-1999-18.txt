 President, I rise today to introduce, with Senator Roth, Senator Lugar and other colleagues, a resolution that attempts to clarify the relationship between the European Union's new European Security and Defense Identify, popularly known by its acronym ESDI, and the North Atlantic Treaty Organization.  Mr. President, as my colleagues will remember, ESDI has been gathering momentum since last December's meeting in St. Malo, France between French President Chirac and British Prime Minister Blair. It is part of the European Union's Common Foreign and Security Policy, which the EU sees as essential to its development as ``an ever closer union.''  ESDI was discussed in the communique of the April 1999 NATO Washington Summit, and it was elaborated on in the communique of the June 1999 EU Cologne Summit.  Let me say up front that I believe that ESDI--if it is developed in proper coordination with NATO--can serve the national interest of the United States by becoming a valuable vehicle for strengthening the European military contribution to NATO. Put another way, ESDI, if handled correctly, can at long last create more equitable burden-sharing between our European NATO allies and the United States.  NATO must and will remain the preeminent organization to defend the territory of the North Atlantic area against all external threats, as envisioned in Article 5 of the North Atlantic Treaty of April 4, 1949 and restatedon April 30, 1998 by the United States Senate in its Resolution of Ratification of the enlargement of the Alliance to include Poland, the Czech Republic, and Hungary.  NATO may also, pursuant to Article 4 of the North Atlantic Treaty, on a case-by-case basis, engage in other missions when there is consensus among its members that there is a threat to the security and interests of NATO members. These missions have become known as non-Article 5 missions and were also reaffirmed by the Senate in the April 30, 1998 Resolution of Ratification of NATO enlargement.  ESDI's field of action should be restricted to those non-Article 5 missions in which NATO as an organization does not wish to involve itself. In practice, Mr. President, this would mean that at some future date if the need for military action arose in non-NATO Europe and the United States did not wish to become involved, the European Union could undertake the effort, utilizing, in part, NATO assets.  Mr. President, I believe that such a situation with a rejuvenated European pillar of the alliance could free up forces of this country for possible action elsewhere.  Let me emphasize, however, that in order for ESDI to accomplish both the goals of the European Union and of NATO, it must be clearly designed in a way that gives NATO the ``right of first refusal'' on non-Article 5 missions. To repeat--if NATO would not wish to become involved, then the European Union would have the option of leading the mission.  In addition, Mr. President, we must be sure that ESDI does not duplicate resources or discriminate against non-EU European NATO members (Norway, Turkey, Iceland, Poland, Czech Republic, and Hungary).  Mr. President, in my opinion the biggest danger is that ESDI could be constructed as an alternative to NATO for non-Article 5 missions. If this would happen, it could lead to an estrangement of the United States from its European allies.  Unfortunately, the June 1999 Cologne EU Summit communique subtly modified the language of the April 1999 Washington NATO Summit communique in the direction of ESDI as an autonomous EU military organ, using NATO assets, without giving NATO this necessary ``right of first refusal'' for non-Article 5 missions.  The European Union is currently involved in internal negotiations on a further elaboration of ESDI at the December EU Summit in Helsinki. The Sense of the Senate resolution that we are introducing serves as a clear message to our friends in the European Union that while we recognize their aspirations for a European Security and Defense Identity, it must complement NATO, not be in competition with, or duplicative of it.  With that in mind, our Resolution traces the development of ESDI, citing both the Washington NATO Summit and the Cologne EU Summit. It stresses that the Yugoslav air campaign demonstrated the military shortcomings of the European allies and the imbalance with the United States, both of which the allies have pledged to address through the NATO Defense Capabilities Initiative.  The Resolution then expresses several items that are the Sense of the Senate.  NATO should remain the primary institution for security issues of trans-Atlantic concern;  All NATO members should commit to improving their defense capabilities so that the Alliance can project power decisively with equitable burden-sharing;  The Defense Capabilities Initiative adopted at the Washington NATO Summit is specifically endorsed;  The resolve of the EU to have the capacity for autonomous action where the Alliance as a whole is not engaged is acknowledged;  The member states of NATO and the EU should promulgate principles that will strengthen the trans-Atlantic partnership and reinforce unity within NATO.  Then, Mr. President, cutting directly to the heart of preventing ESDI's becoming an alternative to NATO for non-Article 5 missions, the Resolution offers the Further Sense of the Senate that ``on matters of trans-Atlantic concern the European Union should make clear that it would undertake an autonomous mission through its European Security and Defense Identity only after the North Atlantic Treaty Organization had been offered the opportunity to undertake that mission but had referred it to the European Union for action.''  Further, and directly relevant to the issue of more equitable burden-sharing, the Resolution states the Sense of the Senate that ``failure of the European allies of the United States to achieve the goals established through the Defense Capabilities Initiative would weaken support for the Alliance in the United States.''  Addressing the issue of non-discrimination by the EU against non-EU NATO members, the Resolution states the Sense of the Senate that ``the European Union must implement its Cologne Summit decisions concerning its Common Foreign and Security Policy in a manner that will ensure that non-WEU NATO allies, including Canada, the Czech Republic, Denmark, Hungary, Iceland, Norway, Poland, Turkey, and the United States, will not be discriminated against, but will be fully involved when the European Union addresses issues affecting their security interests.''  Finally, the Resolution expresses the Sense of the Senate that the EU's implementation of its Cologne Summit decisions should not promote a strategic perspective on trans-Atlantic security issues that conflicts with that promoted by NATO and should not promote unnecessary duplication of the resources and capabilities provided by NATO.  Mr. President, the North Atlantic Treaty Organization remains the cornerstone of our engagement with Europe. The resolution we have introduced makes clear to our partners that we support the European Union's European Security and Defense Identity as long as it is developed in a manner to strengthen NATO, not weaken it.  I thank the Chair and yield the floor.                          ____________________
