Chairman, I rise today in strong support of the amendment offered by the distinguished gentleman from Wisconsin, the ranking member on the Appropriations Committee, Mr. Obey. Mr. Obey's amendment keeps the books clean. It provides only what the administration asked for and pays for it.  Mr. Chairman, on January 26, 1995, the House of Representatives passed a resolution to make balancing this Nation's budget a constitutional mandate.  Once ratified, the balanced budget amendment will take its place along side the right to free speech, the right to vote, freedom of religion, and the abolition of slavery.  The Members of this House considered a balanced budget so fundamental that they flocked to the floor to support it.  I supported the balanced budget amendment, because I want the budget balanced. I have urged my colleagues not to use the balanced budget amendment to give the appearance of good fiscal policy, while, in reality pushing the hard choices off until the next century.  Today, less than a month later, the balanced budget amendment will get its first at bat. If the House fails to enact the Obey amendment, the balanced budget amendment will be zero for 1 so far this season, not even good enough for a replacement player.  We will raise this Nation's deficit by $645 million by the year 2000, just 2 years before the balanced budget amendment kicks in.  This legislation we consider today contains $3.2 billion in new spending, $2.53 billion in emergency funds the Clinton administration requested, and $670 million of Republic add-ons. Despite a promise to the contrary and despite their best efforts, the Republican majority has failed to pay for all this new spending. All told, this borrow and [[Page H1988]] spend legislation increases the deficit by $645 million over 5 years.  You know, there has been a lot of talk about the Republican Contract on America, but for any contract to be valid, something of value must be exchanged.  In this instance, the other side of aisle the wants the American people to pay an additional $69 million in interest in the next 2 years alone for the new defense spending they refuse to pay for today.  Clearly the most disturbing aspect of today's debate is what it means for the rest of this Congress. In the next couple of weeks we are going to have to come up with an additional $15 billion in rescissions--this year's share of the Contract on America and the California flood relief bill.  If this Congress doesn't have the intestinal fortitude to come up with $3 billion in cuts--balanced budget amendment or not--how are we possibly gong to come up with $15 billion?  Mr. Chairman, this legislation makes a sham of the balanced budget amendment, and it deceives the American people. It is a relapse back into a terrible habit I thought we would finally overcome, that of sending our children the bill for our own failed leadership.  I urge my colleagues, support the balanced budget amendment. Support the Obey amendment.                              {time}  1330
