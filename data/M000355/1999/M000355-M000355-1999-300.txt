 President, I rise today in support of S. 1205, the Military Construction Appropriations bill. I congratulate Chairman Burns and the ranking member, Senator Murray, for crafting a spending bill which addresses the critical priorities of America's soldiers in a prudent and effective manner.  This year's Administration submission made the task of the Committee more difficult than at any time since I have been a member of the Senate Appropriations Committee. By suggesting that Congress incrementally fund all military construction programs, the Administration charted a course for failure and left Senators Burns and Murray to clean up the mess. They have done so admirably and I am proud to support their efforts.  While I strongly support the entire bill before the Senate today, I would like to take just a moment of the Senate's time to explain a particular section of the bill. Section 129 of this measure was included at my request and deals with the construction of chemical demilitarization facilities at the Bluegrass Army Depot in Kentucky. Specifically, this provision would prohibit such construction until the Secretary of Defense reports on the completed demonstration of 6 alternatives to baseline incineration as a means of destroying America's chemical weapons stockpile.  I think it is important to state first what this amendment does not do. This language will have no impact on any proposed funding in the FY00 military construction bill. The reason is that the prohibition on spending for construction at Bluegrass Army Depot applies only to facilities which are technology specific. This means that construction for buildings which will be necessary regardless of the method of destruction employed at Bluegrass is permitted. This allows for progress on necessary components for eventual demilitarization activities such as administrative facilities, but prohibits construction of the actual treatment facility to be deployed in Kentucky until the Secretary certifies that demonstration of the six alternatives is complete.  It is also not my intent to delay or avoid destruction of the stockpile in Kentucky. My sole purpose is to ensure that when the weapons stored in Kentucky are destroyed only the safest most effective method is utilized. Once the Secretary certifies that all six alternative technologies have been demonstrated--and this can occur in the very near future--technology specific efforts at Bluegrass may begin. I supported ratification of the Chemical Weapons Convention and believe that the United States should do everything it can to meet the April 2007 deadline. The language contained in Section 129 should have no adverse impact on theU.S. being able to satisfy its Chemical Weapons Convention obligations.  Now that I have offered an explanation as to what this language will not do, let me describe what I hope it will accomplish. Quite simply, this is a continuation of my efforts to push the military to recognize that public safety should be the top priority as America eliminates its chemical weapons in compliance with the CWC. The Army's selection of incineration as their preferred technology dates all the way back to 1982--almost 20 years ago. It is unreasonable, and in fact irresponsible, to assume that there have been no technological advancements since that time which could lead to improved methods of disposal. Only ten years ago few would have predicted the dynamic nature of the Internet would provide Americans instant access to information around the globe. Given that example, why has the department chosen to ignore potential strides in chemical weapons destruction? Why then has the safety of those Americans who live near chemical weapons destruction sites taken a back seat to fiscal and calendar concerns?  In an effort to force the Department to consider the possibility of alternatives to incineration, I offered and the Senate accepted an amendment to the FY97 Defense Appropriations bill which established the Assembled Chemical Weapons Assessment program. As I previously stated, this program identified a total of six technologies as suitable for demonstration. Unfortunately the Department has chosen to fund only three. As a result of the Department's decision to not fully test each technology, much of the good will established by the program has eroded. Continued DOD intransigence will lead to well deserved skepticism regarding the eventual report issued by ACWA. The citizens who are counting on the federal government's honest assessment of how to proceed deserve the security of knowing that all viable options were appropriately considered.  I have outlined the hypocrisy of the Department's argument in a floor statement I made on June 8, 1999, and so I will not repeat myself at this point. Regardless of the Department's contention that funding for further testing is limited, I believe the interests of public safety far outweigh any limited fiscal concerns. This is not a case of one Senator screaming that the ``sky is falling.'' Rather, this is an effort to hold the Department of Defense accountable for what should have always been its first priority--the safety of potentially impacted citizens. I will continue to press for full testing and accountability.  I thank my colleagues and urge their support for the Military Construction bill.                          ____________________
