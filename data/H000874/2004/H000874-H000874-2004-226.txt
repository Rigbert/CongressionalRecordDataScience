Speaker, I yield to the distinguished majority leader for the purposes of informing us of the schedule for the week to come.  Mr. DeLAY. Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentleman from Maryland for yielding to me.  Mr. Speaker, I would like to make all the Members aware that the House has completed voting for the day and the week.  Regarding next week's schedule, the House will convene on Monday at 12:30 p.m. for morning hour and 2 p.m. for legislative business. We will consider several measures under suspension of the rules. A final list of those bills will be sent to Members' offices by the end of this week. Any votes called on these measures will be rolled until 6:30 p.m.  For Tuesday and the balance of the week, we may consider additional legislation under suspension of the rules. We also plan to consider several bills that would amend the Occupational Safety and Health Act of 1970: H.R. 2728, the Small Business Day in Court Act; H.R. 2729, the Review Commission Efficiency Act; H.R. 2730, the Independent Review of OSHA Citations Act; and H.R. 2731, the Small Employer Access to Justice Act. In addition, we expect to consider H.R. 2432, the Paperwork and Regulatory Improvements Act; and H.R. 4200, the National Defense Authorization Act For Fiscal Year 2005.  Finally, I would like to make all Members aware that we plan to consider H.R. 4359, the Child Credit Preservation and Expansion Act, which would make the full $1,000 per child credit permanent and expand the number of families eligible for the credit.  I will be happy to answer any questions the gentleman may have.
