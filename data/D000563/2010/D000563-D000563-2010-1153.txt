President, tomorrow several Senators will be participating in the bipartisan, bicameral health care summit with President Barack Obama. I am honored to be one of those Senators. As a result, though, there will be no rollcall votes prior to 4 p.m. tomorrow. We will continue to work on an agreement to consider the 30-day tax extenders legislation, which I just referred to in an earlier statement.  As a reminder, Senator Reid also filed cloture on the motion to concur with respect to H.R. 1299, which is the legislative vehicle for the Travel Promotion Act. We hope to reach an agreement to have that vote tomorrow.                          ____________________
