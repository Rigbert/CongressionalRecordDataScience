 President, in the past few weeks we had a whirlwind, but the Keystone jobs debate has been important for the Senate and for our country. We took about one dozen more rollcall votes on amendments yesterday. That means the Senate has now taken more than twice as many of these amendment votes on this bill alone than were offered or allowed all of last year.  We obviously had a busy afternoon yesterday, and we will continue it again today. It has been an instructive exercise, too, because we learned about more than just the lesser prairie-chicken. We also discovered something about this body. We learned that open floor debates and open amendment processes require hard work, they require dedicated Members, and they require constructive cooperation from across the aisle.  I thanked Senators Hoeven and Murkowski for their work before. I thank them again now. I note the efforts, once again, of colleagues such as Senator Cantwell.  The debate over these American jobs has shown that with bipartisan cooperation, it is possible to get Washington functioning again. This debate is also proving the new Congress is ready to work and work hard for the middle class, even in the teeth of opposition from powerful special interests.  Let's notch one more win for the middle class by passing this important infrastructure project. Constructing Keystone would pump literally billions into our economy. It would support thousands of good American jobs. As the President's own State Department has indicated, it would do this with minimal environmental impact.  The Keystone infrastructure project has been studied endlessly--endlessly--from almost every possible angle. The same general conclusion keeps becoming clear, build it. We need to build it.  Let's make some progress for the American people by voting to pass the Keystone jobs and infrastructure bill.                          ____________________
