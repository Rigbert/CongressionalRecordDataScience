 President, prior to the 1996 farm bill, the annual cost-share assistance payment limitation for the Agricultural Conservation Program, ACP, was $3,500. With the advent of the Environmental Quality Incentive Program, EQIP, in 1996, the annual cost-share assistance payment limit was increased to $10,000 per year.  EQIP also instituted another change, rather than single year agreements, conservation agreements under EQIP were set at a minimum of 5 years to improve conservation benefits and increase farm payments. Hence, the 1996 law set a 5-year payment limitation of $50,000 for those rare instances in which a participant received the maximum $10,000 annual payment each of 5 years.  Between 1996 and 2002, the national average EQIP cost share amount per farm per 5-year contract was less than $10,000, or less than 20 percent of the $50,000 payment limitation.  Between 1996 and 2002, for animal waste storage structures, one of the most expensive practices eligible for EQIP assistance, the national average per farm per 5-year contract amount has been $13,573, also considerably below the $50,000 payment limitation at that time.  The 2002 farm bill increased the payment limitation nine-fold to $450,000 over the 6-year life of the farm bill.  The $450,000 limit was arrived at in the House-Senate conference committee. The Senate version of the farm bill had a 5-year $150,000 limitation. The House bill had a $200,000 limitation.  Amazingly, on the very last day of the farm bill conference the payment limit was increased to $450,000, three times greater than what the Senate had approved. This new number showed up out of nowhere, with virtually no discussion or debate in public.  The Senate bill contained an important provision related to the payment limit. All payments were made directly attributable to real persons by Social Security number. This direct attribution provision was intended to prevent participants from forming dummy corporations and partnerships for the purpose of getting around the payment limit and collecting multiple payments.  This provision was retained in the conference committee, so that at least the $450,000 limit was to apply to an individual or an entity regardless of the number of farming sites in an operation or the number or type of business arrangements the EQIP operator was engaged in.  In promulgating rules and guidance for the implementation of EQIP, however, USDA has decided to allow the $450,000 to be multiplied by the number of partners in a single farming operation. This essentially makes the limitation meaningless, since it allows business structures to be arranged to collect multiple payments.  While no single person could collect more than $450,000, relatives, employees, farmhands and others could be made partners that each could collect up to the maximum amount.  Farmer demand for EQIP remained very high throughout the 1996 farm bill period and its $50,000 multi-year limitation. Demand outstripped funding.  Congress responded in 2002 by increasing total funding for EQIP five fold, and I was heavily involved with that effort.  However, by simultaneously increasing the payment limit nine fold, the new $1 billion per year funding level may not result in more farmers being served, which was Congress' intention.  The ranking systems in many States being put in place to determine who wins EQIP contracts and who goes on the waiting list appears to be favoring the large farm/large contract applicants.  My amendment would scale the payment limit back to $300,000. This is still double the amount passed by the Senate in 2002, and more than adequate for 97.8 percent of EQIP participants.  My amendment does not scale back funding for EQIP. Rather, it provides that dollars appropriated by this bill cannot be used to pay USDA salaries and expenses to operate the EQIP program with payments greater than $300,000 per agricultural operation.  Adoption of this amendment will allow more farmers to participate in the program in the coming year. Adoption of the amendment will result in a fairer distribution of dollars within the program. Adoption of this amendment will prevent EQIP resources from being gobbled up by a few large contracts to mega farms.  This is a fair compromise, a good compromise. It provides access to the program by all types of farms and all sizes of farms, but it puts a limit on the amount of taxpayer support any one operation can receive.  If we do not pass this amendment, I think by the time of the next farm bill there will be lots of media attention focused on how this environmental quality cost share program has become a new subsidy program, paying out six and seven figure checks, for the Nation's biggest operations. And there will be questions about why an environmental program is leading to concentration and consolidation.  A $450,000 payment limit has no effect on 98.9 percent of all livestock operations. A $300,000 payment limit has no effect on 97.8 percent of all livestock operations. That means my amendment only affects 1.1 percent of livestock operations.  The 1.1 percent of mega-operations will still be eligible for $300,000. They just will not be able to take such a big piece of such a small pie. I do not think it is unreasonable to reduce full funding for the largest 1.1 percent of livestock operations so that more family farmers can participate.  So what I am saying is let's be careful. Let's be balanced. Let's increase the payment limitation, and avoid a ``sky's the limit'' approach.
