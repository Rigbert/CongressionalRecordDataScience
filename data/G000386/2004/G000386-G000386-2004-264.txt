 President, I ask unanimous consent that once Senator Allen offers his amendment with respect to home mortgages, it be set aside only for the purpose of Senator Cantwell offering an amendment, and that after the clerk reports the amendment by number, it be immediately set aside, and the Senate resume consideration of the Allen amendment.
