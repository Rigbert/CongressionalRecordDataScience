Speaker, yesterday Lucy McBath from metro Atlanta stood behind the President when he announced his actions to reduce gun violence.  In 2012, her son, Jordan Davis, was killed simply for playing loud music. I could see the pain of her loss and the anguish on her face. It broke my heart. Jordan Davis is one of the 100,000 Americans killed in the last decade who are no longer with us due to gun violence.  It is our duty to do all we can to protect all Americans. Every year mothers and fathers, brothers and sisters, families and friends beg their government to act. Mr. Speaker, are we deaf to their cries? Are we blind to their suffering?  President Obama is listening, and he is leading. A leader must be a headlight and not a taillight.  Members of this House, we are not leading. His proposal is common sense and constitutional.  Now, as Members, we must do our part. We must do what is right and what is just. It is long overdue.                          ____________________
