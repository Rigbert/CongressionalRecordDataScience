President, I yield myself such time as I may require.  Mr. President, I strongly oppose this amendment. What it does is it reverses the action taken by the subcommittee in legislation that was then in the full bill as reported out of the full committee.  By a vote of 8-5 the Foreign Operations Subcommittee passed my amendment to strike the kind of restrictions imposed by the House and proposed in this amendment that were in the bill that came before the Foreign Operations Subcommittee. I moved to strike the House language, taking the same position as the distinguished Senator from Washington, and before her, the distinguished Senator from Wisconsin. The Foreign Operations Subcommittee approved of my amendment. And that is the condition we are in now.  When you look at what we have done, the bill simply continues current law and practice. We are not asking for anything radically different. This is what we have always done. At a time when support for voluntary family planning programs and women's reproductive health is growing around the world, it would be foolhardy for the United States to once again, as we did in the early 1980's, surrender our leadership in this area.  This bill has the same prohibition on funding for abortion that we have had for years. Now, I have listened to some speaking around this Chamber. I want to make sure everybody understands. No funds in this bill can be used for abortion. It is not just the case that there is not any money in there for abortion; there is an explicit prohibition against money being used for abortion. So, basically, we are putting up a straw person to knock down here.  And then the question is, what might happen in China? No funds in this bill can be used in China. None, nada, neant, rien.  So what is the problem? The whole point of the program in this bill is to promote contraceptive and other alternatives to abortion--alternatives to abortion. We are trying to have alternatives to abortion. We say none of the money can be used for abortion and none of the money can be used in China where they have forced abortions, and, instead, the money can be used for alternatives to abortion. We all ought to jump on board with that one. Every dollar is for voluntary family planning.  So, if you support this amendment, you are opposing voluntary family planning. If you support the amendment on the floor right now, you are against voluntary family planning. Provisions relating to the U.N. population fund would enable us to contribute to this organization, which is the largest international family planning agency in the world.  UNFPA does not fund abortions. It funds contraceptives and information, education about family planning in 140 countries. It is absolutely vital that the United States play a leading role in this agency, especially when the decisions we make today will determine if the world's population doubles or triples.  Can you imagine what this bill would look like, the overall foreign aid bill here, if the world population doubled or tripled?  That is not our population of the United States, that is the rest of the world, most of it in the area where we have the gravest concerns in this bill.  The bill does not earmark funding for UNFPA, but it would permit up to $35 million for UNFPA, which even in the unlikely possibility that that amount is available, is still $15 million below last year's level, and it contains all the restrictions on our contributions. There is an explicit prohibition against using U.S. funds in China, despite the fact UNFPA's program in China promotes voluntary family planning and human rights.  Let us not go backward in this bill, not when so many governments are finally seeking help in limiting the growth of their own population growth. Many of these countries are already impoverished, and the poverty increases because the population grows. We have the technology, the expertise, and we ought to help.  This amendment would require UNFPA to withdraw from China. That is not a decision UNFPA can do, nor can we pass a law to require it to do. It is a decision of its governing board. It is made up of donor governments and a large majority support UNFPA's program in China. By attaching a requirement that UNFPA cannot meet, we cut off funding in 139 other countries.  There is no money for abortion, no money for China. There is no reason to vote for this amendment, unless somehow you are against voluntary family planning altogether. If you have that attitude, then I guess there is nothing I can say.  I ask unanimous consent that a letter from Stirling Scruggs, the chief of information at UNFPA, be printed in the Record.  There being no objection, the letter was ordered to be printed in the Record, as follows:                               United Nations Population Fund,                                                    July 26, 1995.     Senator Patrick Leahy,     Senate Russell Building,     Washington, DC.       Dear Senator Leahy: It has just come to my attention that      on June 28, 1995 during a debate on the House floor,      Representative Chris Smith quoted Dr. Sadik, Executive      Director of UNFPA, ``China has every reason to feel proud of      and pleased with its remarkable achievements made in its      family planning policy and control of its population growth      over the past 10 years. Now the country could offer its      experiences and special experts to help other countries.''      Senator Jesse Helms used the same quote in the Senate Foreign      Relations Committee Report accompanying S-961.       I believe this quote comes from China Daily, an English      language newspaper published in Beijing. I was with Dr. Sadik      when she was interviewed for this article in 1991. This      article was a terrible distortion of what she actually said.      Dr. Sadik did say that China should be proud of its record of      improving women's and children's health since 1949. She      commended China's continuing efforts to improve maternal and      child health by discussing a joint UNFPA and UNICEF project      in 300 poor counties in China that especially focuses on      improving children's health through training and supplies for      treatment of acute respiratory infection and diarrhea,      promotion of prenatal care and nutrition, breast-feeding,      assisted deliveries and family planning that assured several      contraceptive choices and informed consent. She went on to      say that this project was a model that could be replicated in      other countries.       I have no idea why Dr. Sadik was misquoted. I tried      unsuccessfully at the time to secure a retraction from China      Daily. I remember during her visit being very proud of Dr.      Sadik's tenacity and courage and my disappointment with the      China Daily article which was not only wrong, but      contradictory of her real position.       In fact, during this trip, Dr. Sadik attended a series of      meetings that included: the Ministers of Family Planning and      Health, the Head of the People's Congress and several of his      colleagues and the General Secretary of the Communist Party      of China. During these meetings she was very critical of new      laws in several provinces requiring sterilization of the      mentally retarded. She also successfully negotiated projects      designed to increase training for informed consent and      voluntary participation in family planning, and research that      would examine the safety and efficacy of the Chinese steel      ring IUD. The first project, currently on-going, provides      interpersonal counseling training and promotes contraceptive      choice for grass-roots family planning workers in several      provinces. The second resulted in a Chinese ban on steel ring      IUD's in favor of copper based IUD's which in ten years will      prevent 35.6 million abortions. It would also prevent 16,300      maternal deaths; 365,000 potential infant and 28,000      potential child deaths.       For 3\1/2\ years I served as UNFPA's Country Director in      China. I know first hand what we did and said in China and I      can tell you that the way we are frequently portrayed, such      as in the statement in question, is absolutely and      unequivocally untrue.       UNFPA has always represented international norms and human      rights standards as articulated in several U.N. documents      including the Universal Declaration of Human Rights, the      World Population Plan of Action and the Programme of Action      of the International Conference on Population and      Development. For example, Chapter VII, para. 12 of the      Programme of Action which states ``. . . the principle of      informed free choice is essential to the long-term success of      family-planning programmes; that any form of coercion has no      part of play, that governmental goals or family planning      should be defined in terms of unmet needs for information and      services; and that demographic goals, while legitimately the      subject of government development strategies, should not be      imposed on family-planning providers in the form of targets      or quotas for the recruitment of clients''.       In particular, Dr. Sadik has been a champion of human      rights, women's equality and reproductive rights. In the 14      years I have known her, I have never heard her use the phrase      ``population control.''       We deeply appreciate your past and continuing support and      hope you can help set the record straight regarding the quote      used by Representative Smith and Senator Helms.           Sincerely,                                          Stirling D. Scruggs,                                            Chief, Information and                                      External Relations Division.
