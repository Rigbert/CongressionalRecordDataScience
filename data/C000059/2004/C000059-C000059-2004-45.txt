Speaker, I rise today to honor an individual whose dedication and contributions to the community of Riverside, California are exceptional. Riverside County has been fortunate to have dynamic and dedicated community leaders who willingly and unselfishly give their time and talent to making their communities a better place to live and work. Cindy Roth is one of these individuals.  Cindy currently serves as the President and Chief Executive Officer of the Greater Riverside Chambers of Commerce. In this key position, Cindy has been instrumental in the development of Riverside's business community. She became the first woman to hold this post, and her leadership is a testament to her diligence and understanding of business management in Riverside.  Additionally, Cindy serves as the President of the Southern California Association of Chamber of Commerce Executives and is a past board member of the Western Association of Chamber of Commerce Executives.  Cindy's dedication is not only to local business, but also to the wider community. She serves as part of numerous organizations, including the Monday Morning Group of Western Riverside County, the Science and Technology Education Partnership, the Raincross Exchange Club, the Foundation Board of Trustees for La Sierra University, and the Honorary Commanders of March Field. She has received the 1996 Community Service Award from the Rotary Club of Arlington, the 2000 Athena of the Inland Valleys Award, and has been honored as the 2003 Woman of the Year by Assemblyman John Benoit.  It is no surprise that she is now honored as the 2004 Distinguished Citizen of the Inland Empire by the California Inland Empire Council, Boy Scouts of America. Cindy's tireless passion for community service has contributed immensely to the betterment of the community of Riverside. She has been the heart and soul of many community organizations and events and I am proud to call her a fellow community member, American and friend. I know that many in our community are grateful for her service and salute her as she receives this award.                          ____________________
