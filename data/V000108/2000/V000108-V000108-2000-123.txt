Speaker, I rise today to congratulate a distinguished young man, Michael DeBonis, for attaining the rank ofEagle Scout in the Boy Scouts of America. Michael is a member of Boy Scout Troop 69. He will receive this award at an Eagle Scout Court of Honor at 3:00 p.m. on Sunday, February 20, 2000 at the Hobart Scout Cabin, located in Hobart, Indiana.  Boy Scout Troop 69 was founded at St. Bridget Church in Hobart, Indiana. Since its founding in 1957, Boy Scout Troop 69 has become one of the most successful scout troops in Northwest Indiana. Since 1987, fifteen boys from this troop have achieved the prestigious rank of Eagle Scout. Only an elite group of Boy Scouts attain the Eagle Scout ranking, which is the highest of seven rankings in the Boy Scouts of America organization. In order to become an Eagle Scout, a Boy Scout must complete the following three tasks: earn 21 merit badges; complete a service project; and demonstrate strong leadership skills within the troop.  Scout Master Robert Bell must take credit for much of this success. He has been Scout Master of Troop 69 since 1987 and is directly responsible for the excellent program which has led to the development of such fine young men. Mr. Bell devotes significant time to scouting and has displayed qualities of personal understanding, dedication to youth and advocacy for their cause, which has made his troop and his entire community very proud. The following are the names of the Eagle Scouts who have come from Troop 69 since Bob Bell has been Scout Master: George E. Murchek, 1987; William Guinee, 1987; Robert W. Bell, 1988; David Strickley, 1988; Michael Murchek, 1989; Michael Stewart, 1990; Richard Duirda, 1991; Richard A. Sapper, III, 1992; Joel Detterline, 1993; Dennis King, 1995; Eric Stage, 1995; Chad Wolf, 1998; Jeremiah Jackson, 1999; Philip Sirota, 1999; and Michael DeBonis, 1999.  The most recent addition to this list, Michael DeBonis, began in scouting as a Tiger Cub in the first grade. He attended St. Bridget School in Hobart, and is currently attending Andrean High School in Merrillville, Indiana, where he will graduate this June. Michael has served in several positions of responsibility in scouting and was twice Senior Patrol Leader of his troop. Michael also won the Arrow of Life and was inducted into the Order of the Arrow.  Michael attained the rank of Eagle Scout in conjunction with his academic and athletic achievements at Andrean High School. He served as Captain of the Andrean High School Quiz Bowl Team, which won the Indiana State Championship in 1998, and was runner-up in 1999. Michael has also been named an All-Star on Andrean's various academic teams and has won numerous awards as a member of the Andrean Academic Superbowl Teams in Social Studies, Science and Interdisciplinary. Additionally, he plays Defensive Tackle on the Varsity Football Team at Andrean. Michael has achieved all of these accomplishments and yet has maintained an A average at Andrean and is a National Merit Scholarship Semi-Finalist.  Mr. Speaker, I ask you and my other distinguished colleagues to join me in congratulating Michael DeBonis for his commendable achievement. His parents, Tony and Shelia DeBonis, can be proud of their son because it takes a great deal of tenacity and devotion to achieve such an illustrious ranking. This young man has a promising future ahead of him, which will undoubtedly include improving the quality of life in Indiana's First Congressional District.                          ____________________
