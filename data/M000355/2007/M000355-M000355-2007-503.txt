 President, the House of Representatives passed an emergency war spending bill on Friday that includes tens of billions of dollars for projects that have no connection whatsoever to the needs of our troops in Iraq and Afghanistan, that tells U.S. generals how to do their jobs, and which pulls out of thin air a date for evacuating U.S. troops from Iraq.  It was meant to send a message to the Commander in Chief, but its only real effect is to delay the delivery of urgent material support to our troops.
