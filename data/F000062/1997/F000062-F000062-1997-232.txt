 President, 50 years ago a true American hero walked onto Ebbets Field one afternoon and forever shattered the color barrier with one swing of his bat. His name was Jack Roosevelt Robinson.  On that day, 7 years before Brown versus the Board of Education allowed school children of all colors to sit in the same classroom, 16 years before Martin Luther King Jr. spoke of his dreams at the foot of the Lincoln Memorial, and 18 years before the Civil Rights Act became the law of the land, Jackie Robinson did more for the equal rights movement and the sport of baseball than had anyone before him.  Jackie Robinson on April 15, 1947, became the first professional black athlete to play America's pastime, baseball. In his Brooklyn Dodgers uniform, he not only broke the color barrier, but he also broke numerous baseball records during his 10-year professional career.  By the end of his tenure as a player, Jackie Robinson would become one of America's most celebrated and honored athletes. He became major league baseball's first Rookie of the Year--an award now named after him, the national league's Most Valuable Player, holder of the coveted batting title, a six-time member of Dodgers' World Series teams, a member of the 1955 world champion Dodgers, and a member of the Baseball Hall of Fame.  As the senior U.S. Senator representing California, I am particularly proud of the fact that Jackie Robinson was from the Golden State, raised in Pasadena, and was a star athlete at the University of California at Los Angeles. At UCLA, Robinson became the first athlete ever to win varsity letters in four sports: baseball, basketball, football, and track.  Such an amazing and talented athlete, however, was not welcomed into the arms of American baseball fans or of its players back in the spring of 1947.  Jackie Robinson fought prejudice and harassment with every base he ran, every ball he hit, and every victory he helped win for his team. Players and coaches yelled racial slurs at him, and one team even threatened to strike in protest of Robinson's presence in their city. But Robinson, remembering how his mother refused to sell their family home and move away amid protests from white neighbors, persevered.  He faced hatred and racism with courage and conviction, proving to teammates, opponents and fans alike that he had earned the right to play professional baseball through his sheer athleticism. Along the way, Robinson became the role model for future baseball icons such as Hank Aaron and Willie Mayes.  Shortly after his retirement from baseball in 1957, Jackie Robinson helped to further the rights of all African-Americans by becoming a spokesman and fundraiser for the National Association for the Advancement of Colored people [NAACP]. He traveled the country urging black communities to work together for equal rights, educating and encouraging them to participate in the new civil rights movement. He became a role model all over again, this time to millions of men and women who saw inequality and wanted to change it.  Jackie Robinson represents everything good with baseball, and everything great with America. By commemorating his achievements and his entrance onto the professional baseball fields, his legacy lives on, inspiring yet another generation of fans to realize their dreams and break new ground along the way.  Jackie Robinson once said, ``A life is not important except in the impact it has on other lives.'' By that standard, Jackie Robinson's life was as important as America's greatest heroes throughout history, and we as a nation are all grateful and proud of his accomplishments.  Major league baseball has recognized Jackie Robinson's achievements by dedicating the 1997 season to his memory. As part of these festivities, last week's opening day games were played in all major league stadiums with a Jackie Robinson commemorative baseball. Just last weekend, the Los Angeles Dodgers paid tribute to the Hall of Famer in a pregame ceremony attended by Rachel Robinson, Jackie's widow.  The Dodgers plan many other activities throughout the year such as a Jackie Robinson poster distributed to all Los Angeles district schools, a special section devoted to Robinson on the Dodgers' official web site, a salute to Jackie Robinson scholarship winners, an historic Robinson display at Dodger Stadium and assistance with the Jackie Robinson Foundation Golf Classic. Additionally, President Clinton will honor his memory with Rachel Robinson in an April 15 ceremony at Shea Stadium during a game between the Dodgers and the New York Mets.  I salute the memory of Jackie Robinson on this, the 50th anniversary of his becoming the first black baseball player in the major leagues.                          ____________________
