 There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in the Record, as follows:                [From the Washington Post, May 25, 2011]             A Chance to Put Protections in the Patriot Act       Congress appears poised to renew important counterterrorism      provisions before they are to expire at the end of the week.      That much is welcome. But it is disappointing that lawmakers      may extend the Patriot Act measures without additional      protections meant to ensure that these robust tools are used      appropriately.       The Patriot Act's lone-wolf provision allows law      enforcement agents to seek court approval to surveil a non-     U.S. citizen believed to be involved in terrorism but who may      not have been identified as a member of a foreign group. A      second measure allows the government to use roving wiretaps      to keep tabs on a suspected foreign agent even if he      repeatedly switches cellphone numbers or communication      devices, relieving officers of the obligation of going back      for court approval every time the suspect changes his means      of communication. A third permits the government to obtain a      court order to seize ``any tangible item'' deemed relevant to      a national security investigation. All three are scheduled to      sunset by midnight Thursday.       House and Senate leaders have struck a preliminary      agreement for an extension to June 2015 and may vote on the      matter as early as Thursday morning. This agreement was not      easy to come by. Several Republican senators originally      wanted permanent extensions--a proposition rebuffed by most      Democrats and civil liberties groups. In the House,      conservative Tea Party members, who worried about handing the      federal government too much power, earlier this year bucked a      move that would have kept the provisions alive until      December. Congressional leaders were forced to piece together      short-term approvals to keep the tools from lapsing.       The compromise four-year extension is important because it      gives law enforcement agencies certainty about the tools'      availability. But the bill would be that much stronger if      oversight and auditing requirements originally included in      the version from Sen. Patrick J. Leahy (D-Vt.) were permitted      to remain. Mr. Leahy's proposal, which won bipartisan      approval in the Senate Judiciary Committee, required the      attorney general and the Justice Department inspector general      to provide periodic reports to congressional overseers to      ensure that the tools are being used responsibly. Mr. Leahy      has crafted an amendment that includes these protections, but      it is unlikely that the Senate leadership will allow its      consideration.       At this late hour, it is most important to ensure that the      provisions do not lapse, which could happen as a result of a      dispute between Senate Majority Leader Harry M. Reid (D-Nev.)      and Sen. Rand Paul (R-Ky.) over procedural issues. If time      runs out for consideration of the Leahy amendment, Mr. Leahy      should offer a stand-alone bill later to make the reporting      requirements the law.
