 President, one of my constituents, James W. Carney, an attorney practicing in Des Moines, IA, recently requested that I bring to the attention of my colleagues in the Senate some aspects of the medical malpractice situation in Iowa he believes should be more widely known. I ask unanimous consent that his March 30 letter to me, and his e-mail to John Whitaker, a Representative in the Iowa State House of Representatives, be printed in the Record.  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in the Record, as follows:                                                  Carney, Appleby,                                    Kielsen & Skinner, P.L.C.,                                   Des Moines, IA, March 30, 2005.     Re medical malpractice reform.     Senator Charles Grassley,     Federal Building,     Des Moines, IA.       Dear Senator Grassley: I was just listening to WHO and      heard your comment that if we had medical malpractice reform      we wouldn't have to perform all the tests that are unneeded.      As a supporter of yours going back to the days when you were      in the Iowa Capitol, I cry foul. I am attaching an email      which we sent to all members of the Iowa Legislature.       I would request that you make known to the US Senate the      true facts of what is going out in real Iowa--real America.       Malpractice cases are down 29.6% over the last three years.      Civil filings are down in the state of Iowa. Civil jury      trials are down in the state of Iowa. There were only 22      malpractice cases tried in the entire state of Iowa last      year. Verdicts are down.       Meahwhile, guess what? Our physicians are having their      malpractice premiums increased by 10, 15 and 20%. It is      ridiculous to blame lawyers.       Doctors perform tests because they believe it is the best      patient care and the tests are necessary. I have yet to talk      to a doctor who is willing to admit that the only reason they      perform a test is because they fear they are going to be sued      or it might be malpractice. Doctors perform tests because      their patients deserve the best medical care they can give      them. I believe they are motivated from an altruistic point      of view and they truly care about their patients. I have      heard it said many times that it might also be in their best      financial interest to order tests, as they obviously get paid      for the services. Blaming Iowa lawyers for unnecessary      medical tests is like blaming a farmer for drought or floods.      I am attaching the civil filing statistics from the Supreme      Court of the State of Iowa. I hope these come in handy for      your reference the next time you are asked about malpractice.      You have always been a very no-nonsense guy and a person      driven by the facts. These are the facts. As my mentor, Mr.      Jones, used to say ``end of report''.       Thank you for your good service in the US Senate, but I      sure hope this information may help you on the issue of      medical malpractice. In my home town of Centerville, I can      assure you the number one issue for doctors is Medicaid-     Medicare reimbursement--not malpractice. The second major      issue for them is lifestyle and the fact that they have very      few nights and/or weekends off. The third issue is culture      and/or the lack of such. Way down the list malpractice,      because there has never even been a malpractice case filed in      approximately half the counties in Iowa.           Sincerely yours,     James W. Carney.                                  ____       Although you hear all types of stories about lawsuits and      anecdotal stories about litigation, you should know what the      facts are here in Iowa. It is the farthest thing from the      truth to argue that Iowa is a litigious state. Consider the      following:       Fact 1: Medical malpractice lawsuits are down 29.6% over      the last three years.       Fact 2: According to the National Association of Insurance      Commissioners own reporting, Iowa has one of the lowest loss      experiences in the United States. Medical malpractice      insurance companies collected over $60 million in premiums      from Iowa physicians and paid out $41 million for direct      losses, defense and cost containment expenses. The Iowa loss      ratio is 67.64%, one of the lowest in the country.       Fact 3: Independent rating services substantiate that      capping recoveries will not have any effect on insurance      premiums or the availability of insurance.       Fact 4: Iowa has already adopted significant tort reform      measures, and because of this, is rated as having one of the      most reasonable and fair litigation systems in the United      States by the U.S. Chamber of Commerce.       Iowa's civil justice system, conservative jurors and low      verdicts are not the cause of high insurance rates for Iowa      physicians. Caps on non-economic damages will not do anything      to help Iowa physicians obtain lower insurance premiums. Caps      will hurt innocent Iowa citizens who, through no fault of      their own, have been severely injured. Should not      professionals who cause injuries to innocent patients be      responsible for their negligent conduct?                          ____________________[Page S3813]From the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]                          MEDICAL MALPRACTICE
