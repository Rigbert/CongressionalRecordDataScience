President, this year marks the 40th anniversary of the Immigrant and Refugee Community Organization, IRCO, a nonprofit organization that serves the many immigrant and refugee communities that come to Oregon seeking a new and better life.  Since its founding in 1976, IRCO has been helping individuals and families who come to the United States with few resources and little support. Established by refugees, for refugees, the organization has a long track record of providing vital housing, healthcare, and employment services. IRCO staff offer peer-to-peer assistance and culturally specific services through programs like the Asian Family Center and Africa House. IRCO served more than 28,000 people in 2015 alone, helping these new Oregonians integrate into communities across our State while maintaining an important connection to their rich heritage and traditions.  Beyond offering immediate support for those starting a life in the United States, IRCO has also become an advocacy arm for Oregon's immigrants and refugees. Its leadership development programs have graduated many individuals who have worked with key decisionmakers to pursue change in Oregon and beyond.  As many in this Chamber know, I am the son of immigrants who fled Nazi Germany to avoid persecution. The act of helping immigrants and refugees resettle, to become contributing Americans, is close to my heart. I know firsthand how this country thrives by harnessing the ideas, energy, and hard work of those who come to our shores--in fact, I stand here today as the proof. That is why I will continue to do what I can to support organizations, like IRCO, working day-in and day-out to ensure everyone gets a fair shot at success.  I conclude by congratulating IRCO on 40 years of tremendous service and by wishing all of its staff, volunteers, and partners continued success in the years to come.                          ____________________
