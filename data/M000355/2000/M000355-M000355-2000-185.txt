 President, I rise today to express congratulations to all of the team members at the Toyota assembly plant in Georgetown, Kentucky, on being recognized by J.D. Power and Associates for the high quality of vehicles which they have produced.  It is my understanding that the Georgetown assembly plant is the only plant in North America to win this award this year. Moreover, I understand that all of the cars produced at the Georgetown plant have been ranked best in their category in this year's J.D. Power and Associates survey of the best cars and trucks. Not only is it an outstanding achievement to be chosen by J.D. Power--whose rankings are widely considered to be the industry standard for new car quality--to receive a Gold Plant Quality Award in recognition of outstanding vehicle quality, but to receive this honor for the fourth time in ten years is a truly remarkable accomplishment. I commend you and all of your hard work in earning this award.  News of the announcement by J.D. Power of the Georgetown plant's award follows closely on the announcement by Toyota that the company hit a milestone with a record-breaking production of 1 million vehicles in North America. A significant amount of the credit for this accomplishment, too, belongs to the hard-working folks at the Georgetown facility, and I want to congratulate you on this achievement, as well.  I am proud of the relationship between Toyota Motor Manufacturing and the Commonwealth of Kentucky. Since Kentucky made its original investment in Toyota in 1986, the state has realized a 36.8 percent annual rate of return, and has benefited greatly from the more than $5 billion which Toyota has invested statewide. Most of all, though, I am proud of the work being done by the Kentuckians who work at the Toyota plant. On behalf of myself and my colleagues in the United States Senate, congratulations again on your significant achievement.                          ____________________
