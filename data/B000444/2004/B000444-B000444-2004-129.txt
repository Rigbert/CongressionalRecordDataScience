 We know just about everyone in the State. You can't go to the grocery store, church, synagogue, or mosque without running into people you know. We go to each other's events. It is a little like Alaska--small. Alaska is gigantic, but the population is small. We go to each other's gatherings, and we are affected by each other's achievements and each other's milestones, and we are affected by each other's losses. Sometimes the closeness gets us in trouble, but I would not change it for the world.  It has been an honor and a pleasure to represent my State and to have the pleasure over the years to invite several members of our clergy to come and be guest Chaplains.  Rabbi Ellen Bernhardt is our guest Chaplain today. As Senator Carper said, she is finishing her 11th year at the Albert Einstein Academy in Wilmington, not far from where I live.
