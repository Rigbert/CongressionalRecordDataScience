 BENNETT. I yield for another comment.  Mr. McCONNELL. As an observation on what the Senator said about leveling the playing field, that was raised in the Buckley case, and the Supreme Court said it was constitutionally impermissible for the Government to try to level the playing field. In fact, the Court said:       The concept that Government may restrict the speech of some      elements of our society in order to enhance the relative      voice of others is wholly foreign to the first amendment.  So my friend from Utah is correct, even if it were possible somehow for the Government to figure out how to micromanage and level the playing field, it is truly constitutionally impermissible for the Government to try to do that.
