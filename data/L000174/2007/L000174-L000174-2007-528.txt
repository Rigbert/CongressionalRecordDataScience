President, I believe there are 2 minutes equally divided. I simply ask all Senators, send a very strong signal. We want to correct the mistake made in the PATRIOT Act, a mistake that has been utilized the wrong way. We want to go back to the appointment of U.S. attorneys the way they should be appointed. We want to have the advice and consent of the Senate. I urge all Senators to vote for the legislation Senator Feinstein and I and Senator Specter and others have introduced.
