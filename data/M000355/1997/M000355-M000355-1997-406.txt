  The ACLU, in a letter to me dated March 6, says that this language before us may well give the Congress the power to interfere with editorializing in newspapers. Let me just read this observation for my colleagues and for those who are interested.       Senate Joint Resolution 18 [referring to the resolution      before us] would also give Congress and every state      legislature the power, heretofore denied by the First      Amendment, to regulate the most protected function of the      press--editorializing. Print outlets such as newspapers and      magazines, broadcasters, Internet publishers and cable      operators would be vulnerable to severe regulation of      editorial content by the government. A candidate-centered      editorial, as well as op-ed articles or commentary printed at      the publisher's expense are most certainly expenditures in      support of or in opposition to particular political      candidates. The amendment, as its words make apparent, would      authorize Congress to set reasonable limits on the      expenditures by the media during campaigns, when not strictly      reporting the news. Such a result would be intolerable in a      society that cherishes the free press.  So what we have here, America's experts on the first amendment--sometimes we agree with them; sometimes we do not--but clearly America's experts on the first amendment, the ACLU, say that this amendment before us gives the Congress, us, the power to control editorial comment in this country.
