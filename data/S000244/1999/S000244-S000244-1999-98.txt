Chairman, reclaiming my time, I would like to tell my friend, the gentleman from Alabama (Mr. Cramer), as well as the gentleman from Arkansas (Mr. Hutchinson), who has a similar concern, that the Committee on Science is aware of the NOAA Modernization Transition Committee process and commends NOAA for its efforts in this regard.  The committee is also aware of the efforts of various communities that maintain local weather coverage and shares the gentlemen's view and their concern about the degradation of service that may result from closing Weather Service offices. Consequently, the Committee on Science strongly urges NOAA to continue to aggressively work with local communities in developing comprehensive strategies that will allow high-risk communities to effectively respond to occurrences of severe weather.  I can add that the Committee on Science is known as doing tough-love oversight, and this is one of the areas where the committee will be doing some pretty tough oversight because we do not want NOAA modernization to result in a huge degradation of service, particularly in the high-risk areas. I know the gentleman from Alabama (Mr. Cramer) represents one of those areas, as does the gentleman from Arkansas (Mr. Hutchinson).
