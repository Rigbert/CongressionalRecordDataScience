President, I thank the chairman for his kind words and support. I do also recognize Senator Wayne Allard of Colorado. Wayne and I worked together on this legislation for a number of years. In fact, we sort of rotated between subcommittee chairman of the Housing Subcommittee. Consistently and in a very bipartisanfashion, we worked together. We have been joined by Senator Bond whose leadership on the Appropriations Committee is remarkable when it comes to housing issues. We benefited immensely by the contributions of Senators Allard and Bond. I did not have the fortune of knowing Stuart McKinney. I knew him only by reputation. He was known as a sterling man who worked hard when the issue of homelessness was not as central to our consciousness as it is today.  Bruce Vento was extraordinarily decent. These two gentlemen sort of pointed the way. Now we have to take up the task and move it forward and further. I think we can with this legislation.  I thank the chairman for his support and urge all colleagues to join us in support of the amendment.  I suggest the absence of quorum.
