 President, I thank the Chair.  We have been working this afternoon with the Senators from Alaska on the bill before us. One of our main concerns has been the environmental issues in Puget Sound in my home State of Washington.  I appreciate all of the work that the Senator from Alaska has done in helping to meet one of our concerns on this bill.  The amendment in front of us requires that a vessel be in Puget Sound that is paid for by the industry so we can assure that the vessels which come into Puget Sound are escorted through the Straits of Juan de Fuca.  I thank the Senator from Alaska and his committee for all their work on this and urge its adoption.
