 I just sent my staff to the Joint Tax Committee, and as of May 18, there is a small report which shows the distributional effects of S. 1415 as reported by the Senate committee, but that is just the distribution of how the taxes would fall on the income groups.  To the Senator's knowledge, is there any sound analysis by a governmental entity such as CRS, CBO, or Joint Tax on the actual per-pack costs of this bill out 25 years?
