Speaker, it is my distinct honor to congratulate the Croatian Sons Lodge Number 170 of the Croatian Fraternal Union on the joyous occasion of its 99th anniversary and Golden Member banquet on Sunday, September 24, 2006.  This year, the Croatian Fraternal Union will hold this gala event at the Croatian Center in Merrillville, Indiana. Traditionally, the anniversary celebration includes a ceremonial appreciation of the Union's Golden Members, those who have achieved 50 years of membership. This year's honorees that have attained 50 years of membership include: Angeli Cirrincione, Barbara Demers, Rosemary Gard, Catherine Grcevich, Catherine Jelovcic, Elizabeth Lukacek, Nikola Majetic, Margaret J. Milos, Virginia A. Mostak, Ruth Jean Mrzlak, Rudolph J. Pavletich, Sandra Louise Regan, Luandre Rozmanich, Robert Lee Scott, Ann Louise Smoljan, Mary Ann Troksa, and Madeline Vukobratic.  These faithful and devoted individuals share this esteemed tribute with 482 additional Lodge members who have previously attained this significant designation.  This memorable day will begin with a morning mass at Saint Joseph the Worker Catholic Church in Gary, Indiana, with the Reverend Father Stephen Loncar officiating. The Brace Tamburitza Orchestra will perform at this gala event. A formal dinner banquet in the afternoon will end the day's festivities.  Mr. Speaker, I urge you and my other distinguished colleagues to join me in commending Lodge President Betty Morgavan, and all the other members of the Croatian Fraternal Union Lodge Number 170, for their loyalty and radiant display of passion for their ethnicity. The Croatian community has played a key role in elevating the quality of life and culture of Northwest Indiana. It is my hope that this year will bring renewed possibilities, admiration, and success for all members of the Croatian community and their families.                          ____________________
