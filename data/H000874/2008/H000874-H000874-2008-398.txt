All of us, however, share what has been said about Tom Lantos, for whom we had the greatest respect, and we all share a sadness at his loss.  I regret that the actions that precipitated this hour that you are taking have occurred. They have occurred. We can't change them. Having said that, I want to say that I understand the point the gentleman is making, and I understand the point my friend Mr. Blunt has made. I think it will suffice to say that. But I can appreciate the position the gentleman found himself in and that Mr. Blunt and his leadership found themselves in.
