I can truly say throughout his more than 36 years of service at Saint Sava, Father Todorovich has been one of the most dedicated, distinguished, and committed citizens of Indiana's First Congressional District. Northwest Indiana and Saint Sava have certainly been rewarded by the true service and uncompromising loyalty he has displayed to the parish and the entire community.  Father Todorovich was born in Vratare, Serbia on July 5, 1940. From a very young age, he was inspired by his faith and realized that a life of service in the priesthood was his calling. In pursuit of his dream, Father Todorovich eventually went on to complete his courses, earning a Bachelor's Degree in Theological Studies at Saints Cyril and Methodius Seminarian College in Prizen. Following the completion of his studies, Father Todorovich emigrated to the United States of America in 1964. In 1965, due to his perseverance and dedication, Father Todorovich's efforts came to fruition with his ordination into the priesthood.  Prior to joining the congregation at Saint Sava Serbian Orthodox Church, while serving as parish priest for Saint George Church, Father Todorovich served as the director of the Saint Sava Mission Summer Camp program in California. Shortly thereafter, in 1970, he arrived at Saint Sava Church, which was located in Gary, Indiana at the time. Early on during his tenure as parish priest at Saint Sava, Father Todorovich's abilities as a teacher and community leader began to emerge. It was through his efforts at this time that many new members joined the congregation, a new donation campaign was initiated, new church bylaws were introduced, and the need for social gatherings and activities for youth was realized.  When a fire destroyed the church in Gary, Father Todorovich led the parishioners of Saint Sava to a new chapel in Hobart, Indiana, where services were held until the construction of the current church, located in Merrillville, Indiana, was completed. Subsequently, the new church was consecrated in May 1991. Once again, with Father Todorovich's leadership and committed efforts, as well as the vast efforts of many parishioners, the people of Saint Sava were once again able to come together with their spiritual leader and each other to worship.  The new church's consecration, however, was not the only momentous occasion at this time, as Father Todorovich was awarded the highest honor, the Pectoral Cross with the title of Protojerej Stavrofor. To further illustrate the high esteem in which Father Todorovich is held by his parish and his community, in April 1993, he was appointed to the distinguished position of Deputy to the Metropolitan.  Another of the many ways Father Todorovich has touched the lives of so many people is through his writing. Father Todorovich is quite the accomplished writer, having produced several literary works, including: Patron Saint-Krsna Slava, Our Slava: A Manual on Confession and Communion, and A Visitor's Guide to Saint Sava Church. He has also penned various articles for the Diocesan Observer, as well as for Saint Sava's church bulletin.  Although his pastoral duties and many additional responsibilities have required a vast amount of his time, what is most impressive is the fact that Father Todorovich has never let his busy schedule keep him from his greatest love, his family. Father Todorovich and his wife, Protinica Mirijana, are the proud parents of three daughters, and they have also been blessed with one grandchild.  Madam Speaker, America is a better place because of the tireless and unselfish service of its citizens. Very Reverend Father Jovan Todorovich is a man who has dedicated his entire life to serving others, and he has been the truest example of morality and wisdom. In so doing, he has strengthened his community and the whole of our society. I ask you and my other distinguished colleagues to join me in commending Very Reverend Father Jovan Todorovich for his lifetime of enduring service and the unforgettable effect he has had on the people of Saint Sava Serbian Orthodox Church and Northwest Indiana. I wish Father Todorovich and his family well upon his retirement.                          ____________________
