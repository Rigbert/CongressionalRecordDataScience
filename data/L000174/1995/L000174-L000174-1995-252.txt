President, this amendment of the Senator from North Carolina is acceptable on this side.  I wonder if the distinguished floor manager would be interested in doing it this way: That we pass by voice vote the amendment by the Senator from North Carolina and then go for rollcall, the yeas and nays having been ordered on the amendment of the Senator from New Mexico.  Mr. McCONNELL. Mr. President, approving the Helms amendment is fine.  I indicated to the Senator from New Mexico that the Senator from Florida, Senator Mack, will want to speak on his amendment, so we will not be able to go forward on the Bingaman amendment yet.  I see no problem in moving ahead on the Helms amendment that is currently before the Senate. I am aware of no opposition to it, Mr. President.
