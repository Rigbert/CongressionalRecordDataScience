Speaker, I rise in support of the resolution and stand 1,000 percent behind our brave and selfless men and women in uniform.  Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of the resolution.  At this decisive moment in history, all Americans stand 1000 percent behind our brave and selfless men and women in uniform.  I have no doubt America will achieve a military victory in Iraq. The road after that will be long, and require sustained commitment along with the support of our allies.  No one can predict fully the course of world events as this war begins, so we must draw our strength from one another. This is a time for reflection, and kindness to one another.  I extend deepest respect to all the people of our community country who have open discussed and not shirked from their responsibilities as free citizens in addressing how best to defeat rising terrorism around the world. Your voices will shape a wiser course for the future.  May the God that creates and sustains us all protect the world's children for a general of peace to come.
