 President, Valdon Johnson is a retired Assistant Professor of English, now Emeritus Professor of English, from the University of Northern Iowa and currently is a regular volunteer in my Waterloo Regional office.  Although Valdon's father died when Valdon was about 7, his mother had remarried about 5 years later. Valdon began his college career at Iowa State Teachers College, now the University of Northern Iowa (UNI) in 1950. His studies were suspended while he served in the Navy. He received his B.A. in English in 1958 and an M.A. in English in 1959. His first teaching position was with Webster City Junior College, now Iowa Central Community College. In 1962, Valdon received a Fulbright Award to teach English as a foreign language in Japan before returning to UNI in 1968, where for 26 years, he taught Linguistics and Humanities.  Valdon's first day in my office was September 23, 1994, his next was November 6, 1995. During the in-between time of about 13.5 months he recovered from a stroke that left him unable to talk. Not withstanding the stroke, he volunteered one to two days per week since. Valdon continues his other interests, which include the Masons and in traveling to the United Kingdom about every year, music (piano & organ), calligraphy, stenotype theory, handwriting analysis and religious history.  Although Valdon is unable to answer the phone, he does help with case work letter preparation, news paper clipping, filing and calligraphy. For over 7 years he has been a faithful, always on time volunteer and has been of invaluable assistance.  Valdon will celebrate his 69th birthday on August 15. I want to use this occasion to say ``happy birthday'' Valdon. And to say thanks for all you have done for me and for the people of Iowa.                          ____________________
