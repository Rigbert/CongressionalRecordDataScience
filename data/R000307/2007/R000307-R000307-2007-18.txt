President, I rise today to discuss several important tax relief measures that expire this year.  As several of my colleagues have noted, these provisions are important to many of our folks back home and have a direct impact on their daily lives and pocketbook. This tax relief has put more money in taxpayers' pockets rather than the government coffers and needs to be extended.  I am pleased to introduce legislation to extend two expiring tax relief measures.  The first measure ensures that we continue to provide a 7-year depreciation schedule for motorsports complexes. This is an important tax relief provision to hundreds of race facilities across the country, both large and small.  In Kansas, more than 30 tracks can benefit from this depreciation schedule. It allows race facilities to make important safety and modernization investments under a depreciation schedule that reflects the ongoing need to maintain these facilities.  The largest track in Kansas, the Kansas Speedway, which was just completed in 2001, has been the economic driver in the revitalization of Kansas City, KS. What was once one of the most economically depressed areas in Kansas is now one of the fastest growing. The speedway alone contributed more than $150 million to the local economy in its first year, creating 3,300 new jobs and generating $10 million in property taxes and $26 million in sales taxes.  The track has spurred new investment in the area, including a 400-acre retail and entertainment center that has brought in more than 90 businesses and 5,500 jobs. Because of this growth, an additional $750 million in development in the area is underway. The area has become the largest tourist attraction in Kansas, bringing in 12 million visitors per year.  As we look at extending tax relief, I hope we will be mindful of the tremendous economic benefit that these facilities generate in our home States.  I am also pleased to introduce legislation to extend an important charitable giving provision that we initially passed last year as part of the Pension Protection Act. This provision allows individuals age 70\1/2\ or older, who must begin taking distributions from their individual retirement accounts, to donate those distributions to a charitable organization without incurring tax on the distribution. Individuals many donate up to $100,000.  I have heard from many charitable organizations in Kansas that have already seen the benefits of this legislation, including colleges and universities, that tell me that many donors are making good use of this tax relief provision.  At the University of Kansas for example, this provision has helped generate 94 gifts totaling more than $2.8 million. The gifts have ranged from $100 to $100,000--the rollover maximum.  Smaller colleges are also benefitting. Sterling College, located in central Kansas, has an enrollment of 607 students. Last year the college raised a total of $2 million dollars in unrestricted gifts. More than 10 percent of that amount, $253,000, was raised as a result of this provision. In addition, one donor who had previously given $1,000, increased her gift to over $80,000 as a direct result of the IRA charitable rollover provision.  This provision has proven to be an important incentive to encourage small donors to give, and is an important tool for charities to attract new donors. I encourage my colleagues to support an extension of this measure.  I would also like to share my support for two other measures that extend expiring tax relief. The first is the deduction for tuition and higher education expenses, introduced by Senator Cornyn. I am pleased to cosponsor this legislation.  This deduction is an important benefit for many families who are looking for ways to pay for a college education. It allows a deduction of up to $4,000 for tuition and related expenses. Nearly 49,000 Kansas taxpayers benefitted from this deduction in 2005. Across the country, more than 4.5 million taxpayers claimed the deduction.  We have taken a number of steps in Congress to help families manage the cost of a college education. This deduction is another important benefit that we need to extend to aid families paying for college.  In addition, I am pleased to cosponsor legislation introduced by Senator Inhofe that extends an important tax incentive for marginal oil and gas wells.  Recognizing the value of oil and gas wells decline over time, the tax code allows depletion deductions to recover investments in marginal oil and gas wells.  Under one method of depletion deduction--percentage depletion--15 percent of the taxpayer's gross income from an oil- or gas-producing property is allowed as a deduction in each taxable year. The amount deducted generally may not exceed 100 percent of the net income from that property in any year. However, this limitation is suspended for marginal wells prior to January 1, 2008.  Extending this provision is critical for marginal wells, which are a key source of domestic oil and gas production and create thousands of jobs.  Marginal wells account for 17 percent of the oil produced domestically and about 9 percent of natural gas. There are more than 401,000 marginal oil wells in the U.S. which comprise 80 percent of all of the Nation's oil wells. They produced more than 321 million barrels of oil in 2005. This production prevented the U.S. from spending an additional $16 billion on imported oil. Kansas ranks third among States in the number of marginal wells; and fourth in production from these wells.  The number of marginal gas wells has steadily increased over the past 10 years and production has increased accordingly. Over the past 10 years, production from the Nation's 288,000 marginal gas wells has nearly doubled. Kansas has the largest continuous natural gas reservoir in the lower 48 States and ranks eighth in the number of marginal gas wells, and second in production from these wells.  As we look to reduce reliance on foreign oil it is important we keep in mind that marginal oil and gas wells are an key source of domestic production. We need to maintain existing tax incentives to encourage these small producers.                          ____________________
