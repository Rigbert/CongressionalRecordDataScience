President, this is fascinating. I say to my colleagues, I have served here longer than any other Member of this body. I have been here 42 years. I have been here when the Democrats were in the majority and when the Republicans were in the majority, with Democratic Presidents and Republican Presidents. I have never, ever seen a time when a Member of the Senate asked to put into the Record a letter especially by a civil rights icon and somebody objected. It has always been done.  I have had letters that people have asked to be put in that were contrary to a position that I might take. Of course, I would not object. They are allowed to do it. I have seen letters when Members of both sides of the aisle have debated back and forth and the other side would put in letters that were contrary to their opponents' positions, and of course nobody objected.  Don't let the Senate turn into something it has never been before. I would hope that cooler heads would prevail, and we go back to the things that made the Senate great, that made the Senate the conscience of the Nation, as it should be.  I have never once objected to a Senator introducing a letter, even though they took a position different than mine. I have never known of a Republican Senator to do that, and here we are talking about a letter from a civil rights icon.  Let's not go down this path. It is not good for the country. It is not good for the Senate, it is not good for democracy, and it sure as heck is not good for free speech.  I admire the Senator from Rhode Island. He is a man of great integrity, a man who was attorney general of his State and U.S. attorney in his State. His request was something that is normally accepted automatically. I would hope Senators would reconsider.  I yield the floor.
