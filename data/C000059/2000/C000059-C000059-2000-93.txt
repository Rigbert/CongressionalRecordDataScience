Speaker, I rise today in strong support of this conference report, the Agricultural Risk Protection Act of 2000. This legislation goes a long way to assisting our farmers. I want to thank both the chairman and the ranking member, the gentlemen from the great State of Texas, for moving this conference report forward. I am especially pleased that $25 million was included to compensate growers for losses resulting from Pierce's Disease, plum pox, and citrus canker. My district has been hit hard by Pierce's Disease, which is transmitted by the glassy-winged sharpshooter. The disease attacks grapevines and is spreading at a rapid rate through Southern California, the gateway of one of the premier wine regions in California, as well as threatening the wine regions in the northern part of the State.  It is estimated that 25 percent of the 3,000 acres of vineyards in Temecula have been destroyed to Pierce's Disease. Pests are not new to California and to this country. It is estimated in California alone we will lose about $3 billion in losses just because of pests. Pests are introduced in California, new pests, every 60 days. This assistance will help our growers to fight these pests and to struggle through a tough period.
