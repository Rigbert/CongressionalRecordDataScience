Speaker, this is a very important agency of the Federal Government in terms of consumer health and safety: the National Transportation Safety Board. And one of the things for a number of years that has concerned me about the National Transportation Safety Board is they approach issues of public safety from a fairly pure standpoint in terms of what is needed to better protect the traveling public and to prevent loss of life. And unfortunately, when it gets over to the agencies of jurisdiction, particularly the FAA, they have put a value on your life. Now, I once asked an FAA individual, I said, so what do you think your life is worth? And the particular value at that time I think was around $200,000 per life, or soul as they call it. I said, don't you think you are worth more than that? At that point we were arguing about moving seats further apart so people could access the over-wing exits. And the airlines were complaining about the revenue that would be lost. It took, actually, 8 years after a tragic accident, with people stacked up like cord wood in Manchester, England, to get that rule passed here. The Brits did it in 6 months.  So often the NTSB recommends what they see as needed changes to protect safety, and all too often those things are ignored. They disappear in the black hole over there at the FAA. This bill will change that.  The most wanted transportation safety improvements, which are available and published on an annual basis by the NTSB in all modes of transportation, are now going to have to be responded to by the FAA. Within 90 days of the date of enactment of this bill, we will get a report which will explain why they have not implemented these most wanted regulations here to better protect the traveling public. This will be an improvement. It will now at least require meaningful response from the agency, and perhaps move us forward in better protecting life and safety.
