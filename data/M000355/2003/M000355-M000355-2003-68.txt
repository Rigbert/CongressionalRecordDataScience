 President, I say to my friend from Nevada, I think that is a widely held sentiment on this side of the aisle as well. It will be vastly more desirable to wrap it up this week, even if this week means a longer week than normal, than to carry it over to next week or certainly December. We are going to be pushing to complete the business of the Senate this week. This week ideally would be Friday, but it could end up being Saturday or later. It is our goal to wrap up this session of the 108th Congress this week.  Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.
