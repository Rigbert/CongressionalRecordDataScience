President, it would be helpful if the Democratic manager of the bill or the sponsor of the amendment gave us some idea as to the subject of the amendment and whether the Senator from New Jersey is seeking a full debate on it or just wants to call it up briefly--or what his intentions are.  The Senator from New Jersey has an amendment that we are trying to put in a block of amendments to deal with the issue of scanning cargo. There are three such amendments that are pending: the amendment of the Senator from New York, Mr. Schumer; the amendment of the Senator from New Jersey; and the amendment of the Senator from Minnesota. I need more information about the Senator's intentions, given he has filed more than one amendment.
