Speaker, I rise today to honor and pay tribute to two individuals whose ongoing dedication and contributions to the community of Temecula, California have been exceptional. Temecula has been fortunate to have dynamic and dedicated community leaders who willingly and unselfishly give their time and talent to make their communities a better place to live and work. Gerry and Rosie Wilson are two of these individuals. On February 22, 2014, Gerry and Rosie were honored as the ``Lifetime Achievement Award'' recipients at the Temecula Chamber of Commerce Installation and Awards Gala for all that they have done.  Born and raised in the heart of the Midwest, Rosie and Gerry came from humble beginnings. This foundation instilled quality values in the pair that are exemplified to this day. It was almost fate that Rosie and Gerry met one day on a train. She was on her way home to Iowa to celebrate Christmas with her family after having set up a cerebral palsy clinic in Boise, Idaho and he sat down across from her. Not too shortly after, they were walking down the wedding aisle, ready to begin their life together. In a matter of two and a half years, the pair had adopted a child and given birth to three more. Their children became their top priorities.  As their children grew older, however, the Wilson's aspirations grew bigger. At their children's suggestion, the couple began to consider opening a winery. Gerry had never been known as a big risk taker; in fact, he made his living as a financial advisor. He was careful to consider every aspect of this huge investment that may have required their entire life savings. After happening upon Temecula, California in 1996, Gerry and Rosie became convinced that this was the right move for them and their dream became a reality when they purchased a small winery named Wilson Creek Winery that same year.  In 1997, Gerry and Rosie's three children and their families picked up and moved to Temecula to begin working alongside their parents at the winery, which officially opened its tasting room doors in 2000. The family's values have contributed immensely to the success of the business. It is evident that each individual contributes a certain expertise to the day-to-day operations of the winery, creating a dynamic business model.  The Wilson's hard work and dedication have grown Wilson Creek Winery into an incredible business over the years. They have single-handedly created 20 fulltime, and 30 part time jobs. Today, the winery spans 90 acres from which they sell over 30,000 cases of wine each year. 1,000 visitors a weekend walk through the tasting room doors to experience the ambiance and wine the couple has worked so hard to create. For all of the growth and success Gerry and Rosie have contributed to Temecula, the Temecula Valley Chamber of Commerce awarded the winery ``Gold Business of the Year'' for 2004.  Not only have Rosie and Gerry contributed tremendously to the economic growth of the city, but they have always made sure to also give back to their community. Every year, the couple hosts a variety of charity events at Wilson Creek Winery, bringing in hundreds of thousands of dollars to help local organizations and individuals in need. In 2004, The Wilsons hosted a benefit for families affected by a wildfire that came within two miles of the winery, raising $40,000 in one night. More recently, they have hosted fundraisers for the Junior Diabetes Foundation, Special Olympics, Rotary International, Alzheimer's research, and a local animal shelter.  The Wilson's tireless passion for service has contributed immensely to the betterment of the community of Temecula, California. I am proud to call Gerry and Rosie fellow community members, Americans and friends. I know that many individuals are grateful for their service and salute them as they receive this well-deserved Lifetime Achievement Award.                          ____________________
