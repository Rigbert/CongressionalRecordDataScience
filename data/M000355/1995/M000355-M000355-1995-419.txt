 President, I do not know; maybe we can check with the Cloakrooms to see if anybody objects to yielding back time. I do not know whether my friend from South Carolina has time left he wants to use, but I was going to suggest that I make a few more observations and if the Senator from South Carolina is ready to yield back, I would yield back as well. But there could be those who are depending on this vote occurring at a certain time, so if we could ask the staff to check on that, I would appreciate it.          Mr. President, the past majority leader, Senator Mitchell, who just left the Senate a couple of months ago said on June 26, 1990, ``For 200 years,'' referring to the first amendment, ``it has protected the liberties of generations of Americans. During that time, the Bill of Rights has never been changed or amended,'' not once, ever. It stands today, word for word, exactly as it did when it was adopted two centuries ago.  Senator George Mitchell went on on the same day:       Never in 200 years has the first amendment been changed or      amended. As a result, never in 200 years has Congress been      able to make a law abridging freedom of speech.  Now, that was Senator George Mitchell, the Democratic majority leader, expressing his views about the importance of leaving the first amendment unamended, untampered with.  The current majority leader, Senator Daschle, said on June 21, 1990:       What chapter will we have ghosted for our autobiographies      to explain away our writing a loophole into the free speech      clause of the Bill of Rights of the Constitution of the      United States?  Senator Daschle was, of course, referring to the debate on the flag burning amendment, but his point, his point, was about the first amendment and freedom of speech.  Now, the American Civil Liberties Union, which I indicated earlier strongly opposes the Hollings proposal, says:       The proposed constitutional amendment to limit Federal      campaign expenditures would amend the free speech guarantee      of the first amendment as interpreted by the Supreme Court,      thereby limiting the amount of political speech that may be      engaged in by any candidate or by anyone else [anyone else]      seeking to be involved in the political process.  The ACLU said, Mr. President:               It is a highly flawed proposal, one that is      constitutionally incapable [incapable] of being fixed and      raises--          Said the ACLU:     a number of significant issues. It deserves to be rejected by      the Senate.  Now, Mr. President, I have been quoting from a number of organizations that are supposedly on the liberal side of the political spectrum. Just to reassure some of my conservative friends, it is also the view of conservatives that the Hollings amendment is a bad idea. George Will in a June 28, 1993, Newsweek column said this. He was really, I would say to my friend from South Carolina, admiring the Senator in many ways. This is a quote from Mr. Will's column, which I will ask in a moment be inserted in the Record. He said:       Hollings claims--you have to admire his brass--  And, boy, we do admire the brass of the Senator from South Carolina. He has more brass than anybody else in the Senate, and we do admire him. He said:       Hollings claims--you have to admire his brass--that carving      this huge hole in the first amendment would be ``a big boost      to free speech.'' But by ``free'' he means ``fair,'' and by      ``fair'' he means equal amounts of speech--the permissible      amounts to be decided by incumbents in Congress and State      legislatures.  George Will went on. He said:       Note also the power to limit spending not only ``by'' but      even ``in support of, or in opposition to'' candidates.  That gets back to the point I made earlier about giving Congress the power to shut the newspapers up, too.       [[Page S2636]] The Senators who voted for this included      many who three years ago stoutly (and rightly)--  George Will said.     Opposed carving out even a small exception to the first      amendment protections in order to ban flag burning. But now      these incumbents want to empower other incumbents to hack      away at the Bill of Rights in order to shrink the permissible      amount of political discourse.  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the George Will column be printed in the Record; also, that the letter to which I have referred several times from the American Civil Liberties issue be included in the Record.  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in the Record, as follows:                     [From Newsweek, June 28, 1993]  So, We Talk Too Much?--The Supreme Court's Two-word Opinion of the                 Senate's Reform Bill May Be Good Grief!'                          (By George F. Will)       Washington's political class and its journalistic echoes      are celebrating Senate passage, on a mostly party-line vote,      of a ``reform'' that constitutes the boldest attack on      freedom of speech since enactment of the Alien and Sedition      Acts of 1798. The campaign finance bill would ration      political speech. Fortunately, it is so flagrantly      unconstitutional that the Supreme Court will fling it back      across First Street, N.E., with a two-word opinion: ``Good      grief!''       The reformers begin, as their ilk usually does, with a      thumping but unargued certitude: campaigns involve ``too      much'' money. (In 1992 congressional races involved a sum      equal to 40 percent of what Americans spent on yogurt. Given      the government's increasing intrusiveness and capacity to do      harm, it is arguable that we spend to little on the      dissemination of political discourse.) But reformers eager to      limit spending have a problem: mandatory spending limits are      unconstitutional. The Supreme Court acknowledges that the      First Amendment protects ``the indispensable conditions for      meaningful communication,'' which includes spending for the      dissemination of speech. The reformers' impossible task is to      gin up ``incentives'' powerful enough to coerce candidates      into accepting limits that can be labeled ``voluntary.''       The Senate bill's original incentive was public financing,      coupled with various punishments for privately financed      candidates who choose not to sell their First Amendment      rights for taxpayers' dollars and who exceed the government's      stipulated ration of permissible spending/speech. Most      taxpayers detest public financing. (``Food stamps for      politicians,'' says Sen. Mitch McConnell, the Kentucky      Republican who will lead the constitutional challenge if      anything like this bill becomes law.) So the bill was      changed--and made even more grossly unconstitutional. Now it      limits public funding to candidates whose opponents spend/     speak in excess of government limits. The funds for the      subsidy are to come from taxing, at the top corporate rate,      all contributions to the candidate who has chosen to exercise      his free speech rights with private funding. So 35 percent of      people's contributions to a privately funded candidate would      be expropriated and given to his opponent. This is part of      the punishment system designed to produce ``voluntary''      acceptance of spending limits.       But the Court says the government cannot require people      ``to pay a tax for the exercise of that which the First      amendment has made a high constitutional privilege.'' The      Court says that the ``power to tax the exercise of a right to      power to control or suppress the exercise of its enjoyment''      and is ``as potent as the power of censorship.''       Sen. Fritz Hollings, the South Carolina Democrat, is a      passionate advocate of spending limits but at least has the      gumption to attack the First Amendment frontally. The Senate      bill amounts, he says candidly, to ``coercing people to      accept spending limits while pretending it is voluntary.''      Because ``everyone knows what we are doing is      unconstitutional,'' he proposes to make coercion      constitutional. He would withdraw First Amendment protection      from the most important speech--political discourse. And the      Senate has adopted (52-43) his resolution urging Congress to      send to the states this constitutional amendment: Congress      and the states ``shall have power to set reasonable limits on      campaign expenditures by, in support of, or in opposition to      any candidate in any primary or other election'' for federal,      state or local office.       Hollings claims--you have to admire his brass--that carving      this huge hole in the First Amendment would be ``a big boost      to free speech.'' But by ``free'' he means ``fair,'' and by      ``fair'' he means equal amounts of speech--the permissible      amounts to be decided by incumbents in Congress and state      legislatures. Note also the power to limit spending not only      ``by'' but even ``in support of, or in opposition to''      candidates. The 52 senators who voted for this included many      who three years ago stoutly (and rightly) opposed carving out      even a small exception to First Amendment protections in      order to ban flag-burning. But now these incumbents want to      empower incumbents to hack away at the Bill of Rights in      order to shrink the permissible amount of political      discourse.       Government micromanagement: The Senate bill would ban or      limit spending political action committees. It would require      privately funded candidates to say in their broadcast      advertisements that ``the candidate has not agreed to      voluntary campaign limits.'' (This speech regulation is      grossly unconstitutional because it favors a particular point      of view, and because the Court has held that the First      Amendment protects the freedom to choose ``both what to say      and what not to say.'') All this government micromanagement      of political speech is supposed to usher in the reign of      ``fairness'' (as incumbents define it, of course).       Incumbents can live happily with spending limits.      Incumbents will write the limits, perhaps not altogether      altruistically. And spending is the way challengers can      combat incumbents' advantages such as name recognition,      access to media and franked mail. Besides, the most important      and plentiful money spent for political purposes is dispensed      entirely by incumbents. It is called the federal budget--$1.5      trillion this year and rising. Federal spending (along with      myriad regulations and subsidizing activities such as      protectionist measures) often is vote-buying.       It is instructive that when the Senate voted to empower      government to ration political speech, and even endorse      amending the First Amendment, there was no outcry from      journalists. Most of them are liberals and so are disposed to      like government regulation of (other people's) lives.      Because, journalists know that government rationing of      political speech by candidates will enlarge the importance of      journalists' unlimited speech.       The Senate bill's premise is that there is ``too much''      political speech and some is by undesirable elements (PACs),      so government control is needed to make the nation's      political speech healthier. Our governments cannot balance      their budgets or even suppress the gunfire in America's      (potholed) streets. It would be seemly if politicians would      get on with such basic tasks, rather than with the mischief      of making mincemeat of the First Amendment.                                                                    ____                               American Civil Liberties Union,                                     Washington, DC, June 4, 1992.       Dear Senator:       The American Civil Liberties strongly opposes S.J. Res. 35,      the proposed constitutional amendment to limit federal      campaign expenditures. The proposal would amend the free-     speech guarantee of the First Amendment, as interpreted by      the Supreme Court, thereby limiting the amount of political      speech that may be engaged in by any candidate or by anyone      else seeking to be involved in the political process. It is a      highly flawed proposal, one that is constitutionally      incapable of being fixed, and raises a number of significant      issues. It deserves to be rejected by the Senate.       First, as many members of the Senate recognized during the      debate about the flag-burning amendment proposed a few years      ago, it is wrong for the Senate to consider changing the      First Amendment, a provision that is a justifiable source of      pride for the United States and much admired throughout the      world. If Congress could carve out exceptions to the reach of      free speech through constitutional amendment, particularly in      the important area of political speech, then none of our      liberties and freedoms are safe and proposals to give      Congress authority over other forms of speech will abound.      Moreover, since the Constitution does not grant freedom of      speech to the people, but is a reflection of its Framers'      natural-rights philosophy--one that recognizes that these      rights inhere in the people and are inalienable--it is      unlikely that Congress, even by way of constitutional      amendment, has the authority to interfere with or restrict      those rights. In other words, S.J. Res. 35 may well be an      unconstitutional constitutional proposal.       Second, if the proposed amendment were implemented, it      would operate to distort the political process in numerous      ways. if implemented evenhandedly, it would operate to the      benefit of incumbents who generally have a higher name      recognition and thus an ability to do more with lesser      funding. And it would operate to the detriment of dark-horse      and third-party candidates who start out with fewer      contributors and whose only hope of obtaining the visibility      necessary to run a serious campaign may come from the backing      of a few large contributors or from their own funds. Thus,     rather than assure fair and free elections, the proposal      would likely operate to the benefit of those in power and to      the disadvantage of those challenging the political status        quo.Additionally, the wording of the proposed amendment      would actually permit Congress to set a different limit on      incumbents versus challengers, wealthy candidates versus      those without vast personal funds to mount a campaign, or      candidates from underrepresented groups versus those who are      well represented, as long as these were justified on a      rational basis. The First Amendment properly prevents the      government from making these kinds of distinctions, but S.J.      Res. 35 would enable Congress to set these limitations      notwithstanding currently existing constitutional      understandings. Some of the dangers to the First Amendment      are most apparent when S.J. Res. 35 is viewed from that      perspective.       Finally, as an amendment subsequent to the First Amendment,      the existing understandings about the protections of freedom      of the press would also be changed, thereby empowering      Congress to regulate what newspapers and broadcasters can do      on behalf of       [[Page S2637]] the candidates they endorse or oppose. A      candidate-centered editorial, as well as op-ed articles or      commentary, are certainly expenditures in support of or in      opposition to political candidates. The amendment, as its      words make apparent, would authorize Congress to set      reasonable limits on the involvement of the media in      campaigns when not strictly reporting the news. Such a result      would be intolerable in a society that cherishes a free      press.       Last year, we celebrated the 200th anniversary of the Bill      of Rights with speeches, articles, and lessons about the      importance of our cherished liberties. This year should not      mark the end of that bicentennial legacy by an ill-conceived      effort to cut back on freedom of speech and the press. Please      reject S.J. Res. 35.           Sincerely,                                                   Robert S. Peck,                                              Legislative Counsel.  Mr. McCONNELL.  Let me just say again, hopefully in conclusion, if both sides are ready to yield back their time--I do not know whether they are not, but if they are, I am prepared to, but let me summarize again that this proposal has the opposition of Common Cause, the opposition of the Washington Post, the opposition of the ACLU, and the opposition of George Will. That pretty well covers it, Mr. President. It is opposed by people from left to right.  I hope that the Senate would support the motion to table I will make at such time as we conclude the debate.  So, Mr. President, I would just inquire of my friend from South Carolina, do we want to yield back and go ahead or have we heard from our Cloakrooms?
