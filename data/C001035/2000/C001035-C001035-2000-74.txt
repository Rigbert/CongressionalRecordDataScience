Anyone who had the good fortune to work with him left more hopeful, more committed, more convinced we could all make a difference.  Much is being said about his extraordinary ability to get things done; I would like to talk about how he was able to accomplish so much. Senator Coverdell had many talents, but perhaps the secret to his success was high ability to bring people together. In times of friction, fractiousness, and pressure, he was always the one who remained focused and calm in the eye of the legislative storm.  It was a common for him to hold meetings in his office where conservatives and moderates, strategists and ideologues, listened to each other, shared ideas and figured out not just ways of accomplishing diverse goals, but also what those goals really should be. And his energy and willingness to take on the most difficult task with little public recognition or thanks was legendary.  Senator Coverdell was a man who listened. He listened to Senators and staff and policy experts. He listened to those he agreed with and those he didn't--and merged it all into a comprehensive, concise and workable plan. He respected all individuals with an honesty and sincerity that set the tone for working together.  Most of all, and through it all, Senator Coverdell was kind and gracious in his dealings with everyone. The country, his state, and all of us who have been privileged to know him will miss him terribly. We join in praying for his family as they suffer his loss. We have all lost a very good friend.                          ____________________
