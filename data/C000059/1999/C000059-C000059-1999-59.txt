Speaker, I thank the gentleman for yielding time to me.  Mr. Speaker, I rise today in support of H.R. 472, the Local Census Quality Check Act. My hometown of Corona, California, has been voluntarily working with the Census Bureau to review and compare maps provided by the Census Bureau to ensure accuracy in the 2000 Census count.  Growth in Riverside County, California, has soared in the last decade. From 1991 to 1998 the city of Corona added 36,000 new residents, more than any other community in California's inland empire. An accurate Census count is absolutely vital.  During this review, the city found that additions are not always incorporated in a timely manner by the Census Bureau. Local governments are the best source to verify where residential addresses are located within their boundaries. Therefore, it is critical that cities have the opportunity to review the final addresses.  Mr. Speaker, H.R. 472 is a sound piece of legislation which restores and improves upon a program begun by the Census Bureau. As we work toward enumeration of the 2000 Census, we will continue the implementation of improved methods and ensure all persons are counted.
