 Chairman, the gentleman makes, I think, the key point in this whole debate. If we want a volunteer program, let us develop a volunteer program. But a volunteer program says, we would like you to volunteer. And we create the circumstances.  That is a good idea. If we want people to work, we have got to pay them. I would hope that my Republican friends, who have talked about the virtue of work and how people's self-enhancement and self-esteem goes up with work, would understand that when most people work they expect a paycheck.  I look forward to an amendment from my Republican friends that says, when we get people to work, we are going to pay them so their kids can see them earning a paycheck.
