Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.  Mr. Speaker, I would like to thank the gentlewoman from Guam (Ms. Bordallo) for her very eloquent remarks and my good friend from California (Mr. Lantos). We need a very strong show of support by our colleagues today, Mr. Speaker, on behalf of this resolution. The U.N. committee is meeting as we speak. This issue must be brought so the kind of scrutiny and, I would say, condemnation for these egregious abuses of human rights can be brought to the fore. North Korea has a horrific record on human rights; and it is about time the international community said so in one loud voice: no more.
