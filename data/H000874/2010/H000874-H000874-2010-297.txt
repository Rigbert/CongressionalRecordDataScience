Speaker, for all but 11 minutes of the State of Israel's existence, it has found its foremost advocate and ally here: the United States of America. And what were those 11 minutes? That was the time it took the news of Israel's independence to travel around the world and reach the desk of President Truman, the first to recognize a new member of the world community and a new friend.  Israel, President Truman said, ``has a glorious future before it--not just another sovereign nation, but as an embodiment of the great ideals of our civilization.'' Sixty two years later, as Israel marks its independence, those words have been confirmed time and again. Our alliance with Israel, and the common interests we share, run deep. But even if those common interests amounted to nothing, we would still see in Israel a reflection of deepest values and great ideals.  Sixty two years ago, Israel's founders set their names to a declaration that embodied those ideals--the declaration that ended two millennia of exile for the Jewish people. It read, in part: ``THE STATE OF ISRAEL . . . will be based on freedom, justice and peace as envisaged by the prophets of Israel; it will ensure complete equality of social and political rights to all its inhabitants irrespective of religion, race or sex; it will guarantee freedom of religion, conscience, language, education and culture; it will safeguard the Holy Places of all religions.''  In those words, in the sprit that animates them, and in the political life that strives each day to live by them, we see our own spirit, our own struggle, our own founding promise.  And those common values are at the heart of Congress's unshakeable, bipartisan unity onIsrael and its security. I speak for all of my colleagues, Republicans and Democrats, when I say: the bond between our nations was powerful long before we set foot in this chamber, and it will outlast all of us. In that spirit, Congress must continue to support strong foreign aid for our ally. And we must continue to insist that regimes that threaten Israel's safety, and the world's, recognize Israel's right to exist--and act accordingly.  Few ideas in history have been more daring than the idea that the Jewish people could end generations of exile and build a thriving state, called to the highest principles of justice. Few ideas have been more hopeful, or more demanding. And few are more deserving of the world's sustaining effort.                          ____________________
