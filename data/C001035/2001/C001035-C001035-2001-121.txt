President, I wish to thank the Senator from Virginia for his usual eloquent and gracious remarks. He is a terrific Senator with whom to work. The people of Virginia are very fortunate to have him representing them. He has also been an extremely strong advocate for education his entire time in the Senate. It has been a pleasure to work with him.  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the Senator from Rhode Island, Jack Reed, another very strong advocate for education, be added as a cosponsor of our amendment.
