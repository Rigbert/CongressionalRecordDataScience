Speaker, Clara Barton, a true visionary in American history, once stated: ``I have an almost complete disregard ofprecedent, and a faith in the possibility of something better. It irritates me to be told how things have always been done. I defy the tyranny of precedent. I go for anything new that might improve the past.'' Her motivation as well as her devotion to humanity led Clara Barton to found the American Red Cross in 1881.  Today we celebrate the 121st anniversary of the American Red Cross, which is one of the most renowned charitable organizations in our nation. It is made up of over a million Red Cross volunteers who provide much needed relief services to families, communities and countries around the world in times of crisis.  When unexpected disasters hit, the Red Cross is prepared. For example, the American Red Cross coordinates the collection of blood and ensures that the safest blood is available to save the lives of our armed service members and lives in over 5,000 hospitals across the country.  Internationally, the Red Cross has been active in helping millions of people fight malnutrition and communities gain access to such basic and vital needs as safe drinking water.  Each year, the American Red Cross quickly responds to more than 67,000 disasters, including transportation accidents, house fires, hurricanes, floods, earthquakes, and tornadoes.  One instance of the Red Cross's exemplary and timely response to a disaster was after a lethal tornado tore through my District in Southern Maryland on April 28th. Without delay, the Red Cross was on the scene to provide help after one of the fiercest tornado disasters ever on the East Coast.  Approximately 230 Red Cross volunteers poured in from across the nation to join 100 local volunteers. They worked tirelessly to help community members in their time of need by quickly erecting shelters and administering food, clothing, emergency medication and grief counseling.  As I walked through the streets of La Plata, stepping over the wires, rubble and debris of the once vibrant community, it was evident that there was a lot of work ahead for residents to overcome this tragedy. Fortunately, as a result of help from service organizations like the Red Cross, government officials and agencies, and citizens, it is clear that La Plata will rebuild and come back stronger than ever.  The Charles County Red Cross Chapter is a shining example of the dedication of the Red Cross, and why La Plata will persevere and once again thrive. The same evening that the tornado completely wiped out the Chapter building and all of their resources in La Plata, the Red Cross leaders and volunteers set up a temporary Disaster Operation Center in a vacant store building in Waldorf.  Since 1917, the county's Chapter has been instrumental in providing disaster preparation and care services. The Chapter plans to rebuild, just like the La Plata community will rebuild, and continue to dedicate time and energy to the citizens of La Plata.  The American Red Cross, since it was founded, has been instrumental in relieving the suffering and the saving lives of our local, national and international communities.  And thus it's with great gratitude and honor that I commend the American Red Cross today on its 121st anniversary. On behalf of the citizens of the 5th Congressional District of Maryland, who were affected by this most recent natural disaster, as well as the millions of Americans whose lives have been bettered by this wonderful organization, I wish it only the best in the years to come.                          ____________________
