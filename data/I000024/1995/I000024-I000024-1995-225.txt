At that time they were asked again. Where are the guarantors that are going to join us? At that point, it was not $20 billion, it was $40 billion. I have been fearful, since they had started to come for concurrence from both Houses of Congress and then went ahead and did it by Executive order that perhaps this $20 billion we keep hearing about is in fact closer to $40 billion, part one of the question; part two, I picked up a paper going through Dallas--I believe it was a newspaper in Mexico--characterizing this amount of money as not loan guarantees but foreign aid.  Mr. D'AMATO. I believe the Senator is absolutely correct. It is foreign aid when we become involved in not short-term propping up of the currency for 3 months or 6 months, which was traditionally used, and it is questionable whether or not it was ever intended to prop up foreign currencies. But if you want the argument that it helps us and that it helps our own currency fund, never before have we made a loan under a situation which has gone beyond a year, and in that one case we went the year. That was Mexico; in no other case. Once again, back in 1982 we participated to the extent of $1 billion. We are now talking about $20 billion.  I think the Senator from Oklahoma is absolutely correct. We are not talking about $20 billion. We are talking about $20 billion from the ESF fund, we are talking another $20 billion from the IMF fund, another unsubstantiated participation in the World Bank. We are talking about other economic swaps. We are talking about closer to $40 billion of taxpayers' money to maybe drawn down on.
