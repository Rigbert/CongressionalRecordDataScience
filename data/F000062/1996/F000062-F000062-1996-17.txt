 President, I introduce legislation to strengthen tax incentives to encourage more charitable giving in America. The legislation would represent an important step and encourage greater private sector support of important educational, medical, and other valuable programs in local communities across the country.  Americans are among the most caring in the world, contributing generously to charities in their communities:  American families contribute, on average, nearly $650 per household, or about $130 billion, per year, to charities.  Approximately, three out of every four households give to nonprofit charitable organizations.  However, charities are very concerned for the future, anticipating a decline in Federal social spending to address urgent needs like childrens' services, homelessness, job training, health and welfare, just as the need for help accelerates.  Nonprofit charities are very concerned about their ability to maintain their current level of services, let alone expand to meet the increasing demand for services. While charitable contributions grew by 3.7 percent in 1994, contributions for human services, the area most closely associated with poverty programs, dropped by 6 percent.  Private charities can never replace government programs for national social priorities. However, nonprofit charities across America play a critical role in providing vital services to people in need. The Federal Government needs to take steps to ensure we are doing everything we can to encourage private charitable support to supplement government programs and government support.  The Federal Government needs to take steps to encourage greater private sector support. Government must provide both the leadership and the incentives to encourage more private, charitable giving through the tax code. Analysts believe the gift of closely held business stock is an underutilized source of potential funds for charitable activities that warrants closer attention and legislative remedies.  A closely held business is a corporation, in which stock is issued to a small number shareholders, such as family members, but is not publicly traded on a stock exchange. This business form is very popular for family businesses involving different generations.  However, today, the tax cost of contributing closely-held stock to a charity or foundation can be prohibitively high. The tax burden discourages families and owners from winding down a business and contributing the proceeds to charity. This legislation would permit certain tax-free liquidations of closely held corporations into one or more tax exempt 501(c)(3) organizations.  Under current law, a corporation may have to be liquidated to effectively complete the transfer of assets to the charity for its use, incurring a corporate tax at the Federal rate of 35 percent. In 1986, Congress repealed the ``General Utilities'' doctrine, imposing a corporate level tax on all corporate transfers, including those to tax exempt charitable organizations. Additionally, a charitable organization could also be subject to taxation on its unrelated business income from certain types of donated property.  These tax costs make contributions of closely held stock a costly and ineffective means of transferring resources to charity. If the Federal Government is going to find new ways to encourage charitable giving, we need to look at these tax costs which undercut both the incentive to give and the potential value of any charitable gift.  Governments at the Federal, State, and local level, are reducing spending in all areas of their budgets, including spending for social services. Public charities and private foundations already distribute funds to a diverse and wide ranging group of social support organizations at the community level. Congressional leaders have looked to private charities in our religious institutions, our schools and communities, to fill the void created by government cut-backs. However, volunteers are already hard at work in their communities and charitable funding is already stretched dangerously thin. Charities need added tools to unlock the public's desire to give generously. We need to create appropriate incentives for the private sector to do more.  In California and throughout the country, volunteer and charitable organizations, together, perform vital roles in the community and they deserve our support. Allow me to provide a few examples, which could be repeated in any town across America:  Summer Search: In San Francisco, the Summer Search Foundation is hard at work preventing high school students from dropping out of school. Summer Search helps students not only successfully complete high school but, for 93 percent of the participants, go on to college. By increasing charitable contributions, groups like Summer Search can help keep kids in school and moving forward toward graduation and a more productive contribution to the Nation.  Drew Center For Child Development: Dramatic increases in the number of child abuse and neglect cases, which now total nearly 3 million children in the United States, is deeply troubling for everyone. We must do everything to prevent these cases, but cutbacks in Social Services block grants will impose new burdens on local communities. Charitable support can be a small part of the solution.  Drew Child Development, a child care and development center in the Watts neighborhood of Los Angeles, works directly with children and families involved in child abuse environments. Unfortunately, these 130 families in which the Drew Center supports is not the end of the story. There are thousands of other families that could benefit from this child abuse treatment program if more resources were available.  The Drew Center expects cuts in government funding. They anticipate that they will have to cut counselor positions and turn needy families away. Stronger incentives for private sector giving would provide the Drew Center with some of the resources needed to combat this enormous problem.  The Chrysalis Center: In 1993 I visited the Chrysalis Center, a nonprofit organization in downtown Los Angeles dedicated to helping homeless individuals find and keep jobs. Chrysalis provides employment assistance, from training in job-seeking skills to supervised searches for permanent employment. In 1995, the center helped over 750 people find work, and has helped place more than 3,000 people in permanent, full-time jobs in the last decade.  However, there are still an estimated 15,000 homeless individuals in the Los Angeles area that are able to work. Most of these men and women, however, lack literacy skills and the resources to move from the streets to full-time employment. With increased charitable contributions, Chrysalis would be able to offer hope and opportunity for thousands more.  Today, I introduce tax incentive legislation to encourage stronger support for the Nation's vital charities. The proposal:  Eliminates the corporate tax upon liquidation of a qualifying closely-held corporation under certain circumstances. The legislation would require 80 percent or more of the stock to be bequeathed to a 501(c)(3) tax-exempt organization; and  Clarifies that a charity can receive mortgaged property in a qualified liquidation, without triggering unrelated business income tax for a period of 10 years. This change parallels the exemption from unrelated business income tax provided under current law for direct transfers by gift or bequest.  Under the legislation, the individual donor would receive no tax benefit from the proposal, as the tax savings generated would increase the funds available for the charity.  By eliminating the corporate tax upon liquidation, Congress would encourage additional, and much needed, charitable gifts. Across America, countless thousands have built successful careers and have generated substantial wealth in closely-held corporations. As the individuals age and plan for their estate, we should help them channel their wealth to meet philanthropic goals. Individuals who are willing to make generous bequests of companies and assets, often companies they have spent years building, should not be discouraged by substantially reducing the value of their gifts through Federal taxes.  While the Joint Tax Committee has not yet prepared an official revenue cost, previous estimates suggest a 7-year cost of about $600 million.  However, the revenue estimate represents the expectation of significant transfer to charity as a result of the legislation. By the same techniques used to estimate the tax cost to Treasury, we estimate between $3 and $5 billion in charitable contributions would be stimulated by this tax change. This tax proposal may generate as much as seven times its revenue loss in expanded charitable giving.  The legislation has been endorsed by the Council on Foundations, the umbrella organization for foundations throughout the country, and the Council of Jewish Federations.  I am pleased to add my colleagues Mark Hatfield, of Oregon, Slade Gorton of Washington and Max Baucus, of Montana, as co-sponsors of the legislation. I encourage others to review this legislation and listen to the charitable sectors in your community. During this past year, the proposed legislation went through several different revisions in order to sharpen the bill's focus and target the legislation in the most effective manner. I want to encourage the review process to continue, so we may continue to build support and target the bill's impact for the benefit of the Nation's nonprofit community.  With virtually limitless need, we must look at new ways to encourage and nurture a strong charitable sector. The private sector cannot begin to replace the government role, but if the desire to support charitable activity exists, we should not impose taxes to deplete the value of that support.  Tax laws should encourage, rather than impede, charitable giving. By inhibiting charitable gifts, Federal tax laws hurt those individuals that most need the help of their government and their community.  I request unanimous consent to have the legislation and section-by-section analysis printed in the Record.  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in the Record, as follows:                                S. 2141       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of      the United States of America in Congress assembled,     SECTION 1.
