As if this      weren't tragic enough, the city also has to contend with      needle-exchange opponents attacking a program that has--     through the Whitman Walker Clinic--reduced the spread of HIV      by causing a 29 percent drop in the number of drug      injections.  So we have a terrible scourge of HIV and AIDS right here in the Nation's Capital--seven times the national average. We have a program that tries to convince HIV users, through a needle exchange, to stop it, to go through drug rehab, to end their addiction. And it is successful.  As a result of the program, there was a 29-percent drop in the number of drug injections. The Senator from Georgia--and he is going to withdraw the amendment, in fairness to him--the Senator from Georgia says the best thing we can do is eliminate that program. That is an invitation for more HIV and AIDS and more addiction.  Mr. President, 75 percent of the cases of babies born with HIV are due to the use of dirty needles by either the mother or the father, and 70 percent of the cases of women with HIV are due to their own or their partner's use of contaminated needles.  That is what the debate is all about. It pains me to even talk about this topic. I am not comfortable with it. But I think we have to be honest if we want to deal with public health issues. We should say--and I think it should be a standard--that we will not support a needle exchange program unless it fits two criteria: First, it has a valid public health purpose--and I certainly believe that the elimination or reduction of HIV and AIDS in the District of Columbia is such a valid purpose--and, secondly, it must not encourage addiction to drugs.  There is absolutely no evidence that this program in the District encourages addiction. In fact, just the opposite is true. Those who come to these clinics end up getting in programs where they finally--perhaps after a lifetime of addiction--find themselves drug-free so that their babies can be born drug-free.  I am glad that the Senator from Georgia is going to withdraw this amendment. As difficult as it is to talk about some of these issues, we must face the reality that it is part of our responsibility.  The needle exchange program, which he would have restricted, is supported by many groups that I think have great stature in our country: The American Medical Association, the National Academy of Sciences, the American Academy of Pediatrics, the American Bar Association, the U.S. Conference of Mayors, and many others.  Again, I am happy the Senator is going to withdraw his amendment.  I yield the floor.                      Amendment No. 1222 Withdrawn
