Mr. Speaker, I rise today to express my concern over recent events in Slovakia.  Since coming to office last winter, members of the current ruling coalition in that country have repeatedly sought to limit public discourse, control public debate, and quash public criticism of the government. They have portrayed those who disapprove of the government's policies as enemies of an independent Slovakia, and those who disagree with Prime Minister Meciar are depicted as ``anti-Slovak.'' The media and the right of free expression have been special targets of the current regime.  A few weeks ago, I, along with the co-chairman of the Helsinki Commission, Senator Alfonse D'Amato, and the ranking Members, Representative Steny Hoyer and Senator Frank Lautenberg, sent a letter to Slovak Ambassador Lichardus to express our profound concern regarding this trend. Unfortunately, events since then raise even more questions about the authorities in Bratislava. I would like to mention three specific incidents to illustrate my point:  In late August, the office of Bishop Rudolf Balaz was subjected to an unannounced police search, allegedly in connection with purported illegal antiquities trading. This intrusion came, not coincidentally, after the Bishops Conference described Prime Minister Meciar's efforts to oust President Michal Kovac as destabilizing.  Shortly after that, the President's son, Michal Kovac, Jr. was kidnaped and literally dumped in Austria. Moreover, the investigator charged with looking into this case was removed from this inquiry after announcing that witnesses had been intimidated and there were possible links to the security forces.  Last week, Frantisek Miklosko, the deputy chair of the Christian Democratic Party--who had been in Washington just a few months ago--was beaten up by three thugs in front of his home.  Ironically, Mr. Speaker, as the ruling coalition continues to delay or even reverse the establishment of democratic institutions and market reforms in Slovakia, average Slovak citizens have shown an unprecedented degree of activism: tens of thousands of people have demonstrated in Bratislava this year, 100,000 have signed a petition calling for freedom of speech, and, after Bishop Balaz's office was searched, 3,000 clerics demonstrated to protest government intimidation of Catholic Church officials.  Mr. Speaker, as parliamentarians reconvene in Bratislava for the fall session and once again take up legislation that will define the pace and parameters of Slovakia's democratic transformation, they might do well to look at a chapter from recent Polish history: when 100,000 people--in a country of only 5 million--take to the streets to protest you policies, you should pay attention.                          ____________________
