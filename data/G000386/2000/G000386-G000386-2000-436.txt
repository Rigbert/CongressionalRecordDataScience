m. tomorrow, with Senator Wellstone in control of the first hour. There are other remaining amendments that will be debated and voted on throughout Tuesday's and Wednesday's session of the Senate, with a vote on final passage expected to occur no later than Wednesday. As a reminder, in addition, a cloture motion has been filed on the motion to proceed to the nuclear waste disposal legislation, and that vote will occur following the completion of the bankruptcy bill during Wednesday's session of the Senate.                          ____________________
