 President, I rise to recognize a distinguished doctor and Kentuckian, Dr. Conrad Jones. Dr. Jones has risen to become one of the most admired and applauded physicians in the Bluegrass State, a feat that was recognized at the Murray-Calloway County Hospital in 2007 when they opened their new women's health facility and named it the Conrad Jones Women's Pavilion. As Dr. Jones has contributed to the field of women's health for six decades now, it was a very fitting tribute.  When Dr. Jones was born in 1922, there was not yet the MRI, the ultrasound or the home pregnancy test. Dr. Jones's father, Dr. Cody Jones, was also a physician, and a young Conrad would accompany him on his rounds as a country doctor. The Jones family had come to Kentucky from the Carolinas and Tennessee before the Civil War. Conrad's mother was a school teacher who taught in Hazel and at Murray High School.  Conrad remembers his father worked long, hard hours. His father would have preferred that Conrad become a farmer instead of a doctor, in fact, because a doctor's life was too hard. Luckily for the people of Kentucky, Conrad did not take that particular piece of advice.  Dr. Conrad Jones attended Murray State and then went to medical school at the University of Louisville. After serving his country in uniform, he returned to Murray, KY, to work at what was then the new city-county hospital and its obstetrics unit. He helped patients from the immediate area as well as all over Marshall, Graves and Henry counties.  Dr. Jones has practiced medicine in Murray so long he can tell you the history of how medicine and medical technology has advanced in the area. Dr. Jones certainly keeps up with the technology, and is proud that Murray has what he calls by today's standards state-of-the-art facilities.  I wish to commend Dr. Conrad Jones for his many decades of service to his community. The people of Murray, Calloway County and Kentucky are lucky to have him. I know my colleagues join me when I say this U.S. Senate is grateful to him and his family for all he has contributed to make ours a stronger country.  The Murray-Calloway County Chamber of Commerce published a 2008 Viewbook that contained an illuminating article detailing Dr. Conrad Jones's life and career. I ask unanimous consent that the article be printed in the Record.  There being no objection, the article was ordered to be printed, as follows:  [From the Murray-Calloway County Chamber of Commerce 2008 Viewbook]               Murray's Conrad Jones: A Life in Medicine                        (By Robert A. Valentine)       In February 2007, the Murray-Calloway County Hospital      opened a state-of-the-art facility dedicated to women's      health. Almost everyone there recognized the appropriate name      of the new facility: The Conrad Jones Women's Pavilion. Dr.      Conrad Jones, who had already witnessed six decades of      progress in women's health, was looking on in a state of      near-speechless humility.       He was born long before the MRI, the ultrasound or even the      home pregnancy test. Most women had yet to vote in their      first presidential election, and all but a very, very few      babies were born at home. It was a warm October in 1922.       ``My father wanted me to be a farmer because a physician's      life was hard,'' Dr. Jones told us in an interview in his      offices at the Murray Woman's Clinic. He was attracted to the      life of the country doctor, despite its perils and long, hard      hours. ``Work in the tobacco fields made me know that I      didn't want that.''       After Murray State, he entered medical school at the      University of Louisville. Following that, he went directly      into the service. ``There were few specialists there,'' he      remembers. ``You did whatever was necessary for the      patient.''       He returned to Murray after the service. By that time, the      new city-county hospital had come into being with an      obstetrics unit on the second floor of the northwest wing.      ``It was pretty crude by today's standards,'' he remembers,      ``But it was probably the best OB unit for several counties      around. We did about as many deliveries then as we do now,''      Dr. Jones observed, because many patients came from Marshall,      Graves and Henry counties.       ``Murray has always been a very progressive community in      terms of technology'' he reminded us. ``By today's standards,      what we have now is the state-of-the-art. This should serve      us well for several years.''       We asked Conrad Jones how long he has been in Murray. With      a broad smile, he answered, ``Always.'' That makes him the      ideal source of information on changes in women's healthcare      over the years. We also asked about the most important      changes during his career.       ``Today there are far more caesarian sections being      performed. In the '50s and '60s, if your section rate got      above 5 or 6 percent, it was uncommon. Now, we see 23 to 30      percent. Surgery is much safer now, and we have better      tracking technology, so you can tell how the fetus is under      stress. Fetal monitors were a major step forward by in the      late '60s and early '70s.''       Modern techniques make it much safer for the mother.      ``Anesthesia is also another big change. Not too many years      back, the only anesthesia was the `saddle block' (a procedure      which cuts off sensation in the pelvic region) or nitrous      oxide. Now, the epidural has replaced that.''       But the main change is the technology and the facility. The      custom of hospital instead of home deliveries has drastically      reduced the infant mortality rate. Only two generations ago,      maternal and infant mortality was all too common. ``The      mothers of today have no idea how dangerous childbirth used      to be,'' he recalls with a serious look.       And women are presenting more challenges. Today, there are      more career or professional women, and more women remain in      the workforce longer. ``The age at which women start families      is higher, and I don't know what affect that's going to have      on the family. But we know that, as a mother ages, there is a      greater risk to her and to the child. However, medicine is      keeping pace, I think, so it's safer.'' He points with pride      to the work of his associates in fertility treatments and in      the new outpatient, non-invasive surgeries for incontinence      hysterectomies, and non-surgical permanent birth control.      ``Fifty years ago, that would have seemed like a miracle,''      he says.                  the role of women in murray medicine       In the future, he expects to see more women entering      medicine, and he welcomes it. ``We had two women in my      medical school class of 100; now about half of the classes      are women. It's a growing thing, and very important. Most of      the pediatricians in Murray are women, and there are two top-     notch internists. We have Dr. Deeter and Dr. Burnett in our      practice (Murray Woman's Clinic) and three outstanding nurse-     practitioners, and that is very important to good, modern      family care.''       After so many sleepless nights and the constant drive to      remain ``current'' in technology and practice, we had to ask      if he would still choose medicine as a career if he were      starting over, today. ``Most emphatically, yes! The hours are      very difficult, but you get so much joy out of helping      others. It's a very happy, joyous experience; you are helping      people at a vital time in their lives.''       And what would he tell someone starting out in medicine      today? ``Well,'' he smiled, and leaned over his desk,      ``You've got to have a good partner--and that's my wife. She      was with me all the way; when I was gone all night, she had      to be alone. We couldn't take vacations as other folks might,      and maybe we missed a lot of things. She has been a real      trooper; without her, I couldn't have done it.''       Would he change anything about his career? ``Not a bit,''      he smiled. After all, it has been not merely a career so much      as it is a life in medicine.                          ____________________
