President. I thank my colleague from the Commonwealth of Massachusetts for his statement.  Those who are following this debate--my colleagues and those in the audience--should know this is a historic moment in the Senate. It is rare that Members of the Senate are given an opportunity to review a Justice to the Supreme Court. It has been 11 years. Recently, we have had two. Chief Justice John Roberts came before the Senate, and today we consider the nomination of Judge Sam Alito to fill the vacancy of Sandra Day O'Connor on the Supreme Court.  I take this very seriously. As Senator Kennedy said yesterday in another meeting: Next to a vote on war, there is nothing more serious than this decision.
