President, it is with a mixture of pride and sadness that I recognize the life of a friend, Francis ``Fran'' Voigt, the cofounder of the New England Culinary Institute of Montpelier, VT. Fran passed away in May, leaving a strong legacy and many family and friends.  Fran Voigt was an innovator, who originally came to Vermont to teach at Goddard College. In 1969, he came to Vermont with his wife, poet Ellen Bryant Voigt, who would later serve as Vermont's poet laureate. He was part of a faculty and staff at Goddard that changed the culture of central Vermont. While at Goddard, Fran developed programs in many fields, including social ecology and art therapy. Fran believed in hands-on education, both at Goddard and later at the New England Culinary Institute, known locally as NECI, which he cofounded in 1980.  The New England Culinary Institute, which began in the basement of Montpelier's Capitol Plaza Hotel and Conference Center, grew quickly and garnered national attention. Fran and NECI were soon at the forefront of ourcountry's progressive culinary education movement and were recognized by President Bill Clinton as first runner-up for the Nation's small business of the year in 1994. In 2000, Fran was named Vermont Citizen of the Year by the Vermont Chamber of Commerce.  Vermont's culinary landscape was forever changed by the New England Culinary Institute, as its students opened and worked at restaurants throughout the State.  In memory of Fran Voigt, I ask unanimous consent that the article by Stephen Mills in the May 22 edition of the Barre Montpelier Times Argus, ``NECI founder revered for student model,'' be printed in the Record.  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in the Record, as follows:         [From the Barre Montpelier Times Argus, May 22, 2018]                 NECI Founder Revered for Student Model                           (By Stephen Mills)       Montpelier.--The Capital City reacted to news of the death      of Fran Voigt, co-founder of the New England Culinary      Institute, who died at his Cabot home Monday. He was 78.       Voigt and co-founder John Dranow, and their wives, Ellen      Bryant Voigt and Louise Gluck, respectively met at Goddard      College and started the legendary cooking school with seven      students in the basement of the Capitol Plaza Hotel &      Conference Center on State Street in 1980.       At the height of its success, the business was honored in      1994 by former President Bill Clinton as first runner-up for      the nation's small business of the year. It boasted a high of      800 students, and a number of academic offerings and outlets      that still include the flagship NECI on Main restaurant and      La Brioche bakery and cafe, and food service at National Life      and the cafeteria at Vermont College of Fine Arts, all in      Montpelier. Other operations, included a second campus in      Essex and NECI Commons, a restaurant on Church Street in      Burlington, which were discontinued. More recent contracts      included a $200,000 contract to train cooks for the U.S.      Coast Guard and a three-year contract to design and deliver a      training program for culinary staff at Sandals resorts in the      Caribbean. But NECI also was at the center of a protracted      legal dispute in 1999 that landed in the Vermont Supreme      Court after Voigt and the wives had a falling out with Dranow      who was ousted, and sued but finally settled. NECI is now run      by Milan Milasinovic, who is also president of Virginia Marti      College of Art and Design in Ohio and merged the two schools      last June after Voigt stepped down as president in January      2017. It has about 200 students. Voigt's daughter, Dudley,      said there would be no public service, but the family hoped      to hold a memorial service later.       ``We would just say that he died at home after a long      illness,'' she said.       ``We feel that we're very proud of NECI,'' Dudley Voigt      said. ``We watched him build it, and it was a unique      coalescing of all of his talents and gifts and curiosities.''       According to an obituary provided by the family to be      published in The Times Argus, Francis George Wilheim Voigt      was born in in Oskaloosa, Iowa, March 27, 1940, after his      parents emigrated from Germany. He graduated from Wesleyan      University in 1962 and earned a graduate degree in political      theory from the University of Iowa where he met his wife,      Ellen Bryant Voigt. The couple came to central Vermont as      educational idealists in 1969. Fran Voigt accepted a teaching      position at Goddard College and developed some of the skills      he used to build the hands-on education that became the model      for NECI where students started in the kitchen in the      classroom and the student-teacher ratio was 7-1. The NECI      motto was: ``Learning by doing.''       In addition to his lifelong work at NECI, Voigt was also an      active member of the Vermont Business Roundtable, Rotary      International, the Cabot School and the Vermont Chamber of      Commerce, which named him Vermont Citizen of the Year in      2000. He was also recognized in the community for his      signature bow ties and antique Citroens.       Milan Milasinovic credited Voigt with visionary leadership      and commitment to the NECI model of culinary arts and being a      mentor to all at the school.       ``He became a dear friend of mine in the last couple of      years of his life,'' he said. ``It's a huge loss. He was our      founding father and he made NECI very innovative and a force      as a culinary school in the United States. It's all because      of his entrepreneurial spirit. I'm sure the people at NECI      will miss him greatly. We loved this man a lot.''       U.S. Sen. Patrick Leahy credited Voigt with being ``at the      forefront of the progressive culinary education movement      nationally,'' and said the Vermont food scene would not be      what it is today without Voigt's contribution and leadership.       ``His vision, hard work and dedication in founding and      continually reinventing NECI leaves a lasting legacy that      extends well beyond Vermont,'' Leahy said. ``He helped give      expression to Vermont's tradition of quality, taste and      excellence. Vermont's culinary landscape owes a significant      debt to his vision, and so do the communities that were      nourished, enriched and enlivened by those trained under his      leadership.''       Montpelier Mayor Anne Watson added: ``Fran Voigt made      substantial cultural contributions to Montpelier, and I'm      certainly saddened to have lost him. We send our condolences      to his family.''       The family has requested that in lieu of flowers, donations      be made in Voigt's name to the NECI scholarship fund or to      the Vermont Foodbank.                          ____________________
