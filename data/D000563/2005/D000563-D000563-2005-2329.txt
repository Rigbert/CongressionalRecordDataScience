President, I rise today in support of the nomination of Governor Mike Johanns as the Secretary of Agriculture. As the Governor of Nebraska, and a fellow Midwesterner, Johanns has a strong background in agriculture and is well suited for the role of Secretary of Agriculture.  I was able to meet with Governor Johanns yesterday and I was very impressed with his view on the future of agriculture, food safety and rural issues.
