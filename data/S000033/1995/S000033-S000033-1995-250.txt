  What Mr. DeFazio is talking about is that in the early 1980s, if my memory is correct, a majority of the major corporations in America paid zero, not a penny in taxes, and, as Mr. DeFazio indicates, some of them actually got a credit. That is how absurd and corrupt the tax system was.  Well, both the Democrats and the Republicans became a little bit embarassed by this scandalous situation where we have working people making $20- or $30,000 a year paying more in taxes than all of AT&T and General Electric and the other large corporations.                              {time}  2030  So what they passed in 1986 was called the minimum corporate tax. Basically, what that said, it said large multinational corporations with all of your fancy lawyers and your tax accountants and everybody else, after you go through all of the tax loopholes and after you avoid paying taxes on this, that and the other thing and you end up with zero, well, guess what, we think you should at least pay a minimal tax, a minimal tax. And that is what was passed in 1986, mandating the corporations at least paid something.  What Mr. DeFazio is describing is that yesterday, as part of the Republican tax bill, that minimal corporate tax was repealed, and we are rapidly moving back to the time when the largest corporations in America will pay zero in taxes.  Now, some people will say, well, so what? So what does it matter that AT&T and General Electric and duPont and all these corporations do not pay anything in taxes? What does it have to do with me?  Mr. DeFazio, what does it have to do with the average working person?  Mr. DeFazio. Well, if it gets as bad as it did in the 1980', working people will pay taxes in order to give tax credits to corporations that did not pay any taxes at all, which they then passed through to their shareholders who are also hiring the same accountants to avoid taxes and now will be allowed with the new 14-percent tax bracket for capital gains or 18 percent established by the Republican bill, will be able to pay a lower rate of taxes than someone earning $25,000 or $30,000 a year through the capital gains loophole.  So what we are doing is asking people who are struggling to make ends meet, people who are struggling to figure out desperately some way to save a few bucks for their kids' education or just for their clothes are going to be asked to send money to the Federal Government so it can be handed back to large, profitable corporations so they can distribute it to shareholders who will not pay very much tax on it.
