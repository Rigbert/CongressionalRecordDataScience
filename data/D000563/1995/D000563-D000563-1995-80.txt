Chairman, as a cosponsor I rise in support of the Dellums-Kasich amendment. There are only three problems with the B-2 bomber. First, it does not work. It cannot tell the difference between a rain cloud and a mountain. Second, it costs a fortune, $2.2 billion per airplane. Third, we do not need it. What we have been told by the Pentagon, the people who beg us for military expenditures, is do not put any more money into this airplane, we do not need it, and yet today we find that the wind beneath the wings of the B-2 bomber is not national security, it is the clout of defense contractors which stand to bank billions of dollars if Congress will approve this unnecessary boondoggle.  Mr. Chairman, at a time when this Congress is cutting Medicare, Medicaid, education, and health care, it is unconscionable that we would spend up to $30 billion for an airplane that does not work, that costs $2.2 billion a copy, and one that military experts tell us is totally unnecessary.
