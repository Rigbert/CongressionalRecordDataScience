Chairman, I yield myself such time as I may consume.  Mr. Chairman, for the information of the Members, it appears, because of the leadership on the majority side's desire to move toward a decision on the issue regarding the audit report tonight, that we would like to conclude this debate tonight and resume tomorrow morning, so that it would be our intention not to further debate this issue tonight. That is my understanding; that is the chairman's intention as well. Quite obviously, we are waiting for our leaderships to get here because they want to get to that issue, and I know their interest is to get Members out in a timely fashion this evening. We are prepared to do that. I have discussed that with the chairman. They are not here at this point in time. I presume they will be here shortly.
