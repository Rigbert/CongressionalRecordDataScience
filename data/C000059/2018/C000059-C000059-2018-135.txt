Speaker, I rise today to honor and pay tribute to former California State Senator and Riverside County icon Robert B. Presley, who passed away on Saturday, September 22, 2018. Bob served the people of California and Riverside County in many ways throughout his life and he will be deeply missed.  Bob was born in Tahlequah, Oklahoma, to Doyle and Ann Presley, on December 4, 1924. He joined the U.S. Army at the age of 18 and was awarded the Bronze Star for heroic achievement in action while serving with the Fifth Army in Italy during World War II. After attending college at Riverside Community College and the University of California, Riverside, Bob joined the Riverside County Sheriff's Department, where he would have a 24-year career. Early in his career at the Sheriff's Department, Presley was known as Riverside County's top homicide investigator. In the second half of his career with the department, Bob served as Riverside County Undersheriff to long-time Sheriff Ben Clark.  Following his law enforcement career, Bob entered the world of politics and was elected to the State Senate in 1974, where he served as a Democrat representing both Riverside and San Bernardino Counties until 1994. Over the years, Bob worked on many different pieces of legislation and helped fund a number of important programs and projects as the Chairman of the California Senate Appropriations Committee. Bob was an especially impactful advocate for the environment, prison expansion and reform, and victims of domestic violence. Thanks to Bob's efforts, the state established the first shelters to protect battered women and children. After retiring from thelegislature, Bob was appointed to serve as Chair of the State Parole Board by Republican Governor Pete Wilson and, later, to serve as Secretary of Youth and Adult Corrections by Democratic Governor Gray Davis.  Senator Presley was predeceased by his first wife, Ahni Ratliff Presley. He is survived by his second wife, Susan Foreman Presley; his three adult children; Robert Presley, Jr., Donna Danielson, and Marilyn Raphael; and numerous grandchildren and great grandchildren. I want to extend my heartfelt condolences to the Presley family, his friends, and everyone who had the pleasure of knowing him. Although Bob may be gone, the many life-changing contributions he made in Riverside County will have a lasting impact.                          ____________________
