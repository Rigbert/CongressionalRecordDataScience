I have mentioned a number of courts of appeals judges were heard out of order at the request of Republican Senators, and I am sure if some of those same Senators were then to speak of the fact that some of the judges, their own nominees especially, were heard ahead of others, that they would see delicious irony in that.  I know we are supposed to recess. I yield the floor.                     nomination of michael baylson
