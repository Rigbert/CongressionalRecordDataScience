Chairman, the gentleman from Nebraska [Mr. Bereuter] has really shown us some leadership. This is an innovative approach to providing housing with limited exposure for Federal taxpayers and maximum investment in good housing for people living in rural areas. We were glad to support him last year. I am sorry the authorization did not go through, and I am happy to support him again this year.
