 President, I am pleased that the Senate has passed H.R. 956, the Drug Free Communities Act of 1997, today. Earlier this month, this same bill was approved by a vote of 420 to 1 in the other body. As you know, I, along with 18 of my colleagues, introduced a companion version of this legislation in the Senateearlier this year. By the close of business today, this legislation has garnered a total of 29 cosponsors.  Mr. President, this is an outstanding show of support for this important piece of legislation. When each of us return home over recess, we meet with the people that we represent. We listen to their problems, and we listen to their solutions. And when we talk about drugs, and talk about what can be done to keep our kids from using drugs, it always comes back to the community. What matters most is what parents, schools, churches, law enforcement, community groups, and businesses do, working together, to keep our kids drug free.  This legislation will support these efforts. It will allow communities with established coalitions, coalitions that have a proven track record, to receive matching funds to support their efforts. It will provide additional resources in the hands of those who make a difference; people that our children respect and listen to: parents. Placing resources at the community level allows parents, teachers, community, and religious leaders to use these funds to make a difference in the lives of our children, our future.  I want to thank my colleagues and co-sponsors on both sides of the aisle. I particularly want to thank Senator Daschle, Senator DeWine, Senator Biden, and Senator Hatch and many others for their support and efforts in moving this legislation.                          ____________________
