President, today, along with my colleague Senator Whitehouse, I am introducing the Rhode Island Fishermen's Fairness Act of 2011.  For nearly a decade, I have worked to correct a serious flaw in our fisheries management system, which denies the fishermen of my state a voice in the management of many of the stocks that they catch and rely upon for their livelihoods.  The Magnuson-Stevens Fishery Conservation and Management Act established eight regional fishery management councils to give fishermen and other stakeholders the leading role in developing the fishery management plans for federally regulated species. As such, the councils have enormous significance on the lives and livelihoods of fishermen. To ensure equitable representation, the statute sets out the states from which appointees are to be drawn for each council.  Under the Magnuson-Stevens Act, the State of Rhode Island was granted voting membership on the New England Fishery Management Council, NEFMC, as NEFMC-managed stocks represent a significant percentage of landings and revenue for the State. However, while Rhode Island has an even larger stake in the Mid-Atlantic fishery it does not have voting representation on the Mid-Atlantic Fishery Management Council, MAFMC, which currently consists of representatives from New York, New Jersey, Delaware, Pennsylvania, Maryland, Virginia, and North Carolina.  Rhode Island's stake in the Mid-Atlantic fishery is hardly incidental. According to National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration, NOAA, data, Rhode Island accounts for approximately a quarter of the catch from this fishery, and its landings are greater than the combined total of landings for the States of New York, Delaware, Pennsylvania, Maryland, Virginia, and North Carolina. In act, only one State, New Jersey, lands more MAFMC regulated species than Rhode Island.  This legislation offers a simple solution. Following current practice, the Rhode Island Fishermen's Fairness Act would create two seats on the MAFMC for Rhode Island: one seat appointed by the Secretary of Commerce based on recommendations from the Governor of Rhode Island, and a second seat filled by Rhode Island's principal state official with marine fishery management responsibility. To accommodate these new members, the MAFMC would increase in size from 21 voting members to 23.  Pursuant to a provision included in the Magnuson-Stevens Reauthorization Act of 2006 at my request, the MAFMC reported to Congress on this issue in 2007 and confirmed that there is a precedent for this proposal. As the report notes, North Carolina's representatives in Congress succeeded in adding that State to the MAFMC through an amendment to the Sustainable Fisheries Act in 1996. Like Rhode Island, a significant proportion of North Carolina's landed fish species were managed by the MAFMC, yet the State had no vote on the council.  With mounting economic, ecological, and regulatory challenges, it is more important than ever that Rhode Island's fishermen have a voice in the management of the fisheries they depend on. I look forward to working with Senator Whitehouse and my other colleagues to restore a measure of equity to the fisheries management process by passing the Rhode Island Fishermen's Fairness Act.  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be printed in the Record.  There being no objection, the text of the bill was ordered to be printed in the Record, as follows:                                S. 1371       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of      the United States of America in Congress assembled,     SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.       This Act may be cited as the ``Rhode Island Fishermen's      Fairness Act''.     SEC. 2. FINDINGS.       The findings are as follows:       (1) Rhode Island fishermen participate in fisheries managed      by the New England Fishery Management Council (NEFMC) and the      Mid-Atlantic Fishery Management Council (MAFMC).       (2) Rhode Island currently has voting membership on the      NEFMC under the Magnuson-Stevens Fishery Conservation and      Management Act but does not have voting membership on the      MAFMC.       (3) Rhode Island lands more MAFMC-managed stocks than any      other MAFMC member except the State of New Jersey.       (4) A higher percentage of Rhode Island's commercial      landings (by weight or value) traditionally have come from      species that are managed by the MAFMC as compared to species      managed by NEFMC.       (5) MAFMC has found that Rhode Island's circumstance      parallels that of Florida and North Carolina, which each have      voting membership on two different fishery management      councils.     SEC. 3. ADDITION OF RHODE ISLAND TO THE MID-ATLANTIC FISHERY                    MANAGEMENT COUNCIL.       Section 302(a)(1)(B) of the Magnuson-Stevens Fishery      Conservation and Management Act (16 U.S.C. 1852(a)(1)(B)) is      amended--       (1) by inserting ``Rhode Island,'' after ``States of'';       (2) by inserting ``Rhode Island,'' after ``except North      Carolina,'';       (3) by striking ``21'' and inserting ``23''; and       (4) by striking ``13'' and inserting ``14''.                                 ______                                       By
