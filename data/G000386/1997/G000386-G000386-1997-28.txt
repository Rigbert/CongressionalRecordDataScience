 President, on behalf of Senator Breaux and myself, I am introducing legislation today to require the use of universal product numbers [UPNs] for all durable medical equipment [DME] Medicare purchases. The purpose of this legislation is to improve the Health Care Financing Administration's [HCFA] ability to track and to appropriately assess the value of the durable medical equipment it pays for under the Medicare Program. Very simply, our bill will ensure Medicare gets what it pays for.  According to an interim report by the General Accounting Office [GAO] and the Office of Inspector General's review of billing practices for specific medical supplies, the Medicare program is often paying greater than the market price for durable medical equipment and Medicare beneficiaries are not receiving the quality of care they should. HCFA currently does not require DME suppliers to identify specific products on their Medicare claims. Therefore it does not know for which products it is paying. HCFA's billing codes often cover a broad range of products of various types, qualities and market prices. For example, the GAO found that one Medicare billing code is used by the industry for more than 200 different urological catheters, with many of these products varying significantly in price, use, and quality.  Medicare's inability to accurately track and price medical equipment and supplies it purchases could be remedied with the use of product specific codes known as bar codes or universal product numbers [UPN's]. These codes are similar to the codes you see on products you purchase at the grocery store. Use of such bar codes is already being required by the Department of Defense and several large private sector purchasing groups. The industry strongly supports such an initiative as well. I am submitting several letters of endorsement for the record on behalf of the National Association of Medical Equipment Services and the Health Industry Distributors Association.  This bill represents a common-sense approach. It will improve the way Medicare monitors and reimburses suppliers for medical equipment and supplies. Patients will receive better care. And the Federal Government will save money. I ask that my colleagues on both sides of the aisle support this legislation which I am introducing today with my friend and colleague, Senator Breaux.  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that additional material be printed in the Record.  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in the Record, as follows:                                S. 1362       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of      the United States of America in Congress assembled,     SECTION 1.

Hon. Charles Grassley,     Chairman, Special Committee on Aging,     U.S. Senate, Washington, DC.       Dear Senator Grassley: On behalf of the Health Industry      Distributors Association (HIDA), I would like to applaud your      support for the use of universal product number (UPNs) on      Medical billings. HIDA is the national trade association of      home care companies and medical products distribution firms.      Created in 1902, HIDA represents over 600 companies with      appropriately 2500 locations nationwide. HIDA Members provide      value-added distribution services to virtually every      hospital, physician's office, nursing facility, clinic, and      other health care cities across the country, as well as to a      growing number of home care patients.       HIDA has long supported the use of UPN's for medical      products and supplies. UPNs provide a standard format for      identifying each individual product. UPNs are a major      enabling factor in the health industry's efforts to minimize      fraudulent billings and automate the distribution process.      The Department of Defense (DOD) has taken a leadership      position in promoting the implementation of the industry      standards of UPNs. As a part of their decision to use      commercial medical products distributors, the DOD has      mandated the use UPNs for all medical/surgical products      delivered to DOD facilities.       HIDA believes that the Medicare Program could benefit      greatly from the use of UPNs. By cross-referencing each UPN      with the HCFA Common Procedure Coding System (HCPCS) and      requiring the UPN on each claim for durable medical      equipment, prosthetics, orthotics and supplies (DMEPOS),      Medicare's ability to track utilization and combat fraud and      abuse would be greatly enhanced. By using UPNs, the Medicare      system would be able to correctly identify product      utilization. As UPNs provide a unique, unambiguous means of      identifying each item of DMEPOS on the market, Medicare would      have a record of the exact product used by the beneficiary.      Trends in product utilization and claims for ``suspicious''      items would be easily identifiable. HCPCS alone can not      provide this information as many products of varying quality      and cost are included in a single code.       In addition, problems with ``upcoding'' could be greatly      reduced through the implementation of UPNs. Upcoding occurs      when a beneficiary receives a product of lesser cost/quality      than the HCPCS billed to Medicare. UPNs would correctly      identify the specific item of DMEPOS, thereby making it      impossible to misrepresent the cost and quality of the item.      Importantly, by addressing the problem of upcoding, the      Medicare Program would take great steps in assuring that      beneficiaries receive the exact items of DMEPOS that they      were intended to receive.       HIDA firmly believes that the Medicare Program and DMEPOS      industry would benefit greatly from the use of UPNs. This      standard would not only increase Medicare's understanding of      what it pays for, but also assist in the effective      administration of the Program. If HIDA can provide any      further information or be of any assistance, please contact      Ms. Erin H. Bush, Associate Director of Government Relations      at (703) 838-6110.       Again, thank you for your interest in this important      matter.           Sincerely.                                         Cara C. Bachenheimer,                                 Executive Director, Home Care and     Long Term Care Market Groups.                                                                    ____                                          National Association for                                   Medical Equipment Services,                                 Alexandria, VA, November 3, 1997.     Hon. Charles Grassley,     U.S. Senate, Special Committee on Aging.     Hon. John Breaux,     U.S. Senate, Special Committee on Aging.       Dear Senators Grassley and Breaux: The National Association      for Medical Equipment Services appreciates your October 27      letter requesting comment on your draft bill concerning use      of uniform product number on home medical equipment. On      behalf of our 1,200 member companies, NAMES is pleased to      endorse this bill. We look forward to working with you as it      proceeds through the legislative process. And, once enacted,      we would hope the Administration would work with the industry      to implement this law appropriately.           Sincerely,                                         William D. Coughlan, CAE,                            President and Chief Executive Officer.                                 ______                                       By Mr. McCAIN (for himself and Mr. Levin):  S. 1364. A bill to eliminate unnecessary and wasteful Federal reports; to the Committee on Governmental Affairs.              THE FEDERAL REPORTS ELIMINATION ACT OF 1997  Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, I am pleased to rise today to introduce legislation that would eliminate approximately 150 unnecessary reports that have been mandated by the Congress. All of these reports have been judged as unnecessary, wasteful, or redundant by each of the Federal agencies which have been required to produce them. I am also pleased to have the considerable assistance of the coauthor of this legislation, Senator Levin.  This proposal is intended to combat the growing problem of the thousands of mandatory reports that Congress has been imposing upon the executive branch over the last decade. Each year, Members of Congress continue to burden the executive branch agencies by mandating numerous reports. The price for the wasteful reports is extraordinarily high. Not only do they cost American taxpayers hundreds of millions of dollars each year, but they exhaust the often limited resources of the Federal agencies which have to meet these reporting requirements. Furthermore, the thousands of Federal employees who must work for months on these unnecessary reports could focus their energies to work on far more worthy ventures on behalf of taxpayers. They are a dubious use of taxpayers dollars and Government productivity.  Senator Levin and I began working on various aspects of eliminating and sunsetting unnecessary Federal reportsin 1993. We have both been long concerned about the vast amounts of public funds and valuable government personnel resources that are being wasted. Let me state just one instructive example of how reporting mandates drain public funds and departmental resources. The Department of Agriculture alone spent over $40 million in taxpayers money in 1993 to produce the 280 reports it was required to submit to the Congress that year. While many of these reports may provide vital information to the Congress and the public, it is undeniable that many others can and should be repealed in order to save taxpayer dollars and staff time. This is true for virtually every agency of the Federal Government.  In 1995, Senator Levin and I were able to successfully eliminate approximately 200 reports, and sunset several hundred others. However, since that time, the administration has highlighted 450 additional reports that they would like repealed. Here are a few examples of the type of reports I am talking about. Each year, the following are required to be sent to the Congress from Federal agencies: Report on the Elimination of Notice to Congress Regarding Waiver of Requirement for Use of Vegetable Ink in Lithographic Printing; Report on Canadian Acid Rain Control Program; and Report on Metal Casting Research and Development Activities.  I have asked OMB to calculate the total amount of public funds we would save if the unnecessary or redundant reporting requirements contained in this legislation are repealed, and I will provide my colleagues with their response. Considering that we currently have over a $5 trillion dollar Federal deficit, Mr. President, I'm sure that you would agree that our citizens would not support this egregious expenditure of hundreds of useless reports each and every year.  It is important to note that this reporting mandate problem continues to grow with each passing year. GAO determined several years ago that ``Congress imposes about 300 new requirements on Federal agencies each year.'' Prompt Senate action to authorize the elimination of wasteful reports in this proposal will be an important service to our constituents and these agencies. The staffing burdens and paper shuffling these outdated reporting mandates cause are of little real value to the important work of government. We should lighten the load of both overburdened taxpayers and the agencies involved by ending them now.  I would again like to thank Senator Levin for his hard work and dedication on this issue over the past few years. Furthermore, I must acknowledge the administration for its earnest support of this effort. Additionally, the proposed terminations were carefully reviewed and then approved by each respective committee chairman and ranking member. These reports represent the flagrant waste of taxpayers dollars and Government productivity.  It is clear that this bipartisan effort will put an end to a significant part of the unnecessary cycle of waste and misspent resources that these reports represent. The adoption of this legislation would be a strong contribution toward downsizing Government as the American people have repeatedly called upon us to do. I urge my colleagues to support this legislation and remove the millstone of unnecessary and costly paperwork that Congress has hung around the neck of the Federal Government for too long.
