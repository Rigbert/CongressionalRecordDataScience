President, I would like to take a moment to commend the University of Vermont for its close relationship with the Peace Corps. This year, UVM ranked fifth in the Nation among midsized colleges and universities that are the top producers of Peace Corps volunteers. I am proud of the 42 UVM alumni currently serving in the Peace Corps around the world.  UVM has highlighted Eric Smith as one of its current alumni volunteers. Eric, who is stationed in Costa Rica, is applying his business degree by teaching microfinance and helping young women develop small businesses. He says that such efforts ``would not have been possible without my education at UVM.''  Like Eric, all of the UVM volunteers have devoted 2 years to promoting cultural understanding and improving the lives of people in countries such as Cambodia, El Salvador, Tanzania, and Uganda. Some are employing innovative teaching methods to inspire young people. Some work on small farms, increasing food production in rural villages. Others help provide safe drinking water or combat the HIV/AIDS pandemic. Yet all of the UVM volunteers display an admirable commitment to civic engagement with the dream of building a better world.  This dream is emblematic of the Vermont spirit. For the second year in a row, in 2011 our State produced the most Peace Corps volunteers per capita in the Nation. The Upper Valley region of Vermont ranks eighth in the Nation among metropolitan areas whose citizens are serving in the Peace Corps. In 2010, the Burlington area ranked second in the same category.  As the Peace Corps continues its 50th year of building understanding between Americans and the citizens of other countries, I want to applaud the contributions of Vermonters and the University of Vermont. These volunteers deserve our appreciation and support.  I ask unanimous consent that a January 25, 2012, Burlington Free Press article entitled ``UVM ranks 5th in producing Peace Corps vols.'' be printed in the Record.  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in the Record, as follows:            [From the Burlington Free Press, Jan. 25, 2012]            UVM Ranks 5th in Producing Peace Corps Volumes.                       (By the Associated Press)       Burlington.--The Peace Corps says the University of Vermont      ranks fifth in the country in the number of former students      who are serving as volunteers overseas.       The rankings of medium sized universities released Tuesday      show that 42 UVM alumni are serving overseas. The figure is      up eight over last year and it moved the school from 13th to      fifth.       The Vermont alumni work across the globe in programs that      include agriculture, education, environment, health and      business and youth development.       The top producing medium sized college or university is The      George Washington University.       The overall top producing school is the University of      Colorado at Boulder.                          ____________________
