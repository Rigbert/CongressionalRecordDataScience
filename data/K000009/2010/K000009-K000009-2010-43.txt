Speaker, in each of the last 14 years, Ohio has set a record for the number of foreclosures, and this year is on track to be no exception. Every year a new record. That is hard to imagine, and not what I want to say about my home State.  Over the last 2 years, Congress has passed what I call hollow legislation that looks like it might stem the tide of foreclosures, but clearly the programs were not intended to work. Then, next, Treasury decided to make homes affordable, they say, by using some of the TARP bailout money, the Troubled Asset Relief Program that was passed back in the fall of 2008 to bail out the Wall Street speculative banks. According to The Wall Street Journal last week, of the handful of homeowners who have now been so-called ``helped'' by Treasury out of the millions and millions that are in trouble, even Treasury's reported that only one in four of the few helped to try to get their mortgage payment to be affordable have now been even more weeded out of that program. This is like the great shrinking blimp. You sort of promise them everything, but give them nothing, and the gas just drains right out of the balloon.  The overall program in fact is voluntary and aimed to protect the investor, not the homeowner. People today who are in the program and trying to save their homes are depleting their savings so when they get kicked out of the administration's programs, they are more poor and assured of losing their homes and with little, if anything, to survive on. People are still losing their homes. We are not stemming the tide of foreclosures. You think somebody here in Washington would notice that.  That's why I joined with my esteemed colleague, Representative Raul Grijalva, and introduced the Right to Rent Act of 2010, H.R. 5028. And we invite our colleagues to join us. This bill creates a right to rent for homeowners facing foreclosure. The bill is going to help a good portion of those 6 million delinquent homeowners transition from foreclosure to renting a home. And if communities are wise and adopt the old turnkey program, kind of resurrect that, then after 5 years if your payments are good you can end up owning your home, help to save our neighborhoods, save our communities by saving the families who don't deserve to be thrown out.  Right to Rent would allow families to stay in their home and keep their family stable, while lowering the family's monthly housing costs by extending the term. In the meantime, the mortgage holder receives a fair market rent on their property. Keeping both families and mortgages stable strengthens communities rather than leaving homes barren and families on the street.  In some communities in Ohio, entire neighborhoods are now vacant. Who does that help? Aiming relief directly at middle income homeowners, not speculators or people living in unaffordable mansions, the Right to Rent Act of 2010 allows homeowners facing foreclosure to stay in their homes at a fair market rent for 5 years.  Specifically, to be eligible, the home must be a single-family property, a condominium with an undivided interest in common areas, or a similar dwelling in a multi-unit project that has been occupied for at least 2 years. The mortgage must have been originated before July 1, 2007. Furthermore, the home must have been purchased at or below a median purchase price for the local metropolitan area as measured by the National Association of Realtors.  The homeowner, upon receiving notice of foreclosure on an eligible property, has 25 business days to petition the court to exercise his or her right to rent the home for up to 5 years at a fair market rate as determined by a court-appointed independent appraiser. The bill does not change existing State foreclosure laws or landlord-tenant laws.  In addition, the Secretary of Housing and Urban Development will monitor compliance with the program. In addition, this right to rent sunsets 5 years after date of enactment. It's not meant to be around forever.                              {time}  1945  Judges can transition middle-income family home foreclosures to rental agreements in a manner consistent with common sense and justice.  Right to Rent is but one tool, a workable one, to address our Nation's housing crisis and help stabilize not only our community but also our Nation's mortgage economy.  The Right to Rent provides a strong incentive for lenders to modify mortgages, including principal write-downs, to avoid becoming landlords. If the lender chooses to pursue foreclosure, the family can go to court to rent their home, thus preventing the spiral of vacancy, social problems, crime, and lower property values in neighborhoods that follow mass vacancies.  Right to Rent is backed by real world results. A model similar to H.R. 5028 is currently used on a limited basis by Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac.  Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to join me and Raul Grijalva in cosponsoring H.R. 5028 to stem the tide of foreclosures still sweeping across this country.              [From the Wall Street Journal, May 18, 2010]                     Loan Aid Leaves Some Worse Off   One in Four in Government's Mortgage Program Is Dropped; Tales of                            Exhausted Savings                         (By James R. Hagerty)       The government's mortgage-modification program has left      some struggling homeowners worse off than they were before.       The Treasury reported Monday that nearly one in four      homeowners who were offered lower payments under the Obama      administration's 15-month-old effort have been weeded out of      the program. Many people were removed from the trials because      they failed to make payments, didn't provide all the      financial documents needed to qualify or were found to be      ineligible.       Homeowners are first offered trial modifications under the      program, which provides incentive payments to loan servicers,      investors and the homeowners. If borrowers make the payments      and satisfy other criteria, those trials are made permanent,      ensuring a cut in payments for five years.       While awaiting answers, some borrowers keep making      payments, exhausting their savings in what may be a futile      effort to save their homes. They also incur fees from the      banks and delay taking action that might give them a fresh      start in a more affordable home.       Some borrowers had unrealistic expectations about loan-     relief programs, which were never designed to prevent all      foreclosures. Another big problem is that banks often take      six to 12 months to determine whether applicants are      eligible.       ``I had to learn the hard way and deplete my savings doing      it,'' said Mia Parry, a manager at a mortgage brokerage in      Scottsdale, Ariz., who has spent nearly two years seeking a      loan modification. She now wishes she had put her home on the      market.       Most struggling borrowers do benefit from seeking help,      said Aaron Horvath, a senior vice president at Springboard      Inc., a nonprofit counseling service based in Riverside,      Calif.       Some win modifications, cutting monthly payments by      hundreds of dollars. Others who ultimately can't get      modifications at least are allowed to stay in their homes for     months, making either no payments or reduced payments.       But ``if you're draining your savings'' in a vain effort to      hang onto a home, he said, you may end up worse off.       Eager for quick results, the Obama administration last year      prodded banks to start people on trials without first      obtaining documents proving they were eligible. That has led      to many crushed hopes. The Treasury earlier this year changed      its rules and told banks to start trials only after getting      documents that proved borrowers qualified.       The Treasury said in a monthly report on the government's      $50 billion Home Affordable Modification Program, or HAMP,      that about 1.2 million trial modifications had been started      under the plan, and about 281,000 borrowers had washed out by      the end of April.       Only about 30 percent of borrowers who seek help from the      main foreclosure-prevention counseling program at      Neighborhood Housing Services of South Florida end up with      modifications, said LeeAnn Robinson, chief operating officer      of the Miami-based nonprofit Many borrowers don't have enough      income to support even reduced loan payments; others give up      before completing the paperwork.       On average, it takes seven months to resolve a borrower's      situation, up from four months a year ago, Ms. Robinson said.      Banks and other loan servicers can't keep up with the demand      for help, she said.       Ms. Parry bought a home in Phoenix in 2005 for $535,000,      but she believes it now would sell for around $250,000. She      has been seeking a modification from a unit of Citigroup      Inc., the servicer of her two mortgage loans, since June      2008.       Ms. Parry's application was turned down in late 2008, but      President Obama's announcement of HAMP in February 2009      rekindled her hopes. Ms. Parry decided to keep making      payments on her loans because she expected to qualify for      this new program.       Citigroup started her on a HAMP trial in June 2009, and she      made three payments. Then Citigroup told her there had been a      mistake and she would need to go through another three-month      trial.       At the end of that second trial, Ms. Parry said, Citigroup      told her the investor that owned her first mortgage wasn't      participating in HAMP, so she couldn't get a modification      under that plan. During her trial period, Citigroup charged      her more than $1,300 of ``late charges'' and ``delinquency      expenses,'' she said.       Ms. Parry said Citigroup should have been able to determine      that the investor wasn't participating before she went      through the trial. Citigroup recently offered her another      type of modification that she said fell short of the HAMP      formula and wouldn't lower her costs enough to make keeping      the home worthwhile. Unless Citigroup improves the offer, she      will try to sell the home.       A Citigroup spokesman said: ``We have worked diligently      with the borrower and the investor in an effort to find a      solution that meets both the borrower's needs and the      investor's requirements.''       Martha Wright, a marketing executive whose income has      dropped in recent years, has been trying since February 2009      to work out a deal with J.P. Morgan Chase & Co., the bank      that services the $1.1 million mortgage on her Avalon, N.J.      home.       The bank denied her request last summer, but Ms. Wright      said she kept trying because the responses from the bank were      unclear and inconsistent, and she believed she still might      qualify. Meanwhile, she said, by continuing to make payments,      she cut her nonretirement savings to about $500 from $63,000      in early 2009.       A spokesman for J.P. Morgan said the bank told Ms. Wright      on three occasions that she didn't qualify for a      modification. ``Modifying the loan would produce less value      to the loan's owner than foreclosing,'' he said.                          ____________________
