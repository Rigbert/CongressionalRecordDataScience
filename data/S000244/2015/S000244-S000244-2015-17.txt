 This weekend is one of America's greatest sports traditions--the Super Bowl. As most Americans huddle around the television, either rooting for their teams or against the rival as the case may be, sadly, many American children are huddled on the streets or in hotel rooms--the victims of sex trafficking.  A sinister side to major sporting events and to other large events is that a portion of the attendants come looking to abuse young children as much as they come for the headline events. While no one knows exactly how much the incidence of child sex trafficking increases during these events, it is known that pimps do bring children and other victims from around the country to offer them for sale at the Super Bowl and at other similar events. During last year's Super Bowl, the FBI and other law enforcement agencies arrested more than 45 traffickers and rescued 16 child victims of sex trafficking, including victims as young as 13 years old and some who had been reported missing by their families.  Compounding this tragedy is the fact that most States have no exception to their prostitution laws for minor victims of trafficking. These children must often fear arrest and prosecution when law enforcement manages to locate and rescue some sex trafficking victims. This must stop. In recognizing the need for protection and support for the growing number of child victims of commercial sex trafficking, an increasing number of States have taken steps to establish so-called ``safe harbor'' provisions that either decriminalize minor prostitution or divert minor victims to the services and support needed for recovery.  H.R. 159, the Stop Exploitation Through Trafficking Act, introduced by Mr. Paulsen of Minnesota and Ms. Moore of my own State of Wisconsin, seeks to continue this trend by encouraging the States, through preferential treatment in the Federal COPS grants, to enact safe harbor legislation that ensures these victims are treated as victims and not as criminals and that they are directed to support services and not to detention facilities.  The bill also codifies a ``national human trafficking hotline'' that ensures young victims are eligible for enrollment in the Job Corps program. It requires the Attorney General to report on sex offender convictions, and it clarifies the authority of the U.S. Marshals Service to help locate and recover missing children, many of whom are vulnerable to becoming sex trafficking victims.  This bill passed the Judiciary Committee by voice vote. Similar legislation passed on the House floor unanimously last Congress, but it was not enacted into law.  There is no such thing as a child prostitute--just victims of commercial sexual abuse at the hands of adults, so I urge my colleagues to support H.R. 159.  I reserve the balance of my time.         Committee on Education and the Workforce, House of            Representatives,                                 Washington, DC, January 26, 2015.     Hon. Bob Goodlatte,     Chairman, Committee on the Judiciary, House of          Representatives, Washington, DC.       Dear Mr. Chairman: I am writing to confirm our mutual      understanding with respect to H.R. 159, the ``Stop      Exploitation Through Trafficking Act of 1015.'' Thank you for      consulting with the Committee on Education and the Workforce      with regard to H.R. 159 on those matters within the      committee's jurisdiction.       In the interest of expediting the House's consideration of      H.R. 159, the Committee on Education and the Workforce will      forgo further consideration of this bill. However, I do so      only with the understanding this procedural route will not be      construed to prejudice my committee's jurisdictional interest      and prerogatives on this bill, or any other similar      legislation, and will not be considered as precedent for      consideration of matters of jurisdictional interest to my      committee in the future.       I respectfully request your support for the appointment of      outside conferees from the Committee on Education and the      Workforce should this bill or a similar bill be considered in      a conference with the Senate. I also request you include our      exchange of letters on this matter in the Congressional      Record during consideration of this bill on the House floor.      Thank you for your attention to these matters.           Sincerely,                                                       John Kline,     Chairman.                                  ____                                         House of Representatives,                                   Committee on the Judiciary,                                 Washington, DC, January 26, 2015.     Hon. John Kline,     Chairman, Committee on Education and the Workforce, Rayburn          House Office Building, Washington, DC.       Dear Chairman Kline, Thank you for your letter regarding      H.R. 159, the ``Stop Exploitation Through Trafficking Act of      2015,'' which the Judiciary Committee ordered reported      favorably to the House on January 21, 2015.       I am most appreciative of your decision to forego      consideration of H.R. 159 so that it may move expeditiously      to the House floor. I acknowledge that although you are      waiving formal consideration of the bill, the Committee on      Education and the Workforce is in no way waiving its      jurisdiction over the subject matter contained in the bill.      In addition, I would support your effort to seek appointment      of an appropriate number of conferees on any House-Senate      conference involving this legislation.       Finally, I am pleased to include a copy of our letters in      the Congressional Record during consideration of H.R. 159.           Sincerely,                                                    Bob Goodlatte,                                                         Chairman.
