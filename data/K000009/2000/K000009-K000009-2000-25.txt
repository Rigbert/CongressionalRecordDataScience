Speaker, I yield 3 minutes to the gentlewoman from Connecticut (Ms. DeLauro), a member of the subcommittee who has worked diligently all year and whose voice should be allowed to be heard in full conference and open public hearings.  Ms. DeLAURO. Mr. Speaker, I rise in strong support of this motion to instruct. We were promised that in this Congress under this Republican leadership that the trains were going to run on time. Well, not only has the train not run on time, it has completely derailed. To tell members of any committee that they are not even able to sit as a conferee on their own bill in fact undermines the credibility of this House. It is an affront to each and every Member. This does not protect the decisions that were made by the members of the subcommittee. I am a member of this subcommittee. I take the job very, very seriously. This conference report was negotiated in the dead of night by a few members of the Republican leadership behind closed doors.  Let me say that we worked hard with our colleagues on the other side of the aisle up until this point, the gentlewoman from Ohio and the gentlemen from New York, California, and Florida and myself, we were engaged. My God, we have been left out of the process. This is not a democracy. This is capitulation.  Do you know what is in this bill? Vital things, incredibly important to people in this country. The prescription drug reimportation piece of it is vital to our seniors.                              {time}  1315  It says we are going to bring down the cost of prescription drugs to people in this country, to seniors in this country.  Sanction reform for our farmers, it says let our farmers sell their products overseas, alternative fuel source, food stamps, nutrition programs for women and children, help for hard-working families and their families.  Connecticut leads New England in farm income, in fruit, and milk production. As a Member of Congress, it is my responsibility to represent my constituents. This report denies my constituents a chance to be heard.  Too much is at stake. Let us allow the conferees to sit down, to review the issues, to make their determinations. Let them do their job. When you lock Members of this House out of the conference, when a handful of people decide to cast votes, then you shut my constituents out of this process. That is not the message that this House needs to be sending.
