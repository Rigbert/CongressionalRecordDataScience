That way he could be part of it.  The Senator from Mississippi is absolutely right. We go forward with a vote--I was suggesting a way to save having to put the other amendment up at another time. It still becomes a matter of conference. If the distinguished Senator from Mississippi wishes to go forward with the vote on the Thomas, that is fine with me.  I would state, as I have before, that is a defeat of the underlying Nelson-Leahy, et al, amendment which will come up in another form at a later time. I am perfectly willing to go ahead and vote now.  I ask for the yeas and nays.
