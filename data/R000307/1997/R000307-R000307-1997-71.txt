President, for the information of all Senators, tomorrow from 9:30 in the morning until 11:30, the Senate will be in a period of morning business to accommodate a number of Senators wishing to speak.  At 11:30, the Senate will begin consideration of S. 562, the reverse mortgage bill. Under the agreement, there will be 1 hour for debate on that bill. However it is our understanding that no Senator will request a rollcall on passage, therefore, with that in mind, Senators should not expect rollcall votes to occur during Friday's session of the Senate.  On Monday, April 28, the Senate will debate the motion to proceed to S. 543, regarding protections to volunteers. A cloture motion will be filed tomorrow on this issue, which will call for a cloture vote on the motion to proceed to S. 543 on Tuesday of next week. Therefore, the next rollcall vote will occur on Tuesday, April 29, at 2:15 p.m. If cloture is invoked on Tuesday, it is expected that the Senate will proceed to the bill on Tuesday. Therefore, additional votes can be expected to occur on Tuesday on amendments to the volunteer protection bill.  The Senate could also be asked to turn to any other Legislative or Executive Calendar items that may be cleared for action.                          ____________________
