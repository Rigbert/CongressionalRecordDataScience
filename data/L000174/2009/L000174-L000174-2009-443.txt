President, I am pleased to join Senator Durbin once again to introduce the Development, Relief, and Education for Alien Minors Act, DREAM. This legislation has the potential to change the lives of many young people in an extraordinary and positive way and is an investment in America's future.  The Senate has attempted several times to pass the DREAM Act, but the bitter politics of immigration have stalled our best efforts in the past. I appreciate Senator Durbin's persistence, and I share his commitment to the young people whose lives this bill would profoundly improve. Those who came to the U.S. as minors under the care of their parents are not guilty of their parents' transgressions. For many, the U.S. is the only home they know. We will further the Federal policy that supports educational opportunity and military service if we exercise the forbearance to defer rigid application of our laws upon those who have the potential to be citizens that will move our country forward. We all recognize the value of higher education and service to our country. To serve these Federal policy interests by giving legal stability and opportunity to young people caught in the limbo of our laws through no fault of their own is the right thing to do.  As Congress and the administration work through the immediate challenges that lie ahead, and begin to restore the faith of Americans in our economy and our government, I hope Congress will not shy away from other important issues such as immigration reform. When our Federal Government confronts the issue of immigration, I hope we will see not only the opportunity to correct what is wrong, but also to improve and build upon what is good and just about the traditions of welcoming and refuge that define our immigration system. The promise this bill holds for so many young people will reinforce the spirit that underlies the history of American immigration and the diversity that has moved us so far.  I thank Senator Durbin and hope all Senators will join us in support of this legislation.                                 ______                                       By
