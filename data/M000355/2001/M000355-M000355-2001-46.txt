 STEVENS. Senator McConnell you are exactly right. The efforts by the foundation will not only utilize the vast resources of the private sector--but combine that with the experience and knowledge of the Department of State and the United States Agency for International Development. State and USAID each have personnel around the globe who are aware of the need for these chairs--from Central America to the nations of Africa to the Balkans to South East Asia. We are confident that these U.S. personnel can utilize their contacts in each of these communities to bring relief to those in need--and in five years--to reach one million people.
