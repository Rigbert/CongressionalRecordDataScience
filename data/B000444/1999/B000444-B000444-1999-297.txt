  I want to make it clear, I do not know where the Senator got the impression that there would be no objection. I did not agree to that. What I suggested was that when he asked me whether or not I objected, I asked him to withhold until after I made my talk and asked some questions. Then I would not object. We are getting the ``cart before the horse'' here. I want to make it clear, I may not ultimately object. I just want to have an opportunity to speak to this before he sends his amendment to the desk.
