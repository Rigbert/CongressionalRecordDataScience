Each year, the Asian American Medical Association pays tribute to prominent, outstanding citizens and organizations for their contributions to the community. In recognition of their efforts, these honorees are awarded the prestigious Crystal Globe Award each year at this annual banquet.  The Asian American Medical Association has always been a great asset to Northwest Indiana. Its members have selflessly dedicated themselves to providing quality medical service to the residents of Indiana's First Congressional District, and they have always demonstrated exemplary service through their many cultural, scholastic, and charitable endeavors.  At this year's charity ball, the Asian American Medical Association will present the Crystal Globe Award to one of Northwest Indiana's finest citizens, Mr. James Gagan. Born in Chicago, Illinois on May 6, 1930, James Lawrence Gagan learned the importance of serving his community from a young age. This would become evident in his two separate stints in the United States Army between 1948 and 1954. Following his military service, Jim, as he is known by those closest to him, relocated to Northwest Indiana in 1956 and worked as a finance company manager until 1958. At that time, he founded a collection and prorating business now owned and operated by his brother, Larry. An astute businessman, Mr. Gagan later moved on to the oil industry when, in 1963, he founded United Penn Oil and Gas Company. Focusing on the leasing, drilling, and production of oil and gas wells, the company expanded to serve an area covering nine states. Remarkably, Jim's entrepreneurial success did not end there. In 1971, he conceived a new company that incorporated with United Consumers Club, Inc. Now known as Direct Buy, this company is now the most successful private buying club in the world, with more than one million members and 163 locations throughout the United States and Canada. Beginning with the vision of Jim Gagan, Direct Buy has become the gold standard in the merchandising industry. Mr. Gagan's impressive contributions to his industry are truly a source of pride for the First Congressional District. In addition, Jim has also been a partner in the development of one of California's premier golf clubs, Big Horn Country Club in Palm Desert, California, which has gained national recognition, and he has been an active participant in the restoration of Innsbrook Country Club, one of Indiana's oldest golf courses.  While his resume is already impressive in and of itself, it is his service to those in need throughout the Nation that is most astonishing. Entirely funded by profits from Direct Buy, Jim formed the Friendship Foundation in May of 1985. This outstanding foundation, like Jim, is solely focused on improving the quality of life for those who are in need. Since its inception, the Friendship Foundation has contributed, both locally and nationally, to many people through organizations such as: Habitat for Humanity, the Salvation Army, Christian Haven Homes, Shults-Lewis Homes, Ronald McDonald House, The Caring Place, Baptist Children's Homes, Visiting Nurses Association, Meals on Wheels, Hebrew Association for the Deaf, Greater Hammond Community Center, Special Olympics, Opportunity Enterprises, Wycliffe Bible Translators, Respite Care Services, Boys and Girls Clubs of America, Boy Scouts of America, Lake County Child Abuse Center, Hospice Home Care, Children's Memorial Hospitals of Indianapolis and Chicago, as well as many local food pantries, churches, and civic charities. Also, through Direct Buy, local nursing homes have annually received more than 1,500 Christmas gifts, consisting of much needed goods, and more than 1,000 children have had a brighter Christmas thanks to their efforts through the local Angel Tree project. For his efforts on behalf of his community, Jim has received many honors, including the prestigious Sagamore of the Wabash, presented by the governor of the State of Indiana, in 1981.  Madam Speaker, I ask that you and my other distinguished colleagues join me in commending the Asian American Medical Association, as well as this year's Crystal Globe Award recipient, Mr. James Gagan, for their outstanding contributions to their communities and beyond. Their unwavering commitment to improving the quality of life for the people of Northwest Indiana and throughout the United States is truly inspirational. For these reasons, the Asian American Medical Association, its members, and Mr. Gagan are to be recognized, and I am proud to serve as their representative in Washington, DC.                          ____________________
