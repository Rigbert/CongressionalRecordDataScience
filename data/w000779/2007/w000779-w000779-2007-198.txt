President, the distinguished Senator from Virginia, I think, will be pleased with my request.  I ask unanimous consent that Senator Warner be recognized at this time for up to 60 minutes and, following that, Senator Murray be recognized for 15 minutes, a Republican Senator be recognized next for 10 minutes, then Senator McCaskill be recognized for 10 minutes, and then Senator Smith be recognized for up to 75 minutes. I will be joining Senator Smith during his 75 minutes. That is my request.
