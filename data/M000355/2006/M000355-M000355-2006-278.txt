 President, I rise today to honor the life of a father, son, uncle, and brother from the Commonwealth of Kentucky who was lost in the line of duty as a member of America's Armed Forces. I ask the Senate to pause today in memory of SPC Stephen P. Downing II of Burkesville, KY. He was 30 years old.  On October 28, 2004, Specialist Downing and his squad were on patrol securing one of the busiest intersections in Ramadi, Iraq. As a key route for vital U.S. convoys, this crossroads had become a focal point of terrorist attacks. The threat to vulnerable U.S. vehicles meant soldiers like Stephen Downing were needed to stand guard against would-be bombers.  As his squad waited to be relieved at noon, Stephen, whose duty was simply to drive the armored humvee, volunteered to give his gunner a break from the intense heat. He climbed out of the relative safety of the driver's seat to man the .50 caliber machinegun mounted on top of the roof. Then, just a few minutes before his squad was to be replaced, he was fatally wounded by a lone sniper's bullet.  For his actions as a soldier, Specialist Downing earned numerous medals and awards, including the Bronze Star Medal and the Purple Heart.  Stephen Downing was a man of action, with a keen sense of right and wrong. He was more comfortable working on an engine or being outdoors than sitting inside. He was quick-witted, with a knack for pulling practical jokes. This quality endeared him to his family, friends, and fellow soldiers.  Stephen loved his family. As SPC Robert Gonzales, who served with Stephen Downing in both Korea and Iraq, recalls--using Stephen's nickname with the unit--       Stevey D. was very proud of his kids. He always talked      about how proud they made him. . . . I can't remember how      many times he showed me a picture of his son and his daughter      swimming in a pool, wearing floaties. He kept it with him all      the time.  Stephen's fatherly tenderness extended beyond his daughter, Taylor, and his son, Stephen, to include his niece, Chelsea. As Stephen's sister, Danica, says:       Stephen was like a father to my daughter . . . and Chelsea      always looked up to Stephen.  When Stephen himself was a child, his appetite for adventure could not be satisfied. His sister recalls that her brother loved to go diving, swimming, skiing--if it was to be done outside, Stephen was eager to pursue the challenge.  When he was not taking things apart, he was putting them back together. Stephen loved modifying his BMX bikes, even if his modifications did not always turn out to be an improvement.  According to his stepfather, Jim Maynard, Stephen seemed blessed with a constant smile on his face.  And nothing could make Stephen smile more than pulling a prank on his sister. As the older sibling by almost 2 years, Danica was a constant presence for her brother growing up, helping him if older bullies tried to pick on him. But this didn't stop Stephen from having a good-natured laugh at her expense.  One morning, Stephen rushed out to catch the schoolbus and told the driver to go ahead because his sister was not going to school that day. About 3 miles down the road, the bus driver and everyone else on the bus learned the truth when Stephen's mother flagged down the schoolbus and Danica jumped on.  Another time, Danica was babysitting for a neighbor, and she and a girlfriend decided to take the baby for an evening stroll. Along their path they passed an abandoned old farm house, an infamously spooky local attraction.  As you might have guessed, Mr. President, what better way to scare your sister than to hide in the weeds by a house such as this and at the right time, jump out yelling. As Danica recounts, ``Stephen scared [us] half to death . . . we both were so scared, we just took off screaming. It took us a minute to realize neither of us had brought the stroller.''  Stephen enlisted in the Army in 1992. He joined the National Guard in 1994, and left the service in 2000. In 2002, however, Stephen felt compelled to reenlist in the Army. He was sent to Korea, where he was stationed with the Second Infantry Division.  After a year-long stint, his unit was ordered to prepare for deployment to Iraq. Given the choice between staying with the unit or being transferred to Fort Carson, CO, Stephen elected to go to war with the men he had come to know and depend on.  Shortly before Stephen deployed to Iraq with the 2nd I.D., he returned home for 2 weeks to be with his family. During that time, his mother, Stella Maynard, fixed all of Stephen's favorite foods, including her famous cherry delight cake. Each family member let Stephen know how proud they were ofhim, while also quietly airing their greatest fears.  Stephen told his daughter, who pleaded with him not to go, that he was needed in Iraq. Putting her on his knee, Stephen told her that he was going to Iraq to help the children there--to keep them safe, so that they could have a chance at a better life.  Danica also pulled her brother aside and told him to be careful. ``I told him to keep his head down,'' she says. ``Not to be a hero, not to do more than what he had to do to get by.'' Stephen understood his sister's motivations, but as his actions would demonstrate, and as his fellow soldiers would later recall, Stephen did anything but the bare minimum.  SP Phillip Pilcher, who was on patrol with Stephen that fateful day, recalls ``Stephen was one of the hardest working guys over there; he would work two to three hours later than everyone else just to make sure that everything was where it needed to be.''  Specialist Gonzales, who credits Stephen with being instrumental in making him a better soldier, strikes a similar chord. ``Stephen was the heart and soul of our squad and our regiment,'' he says. ``Even though he didn't have the stripes on his arm, he was still a great leader.''  Many of the friends Stephen made over his 30 years came to say goodbye when he was laid to rest. BG Dan Bolger, who helped command the Second Infantry Division in Korea and asked to be the survivor-assistance officer for Stephen's family, was astounded by what he saw that day: For a 22-mile stretch along the path of the funeral procession, people, some holding signs, others flags, stood in silent tribute to their fallen hero.  A few months before his death, Stephen wrote a letter to his mother, to be sent in the event he did not return. He wrote, ``Different people will remember me for different reasons, but I would hope that everyone would think that I was over here for them.''  The devotion to honor and sacrifice expressed in those words tells us how Specialist Downing was able to touch so many people, and why so many people paid their final respects to his memory. As his mother recalls, ``Stephen didn't have friends--he had family.''  I thank Stephen's mother, Stella Maynard, and his niece, Chelsea Downing, who have traveled to our Nation's capital to--meet with me today, for sharing Stephen's story. His children, Taylor and Stephen, his sister, Danica, his step-father, Jim Maynard, and other beloved family members are in our thoughts today as well.  We can never repay Specialist Downing's family for their loss. But we can, and we must, honor the sacrifice of their beloved father, son, uncle and brother, and recognize that without his courage and the courage of the men and women of our Armed Forces, America could not lead the world in the defense of freedom.  Mr. President, Stephen's mother, Stella, put it just right, and we are all blessed to have had SP Stephen Downing in our family.                          ____________________[Pages S9247-S9248]From the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]                       HONORING OUR ARMED FORCES                    Specialist Stephen P.
