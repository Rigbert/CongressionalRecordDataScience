Speaker, it gives me great pleasure to pay tribute to the outstanding achievements of an exceptional group of students from Chesterton High School, located in Indiana's First Congressional District. On Saturday, February 5, 2000, the Chesterton High School Debate Team won its 11th state debate title.  Chesterton entered four Policy debate teams, four Lincoln Douglas debaters and five Congressional debaters. All 17 debaters broke out of the preliminary rounds and competed in the elimination rounds. Additionally, Chesterton won all three championships--Policy, Lincoln Douglas, and Congress--for a complete sweep of the tournament. No school in the state had ever accomplished this feat. Joel Cavallo and Paul Babcock survived the field of 44 teams to win the State Policy Debate title. In Lincoln Douglas debate, MattGregoline was named the top debater in a field of 66. John Jernigan took the Congressional debate title, outlasting 86 competitors.  In addition, I would like to recognize the other members of the State Debate Championship Team: Dave Blumenthal; Meredith Chase; Aaron Dartz; Eric Galamback; Katie Hurley; April Jenkins; Stephanie Kendall; Christian Nallenweg; Sherry Nelson; Dave Odefey; Mike Podguski; Owen Sutkowski; and Amber Zehner. The team's success is also due to the outstanding ability and leadership of its teachers and coaches. In particular, James Cavallo, Carol Biel and Kirsten Turnak should be commended for the devotion they have demonstrated as coaches. Additionally, Chesterton Principal Janice Bergeson and Dr. Kenneth Payne, Duneland Superintendent of Schools, should be recognized for their strong support of the debate program. The accomplishments of these outstanding individuals are a reflection of their hard work and dedication to scholarship. Their scholastic effort, determined preparation and rigorous approach to learning have made them the best in the state. They have also brought pride to themselves, their families, their school, and their community.  Mr. Speaker, I would like to once again extend my most heartfelt congratulations to the members of the Chesterton High School Debate Team for their commitment to excellence as well as to the faculty members who have instilled in their students the desire to succeed. I am proud to have been given this opportunity to recognize these future leaders, and I look forward to their future achievements as they continue to rise to the top!                          ____________________
