Chairman, again the question is, Why should we grant a blanket exemption under this bill when the President has the authority as Commander in Chief to exempt any individual military facility? In particular, why is it in the States of California, Idaho, and South Carolina that we would exempt facilities that are closed or being decommissioned? It is particularly puzzling.  Even beyond that, I think the residents of the other States, and the list is long, New York, Pennsylvania, South Carolina, Virginia, Idaho, Washington, Hawaii, Connecticut, I think the residents of those States should ask, what is it that the Federal Government is putting into the water that no industry in America is allowed to put into the water, that no local government in America is allowed to put into their water, whether it is recreational water or drinking water or just something that happens to flow through their community; what is it that the Feds are putting in that they need this blanket exemption? I think that is a question that should be answered.  All I am saying is put back in the words, subject the Federal Government to the same requirements as everyone else in this country, the same way we subjected the Congress of the United [[Page H4836]] States to the same laws as everyone else in this country, for the sake of consistency make the Federal Government follow its own laws, and if it needs an exemption for national security purposes, the bill allows it with a simple signature by the President of the United States.
