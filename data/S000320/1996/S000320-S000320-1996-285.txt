 President, I rise today in honor of Judge Joseph Phelps who was killed tragically in a car accident on June 22, 1996. Joe retired from his Montgomery circuit judgeship in 1995, after spending 18 years on the bench. He served the State of Alabama, the Alabama judicial system, and our Nation with dignity, prudence, courage, and honor.  Joe received both a bachelor's degree and a law degree from the University of Alabama. Even as a youth, Joe showed character in all that he did providing a glimpse into the future of the wise, Christian adult, leader, and honorable jurist he would later become.  In 1990, Joe was awarded the Alabama Bar Association's Judicial Award of Merit, its highest award for outstanding and constructive service to the legal profession in Alabama.  Joe's Christian values are reflected not only in the way he lived his life, but in the many positive organizations which he led, founded, belonged, and served. He was the past president of the Montgomery County Bar Association, and has served as a member, past president, trustee, and founder. He also served diligently in the YMCA; Montgomery Lion's Club; Lion's Club International Youth Day in Court Program, which he founded; Jimmy Hitchcock Memorial Award; Fellowship of Christian Athletes; Salvation Army; Capitol City Boys Club; STEP Foundation; Blue-Gray Association; Leadership Montgomery; the Governor's Study Task Force on Drugs; Alabama Trial Lawyers' Association; Association of Trial Lawyers of America; American Judicature Society; Montgomery Magnet Grant Review Committee; and numerous other legal, civic, and Christian groups. He was an elder at Trinity Presbyterian Church, where he served on the Christian education committee, congregational involvement committee, and long-range planning committee. Joe also taught ninth grade Sunday School. In 1980, Joe was honored as YMCA Man of the Year in recognition of his service to youth in Montgomery.  Joe's list of accomplishments are reflective of the life he led, the type of friend he was, and the positive contributions he made throughout his life to his community and his fellow Alabamian. Not the least of which was his role as husband and father. My heart goes out to Joe's family.  Joe's lifelong dedication to community and country made our world a better place. His presence will be sorely missed.                          ____________________
