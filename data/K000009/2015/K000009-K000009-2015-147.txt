Speaker, I rise today to talk about the millions of high-quality jobs this Nation has outsourced over the last quarter century because of flawed free trade deals. These job-killing deals, like NAFTA, have been incredibly harmful to the American economy, racking up a massive, massive trade deficit of $9.5 trillion. And they have failed to live up to the promise of creating jobs. Instead, they have wiped out good jobs, high-paying jobs across our country.  Take Motorola Solutions, for example, which shut down plants all over our country, from California to Florida. Motorola shut down those operations and moved production to China, to South America, to Eastern Europe.  Take Walgreens, which has outsourced its information technology operations to Mexico, to India, leaving its Illinois employees jobless.  Meanwhile, 6 years after the recession, Ohio and 14 other States have job markets that have not yet recovered from the number of jobs during the recession. Hundreds, thousands, millions of quality, good-paying manufacturing jobs have not returned. Citizens of these States, like Ohio, are fighting for honest employment.  Since 1976, America has literally outsourced 47.5 million good jobs. We have a budget deficit because we have a $9.5 trillion trade deficit.  We must support job seekers. More lopsided trade deals are not the answer. We simply have to reform our trade policies.                          ____________________
