As members of the Senate Environment and Public Works Committee we share a concern that the programs at the EPA should be grounded in sound science and that the Agency must continue to produce sound scientific research to be used in the regulatory process. Continuing and encouraging the ground water research at the Kerr Laboratory will not only help protect the environment but will ensure that newly developed knowledge and technology for ground water remediation at contaminated sites to be made available to the remediation industry in a usable and timely manner. This research facility is essential in continuing to protect our country's ground water resources and I urge the EPA to continue to support the Kerr Laboratory.            epa funding for the sokaogon chippewa community
