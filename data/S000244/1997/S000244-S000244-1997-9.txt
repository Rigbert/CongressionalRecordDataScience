Speaker, it was with great sadness that I learned of the death of Walter Capps, my colleague in the House and a member of the Science Committee, which I chair. Walter died yesterday of an apparent heart attack after arriving at Dulles airport upon returning to Washington from his California district.  Before his election to Congress, Walter was a professor of religious studies at the University of California at Santa Barbara. He also established and taught the first college course on the Vietnam war. His lifelong commitment to education was evident to everyone who knew him. His experience as an educator was a tremendous asset to the Science Committee and our work to improve science and math education.  I was particularly impressed by the integrity and honesty that Walter Capps displayed at all times. I recall a conversation I had with Walter after a particularly successful bipartisan markup we had in the Science Committee earlier this year. He told me he was impressed by the bipartisan spirit and focus on policy over politics and he hoped that it would catch on in the House. Displaying the integrity that I particularly admired in Walter Capps, he indicated to me that he was going to skip a meeting later that day with Members of his own party that he believed to be intent on promoting partisan politics.  Walter was a pleasure to work with and will be missed as both a friend and a colleague. I know that all of the Science Committee members would want to join me in extending our sympathy to his wife, Lois, and three children, Lisa, Todd, and Laura.
