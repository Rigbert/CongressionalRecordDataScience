 President, this amendment makes a technical correction to the 1995 Law Enforcement Availability Pay Act. The Pay Act, which was included as a separate section in the Fiscal Year 1995 Treasury Appropriations Act, commonly referred to as LEAP, contained a provision which amended section 5542 of title 5. This provision requires that the first 2 hours of scheduled overtime work by criminal investigators be calculated against availability pay hours, authorized under the act.  The issue relating to the calculation of work hours for scheduled overtime compensation has been an issue of contention for certain agencies and criminal investigators alike. The current section, as written, is overly restrictive and inflexible and, thus, increases the potential for litigation.  The provision, as stated in a letter received from the Federal Law Enforcement Officers Association, is unfair and does not adequately reflect the intent of Congress. The author of this legislation, Senator Dennis DeConcini, attempted to clarify congressional intent in a December 1994 floor statement.  Despite this clarification by the amendment's sponsor, personnel regulations have gone unchanged.  Flexibility is needed for the unusual circumstances surrounding Secret Service specific physical security assignments which will become extraordinarily demanding during the upcoming Presidential campagin and the United Nations General Assembly's 50th anniversary. In light of these upcoming demands it is imperative that flexibility to agency management and fairness to the agents be provided, as was originally intended by Congress. This amendment only applies to the unique circumstances surrounding Secret Service physical protection activities.  The Pay Act, resulted in over $40 million in savings in fiscal year 1995 to Federal law enforcement agencies. It also prevented hundreds of millions of dollars from being spent on litigation by the Federal Government.  It was endorsed by Federal law enforcement agencies, the Office of Management and Budget, and respected law enforcement associations.  In order to ensure that this legislation does what it was intended to do, I urge the adoption of the amendment.                           amendment no. 2243
