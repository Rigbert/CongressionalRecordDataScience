 President, I rise today to talk again about the mess at the Department of Justice. As we all know, this Justice Department has been subjected to criticism from Democrats and Republicans alike for mishandling cases. Yesterday, the Justice Department's own Inspector General completed a lengthy report which points to ``egregious misconduct'' by senior officials in the Justice Department. That phrase ``egregious misconduct'' is not my phrase. That's the conclusion of the IG.  This is a sordid story which began in 1997, when I wrote to Attorney General Reno asking her not to fire a whistle blower who had alleged misconduct in two components of DOJ's Criminal Division--The International Criminal Investigative Training Assistance Program, also known as ``ICITAP'', and the Overseas Prosecutorial Development, Assistance and Training, also known as ``OPDAT''. These offices train prosecutors and police in other countries to enforce laws in a way that respects the rule of law and human rights. As such, these offices are heavy consumers of intelligence from various intelligence gathering agencies that monitor human rights abuses. The IG concluded that some Senior DOJ Officials in these offices intentionally refused to follow Government Regulations regarding the handling of classified information and recommended discipline for three DOJ officials.  The allegations I received in 1997 related to serious security breaches as well as the misuse of Government authority for the personal and financial benefit of top DOJ Officials. I was shocked to hear allegations that Bob Bratt, the Executive Officer of the Criminal Division, who had supervisory control over these offices, and Joe Lake who was an assistant to Mr. Bratt, used their Government positions to get visas for Russian women that Brat met through a ``match making service.'' I was shocked to hear allegations that a Senior Justice Official was allowed to retire early with an early retirement bonus, and then be re-hired at DOJ as an outside contractor just a few months later in clear violation of Federal law.  But, these all proved to be accurate. To quote the Inspector General's report ``We concluded that Bratt and Lake committed egregious misconduct'' in obtaining visas for Russian women to enter the country under false pretenses. These women had been denied visas in the past and were only given visas when Bratt assured Embassy Officials in Moscow that these women would be working for DOJ in the future. The IG concluded that this was a false statement. The IG concluded that Bratt and Lake offered explanations for their conduct and denials regarding the visas for the Russian women which were ``not credible.'' The IG also concluded that Bratt's ``intimate involvement'' with these Russian women left him vulnerable to blackmail and presented a security concern. The IG report indicates that Bratt may have pressured other DOJ employees to mislead the IG inspectors. And the IG found that Bratt had DOJ computers sent to a school in Virginia where a girlfriend works.  Clearly, this is the kind of misconduct which should be exposed and corrected. This is why I work so hard to support whistle blowers when they ask for my help.  But it doesn't end there. The IG also concluded that Joe Lake violated Federal Law when he took an early retirement bonus of $ 25,000. One provision of the early retirement program prohibited lake from working for DOJ for 5 years after his retirement. Yet, two months after he retired, Lake was hired as a consultant at DOJ reporting to his old friend Bob Bratt. This was patently illegal, and the IG recommends that DOJ seek the return of lake's $ 25,000 retirement bonus.  The IG also noted many of the hiring practices at issue were--to use the IG's own words--``questionable.'' For instance, the IG report described the hiring of a bartender at a local restaurant frequented by the Associate Director of ICITAP. The bartender was originally hired to work at DOJ on a temporary basis. After this bartender-turned-Government lawyer began a personal relationship with Bratt, Bratt hired her on a permanent basis at DOJ. Another example cited by the IG involved an ICITAP official hiring the father of an ex-spouse's step-children even though he had very little experience. Again, the American people deserve better from their Government.  The IG report also indicates that Senior Justice officials improperly used frequent flier miles. The IG recommends that security clearances begranted to ICITAP officials only after evaluating their poor record of complying with security regulations.  I wrote to the Attorney General on this matter in 1997. It's taken until September of 2000 for DOJ to finish its report. Just last month, Mr. Bratt was allowed to retire from Government service. The IG report indicates that the IG would have recommended that Bratt be fired from the Justice Department if he were still working for DOJ. It seems to me that Senior Justice officials may need to be held accountable for letting Bratt retire rather than face the music for his misdeeds. As Chairman of the Administrative Oversight Subcommittee on the Judiciary Committee, I intend to keep a close eye on the Criminal Division, in light of this sorry Record.  Mr. President, this is merely the latest example of how Justice Department is a real mess. We all know that. For the benefit of my colleagues, I ask unanimous consent to have printed in the Record at the cost of $1,300 an executive summary of the report.  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in the Record, as follows:                           Executive Summary       Te International Criminal Investigative Training Assistance      Program (ICITAP) is an office within the Criminal Division of      the Department of Justice that provides training for foreign      police agencies in new and emerging democracies and assists      in the development of police forces relating to international      peacekeeping operations. The Criminal Division's Office of      Overseas Prosecutorial Development, Assistance and Training      (OPDAT) trains prosecutors and judges in foreign countries in      coordination with United States Embassies and other      government agencies. The Criminal Division's Office of      Administration serves the Criminal Division's administrative      needs. This report details the results of an investigation by      the Office of the Inspector General (OIG) into allegations      that managers in ICITAP, OPDAT, and the Office of      Administration committed misconduct or other improprieties.       The allegations raised a wide variety of issues including      managers' improper use of their government positions to      obtain visas for foreign citizens, widespread violations of      the rules governing the handling and storage of classified      documents, managers' use of business class travel without      authorization, managers' use of frequent flyer miles earned      on government travel for personal use, violations of      contractual rules and regulations, failure to supervise      contracts leading to substantial cost overruns and      overcharges by contractors, and favoritism in the hiring and      promotion of certain employees. Many of the allegations      concerned the actions of Robert K. ``Bob'' Bratt, a senior      Department official who became the Criminal Division      Executive Officer in charge of the Office of Administration      in 1992. At varying times during the years 1995-1997, Bratt      also was the Acting Director of ICITAP and the Coordinator of      both ICITAP and OPDAT.       We substantiated many of the allegations and found that      individual managers, including Bratt, committed serious      misconduct. We also concluded that managers in ICITAP, OPDAT,      and the Office of Administration failed to follow or enforce      government regulations regarding ethics, security, travel,      and contracts. As a result of our investigation, we      recommended discipline for three employees. We would have      recommended significant disciple for Bratt, including      possible termination, but for Bratt's retirement effective      August 1, 2000. We also found that some of the problems      revealed by this investigation go beyond holding individual      managers accountable for their actions and that the      Department can make changes to enhance the performance of      other managers, employees, and offices. Therefore, we made      nine recommendations concerning systemic improvements for the      Department to consider.       The report is divided into chapters addressing the major      allegations. In this Executive Summary, we summarize the      background of the investigation and the allegations, the      investigative findings, and the OIG conclusions with respect      to each chapter.                   i. background of the investigation       ICITAP was created in 1986 and although it is part of the      Department of Justice, its programs are funded by the      Department of State. OPDAT, created in 1991, is similarly      funded. Both ICITAP and OPDAT are headed by Directors, with a      Coordinator responsible for overseeing the management of both      organizations. The Office of Administration handles the      administrative functions for the Criminal Division, including      personnel, budget, information technology, and procurement      matters. The Executive Officer heads the Office of      Administration.       Bratt became the Executive Officer for the Criminal      Division in 1992. He was appointed the Acting Director of      ICITAP in March 1995 following the dismissal of the previous      Director. After Janice Stromsem was selected as ICITAP      Director and assumed the post in August 1995, Bratt resumed      his duties as Executive Officer. Bratt was appointed to the      newly created post of Coordinator in September 1996 where he      remained until being detailed to the Immigration and      Naturalization Service (INS) in April 1997 at the request of      the Attorney General.       ICITAP has had a long history of turmoil. Between 1994 and      1997, four different individuals assumed the responsibility      of Director or Acting Director. During that period, here were      two different investigations into allegations of misconduct      as well as reviews of ICITAP's organizationals structure and      financial systems. In 1994, at the request of the Criminal      Division Assistant Attorney General, the OIG completed two      investigations of ICITAP that examined allegations of      favoritism in selecting consultants, misconduct in travel      reimbursements, poor quality of ICITAP's work products, waste      and inefficiency in program and contract expenditures, and      management of foreign programs. The OIG did not substantiate      the allegations of misconduct but did find that ICITAP did      not plan its programs carefully. The OIG also made      recommendations to improve ICITAP's financial management.      In January 1995, Bratt examined a proposed ICITAP      reorganization plan and conducted an investigation      following additional allegations of misconduct that were      made to the Criminal Division, allegations that Bratt      substantiated.       This OIG investigation began in April 1997 when an ICITAP      employee reported to the Department's security staff that an      ICITAP senior manager had provided classified documents to      persons who did not have a security clearance. The      Department's security staff and the OIG investigated the      allegation and confirmed it. The OIG continued the      investigation to determine the extent of security problems at      ICITAP. While this investigation was ongoing, the OIG      received numerous allegations of misconduct and mismanagement      at ICITAP and OPDAT, and we broadened our investigation to      encompass these new allegations.                    ii. investigation of allegations     A. Issuance of visas to Russian women       Bratt made four trips to Russia in late 1996 and 1997 in      conjunction with his duties as ICITAP and OPDAT Coordinator.      We received several allegations of impropriety relating to      these trips. The most serious allegation was that Bratt and      Criminal Division Associate Executive Officer Joseph R. Lake,      Jr. improperly used Bratt's government position to obtain      visas for two Russian women, one or both of whom it was      alleged were Bratt's ``Russian girlfriends.''       Our review determined that in 1997 Russians seeking to      visit the United States had two methods of obtaining visas      from the American Embassy in Moscow: the standard process and      the ``referral'' process. The standard process could be used      by any Russian seeking to visit the United States. Russians      applying through the standard process were required to wait      in long lines at the American Embassy in Moscow to submit      their applications, and the process included an interview by      an American Embassy official. The Embassy official could deny      the application if, among other reasons, the official did not      believe the applicant had established that he or she would      return to Russia. The ``referral'' process could be used in      much more limited circumstances. The referral process      required that United States government interests be supported      by the applicant's visit to the United States or that a      humanitarian basis existed for the visit. In the referral      process, the visa application was submitted by an Embassy      official who completed a form approved by an Embassy Section      Chief setting forth the United States government interest in      or the humanitarian basis for the applicant's visit. No      interview was required, and the use of the referral process      generally ensured that the applicant would receive a visa.       Two Russian citizens, Yelena Koreneva and Ludmilla Bolgak,      received on April 7, 1997, visas to visit the United States.      They received the visas because Lake submitted their      applications using the referral process and purported that a      government interest existed for their visit to the United      States. On the referral form Lake wrote that ``[a]pplicants      have worked with the Executive Officer (EO) Criminal Division      in support of administrative functions, Moscow Office.'' He      signed it ``Joe Lake for BB.'' In addition to being the      ICITAP and OPDAT Coordinator, Bratt retained the title and      many of the responsibilities of the Executive Officer.       We determined that neither woman had ever worked for Bratt      or the Criminal Division. Both women socialized extensively      with Bratt during his visits to Moscow, but Bratt did not      have a professional relationship with them. We concluded that      the statement written on the referral form was false.       We found that Bratt first visited Moscow in November 1996      during which he received a tour of various tourist sites from      a Russian interpreter. According to the interpreter, during      the tour she told Bratt that she also worked for a Russian      ``match-making'' agency. She said that in response, Bratt      told her he would like to meet a single Russian woman. The      interpreter contacted a business associate, Bolgak, who had a      friend who was single, Koreneva. Bratt met Koreneva and      Bolgak on his next trip to Moscow, in January 1997. On this      trip, as well as his later trips to Moscow, Bratt socialized      extensively with Koreneva and Bolgak, usually meeting them      for dinner or drinks.       During the January trip, Bratt invited the women to come to      the United States to visit him. Koreneva told Bratt that she      had previously been denied a visa to visit the United     States. Between the January trip and his next trip to Moscow      in March 1997, Bratt investigated how Russians could obtain      visas to visit the United States. He made inquiries of a      personal friend who worked for the State Department and also      of Cary Hoover, the Special Assistant to the ICITAP Director.      Bratt learned that Russians applied for visas at the      American Embassy in Moscow, that they were interviewed by      Embassy officials, and that the Embassy made a      determination as to whether the applicant would return to      Russia. Bratt also asked Hoover specifically for      information about the referral process.       In March 1997 Bratt and Hoover returned to Moscow on      business. During this trip Bratt and Hoover met with an      unidentified Embassy official to learn more about the visa      process. The evidence showed that Bratt, Hoover, and the      Embassy official discussed the likelihood of Koreneva being      denied a visa. During the meeting Bratt told the official      that one or both of the women might work for the Department      of Justice in the future. We concluded that Bratt learned      through these various inquiries that Koreneva would likely be      denied a visa again if she used the standard application      process.       Although Bratt and Lake deny it, the evidence showed that      Bratt returned to the Embassy again during this March trip,      this time accompanied by Lake who was also in Moscow, and met      with Donald Wells, the head of the Embassy office responsible      for issuing visas through the referral process. Bratt and      Lake told Wells that they wished to bring two women with whom      they had a professional relationship to the United States for      consultations. Wells told the men that the referral process      could only be used if there was a government interest in the      women's visit to the United States.       We also learned that within a few days of the meeting with      Wells, Lake obtained a visa referral form from the Embassy.      The evidence showed that Lake called Bratt, who had returned      to the United States, to discuss the form. Lake submitted the      women's applications and the visa referral form containing      the false statement about the women having worked for the      Executive Officer to the Embassy. The visas were issued      shortly thereafter although they were never used by the      women. Although he initially falsely claimed to the OIG that      he was just friends with Koreneva, Bratt later admitted to      the OIG that he had an intimate relationship with her.       We concluded that Bratt and Lake knowingly used the      referral process even though they were aware that it required      a government interest in the women's visit and that no such      government interest existed. We also found that Bratt's and      Lake's explanations of their conduct, as well as their      denials that certain events happened, were not credible. We      concluded that Bratt and Lake committed egregious misconduct.     B. Security failures at ICITAP       In April 1997 the Department of Justice Security and      Emergency Planning Staff (SEPS) received an allegation from      an OPDAT employee that Special Assistant to the ICITAP      Director Hoover had improperly given classified documents to      individuals who worked at ICITAP and who did not have      security clearances. SEPS and the OIG confirmed the      allegation. SEPS then conducted an unannounced, after-hours      sweep of the ICITAP offices on April 14, 1997, to further      assess ICITAP's compliance with security rules and      regulations. During that sweep and a follow-up review      conducted by the Criminal Division Security Staff, 156      classified documents were found unsecured in the office of      Joseph Trincellito, ICITAP Associate Director. The OIG and      SEPS conducted further investigation to determine the extent      of ICITAP's security problems and ICITAP management's      responsibility for the failures.       The OIG found that the problems discovered in the 1997      security reviews had existed for many years. Evidence showed      that senior managers provided or attempted to provide      classified documents to uncleared consultants or other staff.      Staff, including senior managers, routinely left classified      documents unsecured on desks, including when individuals were      away from their offices on travel. Stromsem, Hoover, and      Trincellito improperly took classified documents home. Highly      classified documents containing Sensitive Compartmented      Information (SCI), or ``codeword'' information, were brought      to the ICITAP offices even though ICITAP did not have the      type of secure facility (a Sensitive Compartmented      Information Facility or ``SCIF'') required to store SCI. The      evidence showed that ICITAP inaccurately certified to United      States Embassies that individuals had security clearances      when they did not. We also found one instance where      classified information was sent over an unsecure e-mail      system.       As an example of the inattention ICITAP managers gave to      security, we set forth the troubling history of ICITAP      Associate Director Trincellito's handling of classified      information. From 1995 through early 1997, ICITAP's security      officers repeatedly found classified documents left      unattended in Trincellito's office. The security officers      warned Trincellito that he was violating security rules, and      they also notified other ICITAP managers about the problem.      One security officer, after becoming aware of repeated      violations, documented the violations in writing and      recommended discipline for Trincellito. ICITAP Director      Stromsem on occasion spoke to Trincellito about his      violations and attempted to make it easier for him to      comply with rules by putting a safe in his office.      However, in the face of repeated violations indicating      that Trincellito refused to comply with security      regulations, Stromsem and other senior ICITAP managers      failed to take sufficient action, such as initiating      discipline, to ensure that Trincellito complied with      security regulations.       We found that ICITAP managers' own violations of the      security rules, their tolerance of Trincellito's known      violations, and the removal of the security officers who      attempted to enforce the rules sent a message that security      was not important at ICITAP. We also found that the Criminal      Division did not adequately supervise ICITAP's security      program even though security reviews conducted by both SEPS      and the Criminal Division beginning in 1994 showed a pattern      of security violations.       In this chapter we also discuss the security implications      raised by Bratt's involvement with Koreneva. Bratt held a      high-level security clearance and had access to highly      classified documents. We concluded that Bratt's intimate      involvement with a Russian citizen about whom he knew very      little, has invitation to her to visit the United States and      his office, his improper use of his government position to      obtain a visa for Koreneva and Bolgak, and his attempt to      conceal the true nature of the relationship left him      vulnerable to blackmail and represented a security concern.       We found that the actions of another ICITAP employee who      was intimately involved with a Russian national also      represented a security concern.     C. Business class travel       We found that Bratt and other ICITAP and OPDAT manager      improperly flew business class when traveling to and from      Moscow in 1996 and 1997. Government and Department Travel      Regulations restrict the use of business class by government      travelers. Even in circumstances when business class may be      used, it must be authorized by the traveler's supervisor. We      found that Bratt instigated and approved a scheme to      improperly manipulate his flight schedules in order to      qualify for business class travel. We concluded that Bratt's      and the other managers' use of business class was not      authorized and violated the rules limiting the use of      business class travel.       On one trip, in November 1996 Bratt, Lake, and Thomas Snow,      the Acting Director of OPDAT, traveled to Moscow and several      other European cities using business class on at least one      leg of the trip. Business class was arranged by the      Department's travel agency because the method used by the      airlines to calculate the cost of trips with several stops      made the use of business class less expensive than coach      class. However, we found that a weekend stop in Frankfurt,      Germany, violated the Travel Regulations and that the stop      should not have been used as a basis to obtain business class      accommodations. We also found that the Department's travel      agency had suggested an alternative itinerary for this trip      that would have saved the government substantial money but      that the itinerary was improperly rejected by Lake.       On a second trip, in January 1997 Bratt and Hoover flew      business class to Moscow purportedly pursuant to the ``14-     hour'' rule. If authorized by a supervisor, government      regulations permit travelers to fly business class when a      flight, including layovers to catch a connecting flight, is      longer than 14 hours. For this trip, Bratt requested that his      Executive Assistant determine whether the flight proposed by      the travel agency qualified for business class under the 14-     hour rule. His Executive Assistant checked with three      different individuals and based on the information she      received, she told Bratt that he did not qualify for business      class because both legs of the flight took less than the      requisite time.       Nonetheless, according to Bratt's Executive Assistant,      Bratt told her to ``do what you can to get me on business      class.'' As a result, Bratt's Executive Assistant arranged      with the Department's travel agency to lengthen Bratt's      flight for the purpose of obtaining a flight long enough to      qualify for business class travel. Even with the      manipulations, however, the flight from the United States to      Moscow was still less than 14 hours. We concluded that Bratt      and Hoover did not qualify for the use of business class and      that they were not authorized to use that class of service.       In March 1997, on a third trip, Bratt, Hoover, and Stromsem      flew business class from Moscow to the United States even      though there were economy flights available that would have      fit the business needs of the travelers. Although Hoover and      Stromsem were originally scheduled to fly on an economy class      flight, Bratt directed that their flights be changed to avoid      the disparity between his subordinates traveling economy      while he traveled on business class. We held Bratt      accountable for all the excess costs of the March trip. On      his fourth trip, in June 1997 Bratt flew business class on      both legs of his trip to and from Moscow. Contemporaneous      documents show that the choice of flights for both of      these trips was dictated by Bratt's desire to use business      class rather than for business reasons. In one facsimile      to the travel agency concerning the June 1997 trip,      Bratt's Executive Assistant asked, ``Can you rebook him      [Bratt] with a slightly longer layover in Amsterdam. . . .      So that at least two extra hours is added onto the trip?     . . . '' In addition, the travelers were not authorized to      travel on business class for either the March or June      trip.       In sum, we found that Bratt pressured his staff to obtain      business class travel and approved a scheme to lengthen his      travel time solely for the purpose of obtaining flights that      would qualify for business class travel under the 14-hour      rule. We concluded that Bratt's manipulation of flight      schedules to qualify for business class travel violated the      Travel Regulations and was improper. The government spent at      least $13,459.56 more than it should have for these four      trips.       We also found that the Justice Management Division (JMD),      which is responsible for auditing foreign travel vouchers,      did not question the use of business class travel by Bratt or      the other managers who accompanied him even when the lack of      authorization was apparent on the face of the travel      documents that the travelers submitted to be reimbursed for      their expenses.       In this chapter we also detail a conversation between Bratt      and his Executive Assistant that led her to believe that      Bratt was coaching her how to answer OIG questions. Through a      series of rhetorical questions that falsely suggested that      Bratt was not involved in making decisions regarding his use      of business class, Bratt tried to shift to his Executive      Assistant the responsibility for the decisions leading to      Bratt's business class travel. Bratt also told her that she      should not report their conversation to anyone. For some time      after that conversation, Bratt continued to contact her      asking whether she had been interviewed by the OIG and what      she had said. Despite OIG requests to Bratt that he not      discuss the subject of our interviews with individuals other      than his attorney, we found that Bratt discussed topics that      were the subject of the investigation with individuals who      would be interviewed by the OIG. Bratt also called      individuals, such as the two Russian women for whom he had      improperly obtained visas, to alert them that the OIG would      be seeking to interview them.     D. Failure to follow Travel Regulations       During the course of the investigation, we found that      ICITAP, OPDAT, and Office of Administration managers violated      government Travel Regulations with respect to the use of      frequent flyer benefits. Government regulations state that      all frequent flyer miles accrued on government travel belong      to the government. Because airlines generally do not permit      government travelers to keep separate accounts for business      and personal travel, travelers may ``commingle'' miles earned      from business and personal travel in one account. However,      the Travel Regulations are explicit that it is the      responsibility of the traveler to keep records adequate to      verify that any benefits the traveler uses for personal      travel were accrued from personal travel.       We found that between 1989 and 1998 Bratt used 380,000      miles for personal travel. Bratt told the OIG that while he      had no records to verify how many miles he had accrued from      his personal travel, he believed that he had collected at      least 150,000 miles from personal travel as well as miles      from the use of a personal credit card. Even giving Bratt the      benefit of his recollection, we concluded that Bratt      improperly used between 156,000 and 230,000 miles earned from      government travel for his personal benefit.       We found that Hoover also used frequent flyer miles accrued      from government travel to purchase airline tickets and other      benefits for personal travel for himself and a family member.      Stromsem used miles accrued on government travel to upgrade      her class of travel in violation of government rules.       The investigation revealed that managers violated other      Travel Regulations as well. Lake was inappropriately      reimbursed by the government for some of the travel expenses      associated with weekends that he spent in Frankfurt, Germany,      when he was on personal travel. In violation of the      regulations requiring a traveler's supervisor to authorize      travel and approve travel expenses, Bratt repeatedly either      authorized his own travel or had subordinates sign his travel      requests. Both Bratt and Stromsem routinely had subordinates      approve their travel expenses.       We received an allegation that Stromsem took a business      trip to Lyons, France, as a pretext that allowed her to visit      her daughter who was in Tours, France. Although Stromsem      did not list a business purpose on her travel paperwork      for her stop in Lyons, we did not conclude that her trip      to Lyons was pretextual.       We also received an allegation that Bratt's trips to Moscow      in 1997 were for the purpose of furthering his romantic      relationship with a Russian woman. We found that the lack of      advance planning for the trips, the fact that most of his      meetings in Moscow were with his own staff rather than      Russians, and his romantic relationship with a Russian woman      strongly suggested that the trips to Moscow were not      necessary or were unnecessarily extended for personal rather      than government reasons.     E. Lake buyout       On March 31, 1997, Lake retired from the federal government      after receiving $25,000 as part of a government-wide buyout      program (the Buyout Program) to encourage eligible federal      employees to retire. The following day Lake began working for      OPDAT as a consultant. Lake worked as a subcontractor to a      company that had been awarded a contract to provide various      support services to ICITAP. In May 1997 at Bratt's request,      Lake worked as a consultant to the Immigration and      Naturalization Service (INS) after Bratt was detailed there.       The Buyout Program prohibited former federal employees from      returning to government service as either employees or as      contractors working under a ``personal services'' contract      for five years after their retirement. A personal services      contract is defined by federal regulations as ``a contract      that, by its express terms or as administered, makes the      contractor personnel appear, in effect, [to be] Government      employees.'' Violation of the prohibition requires repayment      of the incentive bonus.       We found that while at OPDAT and INS after his retirement      Lake reported to and was supervised by Bratt, that Lake      supervised and gave directions to federal employees or other      contractors, that he used government equipment, and that      other staff were often unaware that Lake was not a federal      employee. The evidence showed that Lake essentially did the      same job as an OPDAT consultant that he had performed while a      government employee. We concluded that Lake worked at OPDAT      and the INS under a personal services contract in violation      of the Buyout Program requirements.       The evidence showed that Lake planned for several months to      return to work for the Department as a consultant. Both Bratt      and Lake were warned by officials in JMD and the Criminal      Division Office of Administration that Lake's return as a      consultant could constitute a personal services contract. We      concluded that Bratt and Lake improperly failed to ensure      that Lake's work met the requirements of the Buyout Program.       After allegations were raised in the media that Lake had      received Buyout money and then improperly returned to work      for the Department, Bratt asked JMD for an opinion as to      whether Lake should repay the Buyout bonus. A JMD official      concluded that Lake was not obligated to pay back the money      based upon a ``good faith'' exception to the rule requiring      repayment. We determined that there is no ``good faith''      exception to the requirement that a person who violates the      Buyout Program prohibition against performing personal      services must repay the bonus. We also concluded that even if      a good faith exception existed in the law it would not apply      in this case as Lake was aware of the prohibition against      personal services and was warned that his return as a      consultant might constitute the performance of personal      services.       We also found that JMD permitted Lake to work at INS      without a contract for several months. In addition, while JMD      issued a purchase order for Lake's INS work in July 1997,      senior JMD procurement officials later expressed concerns      that the purchase order that had been issued by their office      was a personal services contract. We also found that hiring      Lake as a subcontractor to a third party contractor added      unnecessary costs to the contract.     F. Harris contract       Jo Ann Harris was the Assistant Attorney General for the      Criminal Division from November 1993 until August 1995, when      she left the federal government. Under federal regulations,      Harris was barred from contracting with the government for      one year after her government service. In December 1996      Harris agreed to become an OPDAT consultant to organize,      moderate, and evaluate three conferences that OPDAT was      planning to hold at the International Law Enforcement Academy      (ILEA) in Budapest, Hungary, and to assist OPDAT in      developing curriculum for other OPDAT training programs.      The OIG investigated allegations that the award of this      contract to Harris violated ethical rules that prohibit      contracting with former government officials on a      preferential basis. We found that OPDAT's award of a      contract to Harris to develop curriculum for OPDAT      programs and the processes used to develop the contract,      to determine Harris' fee, and to modify her contract      raised the appearance of favoritism.       In September 1996 Harris had discussions with Criminal      Division managers, including Bratt, about the possibility of      her assisting OPDAT as a consultant. In November 1996 Harris      discussed on the phone with Bratt specific projects that she      could work on such as the ILEA conferences and curriculum      development. At Bratt's direction, an OPDAT official called      Harris in early December 1996 and had a similar conversation      with Harris during which she reiterated her interest in      working on OPDAT projects. On December 12, 1996, Bratt,      Harris, and Lake met in Harris' former office at the      Department of Justice, and Harris agreed to Bratt's proposal      that she work as a consultant on OPDAT projects. The      Statement of Work, a contract document that set out the tasks      that OPDAT was seeking from a consultant, was issued on      January 23, 1997. The tasks included preparing for the ILEA      conferences, acting as the conference moderator, and      developing curricula for other OPDAT programs.       Because no competition was involved in awarding Harris'      contract, we evaluated the propriety of OPDAT's award of her      contract under the rules pertaining to the award of sole-     source contracts. Sole-source contracts, which do not require      the solicitation of competing bids, may be awarded when the      exigencies of time or the consultant's expertise justify the      waiver of the competitive process. We concluded that OPDAT      could have awarded a sole-source contract for her work on the      ILEA conference given her extensive experience and the short      time frame that existed     to prepare for the conference. However, we concluded that      Bratt's decision to hire Harris to develop curricula for      OPDAT projects other than the ILEA conferences created the      appearance of favoritism. We also found that Bratt discussed      with Harris what projects she could perform and the Statement      of Work was written to fit those projects. We concluded that      the process OPDAT used to develop Harris' contract violated      the principle that the task to be accomplished should drive      the development of a contract rather than the desire to hire      a particular consultant.       We disproved the allegation that Harris was paid $65,000      for eight days work. She was paid approximately $27,000 for      42 days work on two ILEA conferences. However, we found that      Harris' rate of pay was not the result of an ``arms length''      negotiation. Harris told Bratt, her former subordinate, to      set the fee and to ``scrub it'' because she did not want to      read about the fee in the newspaper. She agreed to accept      $650 per day although her contract was later modified to      permit her to be paid based on an hourly rather than a daily      rate. We were unable to determine the basis for the $650 per      day fee or find any evidence that Bratt and Lake used any      comparable consultant fee arrangement as the basis for      setting Harris' rate. Evidence showed that the Department of      State, ICITAP, and OPDAT generally set the fees for their      consultants at a lower rate. We concluded that the lack of a      clear record setting forth the basis for the fee raised the      appearance that Harris was given preferential treatment by      her former subordinates.       We also found that OPDAT hired Harris to perform work      outside the scope of the contract, which only authorized      services to ICITAP not OPDAT.     G. Improper personnel practices       The OIG received various allegations relating to ICITAP's      and OPDAT's hiring and management of personnel. The evidence      showed that ICIPAT and OPDAT managers misused contractor      personnel. Federal regulations prohibit contractor personnel      from directing federal employees or exercising managerial      oversight. Yet, ICITAP and OPDAT managers did not distinguish      between employees and contractor personnel and often failed      to identify personnel working for contractors as such. As a      result, ICITAP and OPDAT staff were often confused about      consultant's roles and the scope of their authority.       We found that contractor personnel were used as managers.      For example, one of ICITAP's Deputy Directors was a      subcontractor employed by a contractor that provided a      variety of services to ICITAP. After ICITAP Director Stromsem      was advised by an administrative official that there were      limits to the authority of personnel employed by contractors,      Stromsem cautioned the Deputy Director about the limitations.      However, Stromsem did not notify other staff about the Deputy      Director's status as a subcontractor, and he remained in      the position of Deputy Director until he became a federal      employee six months later.       We found other problems with the use of contractor      personnel including ICITAP's selection of particular      consultants to be hired by its service contractors. This left      ICITAP vulnerable to claims that it was violating the rules      restricting personal services contracts. The practice of      directing the hiring of consultants wasted money because      ICITAP was performing the administrative work associated with      hiring consultants at the same time that it was paying its      service contractors administrative fees. In addition,      consultants often began work before the Statement of Work was      issued to the prime contractor. This practice required the      paperwork to be backdated or ratified in order for the      consultant to be paid. We also found that consultants were      hired as federal employees and then made decisions affecting      their former contractor employer in violation of ethical      regulations. This practice was stopped by Mary Ellen Warlow,      who became the Coordinator for ICITAP and OPDAT in 1997 after      Bratt left for the INS.       We investigated allegations that ICITAP managers engaged in      favoritism in the hiring of staff. Federal employees are      hired after a competitive process that begins with the public      issuance of a vacancy announcement that describes the      application process and sets forth the responsibilities and      other particulars of the position. Managers were alleged to      have engaged in ``preselection,'' that is, they decided whom      to hire before beginning the competitive selection process      required by federal regulations.       The hiring of Jill Hogarty in particular raised complaints.      Hogarty was an attorney who worked as a bartender at Lulu's      New Orleans Cafe, an establishment located near the ICITAP      offices which was visited regularly by ICITAP Associate      Director Trincellito and other ICITAP staff. While visiting      Lulu's, Trincellito discussed ICITAP's work with Hogarty, and      eventually Trincellito invited Hogarty to consider working as      a consultant to ICITAP. Hogarty gave Trincellito her resume,      and Trincellito wrote the paperwork that resulted in her      being hired as an ICITAP consultant in September 1994.      According to Hogarty, while she was a consultant to ICITAP,      she dated Bratt for several months, from September 1995 to      December 1995. At that time Bratt had resumed his position as      Executive Officer but he retained authority to approve      personnel decisions at ICITAP. In November 1995, during the      time that Hogarty and Bratt were dating, Hogarty applied to      become a temporary federal employee at ICITAP. She was      selected by Trincellito for this position in December 1995.       On January 5, 1997, Hogarty's employment status changed      once again, and she became a permanent federal employee. It      was this selection that raised the complaint about      preselection. The vacancy announcement of the position that      Hogarty obtained opened on November 1, 1996. An ICITAP      employee who held a term position told the OIG that while the      position was still open for applications, he was discussing      the announcement for the position with another employee when      Hogarty told them it was her position and that she had been      selected for it. The employee told the OIG that even though      he was interested in the position himself, he did not apply      for it because he believed Hogarty's statement that she had      already been selected.       To investigate the allegation of preselection, we attempted      to determine which manager had selected Hogarty for the      position and the reason for the selection. The paperwork      listed Stromsem as the official requesting the recruitment.      The paperwork did not show who had made the selection,      however. All of ICITAP's top managers--Director Stromsem,      Associate Director Trincellito (who was also Hogarty's direct      supervisor), the ICITAP Deputy Directors, and Special      Assistant to the Director Hoover--denied having selected      Hogarty for the permanent position. Bratt also denied      selecting Hogarty.       We found strong evidence that Bratt and Stromsem      preselected Hogarty. An e-mail from Bratt on October 8, 1996,      showed that Bratt authorized hiring Hogarty before the      vacancy announcement that opened the position for competition      was issued. We also learned from an ICITAP administrative      official that in October or November 1996, Stromsem asked the      official to determine how they could get Hogarty health      benefits, which Hogarty did not have at that time. The      administrative official said that he and Stromsem agreed to      create a ``term'' position vacancy for Hogarty, but that      instructions came back from Bratt through Stromsem to make      the position permanent. We concluded that Bratt and Stromsem      engaged in preselection in violation of federal regulations      governing personnel hiring.       We investigated other allegations of favoritism, including      the hiring of a consultant who was the father of Stromem's      former husband's stepchildren. He was subsequently selected      by Stromsem to become an ICITAP term employee although his      qualifications for the position were questionable. He was      ultimately not hired for the term position because of the      intervention of Warlow when she became Coordinator. We      concluded that Stromsem's involvement with this hire gave      rise to the appearance of favoritism.       The OIG also received numerous allegations that Bratt gave      favored treatment to a select group of Office of      Administration and ICITAP staff and that he dated      subordinates. Although we only conducted a limited      investigation into these allegations, we found that some of      the employees who socialized with Bratt received rapid career      advancement and that Bratt was often involved in the      promotions. We saw evidence that he dated staff in the Office      of Administration and ICITAP and that in one instance he      intervened to protect the salary of a subcontractor with whom      he had a social interest but who have been found unqualified      by Office of Administration staff for the position she held.      We concluded that Bratt's actions gave right to an appearance      of favoritism.     H. Financial management       In response to allegations that ICITAP's finances were      mismanaged, the OIG examined ICITAP's financial management      system. We found that until 1997 ICITAP could not account for      its expenditures. ICITAP did not receive sufficient      information from its contractors to permit it to track      whether it received the goods and services for which it had      paid. This led to significant problems in 1997 when the State      Department, which was funding ICITAP's programs, asked for      detailed information on how the money for programs in the      Newly Independent States had been spent. ICITAP spent several      months trying to provide an acceptable answer to the State      Department's request and only succeeded by the use of      estimates and extrapolations from the financial information      ICITAP did collect. Although the OIG had advised ICITAP in      its 1994 report following an earlier investigation into      ICITAP's financial management system that ICITAP needed to      collect more detailed information from its contractors, the      problem was not remedied until after the State Department      requested detailed financial information in 1997.       We found that ICITAP did not pay sufficient attention to      the services its contractors provided and left itself      vulnerable to overcharges. In one instance, a contractor      notified ICITAP that it was unilaterally raising one of its      fees, an action not permitted by the contract. Despite this      notice, ICITAP did nothing for two years until a JMD      contracting officer noticed the overcharge. Subsequent      negotiations with the contractor resulted in reimbursement to      ICITAP of some of the money.       Office of Administration managers hired staff for the      Criminal Division by using contractor personnel for jobs that      were outside the scope of the contract under which they      worked. In 1991 the Criminal Division awarded a contract to      provide computer support     services and in 1996 the Criminal Division awarded the same      contractor a second contract for computer support services.      The contractor provided employees to work in Criminal      Division's correspondence units performing tasks such as      reading and responding to correspondence. This work was      outside the scope of the first contract, which only      authorized computer support services. The contractor also      provided employees who worked as writers, planned      conferences, published reports, and organized parties. The      services of these personnel were outside the scope of both      contracts.       We also found that Criminal Division managers failed to      adequately supervise the contract and the contractor charged      the government for the services of personnel who were      unqualified under the terms of the contract. The contract set      out very specific labor categories, such as Senior Programmer      Analyst, and set forth the tasks to be accomplished and the      qualifications for each labor category. We found problems      with 25 of 56 of the contractor's personnel under the first      contract and problems with 19 of 54 of the contractor's      personnel under the second contract. We concluded that the      minimum the contractor overcharged the government was      $1,164,702.01.       The OIG received an allegation that ICITAP had spent      substantial sums of money on an automated management      information system (IMIS) that did not function properly. Our      investigation showed that the development of IMIS was      difficult, that users were unhappy with the product, and that      a system designed to replace IMIS could not be completed by      the contractor. We concluded that managers did not adequately      analyze ICITAP's needs in the initial stages of development,      and consequently IMIS was constantly being upgraded and      modified leading to new problems. Also, the decision to use      floppy disks to transfer information from the field to      headquarters rather than develop a network capacity that      could be utilized by all users led to significant problems,      such as that the data from floppy disks was often out of date      or could not be accessed once it was received at      headquarters. IMIS and the attempt to develop the      replacement system ultimately cost more than one million      dollars. We did not investigate to determine how much      money might have been saved had IMIS been better planned.       ICITAP's lack of planning also led to a substantial cost      overrun of the translation budget for the first ILEA      conference. A hypothetical transnational crime and the      statutes of various countries were translated for the      conference. The budget for translations was $16,000; the      ultimate cost was $128,258. Lake delegated much of the      responsibility for coordinating the ILEA conference to his      assistant, who worked for a contractor. Lake's assistant      ordered large amounts of material to be translated on an      expedited basis without adequately determining the cost of      the translations. The assistant failed to research whether      some of the material was already translated and ordered some      of the material on a costly expedited basis when it was      unnecessary to do so. We concluded that Lake delegated      responsibility to someone who was not qualified to manage the      task and then failed to adequately supervise her.       We examined whether ICITAP could account for the goods it      ordered for use in Haiti by selecting 131 expensive items to      track. The investigation showed that the contractor      responsible for providing goods and services to ICITAP in      Haiti had in place an effective inventory control system and      that ICITAP could account for all but one of the selected      items.     I. Miscellaneous allegations       In this chapter we summarize the results of our      investigation of additional allegations, most of which we did      not substantiate.       We found that Bratt directed that Criminal Division excess      computers be sent to a school associated with a girlfriend,      and Deputy Executive Officer Sandra Bright initiated and      pursued the donation of computers to a school associated with      her husband. In 1996 Bratt directed that 35 computers be sent      to an elementary school in Virginia where his then girlfriend      was employed as a teacher. On one occasion in 1996 Bright      directed that 25 computers be sent to the school district in      Virginia where her husband was employed as a principal and on      another occasion in 1996 Bright directed that 30 computers be      sent to the school at which her husband was employed. We      concluded that Bratt's and Bright's actions created the      appearance of favoritism.       We did not substantiate an allegation that Robert Lockwood      was awarded an OPDAT grant because of his alleged association      with Attorney General Janet Reno. The American-Israeli      Russian Committee that Lockwood directed received a $17,000      grant from OPDAT in 1997. At the time, Lockwood was the Clerk      of Courts of Broward County, Florida, and was acquainted with      the Attorney General, although not closely so. We determined      that the Attorney General received a phone call from Lockwood      in 1997 but that they only discussed Lockwood's organization      and its mission; he did not seek any funding from her.      Lockwood became involved with OPDAT through the OPDAT      Resident Legal Advisor in Moscow. We did not find evidence      that the Attorney General encouraged anyone to award a grant      to Lockwood's Committee or that she knew that an award had      been made. We also did not find any evidence that the      Attorney General or anyone from her office took any action      after Lockwood's grant was not renewed the following year.       The remainder of the chapter discusses allegations that we      failed to substantiate concerning personnel issues, financial      matters, allegations of retaliation, and other issues.                  iii. recommendations and conclusions       In this chapter of the report, we offer a series of      recommendations to the Department, including that certain      employees receive discipline and that the Department seek      compensation from employees who improperly received money or      benefits from the Department. We also made nine      recommendations concerning systemic improvements in the areas      of travel, ethics, and training.       Bratt retired from the Department effective August 1, 2000,      and is not subject to discipline. We recommended that the      Department recover the costs of his improper use of business      class travel and his improper use of frequent flyer miles.       Lake is also not employed by the Department any longer and      is not subject to discipline. We recommended that the      Department recover the $25,000 Buyout bonus and the cost of      travel expenses that Lake improperly charged the government,      including costs associated with the November 1996 trip to      Moscow.       We found that Stromsem violated security regulations,      improperly used frequent flyer miles accrued on government      travel for personal benefit, and was involved in the      preselection of Hogarty in violation of personnel      regulations. We concluded that Stromsem's conduct warrants      the imposition of discipline. We also recommended that the      Department recover the costs of Stromsem's improper use of      frequent flyer miles.       We found that Hoover violated security regulations by      disclosing classified information to uncleared parties and by      removing classified documents to his home. We also found that      he improperly traveled on business class on a flight to      Moscow in January 1997 and that he improperly used frequent      flyer miles accrued on government travel for his personal      benefit. We concluded that Hoover's conduct warrants the      imposition of discipline. We also recommended that the      Department recover the costs of Hoover's improper use of      business class travel and frequent flyer miles.       We concluded that Trincellito's repeated failure to observe      fundamental security practices and his continued resistance      to the advice and warnings of ICITAP's security officers      warrants the imposition of discipline.       We also recommended that SEPS and other agencies      responsible for issuing security clearances carefully      consider the findings and conclusions set forth in this      report before issuing a security clearance to the individuals      most involved in the security breaches. In addition, we made      non-disciplinary recommendations with respect to two other      individuals.       During the course of the investigation, we observed various      systemic issues, and we suggested improvements for the      Department to consider relating to oversight of ICITAP and      OPDAT, security, investigative follow-up, travel, training,      performance evaluations, and early retirement programs. For      example, we recommended that the Department monitor ICITAP's      compliance with security regulations by continuing to perform      periodic unannounced security reviews.       Because many of the travel violations that we found were      apparent on the face of the travel forms, we recommended that      the Department review the process JMD uses to audit travel      vouchers. We believe the Department should offer increased      training on travel regulations to employees and secretarial      or clerical staff who process travel-related paperwork. And      we offered suggestions designed to increase Department      employees' use of frequent flyer miles for government travel      and to decrease the incidents of improper use.       We recommended that increased attention be given to the      recommendations and lessons learned from investigations. We      found that despite numerous investigations of ICITAP, the      same problems continued to surface and that managers failed      to act on investigative recommendations. Management must take      increased responsibility for ensuring that the results of      investigations are appropriately considered and addressed.                          ____________________
