 Mr. President, I know there are going to be more statements made afterward. We have just confirmed Robert Katzmann, of New York, to be United States Circuit Judge for the Second Circuit. This is to replace the very distinguished and former chief justice of the Second Circuit, Jon Newman, who has retired, or has taken senior status. I cannot say he is retired. I know how hard Judge Newman continues to work. I get reports from his former law clerk, Bruce Cohen, who is the chief counsel for the Democrats on the Judiciary Committee.  I note Judge Katzmann now for two reasons. First, of course, Vermont is in that circuit. But far more important, this is a man who was brought here at the strong urging and behest of the senior Senator from New York, my dear friend and one of the most distinguished Members of this body, Senator Daniel Patrick Moynihan, really the intellectual giant of the Senate.  I first met now Judge Katzmann when Senator Moynihan brought him to my office, and I was immediately impressed with him. This is the first circuit court judge to be confirmed this year.  Historians can determine what helped the most: the brilliance of persuasion of the distinguished Senator from New York or the brilliance of Judge Katzmann. I say that it was a symbiotic relationship that made the confirmation possible. I applaud my dear friend from across that great and beautiful Lake Champlain, my dear friend from New York, but I also commend Robert Katzmann. I thank my dear friend from Wyoming for allowing me to say this.
