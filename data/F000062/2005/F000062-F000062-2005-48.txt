 President, I rise today to honor a pioneering scientist and mathematician--Dr. John V. Wehausen. Considered one of the world's leading researchers in the field of hydrodynamics, Professor Wehausen passed away on October 6 of this year. I wish to send my sincerest condolences to his family, friends, and colleagues.  A professor emeritus of engineering science at the University of California, Berkeley, Dr. Wehausen left behind a monumental body of work and vast pioneering contributions to a number of academic fields. Some of his work, now decades old, still remains an important resource for scholars and students.  Professor Wehausen was born in Duluth, MN, and grew up in the suburbs of Chicago. He matriculated at the University of Michigan where he earned B.S. and Ph.D. degrees in mathematics as well as an M.S. in physics.  He left Ann Arbor for Brown University in Rhode Island where he not only began a long and prestigious teaching career, but also met his wife, Mary Katherine Wertime. Ms. Wehausen preceded her husband in death in 2001 after 62 years of marriage.  After Brown, Professor Wehausen spent teaching stints at Columbia University and the University of Missouri before working for the U.S. Navy during World War II in operations analysis and research and development.  In 1956, Professor Wehausen accepted a position at the University of California, Berkeley, where he taught until 1984 and where he remained an active researcher thereafter. Shortly after arriving at UC-Berkeley, Professor Wehausen helped form the Department of Naval Architecture, one of the first programs of its kind in the Nation.  During the decades he spent at UC-Berkeley, Professor Wehausen not only produced volumes of influential scholarship but also garnered a reputation as a faculty member who respected and cared for his students. A respect reciprocated by his many students.  More than a prodigious researcher and instructor, Professor Wehausen held a great love for languages, music, and literature. He gained proficiency in a number of languages and also was an accomplished musician.  Professor Wehausen has left behind a great legacy of scholarship. His many awards testify to his abilities and his determination. Among his many honors were the Davidson Medal from the Society of Naval Architects and Marine Engineers, an honorary doctorate degree from the Joseph Fourier University in France, and the International Lifetime Achievement Award from the American Society of Mechanical Engineers.  His four children all live in my home State of California, and I send them my deepest condolences at the passing of their father. Professor Wehausen made monumental contributions to the fields of math and science, and the influence of his life's work will surely live on for many generations to come.                          ____________________
