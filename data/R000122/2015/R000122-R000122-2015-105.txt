I think one of the best indications of the appropriate direction of this policy is that the Department of Defense extends benefits regardless of State law to all military personnel. Consistent with the Department of Defense, this should be done by the Department of Veterans Affairs.  So I commend the Senator. I think it is the right thing to do and the consistent thing to do and the logical thing to do.  I yield the floor.
