President, I am pleased that the Senate showed its strong support for the AmeriCorps program on Friday by defeating an amendment to strip the $100 million in emergency fiscal year 2003 funding that we in the Senate Appropriations Committee provided as part of the fiscal year 2004 Legislative branch spending bill. Without these emergency funds, Vermont will lose all but 15 to 20 of its over 100 AmeriCorps volunteers, and communities across the Nation are facing similar losses.  The dedicated young people who have answered AmeriCorps' honorable call to service contribute enormously to the strength of our communities. Whether they are helping to house the homeless, feed the hungry, or keep disadvantaged youth safe in fun and educational afterschool activities, they are often filling a sorely needed gap that the community cannot otherwise fill.  We must not let this vital part of our social safety net to unravel in Vermont and across the Nation, and that is why I am pleased to have cosponsored Senator Mikulski's amendment in the Appropriations Committee to add $100 million for AmeriCorps, and why I voted on Friday to defeat the amendment to strip the money out. I urge all of my colleagues in Congress, as well as the President, to support this emergency funding.
