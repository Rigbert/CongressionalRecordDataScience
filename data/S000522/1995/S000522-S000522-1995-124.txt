Mr. Chairman, I am concerned with the part of the amendment that would delete the phrase ``notwithstanding any other provision of law'' from the Child Survival and Disease Programs Fund in title II. I would just ask the chairman of the full committee for a clarification. If the amendment passes, can the House be assured that the money in the fund would not be used or available for population assistance?                              {time}  1315  We have such money designated. It has been used in the past. My hope is that this day on point for child survival interventions, immunizations, oral rehydration, and the like, and those things that were expressed on the bottom of page 7 and page 8 of the bill.
