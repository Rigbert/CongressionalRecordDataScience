 Mr. President, I know some of my colleagues have the sprint-for-the-airport look in their eye, trying to get home.  I am willing to sacrifice my time and spend the next month, the month of August, in Vermont, close to my constituents, onerous as that may seem.  I would be perfectly willing to accept voice votes on each of these seven judges, but I would just ask my friends: Please, don't issue a press release tomorrow saying that we only voted on one judge today.  We have already voted on one. I will take voice votes on the others.
