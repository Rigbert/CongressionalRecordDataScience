 President, before we wrap up today, I call my colleagues' attention to a truly dedicated staff member who has served the Senate for decades.  After more than three decades on the job with the Senate Sergeant at Arms, Cindy Hasiak is retiring today from her post as Chamber manager.  A native of Indiana, Cindy first arrived to work in the Capitol back in 1987. She was welcomed with--get this--a chance to work the Iran-Contra hearings. Since then, she has been on the clock for 7 Presidential inaugurations, 32 Presidential addresses and States of the Union, 6 lying-in-state ceremonies, and a great many more normal workdays, or at least what passes for normal here in the Senate.  More than three decades of landmark votes, major debates, and all the daily business that takes place in this Chamber, Cindy has been here helping make it happen.  To be specific, as one of our doorkeepers, and lately the director of doorkeepers, Cindy has literally guarded the Senate floor. Talk about a sensitive job.  Alongside the brave men and women of the Capitol Police, our doorkeepers control and manage access to this historic institution that attracts the attention of the entire world. They check credentials, welcome visitors, keep things running smoothly.  Here on the floor, they keep us safe. Up in the Galleries, they welcome visitors and give citizens a chance to watch democracy in action. So it is undoubtedly the case that the Senate has been stronger for Cindy's attentive service, but even after 32 years, we would be foolish to think we could keep her forever.  After more than her share of long days, longer weeks, and late nights that relegated entertaining and family time to the back burner, Cindy has certainly earned the chance to spend less time supervising all of us here and more time with her loved ones.  I know my colleagues join me in wishing Cindy good health and happiness as she embarks on a well-deserved retirement. She will leave with our deepest gratitude for a job well done. I might add that given the fact Cindy is from Indiana, it is appropriate that we have the Senator from Indiana as the Chair.                          ____________________
