Mr. Speaker, last week at the 15th International AIDS Conference in Bangkok, Thailand, the world's attention was drawn to the 38 million people around the world who are living with HIV--nearly a million of whom live in the United States.  Moreover, many HIV positive individuals in the United States face significant hurdles that prevent them from engaging in long-term health care, including unstable financial and housing situations and a lack of trust between patients and health care providers. As a result, approximately 250,000 individuals who are aware of their HIV status are not receiving regular primary medical care; a population the Health Resources and Services Administration defines as the ``unmet need'' in the domestic epidemic. However, the United States should not and must not consider this lack of HIV health care inevitable because solutions do exist.  With this in mind, I rise today to recognize and share with you work that is being done in my own state of Alaska to successfully bring HIV treatment and care to the people who need it. The Alaska AIDS Assistance Association in Anchorage uses ``Inter-Agency Networking'' to connect HIV positive Alaskans to a system of integrated health care and support. The activity accomplishes this by providing health care agencies with opportunities to exchange information and share resources, thus increasing the agencies understanding of community needs and enhancing their ability to provide care to more people living with HIV.  Inter-Agency Networking is indebted to a capacity-building initiative called Connecting to Care, which was developed by AIDS Action in collaboration with the Health Resource and Service Administration, Connecting to Care identified the Alaskan AIDS Assistance Association's activity as a ``model practice'' and disseminated it to more than 10,000 health providers throughout the country as a model intervention that has been successful in connecting HIV positive individuals to care. My hope is that the Connecting to Care initiative will guide other communities in their own development of activities that connect HIV positive individuals with the health care they want and need.                          ____________________
