  Mr. Speaker, when I was home over the weekend, several Vermonters asked me to make certain that I express on their behalf their sorrow at the tragic deaths of Capitol Police Officers John Gibson and Jacob Chestnut. I know that I speak for all the people of the State of Vermont as well as my wife Jane when I do just that.  Mr. Speaker, these two extraordinarily brave officers did the job that they were trained to do and that they pledged to do. When their moment of truth came on Friday, they did not shirk from their responsibilities, and they did what I think all of us hope that we have the courage and the strength to do when our moment of truth might come. They gave their lives protecting congressional staff, visitors and elected officials.  It is appropriate that we honor these men and their families because they not only protected and saved the lives of many individuals, but they helped assure that the People's House remains open to all Americans. If democracy means anything, it means that the people have the right to visit with their elected officials, to go to the meetings that are of importance to them, to make their opinions known. That is what democracy is about. It is terribly important that no deranged individual, no terrorist stops that process and closes the door. Our hearts go out to these brave officers. They are true American heroes.
