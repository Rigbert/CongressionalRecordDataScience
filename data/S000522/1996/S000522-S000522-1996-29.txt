Mr. Chairman, I move to strike the last word.  Mr. Chairman, abortion on demand is child abuse and in no way can be construed as humane or compassionate. A child's worth is not determined by who his or her mother happens to be, and the value of a baby is not diminished one iota because mom happens to be an inmate.                              {time}  1945  As a matter of fact, her God-given value is not diminished, either. The Norton amendment which would have been offered tonight and will not be offered because that point in the legislation has passed. This would have forced taxpayers to subsidize violence against children; in this case, the child of an inmate.  Mr. Chairman, many Americans are either uninformed or living in a state of denial on the general issue of abortion, especially as it relates to the gruesome reality of abortion. Abortion methods include dismembering innocent children with razor blade tip suction devices or injections of chemical poisons designed to kill the baby. If the abortion President, Bill Clinton, has his way, both partial birth abortions will remain legal and available for taxpayer subsidy as well as the newest form of baby poison, RU-486.  Mr. Chairman, abortion on demand treats pregnancy as a sexually transmitted disease. The growing child is viewed as a tumor, as a wart, a piece of trash to be destroyed. Earlier today my dad underwent some major surgery to remove cancer from his stomach. Every member of my family has been deep in prayer all day and over the last week, hoping that the surgeon removes every vestige of that horrible disease. My dad's courage--and I just say this parenthetically--his faith in God throughout all of this has been absolutely inspiring, and he is now in intensive care.  But the whole ordeal reminds me anew that the role of medicine is to heal. The role of medicine is to heal and to nurture, to cure a disease, to excise life-threatening tumors. It is not to destroy innocent unborn babies as if they were cancer.  Mr. Chairman, if you have ever watched an unborn child's image on an ultrasound or sonogram screen, you cannot help but be awed by the miracle of human life, by the preciousness of a child's being, and moved to pity by the helplessness and vulnerability of that child, by the fragility of those tiny fingers and toes. To see an unborn child turning, twisting, kicking and sucking his or her thumb while still in utero shatters the myth that abortion merely removes tissue or the products of conception.  Peel away the euphemisms that sanitize abortion and the cruelty to children, and yes, the cruelty to their mothers as well, becomes readily apparent to anyone with an open mind. The entire smoke screen of choice turns the baby into property, a thing, a commodity, and not a someone. The whole rhetoric of choice dehumanizes our brothers and sisters in the womb and puts them in the same category as cars, TV sets, stereos, and toasters. The whole rhetoric of choice reduces unborn babies to objects. The feminists had it right: Do not treat women as objects. The unborn are not objects, either, that can be killed by chemical injections or by dismemberment.  Finally, Mr. Chairman, Mother Teresa was right when she said the greatest destroyer of peace today is abortion because it is a war against the child, a direct killing of an innocent child. Any country that accepts abortion, as she goes on to say, is not teaching its people to love, but to use violence to get what they want. That is why the greatest destroyer of love and peace is abortion, and she pleads and says, ``Please don't kill the baby''.  Last year the Norton amendment was voted down by 281 members. It probably would have had the same fate tonight. It will not be considered by the House because of the lateness in arriving, but just let me say this amendment and others like that use taxpayer funds to subsidize the killing of unborn babies always ought to be defeated.                      announcement by the chairman
