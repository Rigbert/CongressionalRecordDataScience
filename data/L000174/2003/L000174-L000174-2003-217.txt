Arthur Andersen. These investors, mostly elderly, banded together to successfully recoup $217 million from Arthur Andersen. Why? Because of questionable accounting practices surrounding an investment trust. The case is just one example of how a State-based class action litigation holds corporate wrongdoers accountable and helps defrauded investors recoup their losses.  Like most Vermonters, I am a strong supporter of the environment. But I look at this bill and I think, what a green light for polluters and others responsible for environmental damages to avoid accountability in court. So many polluters, who would fear class action suits if they were to violate the law, now know they could get caught. With this legislation, they might take the old idea of: Go ahead and pollute; nobody gives a hoot. They are going to get away with it.  This legislation removes almost all important environmental class actions from State to Federal court. Not only does this deny State courts the opportunity to interpret their own State's environmental protection laws, but it also hampers and deters plaintiffs in pursuing important environmental litigation. It means we Vermonters would not have a say in our own courts--or those in Utah or in any other State.  Under this bill, environmental class action suits may not get litigated, reducing the incentive to keep our environment clean. Plaintiffs' attorneys may not be willing to take these high-risk, high-cost, and time-consuming cases, particularly when what they are looking for is injunctive relief. That is an injunction to stop the polluter from polluting. Intentionally or not, this bill protects polluters and ignores innocent victims of their negligence.  Just a few months ago, as I recall, we read about a horrible toxic dumping situation in Alabama and a monumental settlement in State court to clean up an entire community. It was in State court, though--in State court.  In Anniston, AL, the Monsanto Company manufactured PCBs--carcinogens--from 1929 to 1971. For more than 40 years, in arrogant--arrogant--disgusting disregard of people's health and the environment, Monsanto dumped untreated, unfiltered waste from its PCB plant into the streams and landfills of Anniston. They never let the residents--many of whom actually worked, and worked very hard, for Monsanto--they never let them know of the horrific risk to their environment and their health.  When the undeniable truth of Monsanto's malfeasance became clear, several thousand residents of Anniston sued in State court. They recently won a liability jury verdict. When the case moved into the damages phase, Monsanto was not out there defending and saying: Well, we did not do something bad. They knew they did something terrible. They did not start arguing about: Well, people were not injured by it. They knew they were injured by it.  So what did they do? They tried to get the judge removed. That is what they tried to do. Although the Alabama Supreme Court, a conservative supreme court, had already held that the trial judge was acting properly, Monsanto continued to oppose his participation. They tried everything they possibly could do to confuse people and escape facing up to the issues. They then had to focus on the merits of the case and settled with the local residents for $600 million and pledged to pay additional cleanup costs for the town.  The Alabama Supreme Court, the Alabama State court, did this very well. Not under this bill. Under this bill, it would have been yanked away from those courts, yanked away from the Alabama State court, yanked away from the Alabama Supreme Court, and stuck into Federal court.  Why? More than 100 people lived in Anniston. Even though all the peoplesuffered, they lived just a block or a driveway from each other. We, those of us who say we really care about States having their rights, would reach down and yank it right out of the State and say: You are not good enough to handle the case that involves your own people.  Cases such as this one would provide hard evidence that our State-based civil justice system is working--it is working--to protect the environment and to protect victims of polluters, and there is no reason to prefer a Federal reform for resolution of their claims. State courts, unlike the Federal courts, have a sound understanding of evolving local law and the open dockets to resolve conflicts in a manner that would protect our society from polluters.  In fact, we ought to at least ask, Do the Federal courts want this? The Judicial Conference, headed by Chief Justice William Rehnquist, wrote a letter in March of this year opposing this bill because its ``provisions would add substantially to the workload of the federal courts and are inconsistent with principles of federalism.''  They singled out serious environmental disasters as an example of class actions that should remain in State courts.  Chief Justice Rehnquist and the Judicial Conference said: What are you doing to us? Why are you sending these cases over there? State courts can handle them better.  I would be a very wealthy person if I had a couple dollars for every time I heard speeches or statements from my fellow Senators about how we have to better respect our individual States. After all, that is why we have a Senate. Each one of the 50 States has equal representation here to make sure the States are not subsumed in the Federal system. Those who would support this bill are giving the back of their hand to their States and saying: You are not smart enough, you are not good enough to take care of the laws of your own State.  Numerous organizations devoted to the protection of the environment oppose this bill, including Clean Water Action, Earthjustice, the Environmental Working Group, Friends of the Earth, Greenpeace, the Mineral Policy Center, the Natural Resources Defense Council, the Sierra Club, and the U.S. Public Interest Research Group.  These advocates conclude, in a letter, this bill ``would benefit polluters at the expense of people and communities harmed by public health and environmental disasters.'' I ask unanimous consent their letter be printed in the Record.  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in the Record, as follows:                                                    April 2, 2003.     Hon. Orrin Hatch, Chair,     Hon. Patrick Leahy, Ranking Member,     Committee on the Judiciary, U.S. Senate, Washington, DC.       Dear Chairman Hatch and Ranking Member Leahy: We are      writing to express our opposition to S. 274, the so-called      ``Class Action Fairness Act of 2003.'' This legislation would      not be fair to citizens bringing class action cases based on      state environmental or public health protection laws who wish      to have their cases heard by their state's courts. The bill      would allow corporate defendants in pollution class actions      to remove virtually any type of state environmental law case      from state court to federal court, placing such cases in a      forum that could be more costly, less timely, and      disadvantageous to the citizen plaintiffs. We urge you to      oppose this anti-environmental legislation.       Class actions protect the public's health and the      environment by allowing people with similar injuries to join      together for more efficient and cost-effective adjudication      of their cases. All too often, hazardous spills or toxic      contamination from one source affects large numbers of      people, not all of whom may be citizens of the same state. In      such cases, a class action lawsuit based on state common law      doctrines of negligence or nuisance, or upon rights and      duties created by state statutes, is often the best way of      resolving the claims. Recent examples of such incidents      include the Asarco lead contamination in eastern Omaha, the      Nicor Gas mercury spills in suburban Chicago, and emissions      from an illegally operated rock quarry in San Rafael,      California--incidents that harmed thousands of people--as      well as many cases in which injured plaintiffs have sought      access to medical monitoring in the wake of a community's      toxic exposure.       S. 274 would benefit polluters in state environmental class      actions by allowing them to remove these claims from state      courts that may be better equipped to handle them to federal      courts where the judges are likely to be less familiar with      state law. This removal could occur even if the citizen      plaintiffs object.       The bill would even allow polluters to remove to federal      courts cases brought by more than one hundred plaintiffs even      if the citizens do not seek certification as a class. One      such case is underway now in Anniston, Alabama, where a state      court jury is currently deciding damages to be paid by      Monsanto and Solutia for injuring more than 3,500 people the      jury found were exposed, with the companies' knowledge, to      cancer-causing PCBs over many years. There is little doubt in      the Anniston case that, had S. 274 been law, the defendants      would have tried to remove the case from the state court      serving the community that suffered this devastating harm.       Allowing defendants to remove to cases such as these that      properly belong in state court--even cases based solely on      state law--is not only unfair to the injured parties in the      state law cases, it will needlessly delay justice for all in      the overburdened federal courts, creating delays for those      parties in environmental cases whose claims must be heard in      federal court, as well as for other parties who require a      federal forum.       Last month, the Judicial Conference of the United States      wrote to your committee stating the continued opposition of      the Judicial Conference to broadly written class action      removal legislation. Their letter states that, even if      Congress determines that some ``significant multistate class      actions'' should be brought within the removal jurisdiction      of the federal courts, Congress should include certain      limitations and exceptions, including for class actions ``in      which plaintiff class members suffered personal injury or      personal property damage within the state, as in the case of      a serious environmental disaster.'' The letter explains that      this ``environmental harm'' exception should apply ``to all      individuals who suffered personal injuries or losses to      physical property, whether or not they were citizens of the      state in question.'' S. 274 does not provide any exception      for environmental harm cases.       As U.S. Supreme Court Chief Justice Rehnquist has stated in      the past, ``Congress should commit itself to conserving the      federal courts as a distinctive judicial forum of limited      jurisdiction in our system of federalism. Civil and criminal      jurisdiction should be assigned to the federal courts only to      further clearly defined national interests, leaving to the      state courts the responsibility for adjudicating all other      matters.'' The so-called ``Class Action Fairness Act'' does      not conserve the federal forum but would allow corporate      polluters who harm the public's health and welfare to exploit      that forum whenever they perceive an advantage to defending      class actions in federal court, regardless of whether the      class action would be better adjudicated in a state court.       We urge you to oppose S. 274, legislation that would      benefit polluters at the expense of people and communities      harmed by public health and environmental disasters.
