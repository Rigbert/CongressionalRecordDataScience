 The proposal would not raise taxes on the middle class, rather it would provide a tax cut for the middle class.  Finally, while the proposal taxes workers' health insurance, Senator McCain is providing the same workerswith a tax credit, which is a bigger tax benefit than low- and middle-income workers receive under our current system.  I am going to slow down. Let me explain how health insurance is currently taxed. And the reason is because it is vitally important that my Senate colleagues and my friends in the media understand the current rules governing the taxation of health insurance. To be clear, there are very distinct tax rules that apply to, one, an individual purchasing their health insurance; two, an employer paying for all or a portion of its employees' health insurance; and, three, workers purchasing insurance through their employer.  Unfortunately, most people mix up these three different kinds of tax rules. For example, far too often I have heard people get the employee exclusion, which I will explain in a moment, confused with the employer business deduction. So I have a chart that lays it out. Employee exception and employer business deduction is not equal. Employee exclusion is for the worker; employer business deduction is for the employer.  The employee exclusion is there. Well, a worker purchasing health care through his or her employer does not pay income or payroll taxes on the cost of the health insurance policy.  In other words, the amount of health insurance coverage that is paid for by the employer is excludable from income. This means that the cost of the employer-provided health insurance is not taxable for income or payroll tax purposes.  In addition, the amount of the health insurance coverage that is paid for by the individual worker on their own behalf through a salary reduction arrangement reduces the worker's taxable income. This means that a worker has less income on which to pay income and payroll taxes.  As the chart says, the employee's exclusion is the tax benefit provided to the worker. Let's drill down on the employee exclusion for a moment. I want to explain how this tax benefit works.  Tax 101 teaches us that the tax benefit that you get from a tax exclusion, just like a tax deduction, is based on the tax bracket you are in. This means if you are in a high tax bracket, you receive a bigger tax benefit than someone in a lower tax bracket. So it is very regressive.  Here is a chart that illustrates how regressive the current employee exclusion of the cost of employer-provided health insurance really is.  So we have a new chart. Take a look at it. Here we assume that the average cost of a family's health insurance policy would be about $12,000. After all, the coverage that Members of Congress get costs around $12,000. So this ought to be a good number to use. As you can see, a worker in the 10-percent tax bracket would receive 1,200 dollars' worth of benefits. Compare this with a tax benefit that an upper income worker receives, and you find out it is $4,200 a year, a great amount of inequity.  We have to ask ourselves, is it fair that low- and middle-income workers receive a smaller tax benefit for health insurance than upper income workers receive?  Now, what is the employer business deduction? Here an employer paying for all or a portion of its employees' health insurance can deduct the amounts they pay as ordinary and necessary business expenses, no different than the employer can deduct wages. In essence, the Tax Code treats employer contributions for health benefits as compensation. This is consistent with how economists view employer contributions for health benefits. It is as simple as that.  It is important to note that the employer business deduction is a tax benefit provided to the employer. So we put the original chart back up. I did not want to leave out another very important tax benefit for health insurance, or should I say, the lack of a tax benefit. I am speaking about the fact that people who purchase their own health insurance generally do not receive a tax benefit under our current laws.  They could if they were self-employed, but I am talking about people not self-employed or not otherwise employed or employed where they do not have health insurance, and you want to buy it on your own. In this case, the individual purchases his or her own insurance with aftertax dollars out of their own pocket. These individuals are able to deduct medical expenses that exceed 7.5 percent of their adjusted gross income, but only if the individual itemizes their return. And exceeding the 7.5 percent of gross income to get an income tax deduction for health care and health insurance is not very common. That is why only about 6 percent of all tax returns claim the deduction above that 7.5 percent.  Let's now turn to how changing the current tax rules in the same manner, as contemplated by Senator McCain, would affect people and would affect employers. I want to explain to my friends who are critics, and I have told you who those Senators are, and my friends in the media, how the McCain tax credit for health insurance would actually work.  We can quickly cross the impact any changes would have on employers off the list right away. The reason: As I have said two or three times, employers will not be affected, contrary to what several Senators have said criticizing the health insurance plan of Senator McCain. Everyone needs to understand this key fact because the critics keep getting it wrong.  In other words, let me say for a fourth or fifth time: Employers will not be affected by how the McCain tax plan works.  Let's talk about individuals purchasing their own health insurance. As I mentioned, under the current tax laws, these people generally do not get a tax benefit. The McCain tax credit for health insurance proposal would give these people a meaningful tax benefit and do it for the very first time. The tax credit could be used by the individual to reduce the cost of their health insurance. In this case, the individual would not be required to spend as much of their own hard-earned money on health insurance as they do under the current system.  If the tax credit exceeds the pricetag of the individual's health insurance policy, the excess may be used for other health care expenses. You could use it like for copays or deductibles.  Now we get to the most important part. I am going to explain how workers will be affected by the McCain tax credit for health insurance. I would like all of my colleagues, whether you are Republican or Democrat, and particularly my friends in the media, to pay close attention because the senior Senator from Arizona has structured his tax credit for health insurance in a very unique way.  Let's get back to the basic. As I stated, health insurance that a worker purchases through his or her employer is not taxable to the worker. Again, this is referred to as the employee exclusion. The exclusion, however, has two parts. So we will look at a new chart.  No. 1, the worker does not pay income taxes on the cost of coverage; and, two, the worker does not pay payroll taxes on the cost of coverage. Very clear on the chart. The proposal advanced by my friend from Arizona would maintain the payroll tax exclusion. So let me repeat. The cost of health insurance a worker gets through their employer would not be taxed for payroll tax purposes. This goes for the employer as well.  That is why I have emphasized that the employers do not pay any taxes under the McCain plan. With regard to income taxes, Senator McCain converts the current income tax exclusion into a tax credit. Let me say it another way. The McCain tax credit for health insurance proposals does not eliminate the income tax exclusion. Instead, the income tax exclusion is converted to a tax credit.  So here, let's go back to tax 101. As I discussed earlier, tax 101 teaches us that a tax exclusion, just like a tax deduction, is tied to your tax bracket. A tax credit, on the other hand, is not tied to your tax bracket. Rather, the tax credit reduces your tax liability dollar for dollar. This means that, by definition, a tax credit is more valuable to a lower-income taxpayer. So if you were to convert the income tax exclusion into a tax credit, you would effectively be increasing the tax benefits for low-income workers.  Depending on the dollar amount of the tax credit, this would also be true for middle-income workers as well. So this is what I am saying: I am saying the McCain tax credit for health insurance is effectively increasing the taxbenefit for low- and middle-income workers. I am saying the McCain tax credit makes the tax treatment of health insurance more equitable because every worker is receiving the same tax benefit.  How can some of my friends on the other side oppose making the current tax treatment of health insurance more equitable? Do my friends not want to help out low- and middle-income workers? Let me show my colleagues and my friends in the media how the McCain tax credit for health insurance produces a tax cut.  Under the proposal, the health insurance a worker purchases through his or her employer would be taxed like compensation for income tax purposes. But, unlike compensation paid in the form of taxes, the proposal would not subject the cost of employer-provided health insurance to payroll taxes, as I have discussed. This means that amount of taxes a worker would be required to pay on the cost of their health insurance would only depend on the worker's income tax bracket.  Under the proposal, the worker would apply the tax credit against the new income tax liability that is generated from taxing the worker's health insurance.  In other words, the tax credit would offset any new income tax liability. As illustrated in this chart, because the new income tax liability would be less than the tax credit, the worker would actually receive a tax cut.  So let's take a closer look at the chart. We have several different brackets. Let's assume a family of four purchases a family health insurance policy of $12,000 through its employer. Under the proposal, this family would pay income taxes on a $12,000 policy. Let's assume this family would be in the 25-percent tax bracket. This family would pay $3,000 in additional income taxes. This new tax liability would be offset by a $5,000 tax credit for family health insurance. As a result, $2,000 would be left over. This means the family would receive a $2,000 tax cut. This is a tax cut that would be greater if a family purchased even less expensive coverage.  As we can see, the tax credit for health insurance produces a tax cut for all workers. The tax cut is progressive because workers in the 10-percent bracket are receiving almost five times the tax cuts for the workers in the 35-percent tax bracket.  You can see again, by looking at the chart, that a worker in the 10-percent tax bracket would receive a $3,800 tax cut, compared to the tax cut for an upper income worker in the 35-percent tax bracket of $800.  Like most campaign-related proposals, there are a number of questions of how the idea will impact people in the long run. As the senior Republican tax writer, I will ask these questions. If I determine that Congress needs to tweak the proposal here or there to improve it, I will recommend that we do so. But only time will tell whether we have to undertake such an exercise.  I hope my friends on the other side and those in the media have heard me. I hope they work on getting it right because it is clear, No. 1, that the McCain tax credit for health insurance produces a tax cut for workers; two, that the McCain tax credit for health insurance provides a tax benefit to people purchasing their own insurance and doing this for the very first time; and, three, that the proposal does not adversely impact employers in any way, shape, or form.                               Exhibit 1                           [From CBSNews.com]               The Truth About McCain and Insurance Taxes       Washington, September 15, 2008.--It's one of the most      explosive and important political charges of the election:      ``He wants to tax your health benefits,'' Barack Obama said.       Obama's charge was that that John McCain wants to tax the      health insurance benefits. Americans buy through employers,      CBS News correspondent Wyatt Andrews reports.       ``That's a $3.6 trillion tax potentially increase on middle      class families,'' Obama said. ``That will eventually leave      tens of millions of you paying higher taxes.''       John McCain wants a multi-trillion dollar tax on the middle      class? Here are the facts.       Obama has the tax part correct, but the impact on the      middle class is exaggerated--most people will see tax cuts.       McCain has proposed to end one of the largest tax breaks in      the entire economy. Some 60 million Americans buy health      insurance thru employers tax-free, and McCain would indeed      begin to tax the value of the benefit.       However McCain also proposes to give the money back as a      tax credit, $2,500 for individuals, $5,000 for families.      ``Let's give them a $5,000 refundable tax credit to go out      and get the health insurance of their choice,'' McCain said.      ``It's mostly a tax break,'' said Len Burman of the Tax      Policy Center.       The non-partisan Tax Policy Center says except for the very      richest Americans, most people buying insurance will see a      tax cut.       ``Families at all income levels would pay lower taxes, at      least on average,'' said Burman. ``On average, is about a      $1,200 tax cut in 2009.''       On the issue of energy, meanwhile Gov Palin touts her      energy expertise based on Alaska's production.       ``My job has been to oversee nearly 20 percent of the U.S.      domestic supply of oil and gas,'' she said.       Here are the facts: According to the Energy Department,      Palin's numbers are high.       Alaska provides 14.3 percent of America's crude oil, and      only 2.6 percent of its natural gas. You can check out the      Energy Information Administration statistics here.       On the health care debate, the Obama campaign tells CBS      News that one day, the middle class will be hit by a McCain      tax increase--but the experts CBS News consulted said that      day is 10 years away.
