Chairman, reclaiming my time, I think the gentleman makes a very cogent observation. I had the opportunity to meet just within the last 30 days with the Secretary of the Department of Health in Maryland, and he made that exact point, needing such a registry. So that not only would it assist school officials and health officials, but it would preclude children from being overimmunized, as well as making sure that children who are not get that which they need. So that it has both sanguine effects from that standpoint.  I appreciate the gentleman's observations.  Does the gentleman from Texas want additional time?
