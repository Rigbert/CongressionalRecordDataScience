Speaker, today I rise to express my strong support for H. Res. 296, which recognizes the 100th anniversary of one of America's greatest companies--the Harley-Davidson Motor Company.  For one hundred years, Harley-Davidson has been a testament to American hard work, perseverance, and ingenuity. Today, Harley-Davidson remains an American institution and is recognized all over the world as the manufacturer of the best motorcycles in the world.  Born in Milwaukee, Wisconsin, the company retains its domestic roots by maintaining production facilities in Missouri, Alabama, Pennsylvania, and, of course, Wisconsin. I am proud to have in my district, Harley-Davidson powertrain operations in Wauwatosa and Menomonee Falls, and a product development center in Wauwatosa.  I am pleased to echo the sentiments of former President Ronald Reagan, who called Harley-Davidson ``an American success story''. To all the members of the Harley-Davidson family, please allow me to express my sincerest congratulations on the 100th anniversary of this great American company.
