President, I am pleased to join with Senators DeWine, Hatch and Voinovich in introducing bipartisan legislation to provide common-sense tax incentives to help address asbestos liability issues.  I agree with Supreme Court Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg in the Amchem Products decision that Congress can provide a secure, fair and efficient means of compensating victims of asbestos exposure.
