Speaker, I thank the majority leader for that observation.  Obviously, we disagree, as he knows, on the success or failure of the ACA. As a matter of fact, every health organization in America, every major health organization in America opposed the repeal, a bill that came to the floor.  Senator McCain, I thought, gave a very powerful exhortation to all of us when he said, on July 25, we ought to do this in a bipartisan way.  We found, now, three efforts to repeal by the majority party, who control all three--the Senate, the House, and the Presidency--an inability to do that.  Mr. Speaker, I believe--and I would hope the majority leader would pursue efforts, and we would do the same on our side. We believe the ACA has been working.  We believe that 20-plus million more people are insured under the ACA than were insured before the ACA.  We believe people with preexisting conditions were able to get insurance. We believe seniors saved substantial money in purchasing prescription drugs as a result of that.  We believe that people did not have--we know they did not have the specter of being canceled because their expenses in any one year were above a limit and that their lifetime limitswould not be imposed when they get a serious critical illness.  So we think it worked.  The majority has tried to repeal it. They have not succeeded at this point in time, but they have created, Mr. Speaker, great anxiety and uncertainty in the marketplace.  And to the extent, for instance, that premiums have risen in our State, the head of Blue Cross/Blue Shield, the largest insurer in our State, said the reason for at least 50 percent was the uncertainty that had been created by the administration and by the debates that have occurred in this House and the proposals that have occurred in this House, which have undermined the market.  I talked to him the other day, and he said, in fact, if there were stability, he believes rates would come down significantly because insurance companies, providers, would have an opportunity to have a stable environment in which they could assess the cost of health insurance.  Did the majority leader want to say anything?  I yield to my friend.  Mr. McCARTHY. Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentleman for yielding.  Mr. Speaker, the only thing I want to say, and I know we have debated this many times--we can always put an endorsement somewhere and we can always go back and forth, but I will just tell you for my own district--I don't know why anybody would ever say they are making a decision based on something when our bill carries it out another 2 years even, so I don't believe that to be true.  But I know what is true. Currently, 30 percent of the people who are on the exchange in my district just had somebody pull out; and they had that health insurance, Anthem, so now they don't. They have to go find something else. They had doctors who they loved, and they were promised that they were going to be able to keep them. Well, they couldn't.  I just look at numbers; and I take Republican, Democrat, I take whatever name is across from it. Almost twice as many people pay the penalty or take a waiver as actually make a payment for ObamaCare.                              {time}  1215  So, yes, this will continue not because you and I have a disagreement, but because people are hurting, premiums are going up, deductibles are going up, and people are losing their providers. And the providers are not leaving because it is staying the same way for another 2 years, they are leaving because it is staying there.  So, yes, I look forward to continuing this conversation because we cannot allow this harm to continue to go through this country.
