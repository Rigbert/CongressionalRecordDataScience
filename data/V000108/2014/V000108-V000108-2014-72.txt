Chairman, I rise to make just a couple of points.  The gentleman noted that the last BRAC in 2005, if I am correct, is not going to save money until 2018. That implies it is going to save money in 2018. The concern I have is we do have to think about the future budgets for the Department of Defense, and sometimes we have to make hard decisions in years like 2014 so that we can begin to accrue savings in the out-years.  I mentioned in my opening statements and more than once over the last couple of days--but I feel compelled to do it again--that I do have a concern about Congress' continued failure to confront our long-term fiscal challenges relative to the Department of Defense. The Department of Defense proposed significant initiatives, including military pay adjustments, the restructuring of TRICARE, changes in commissaries, the retirement of several weapons programs--the A-10, the Kiowa Warriors, and others--to provide for future flexibility and to meet our national security strategy.  A number of the proposals--I am not saying they all have incredible value--do possess merit, but with few exceptions, these proposals have not gained any traction in Congress. Most have been excluded in language, prohibiting or postponing the start in the most recently passed National Defense Authorization Act. I certainly don't dismiss the results and impacts on many Members' congressional districts, but, again, I don't think we should foreclose any options to consider in order to possibly save money in the out-years.  I would make the observation, although I am not going to vote against the gentleman's amendment, that we have got to stop saying ``no'' to everything. We have got to start saying ``yes'' to some things, but, unfortunately, for the last 2 days, all we have been doing is saying, ``Don't do anything.''  I appreciate the gentleman's amendment, and I yield back the balance of my time.
