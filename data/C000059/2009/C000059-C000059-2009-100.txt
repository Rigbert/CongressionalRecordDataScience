San Clemente has been fortunate to have dynamic and dedicated community leaders who willingly and unselfishly give their time and talent and make their communities a better place to live and work. Truman Benedict is one of these individuals. On February 19, 2009, the San Clemente Chamber of Commerce will honor Truman with their ``Outstanding Lifetime Achievement Award.''  Truman Benedict moved to San Clemente in 1949, along with his wife Betty. A credentialed teacher educated at Whittier College in Los Angeles, Truman first began teaching seventh graders at Las Palmas. A Superintendent who had originally come to the ``village,'' as San Clemente was known, in 1944, selected Truman for the job of seventh grade teacher.  While renting a place on Avenida Pelayo, Truman continued for five years to teach at Las Palmas School where he worked for $180 a month. Truman Benedict became Principal of Las Palmas School, and in 1956 was named Superintendent of the San Clemente Elementary School District, which included Las Palmas and Concordia schools.  In 1965 when the Capistrano Unified School District, encompassing San Juan Capistrano, Capistrano Beach and San Clemente, was formed, Truman was named Assistant Superintendent in charge of curriculum and the certifying of teaching personnel. He eventually became Superintendent, then Deputy Superintendent of the district. From there Truman went on to serve as a San Clemente City Councilman, City Mayor and member of and volunteer for many civic groups.  Teaching came natural to Truman Benedict. As the smallest person in Los Angeles to ever play varsity basketball, Truman expected a lot of himself, and said that he was inspired by teachers who expected a lot out of him in return. Truman became a teacher because he enjoyed school and working with kids. It follows that in his career he was most often called upon to handle the older and brightest children.  In addition to his distinguished career as an educator and public servant, Truman is also a patriot; he served four years in the U.S. Armed Forces as P38 pilot. He was married to his wife Betty for 45 years until she passed away. Truman and Betty have two daughters, Sally and Nancy, and four grandchildren. The Truman Benedict School is named after him and Truman was named the 1990 San Clemente Citizen of the Year.  Truman's tireless passion for community service and education has contributed immensely to the betterment of the community of San Clemente, California. I am proud to call Truman a fellow community member, American and friend. I know that many community members are grateful for his service and salute him as he receives the ``Outstanding Lifetime Achievement Award.''                          ____________________
