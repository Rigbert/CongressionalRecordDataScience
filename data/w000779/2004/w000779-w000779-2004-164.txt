He has worked very closely with Senator Smith and me, and we appreciate that. If it doesn't cause any great travail, I was interested in speaking for maybe 10 minutes on a health care issue. I see our friend from Colorado. Maybe something could be worked out among the three of us whenever the chairman has completed his remarks. I think at 1:30 the rule kicks in where you can address other issues. If something could be worked out, it would be helpful.
