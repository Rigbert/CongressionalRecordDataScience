President, I thank the Senator from Colorado for his amendment. He is a Senator who continues to demonstrate his interest and ability in bringing us together rather than seeking to drive wedges between us. We can all agree that English should be the common language of the United States. His is a good suggestion for an alternative that I will support. In many local communities and States, it may well be useful and helpful for the Government to reach out to language minorities. Greater participation and information are good things. We should not be mandating artificial and shortsighted restrictions on State and local government.  I have spoken in the course of this debate about my belief that immigrants should learn the English language. In my experience, most new Americans want to learn our language and make efforts to do so as quickly as possible. The bill that we are debating calls for immigrants to learn English as one the several steps they must take before they can earn citizenship.  I certainly understand why the Mexican American Legal Defense and Education Fund, the Asian American Justice Center, the Lawyer's Committee for Civil Rights, the National Council of La Raza, the National Association of Latino Elected and Appointed Officials Educational Fund and others have been concerned about the Inhofe amendment. I share their concerns. I strongly support the efforts of the Senator from Colorado to find a common ground to unite us rather than divide us and strongly support his alternative amendment.
