Speaker, I yield myself 1 minute.  Mr. Speaker, the gentleman from Michigan is right. The Supreme Court is not required to accept congressional findings. In the cases that I have cited, they have given great deference to congressional findings. Here in the Stenberg case, the Supreme Court accepted the findings of the district court. We believe the district court's findings were in error. That is why there are extensive findings contained in H.R. 760 which we hope are substantiated by extensive hearing records and that the Supreme Court will give the same type of deference that it has done in the past in civil rights and employment cases.  Mr. Speaker, I yield 5 minutes to the gentleman from Ohio (Mr. Chabot).
