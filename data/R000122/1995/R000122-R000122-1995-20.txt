Speaker, I call today on the Republican leadership and my President to resolve the current shutdown of the Federal Government. The livelihood of many Americans and the stability of our Nation's political system demand as much.  I have heard from many Rhode Islanders who are upset and confused. They may all have different concerns, but they all share a common question--why did this happen?  Rhode Islanders realize that the current impasse did not have to occur. They understand that the House is behind in its work. They know that instead of passing appropriations bills in a timely, responsible manner, this House has been playing politics.  Each year this House has the duty to establish priorities and appropriate the funds to meet them. There are 13 such bills and they are supposed to be sent to the President before the start of the fiscal year.  Regrettably, this House, and, in particular, this new Republican leadership failed in this task. Instead of seeking bipartisan support for a fair, balanced budget, the Speaker crafted an extreme plan that included unnecessary cuts in essential programs like Medicare and education. More importantly, Mr. Speaker, this failure shut down the Government.  Balancing the budget is important, but there can be no progress in this environment of hostility. The majority has failed to get the appropriations bills to the President. Now, they must be responsible and end the shutdown. A clean continuing resolution is the best and only solution. Moreover, it would provide the only real framework for the bipartisan solution the American people want.  Mr. Speaker, I urge you to do the right thing and end this game.                          ____________________
