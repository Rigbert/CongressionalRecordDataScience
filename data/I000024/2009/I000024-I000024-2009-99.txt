A lot of people have changed their mind and have gone back and forth on it. I think at the time Senator Warner was here, he actually took a couple of positions.  I look at it simply. I have been concerned about the funding and about some of what we need to have. We all had different ideas on the additional F-22s. I look at this and I see that the only current U.S. military aircraft with a new engine source is the F-16. All the rest have single engine sources. It has worked well, and there is no military requirement for the alternate engine.  I have come to the conclusion it would cost over $5 billion to fund the alternate engine and, over the next year, it will cost the program--I have seen estimates from 50 to 80 aircraft, according to the program manager.  Congress has directed three studies on the alternative engine, and we have gone over studies in our Armed Services Committee. Two out of the three studies of the alternate engine stated there would never be any cost savings associated with the competition.  There has never been actual data--only anecdotal--that proves there was ever any cost savings brought about by what someone called the ``great engine war'' on the F-16s.  It seems to me it is a savings without the alternate engine, which will allow us to have more capability, more aircraft.  I strongly support the Lieberman-McCain amendment.  I yield the floor.
