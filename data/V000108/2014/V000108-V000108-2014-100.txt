 Using the same rationale as to my opposition for the previous amendment, I would support the gentleman's because what he would do is remove the limitation, if it is making sense, to allow us to reduce, convert, decommission, or otherwise move to nondeployed status these silos. I don't suggest, while standing here on the floor today, what we should or should not do, but we should allow the administration of this country those options.  I appreciate the gentleman's offering his amendment.
