 We need balance for the people who are the issuers of stock in the public domain. But, on the other hand, we need some safeguards for the investor. If you do not have balance in a situation, you are going to have trouble later.  I believe this bill is not a panacea. This bill is fraught with danger. I think it is a bad bill the way it is constructed today, but it could have been a good bill if we had stayed with the basics and if we were able to work out a bipartisan approach to a very serious thing, and that is excessive litigation.  No one, I believe, in his right mind could do anything but agree that a lot of litigation is out of control in America. But how do you balance that? I believe we have that responsibility and obligation, to make sure it is balanced, especially when you are dealing with people who probably are not going to be as sophisticated about the marketplace as people who come to the marketplace, but will invest their life savings and will invest everything they have. And what remedy will they have in the future as victims? I think this is what some of this is about.
