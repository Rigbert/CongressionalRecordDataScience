Speaker, it gives me great pleasure to rise today to congratulate Dr. Francisco F. and Geraldine Levinson on their receipt of the 1997 Merrillville Exchange Club's Book of Golden Deeds Award. Dr. and Mrs. Levinson will receive this award at a luncheon held at the Radisson Hotel at Star Plaza in Merrillville, IN, tomorrow, June 12, 1997. The Levinsons will be joined by friends and family on this special occasion.  The Exchange Club, a national organization devoted to a variety of initiatives involving the Nation's youth, the well-being of its communities, and responsibility of its citizens, bestows the Book of Golden Deeds Award upon individuals who have accepted leadership roles in bettering the communities and/or world in which they live. The Levinsons have been awarded the Book of Golden Deeds Award, the most distinguished award the service club can bestow, for their many contributions to the communities of Gary and Merrillville.  The Levinsons have positively impacted these communities by contributing their time and energy in the areas of health, community organizations, and sports. Dr. Levinson served on the Gary Board of Health for 25 years, and the Indiana State Board of Health for 20 years. Among his many accomplishments while with these organizations was his instrumental role in bringing water fluoridation to the area's filtration system. Dr. and Mrs. Levinson were also essential in the erection of the main building for the Lake County Association for Retarded Children.  In addition, Dr. and Mrs. Levinson have devoted their efforts to numerous volunteer organizations. Dr. Levinson served 5 years of active duty in the U.S. Army, followed by 29 years in the Active Reserves, from which he retired as a lieutenant colonel. He was also an active member of the Gary Exchange Club where he instituted the Toothbrush fund raiser, which successfully raised money for the organization by selling toothbrushes to large corporations. Dr. Levinson has also maintained leadership positions in numerous professional, civic, and community service organizations. Over the years, he has served as president of the Gary Dental Association, the Northwest Indiana Dental Association, the Indiana State Dental Association, Jewish War Veterans, and B'nai B'rith. He has also served on the board of directors for the YMCA, Jewish Welfare Federation, and Consumer Credit Counseling of Northwest Indiana.  Mrs. Levinson has been active in many community organizations, as well, including the Methodist Hospital Auxiliary, the Job Corps Agency, Israel Bond Drive, Jewish Federation, Temple Beth-El, and Temple Israel. She was also a soloist for the Macedonian Choir, and has served on the auxiliary of the Northwest Indiana Dental Society.  The Levinsons have also devoted much time to promoting sports within the community. Over the past 10 years, the Levinsons have been positive influences on the members of the Merrillville High School tennis team, during which Dr. Levinson has acted as a volunteer assistant coach. Creating organizations for community sporting activities has also been a priority for the Levinsons. Some of their endeavors have included the highly successful Gary Junior Tennis Association and the Ross Township Tennis and Racquet Club. The Levinsons were also very active in Club Vida, a social, athletic, and recreational club, where Dr. Levinson was the financial manager of theClub Vida basketball team. In 1940, Dr. Levinson coached the basketball team all the way to the first game of a national championship at Denver, CO.  Other awards Dr. Levinson has received include the Sagamore of the Wabash Award, presented by former Indiana Governor, Robert Orr, and the Lugar Fitness Award, presented by U.S. Senator, the Honorable Richard Lugar. The Sagamore of the Wabash Award is the most prestigious award granted by the Governor of Indiana.  Mr. Speaker, I ask you and my other distinguished colleagues to join me in commending Dr. Francisco F. and Geraldine Levinson on their receipt of the 1997 Merrillville Exchange Club's Book of Golden Deeds Award. Their children, Eileen Samuelson and Don Levinson, five grandchildren, and three great-grandchildren, can be proud of the hard work and dedication the Levinsons have displayed while working to improve the quality of life for the residents of Indiana's First Congressional District.                          ____________________
