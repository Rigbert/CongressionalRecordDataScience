President, we have come a long way. I am sorry I wasn't here to hear Senator Boxer's remarks, but I am sure I agree with the remarks of the chairman of the committee.  We are down now to a manageable number of amendments. We are working very diligently, and I understand there are two Republican amendments and four Democratic amendments. The time is here for us to do everything we can to try to make this happen. I think almost everyone in here, Democrat and Republican, is for this bill. It has been 7 years since we have had this reauthorization bill. It is overdue, so we need to have it now.  We debated this for 2\1/2\ hours yesterday, so I would encourage any one of the authors of these six amendments to come and work with us and get this thing done. It would be a shame if we came this far and didn't get it done. So I join my chairman, Senator Boxer, in encouraging everyone to work together.  Mr. President, I yield the floor, and I suggest the absence of a quorum.
