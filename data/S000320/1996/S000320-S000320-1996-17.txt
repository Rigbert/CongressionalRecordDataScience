 The GSA should not use funds appropriated to it to facilitate the move. Since the Commerce Appropriations Subcommittee denied requested funding for the relocation, the proposed move should not go forward until Congress has more closely examined the proposal. I would like to work with the gentleman from Oklahoma and the relevant Senate committees to fully understand whether the proposed relocations are justified and if so, how we might go about reducing costs associated with the plan. We should take a close look at these issues in the next Congress. Until we've had the time to closely examine these issues, however, I do not believe the proposed relocation should go forward. Accordingly, we did not include language allowing GSA to fund the proposed move and they should not use any of the resources provided to them for that purpose.
