President, it is my honor to remember Army SGT James E. Dutton. James died March 31, 2012 in Logar province, Afghanistan, in support of Operation Enduring Freedom.

After completing basic combat training at Fort Jackson, SC, James was assigned to the 10th Mountain Division at Fort Drum, NY where he worked as a firefighter and mechanic. In 2008, James had a son, William Tyler Anderson and in 2009, shortly after the birth of his son, he was deployed to Afghanistan.  He returned to Fort Drum in 2010 and in October of 2011 he was reassigned to the 125th Brigade Support Battalion, 3d Infantry Brigade Combat Team, 1st Armored Division, based at Fort Bliss, TX. He deployed for his second tour to Afghanistan in December 2011.  James loved the U.S. Army and planned on a long career serving his country.

His commanding officer remembered him as a great soldier and dog handler. ``Always quick with a smile and laugh, he was the kind of person you always wanted to be around,'' said COL Brian Bisacre.
