 It is my understanding that the amendment that I came before the committee to offer, which proposed that we transfer $290 million from FEMA to the drug elimination program in order to restore it because it was zeroed out in the committee, which I think is backward policy for this country, is not in order on this floor.  If the chairman could, please, explain to me, based on what you have just said on the floor, is my amendment now in order?
