 President, today America mourns the loss of one of its great public servants and patriots, Dr. Jeane Kirkpatrick.  Dr. Kirkpatrick was the first woman to serve as U.S. Permanent Representative to the United Nations. During her tenure at the U.N., she was a vigorous advocate of American interests. She also recognized the strong moral leadership that this Nation provides for the rest of the world.  She was awarded numerous honors for her work. Among them, she received the Nation's highest civilian honor, the Presidential Medal of Freedom.  Mr. President, few can match the courage that Dr. Kirkpatrick brought to defending freedom and American interests around the world. She was a warrior for human rights, for freedom, and for her Nation. Few have or ever will match her service to our country. We, and millions around the world, are in her debt. We will miss her greatly.                          ____________________[Page S11682]From the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]                      TRIBUTE TO JEANE KIRKPATRICK  Mr. McCONNELL.
