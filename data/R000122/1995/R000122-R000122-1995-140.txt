Speaker, it gives me great pleasure to rise today to pay tribute to the Government Printing Office [GPO] for its outstanding work on the GPO Access Network. For its efforts, the GPO has received the James Madison Award for 1995.  The Madison Awards are presented by the Coalition on Government Information to those individuals or organizations who enhance citizens' knowledge while championing the public's right to know. Previous winners of these awards include Vice President Albert Gore, Secretary of Energy Hazel O'Leary, and Representative Henry Waxman. The GPO is certainly worthy of joining this list of well-known and respected officials.  The GPO has developed an access system which allows American citizens to obtain information including congressional bills, the Congressional Record, Federal Register, the U.S. Code, and more than 6,000 other files from 25 Federal agencies. Additionally, the network can be accessed at no charge from libraries that act as Federal depositories 24 hours a day.  As James Madison stated, ``a popular government without popular information, or the means of acquiring it, is but a prologue to a farce or a tragedy, or, perhaps both.'' Madison realized that a well-informed citizenry is the crucial ingredient for healthy debate. As all of my colleagues are aware, informed and spirited debate is the root of a healthy democracy. The GPO access network is a perfect example of how the new information ``super highway'' will heighten the level of public discourse.  In Rhode Island, the GPO has done an outstanding job of fulfilling Madison's vision of a politically aware and active citizenry. Because of the team effort of the GPO, Ocean State Free Net, and the Federal Depository libraries in the State, Rhode Islanders are now able to access all of the aforementioned information with their own home computers. Having such information available will enhance our citizens understanding of Government and their desire to participate in the democratic process. I am confident that continued cooperation between the Federal Government, State Agencies, and American citizens will yield rapid advancement into this new era of shared information.  Mr. Speaker, it gives me great pleasure to commend the outstanding achievement and continuing efforts of the Government Printing Office, and I would ask my colleagues to join me in saluting them.                          ____________________
