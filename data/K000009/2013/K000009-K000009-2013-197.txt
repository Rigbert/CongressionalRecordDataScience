Speaker, I rise today to commemorate the 24th anniversary of the 1989 Tiananmen Square crackdown and Beijing massacre in China.  A quarter of a century ago, the world watched with horror as the atrocities in Tiananmen Square and nearby streets in Beijing unfolded. During this anniversary period, it is with solidarity that we remember the victims of that deep tragedy.  The courageous students protesting on those days in April, May, and June of 1989 sought basic freedoms. Prophetic in their presence, they called upon their autocratic, Communist government to embrace liberty, respect human rights, and put an end to deep-seated corruption. Chinese intellectuals like Wei Jingsheng championed political reform. They posted essays on the Democracy Wall in Beijing. For that, he was arrested and imprisoned twice for a total of 18 years. The Democracy Wall and its postings were shut down.  Today, still autocratic and still Communist, China faces many of the same challenges, despite promises by its new leadership that reform would occur. Millions of Chinese people remain denied adequate food, housing, and health care, and over 1,200 Chinese dissidents and critics are known to be imprisoned or detained for standing up for freedom of speech. Deep disparities between the rich and the poor of China exist. Eight hundred million Chinese, close to a billion people--60 percent of its people--exist on less than $15 a day, all while the government seizes land and forces evictions.  Meanwhile, Communist Party leaders have become billionaires, often through corruption, graft, and theft, with immunity from a lawless regime. To rise economically in China, you must take an oath to the Communist Party and then be accepted into that club of politicians who become vastly wealthy as they climb the party ladder.  The Market-Leninism that drives China has resulted in 83 billionaires buying seats in their parliament. I can only imagine what that money power does to drive out the voices of the masses of the people longing to be free. The average fortune among these wealthiest 83 Communist Party delegates is $3.35 billion.  Environmental issues are also a major source of concern for the Chinese people, and they remain unaddressed. The New York Times recently reported on the findings of the Global Burden of Disease Study, which states air pollution contributed to 1.2 million premature deaths in China in 2010.  It is no secret religious organizations are heavily restricted and monitored in China. The Catholic Church is banned, and phony bishops are sanctioned by the government in their stead. Often, ethnic and religious minorities are intimidated or harassed by government officials.                              {time}  1010  Despite extensive documentation of the truth, the Chinese Communist Party continues to manipulate and censor the facts surrounding the events at Tiananmen Square and Beijing a quarter century ago; not to mention their ongoing censorship of the press and the Internet. The government blocks the social media, denying Facebook and Twitter the ability to operate. Journalists are regularly harassed and often imprisoned.  In remembrance of freedom's prophets, lost peacefully pursuing liberty at Tiananmen Square and in Beijing a quarter century ago, and those today who dream of a more liberty-loving future in that country, our Nation honors their noble spirits, their courage, their aspirations, and their lives given in pursuit of the cause of liberty.                          ____________________
