President, I respect very much Senator Martinez and Senator Brownback. Their views on the issue of abortion, I am sure, are a matter of conscience. They come to us to raise this issue which has been debated so many times in the Senate.  I say at this point in time that many of us who oppose abortion also believe that a woman should be able to make that choice with her family, with her doctor, with her conscience, and, of course, we believe in the first instance that family planning avoids unintended pregnancies. Unintended pregnancies lead to abortion. So reducing the number of unintended pregnancies is going to give women a chance to control their own lives and to reduce the likelihood of abortion.  It is the law of the United States of America, and it has been for many years, in a provision added in 1973 by Senator Jesse Helms explicitly banning the use of American taxpayer funds for overseas abortion. Unequivocally, that is the law. Regardless of the Mexico City policy, signed by President Obama or the situation before that, that is the law. Not one penny of taxpayers' dollars can be used to fund abortions overseas.  The issue here is whether an organization which also counsels women that they have an option for abortion is going to be denied these funds by this policy. Senator Martinez's amendment would deny them the funds to even offer family planning if they counsel a woman that abortion is an option. As Senator Boxer said, in the United States that is unacceptable.You have to give doctors at least the opportunity, even if they do not perform an abortion, to tell a woman what her legal rights are. But that is what is at the core of this issue.
