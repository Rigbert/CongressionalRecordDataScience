Chair, I thank the gentlewoman for yielding. Initially, I want to say that I hope that very soon, in a bipartisan way, we will bring a DACA bill to this floor.  Let me quote what President Trump said last night. Trump tweeted that he wanted to ``legalize DACA,'' another call to action, and further muddled where the administration stood and what it would do.  He said: We need to come together and do this, and we really have no choice.  Now, I want to speak about this bill. As the chairman knows, and as the ranking member knows, I served on the Appropriations Committee for 23 years, so I have taken leave of absence because I am one of the leaders on our side of the aisle.  For most of those years, we worked in a bipartisan fashion. This is a partisan bill. It is sad, and it is not regular order at all. Regular order is doing one bill after another until you have passed the 12 bills. In fact, I don't think I have ever seen this process done in this fashion.  When I was the majority leader, the first year we passed all 12 bills individually, discretely, separately, and sent them to the Senate before the August break.  Hal Rogers, the former chairman of this committee, said of the President's budget: ``While we have a responsibility to reduce our Federal deficit, I am disappointed that many of the reductions and eliminations proposed in the President's skinny budget are draconian, careless and counterproductive.'' I think the same could be applied to the budget that is before us.
