One of the problems we are having now is that in 19 out of the last 22 years, Congress has been unsuccessful in passing annual funding for veterans health care. In fact, over the last 7 years, there has been a delay averaging 3 months in the funding flow for the care of veterans.  This can be corrected. What this amendment does, it offers a solution by providing advance appropriations for veterans health care. It does not mean it increases the cost. It means it actually comes in--and this is used in some other areas of Government. In fact, it is interesting that in October of 2008, then-Senator Obama, a candidate, said:       The way our Nation provides funding for VA health care must      be reformed. . . . My administration will recommend passage      of advance appropriations legislation . . .  For this purpose.  Senator Danny Akaka is a cosponsor on this. I ask it be accepted. I do not need a rollcall.
