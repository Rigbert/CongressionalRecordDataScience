 President, on behalf of the leader, I want to announce that the Senate will be in a period for morning business today until the hour of 10:30 a.m. At 10:30, the Senate will begin 2 hours of debate. That time will be equally divided on the motion to proceed to S. 1635, the Defend America Act.  At 2:15 today there will be a cloture vote on the motion to proceed to S. 1635. If cloture is invoked today, it is hoped that we may begin consideration of the defend America legislation and complete action on that legislation.  As a reminder, the Senate will recess today between the hours of 12:30 and 2:15 for the weekly policy conferences to meet.                          ____________________
