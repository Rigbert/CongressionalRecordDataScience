Speaker, I rise today in support of fast track trade legislation.  For the last several years the majority in Congress has eliminated the deficit, produced tax relief for the first time in 16 years and reformed welfare. The result has been a strong American economy. And Congress today has its role to play again. We cannot allow the current global economic crisis to slow U.S. economic growth any further.  By denying the President the ability to negotiate fast track trade agreements we are hurting the long term prosperity of our country. We in Congress must send a strong and clear signal to our citizens and the world that we are willing to make the tough decisions today to secure prosperity for our children.  Mr. Speaker, I urge all my colleagues to support fast track legislation. It is the right thing to do. As was mentioned, 95 percent of the customers are outside of the United States. Keep our country strong, support fast track.
