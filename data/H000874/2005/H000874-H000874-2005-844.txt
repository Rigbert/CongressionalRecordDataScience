Speaker, late last month--on April 25, 2005--the family and friends of Neale Chaney Slater, the community of Mechanicsville, and the State of Maryland suffered a devastating loss when this caring and accomplished young man was struck down just as he was preparing to enter the prime of his life.  WhIle driving out to help a local farmer, Neale, 20 years old, was killed in a tragic two-vehicle accident on Route 5 in Hughesville.  Yet, in such a short period of time, Neale gave so much to so many others.  At the age of 16, Neale joined the Mechanicsville Volunteer Fire Department, and had held the office of assistant secretary and treasurer.  Neale was a Firefighter II and certified emergency medical technician, and was recognized by his peers with the Mechanicsville Volunteer Fire Department as ``Rookie of the Year'' in 2001. He also was awarded Fire Prevention Awards in 2001 and 2002.  ``He told me he was following the family tradition,'' said Willie Wilkerson, president of the department, noting that Neale's grandfather and uncle had also been members of the department. ``For such a short life, he got a lot accomplished.''  That, in fact, is an understatement.  Neale was a 2003 honors graduate of the Leonard Hall Junior Naval Academy in Leonardstown, where he achieved the rank of Battalion Commander in his junior and senior years.  He also was awarded Midshipman of the Year in 2001, 2002, and 2003, and was also awarded the Military Excellence, Headmaster's and Loyalty Awards at graduation.  Clearly, Mr. Speaker, this was an exceptional young man--a young man who envisioned a career in public service early on.  At the time of his passing, Neale was a Cadet in the Maryland State Police, which he joined in 2003. This coming fall, he was set to join the State Police Academy.  Without question, Neale embodied the best this country has to offer through his dedicated public service, his educational achievements, and the respect he had earned from all who knew him.  Neale was held in high regards by the community he served, and rightly so. Colonel Thomas E. Hutchins, Secretary of the Department of State Police, said that Neale was ``a young man with a strong work ethic who was committed to doing his best in every mission he undertook.''  Mr. Speaker, the passing of one's child, particularly one with so much to contribute to his community, his State and his Nation is as painful as it is incomprehensible.  Today, I want to extend my deepest sympathies to Neale's parents, Eleanor Fowler Slater and Austin Joseph Slater, Sr., as well as all of his family members and friends.  I realize that these words are small solace. But I hope the Slaters, in time, find some comfort in the fact that they raised a truly fine young man who will be sorely missed and never forgotten.  The Slaters have established the Neale Slater Memorial Fund in his honor at the Leonard Hall Junior Naval Academy for a graduating senior intending to enter law enforcement.  I know the recipients of this scholarship will always be inspired by the example set by Neale, and the extraordinarily positive impact he had on his community will be felt for generations to come.                          ____________________
