 President, I want to thank the distinguished Senator from New Hampshire not only for his outstanding comments here today, but also for his dedicated and principled service on the Ethics Committee. He has been absolutely indispensable to the process and has always conducted himself with the highest integrity, both in the committee and outside the committee, in how he has dealt with the matters before the committee and in complying with the rules of the committee. So I thank him very much for his kind comments.  Mr. President, another important member of our committee that has been with us during this process would like some time.  I yield the distinguished senior Senator from Idaho such time as he may need.
