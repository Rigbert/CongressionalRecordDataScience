President, I, too, rise to commend and thank the Senator from Colorado for his extraordinary service to the Senate, to the people of Colorado, and to the United States of America. He is a consummate gentleman. He brought to this Chamber great judgment and great passion to provide opportunity for all our citizens. He also brought the distinctive values of his State of Colorado--a rough sense of individuality, coupled with a commitment to building community; not just an isolated group of people but a community of citizens--and these values have been extraordinarily important to us. His friendship and his leadership have been extraordinarily important to all of us.  I see the Presiding Officer is my colleague and friend from Rhode Island, and as he pointed out a few days ago, they were both attorneys general together: Senator Whitehouse of Rhode Island, of course, and Senator Salazar for the State of Colorado. But we were all together in Rhode Island, and I was reflecting, Ken, I don't know what the Department of the Interior has to do with Rhode Island. OK, the Outer Continental Shelf.
