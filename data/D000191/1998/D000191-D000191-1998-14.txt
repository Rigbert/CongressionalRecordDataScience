Speaker, the gentleman forgot a couple highlights of things they did propose. They did propose elimination of the School to Work program for high school students. I suppose somehow in their world that is going to better prepare our students for employment after school and to compete in the world economy. Beyond me. I wish they would come down here and explain that. I thought it was a pretty good thing to have school to work opportunities for high school kids. In fact, my State has embarked statewide on a program to bring that about.  They have also eliminated in school interest subsidy for student loans. I borrowed a bunch of money to go to college. I thought it was a lot of money when I graduated. I owed about $12,000 when I got out. I am talking to kids now getting out with bachelor's degrees from higher education with $25- and $30,000.
