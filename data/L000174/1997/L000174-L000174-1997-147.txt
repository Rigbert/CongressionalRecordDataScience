I am, therefore, pleased to have this opportunity to introduce legislation with my good friend from Massachusetts, Senator Kennedy. Our Crime Victims Assistance Act represents the next step in our continuing efforts to afford dignity and recognition to victims of crime.  My involvement with crime victims began more than three decades ago when I served as State's attorney for Chittenden County, VT, and witnessed first hand the devastation of crime. I have worked ever since to ensure that the criminal justice system is one that respects the rights and dignity of victims of crime, rather than one that presents additional ordeals for those already victimized.  I am proud that Congress has been a significant part of the solution to provide victims with greater rights and assistance. Over the past 15 years, Congress has passed several bills to this end. These bills have included:  The Victims and Witness Protection Act of 1982; The Victims of Crime Act of 1984; The Victims' Bill of Rights of 1990; The 1994 Violent Crime Control and Law Enforcement Act; and The Justice for Victims of Terrorism Act of 1996.  Just this March, Congress passed the Victim Rights Clarification Act of 1997, which I cosponsored with Senators Nickles, Inhofe and Hatch. That legislation reversed a presumption against crime victims observing the fact phase of a trial if they were likely to provide testimony during the sentencing phase of that trial.  As a result of that legislation, not only were victims of the Oklahoma City bombing able to observe the trial of Timothy McVeigh, all those who were able to witness the trial and were called as witnesses to provide victim impact testimony at the sentencing phase of that trial were able to do so.  Also, on the first day of this session, we introduced S.15, a youth crime bill. In that legislation, which we have identified as a legislative priority for the entire Democratic caucus, we included provisions for victims of juvenile crimeso that their rights to appear, to be heard, and to be informed would be protected. Those provisions have now been incorporated in the juvenile crime bill ordered reported by the Judiciary Committee last week along with added protections against witness intimidation.  The legislation that we introduce today, the Crime Victims Assistance Act, builds upon this progress. It provides for a wholesale reform of the Federal rules and Federal law to establish additional rights and protections for victims of federal crime. Particularly, the legislation would provide crime victims with an enhanced: right to be heard on the issue of pretrial detention; right to be heard on plea bargains; right to a speedy trial; right to be present in the courtroom throughout a trial; right to give a statement at sentencing; right to be heard on probation revocation; and  Right to be notified of a defendant's escape or release from prison.  The legislation goes further than other victims rights proposals that are currently before Congress by including: Enhanced penalties for witness intimidation; an increase in Federal victim assistance personnel; enhanced training for State and local law enforcement and officers of the court; the development of state-of-the-art systems for notifying victims of important dates and developments in their cases; and the establishment of ombudsman programs for crime victims.  These are all matters that can be considered and enacted this year with a simple majority of both Houses of Congress. They need not overcome the delay and higher standards necessitated by proposing to amend the Constitution. They need not wait the hammering out of implementing legislation before making a difference in the lives of crime victims.  I look forward to continuing to work with the administration, victims groups, prosecutors, judges, and other interested parties on how we can most effectively enhance the rights of victims of crime. Congress and State legislatures have become more sensitive to crime victims rights over the past 20 years and we have a golden opportunity to make additional, significant progress this year to provide the greater voice and rights that crime victims deserve.  In my State, Vermont, there are many individuals who have made a difference by dedicating themselves to serving the needs of crime victims. Individuals, such as Lori Hayes from the Vermont Center for Crime Victims Services, have joined in leading the Nation on issues pertaining to crime victims. I congratulate Lori on the results of the Justice Department's recent site visit of Vermont's Victims of Crime Act programs. The Justice Department concluded that       Vermont's programs are setting the standard for outreach to      under served populations and service coordination among      providers and allied professionals * * * Other States      interested in improving their services and advocacy for crime      victims would do well to study the model created by Lori      Hayes, her staff, and other victims advocates in Vermont.  Without the commitment of people like Lori, we would not be making the progress that we are.  I would like to acknowledge several others who have been extremely helpful with regards to the legislation that we are introducing today: The Office for Victims of Crime at the Justice Department, the National Network to End Domestic Violence, the NOW Legal Defense Fund, the National Clearinghouse for the Defense of Battered Women, Professor Lynne Henderson from Indiana Law School, the National Organization for Victim Assistance, Roger Pilon, Director of the Center for Constitutional Studies at the Cato Institute, the National Victim Center, and many others.  While we have greatly improved our crime victims assistance programs and made advances in recognizing crime victims rights, we still have more to do. That is why it is my hope that Democrats and Republicans, supporters and opponents of a constitutional amendment on this issue will join Senator Kennedy and me in advancing this important legislation through Congress. We can make a difference in the lives of crime victims right now, and I hope Congress will make it a top priority and pass the Crime Victims Assistance Act before the end of the year.  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be printed in the Record.
