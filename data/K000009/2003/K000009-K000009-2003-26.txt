Speaker, I thank the gentleman for his leadership on this important issue and rise in support of H.R. 2427.  I wish to say, last year, average drug prices in our country were 67 percent higher than in Canada and double that of Europe. The real issue is that pharmaceutical companies have been gouging the American public for far too long, and the leadership in this Congress has allowed them to do that.  This bill requires the FDA to do what it must to assure safety, but more than that, it finally blows the whistle on an industry that has been taking America's seniors to the cleaners. It is time their gig is up. Support H.R. 2427.                              {time}  0200
