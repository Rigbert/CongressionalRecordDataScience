President, in response to my friend from Tennessee, normally I would say: Have rollcall votes. I also know with the Defense authorization bill we had some very late night schedules. This is pushing up against the Fourth of July recess. I think the Senator from Tennessee, the Senator from South Dakota, and the respective whips have the hardest jobsin the world trying to please everybody.  I will tell my friend from Tennessee, if that would make his life easier, I would be happy to accommodate him.
