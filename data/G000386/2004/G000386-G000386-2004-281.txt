 President, I rise today to pay tribute to CPL Michael R. Speer of Davenport, IA, who courageously gave his life for his country in Operation Iraqi Freedom. He is the 12th Iowan to be killed in Iraq. My deepestsympathy goes out to his wife and his entire family as they deal with their loss. Corporal Speer was killed when his unit came under enemy fire in the Al Anbar province of Iraq on Friday, April 9, 2004.  Corporal Speer was a rifleman assigned to the 2nd Battalion, 2nd Marines, 2nd Marine Division, II Marine Expeditionary Force, based in Camp Lejeune, NC. He performed his duty to his country admirably and I know his loss will be deeply felt by all those who knew him.  Michael Speer enlisted in the Marines in Davenport, IA, on January 16, 2001. He died a true patriot and it is fitting that we recognize his sacrifice here today.                       staff sergeant cory brooks
