Dr. Ganske is not known as a poster child for the anti-States rights movement. This is a bill that has been worked on so as to be sensitive to the rights of States. What it does essentially is bring the same kind of consumer protections at the Federal level that we do in a number of Medicare areas. The Senator and I worked, for example, in the House on Medicare risk contracts and the like. This does say that on certain matters up to what amounts to a floor of consumer protection there ought to be a national standard. And that is how we deal with it here. That is how Dr. Ganske dealt with it in the House.
