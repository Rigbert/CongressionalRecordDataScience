 President, I am announcing, today, my intention to place a hold on the nomination of Mr. Richard Holbrooke to be the next U.S. Ambassador to the United Nations. I would like to explain for the benefit of my colleagues why I have done so.  First, let me explain that I have nothing against Mr. Holbrooke. He is simply caught in the middle. The issue can be cleared up very, very quickly, if reasonable heads come together.  At issue is the outrageous treatment by the State Department of one of its employees. Her name is Linda Shenwick. She is Counselor for Resources Management at the United States U.N. Mission. She is the Mission's expert on financial and management matters.  Ms. Shenwick has been instrumental in bringing to light many of the waste and mismanagement issues associated with the U.N. She's been an invaluable source of information and insight for the people's branch of government. Some people in the State Department, apparently all the way to the top, don't much care for Ms. Shenwick's candor with Congress. And so they painted a big, ol' target on Ms. Shenwick, and have come after her, relentlessly.  You see, Ms. Shenwick is guilty of committing the crime of telling the truth. And when you commit truth, you're history in the State Department.  Here is how the State Department has treated Ms. Shenwick. I'd like my colleagues to know this, so they can judge for themselves whether this is conduct befitting such a grand institution as the State Department.  Ms. Shenwick has been ``Felix Bloched.'' You remember Felix Bloch. He was investigated while under suspicion for espionage. He was put on non-duty status while he was investigated. That's now what they've done to Ms. Shenwick, effective last Friday at 5:30 pm.  That's not all. Before kicking her out of her office last week, she was not allowed to talk to other employees. They could not talk to her. She had to keep her door closed at all times. She couldnot access the main computer in the office. They forced her to fly to Washington, with little or no notice, for meetings that didn't occur.  At the end of this month, Ms. Shenwick must report to a new job in Washington, in an area in which she has no background. They know that she wants to stay in New York. They seem determined to break this woman down. So far, they have not succeeded.  Mr. President, I have a long-standing practice of taking up the cause of witnesses before the Congress who have done the right thing at great risk to their careers. Before I do this, I must make sure the individual has sufficient credibility, and is being retaliated against for their disclosures in the public interest. I have spoken with my colleagues on both sides of the aisle, and on both sides of Capitol Hill. They all agree she has credibility, and has provided solid, accurate information to Congress. It is information that has led to management reforms and more effective controls of the U.N. budget. No one has ever successfully challenged her information. Instead, the Department has attacked her.  In all the whistleblower cases I have worked over the years, this one stands out. I have never seen such a blatant, raw attempt to harass and silence a whistleblower who simply told the truth. Can the truth be that offensive to the State Department?  My action to put a hold on the Holbrooke nomination is a contest over which message will prevail. By its actions, the message the State Department wants to send is fear. Every other employee of the USUN Mission has their eyes firmly fixed on this case. The State Department wants them to know, if they commit truth like Ms. Shenwick did, that they, too, will get the ``Felix Bloch Treatment.'' I guess committing truth is just as bad as committing espionage.  Mr. President, It's my hope that we in this body will intercept that message, and send one of our own. The people's right to know the truth is what we care about. And those who help Congress know the truth will be protected, not punished.  Until this month, Ms. Shenwick and her attorney had been negotiating with the State Department to find her a new job in New York. There was some progress, but the Department started negotiating in bad faith. The talks broke down, and Ms. Shenwick is being transferred to Washington at the end of the month, to a job for which she has no background.  I am willing to release my hold of the nomination of Mr. Holbrooke forthwith. But before that happens, fairness and civility must prevail. Good faith negotiations must re-start, and an agreement must be reached by both parties. This could happen within 24 hours, if desired.  In 1997, another member of this body put a similar hold on a nominee until the Department resolved Ms. Shenwick's situation. The Secretary agreed to resolve the issues and keep Ms. Shenwick at the USUN Mission. The hold was lifted. But instead of resolving the matter, the harassment continued. And it continues to this day.  That will not happen again. The hold gets lifted when there's an agreement in writing.  Mr. President, I hope that my colleagues appreciate the reasonableness of my position, and the importance of the message that I am asking this body to send. I hope I can count on their support in the public's best interest. And we can then allow Mr. Holbrooke to get on with his important work in New York.                          ____________________
