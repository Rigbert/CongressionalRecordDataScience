Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.  H.R. 1275 authorizes a land exchange that enhances the State of Utah's ability to fund public education. In return for 36,000 acres, the Federal Government will receive 46,000 acres of land that is of a higher conservation value and is believed to be environmentally sensitive.  This legislation passed the House in the 109th and 110th Congresses and is supported by local and State governments, as well as representatives of the outdoor recreational and environmental communities. I believe this is a good bill.  Mr. Speaker, I have no further requests for time, and I yield back the balance of my time.
