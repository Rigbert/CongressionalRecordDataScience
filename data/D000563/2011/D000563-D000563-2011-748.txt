President, I continue to receive letters weighing in on the issue of interchange fee reform. I ask unanimous consent to have printed in the Record letters or statements from the following organizations: the Rainbow PUSH Coalition, the Main Street Alliance, Consumer Federation of America, and the National Black Church Initiative.  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in the Record, as follows:                                                    April 1, 2011.       Dear Senator: The Rainbow PUSH Coalition expresses its      views on the Durbin swipe fee reform amendment now being      debated in the Congress. Rainbow PUSH is a strong advocate of      the Dodd-Frank financial reform legislation which provides      critical consumer protections and safeguards against      predatory lending.       The Durbin swipe fee reform amendment should be implemented      as scheduled. It will usher in needed reform to bring      competition, transparency and choice to the interchange      system, and provide incentives for the retail sector to pass      on interchange savings to lower the price of products for      consumers. Numerous consumer rights organizations, civil      rights groups, universities, unions, and other constituencies      have weighed in to support swipe fee reform.       We respect the concerns that some groups have raised about      the provision, but are unconvinced that a delay in its      implementation as proposed by Sen. Tester and the American      Banking Association (representing the financial services      industry) will be beneficial to consumers and students, and      small businesses. It appears that their interest is to      maintain a deregulated environment to continue the virtual      monopoly status of the credit card transaction process, and      to protect their massive profits derived from debit      interchange fees.       Deregulation, greed and lack of congressional oversight led      to the most severe economic collapse since the great      depression. But Wall Street got billions in public funds      because they were deemed too big to fail--they've been bailed      out and are once again recording record profits and issuing      millions     in executive bonuses, while homeowners and working families      are still left out. The big banks are already charging      consumers higher interest rates and raising consumer fees to      record levels in virtually every dimension of banking and      credit card use. We stand ready to meet with all concerned to      ensure the implementation of a sustainable debit card system      going forward.       The Durbin credit card swipe fee amendment will afford the      protections and regulations that consumers need.           Sincerely,                               Reverend Jesse L. Jackson, Sr.,                                            President and Founder,     Rainbow PUSH Coalition.                                  ____                                                   March 31, 2011.     Senator Dick Durbin,     Assistant Majority Leader, Hart Senate Bldg., Washington, DC.       Dear Senator Durbin: We write to express the National Black      Church Initiative's continued support for the Durbin swipe      fee amendment which we supported and was included in the      Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act.      The current interchange system is uncompetitive, non-     transparent and harmful to consumers. It is simply unjust to      require less affluent Americans who do not participate in or      benefit from the payment card or banking system to pay for      excessive debit interchange fees that are passed through to      the costs of goods and services. As a result, NBCI does not      support Congressional delay of implementation of the new law.       As you may know, The National Black Church Initiative      (NBCI) is a faith-based coalition of 34,000 churches      comprised of 15 denominations and 15.7 million African      Americans committed to eradicating racial disparities and      improving the lives of African Americans nationwide.       We oppose efforts to delay implementation of the Durbin      amendment through Congressional action. The new law gives the      Federal Reserve adequate authority it can use without delay      to make sure that the debit interchange reimbursement      financial institutions receive covers their legitimate,      incremental costs for providing debit card services. We know      that there are banks, like BB&T for example, who would like      to delay this process. Their continued profit off the backs      of low income African Americans will no longer be tolerated      and we will continue to advocate on behalf of laws that      support our agenda.       From a consumer point of view, the current interchange      system is not defensible. Feeble competition in the payment      card marketplace has led to unjustifiably high debit      interchange fees that the poorest Americans, generally cash      customers, are required to subsidize at the store and at the      pump.       Thank you for your consideration of our views. Please      contact us directly to discuss these important issues.           Sincerely,                                               Rev. Anthony Evans,     President, National Black Church Initiative.                                  ____                                                   March 31, 2011.     To: U.S. Senators and Representatives.     Re Main Street Alliance support for implementing debit          interchange protections for small businesses in the          Restoring American Financial Stability Act of 2010.       Dear Senator Durbin: The Main Street Alliance, a national      network of small business coalitions representing small      business owners across America, writes to express our strong      support for the provision of the Restoring American Financial      Stability Act of 2010 that set out to ensure that debit card      interchange fees are reasonable and proportional. This      provision is an important step toward putting small      businesses back on stable footing by limiting burdensome fees      on small businesses when we process debit transactions.       Small businesses have faced ever-rising fees on debit card      transactions over the years. For some businesses, these      interchange fees have grown to the point that they represent      some of the highest operating costs, rivaling the costs of      labor and utilities. There is no such thing as fair      competition in this market: the card companies have a      duopoly. Limiting fees to twelve cents per transaction, as      proposed in new rules, will free small businesses from      disproportionate and burdensome costs, allowing economic      growth.       The new rules are a step forward, a step toward parity and      a reasonable balance. We ask that these rules not be delayed      further. Implementing them as planned this summer will      provide a shot in the arm for small businesses and our local      economies. Small businesses are better off with these      protections; we urge you not to allow the lobbying tactics of      the big banks deter the enactment of rules that protect small      business.       The country is counting on small businesses to serve as an      engine of economic recovery and create the jobs we need to      get people back to work across America. The debit interchange      provisions enacted in the financial overhaul last year and      codified in the new rules support these aims. We urge you to      fight efforts to delay or derail the implementation of these      rules.

Position of the Consumer Federation of America on Debit Card                ``Interchange'' Fee Legislation and Rules   no position on debit interchange law or on legislation to delay it       CFA did not take a position on the ``Durbin Amendment'' to      the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act      and has also not supported or opposed legislation introduced      in Congress to delay the interchange law.     federal reserve should alter proposed rule implementing debit                             interchange law       CFA filed comments with the Federal Reserve in February      (http://www.consumerfed.org/pdfs/debit-cards-FRB-interchange-rule-comments-2-22-11.pdf) that came to the following      conclusions:       The current interchange system is uncompetitive, non-     transparent and harmful to consumers. Feeble competition in      the payment card marketplace has led to unjustifiably high      debit interchange fees that the poorest Americans are      required to subsidize. It is simply unjust to require less      affluent Americans who do not participate in or benefit from      the payment card system to pay excessive fees that are passed      through to the cost of goods and services.       The Federal Reserve should ensure that financial      institutions are reimbursed for legitimate, incremental debit      card costs as it finalizes rules that implement the new      interchange requirements. In particular, the Federal Reserve      should increase proposed interchange price standards as      allowed under law to include several specific expenses      incurred by financial institutions when processing debit card      transactions. If such compensation does not occur, these      institutions could increase debit card and other related      banking charges on their least desirable and most financially      vulnerable consumers: low-to- moderate income account      holders.       Once it is implemented, the Federal Reserve should pay      close attention to how it affects the financial viability of      small depository institutions, especially credit unions,      which often provide safe, lower-cost financial services to      millions of Americans.       The Federal Reserve should launch a broad, balanced study      upon implementation of the effects of the rule on consumers.                          ____________________
