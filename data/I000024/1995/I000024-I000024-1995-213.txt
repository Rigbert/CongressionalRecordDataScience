I do not think I will take the 5 minutes.  After the trauma and the tragedy that we have gone through in Oklahoma, it has diverted our attention from many of the other significant things that are taking place in this body. I think the most significant thing, second only to that tragedy in Oklahoma, is the tragedy, the revelation that was recently discovered of what is going to happen to Medicare in America and the demagoging that is taking place in this and other bodies concerning that trauma.  Specifically, a report was released by the Medicare trustees that has come to the incontrovertible conclusion that our Medicare system, in absence of change, is going to go broke in the year 2002, approximately 6\1/2\ years from now.  I think it is important to look and see who was it who looked at the data, who studied the actuarial reports and came to that conclusion.  There are six members of the Board of Trustees of Medicare. They are Robert Rubin, the Secretary of the Treasury, who was appointed by President Clinton; Robert Reich, Secretary of Labor, appointed by President Clinton; Donna Shalala, Secretary of HHS, appointed by President Clinton; Shirley Carter, Commissioner of Social Security, appointed by President Clinton; and Stanford Ross and David Walker.  Four of the six members are appointments and work in the Clinton administration, and they have come up with the conclusion that Medicare will, in  [[Page S6300]]  fact, go broke in the year 2002. I think we know the reasons for it, and I will not get into that.  Quoting from the report, it says, Medicare is ``severely out of financial balance and the trustees believe that Congress must take timely action to establish long-term financial stability for the program. The trustees believe that prompt, effective and decisive action is necessary.''  Madam President, these are the trustees that were appointed by President Clinton, and what has happened since that time? Absolutely nothing. We have not heard one word out of the Clinton administration. We hear a lot of people criticizing Republicans because we want to do something to save a system, and they come up and say, ``The Republicans are suggesting that they are going to cut Medicare in order to pass a tax reduction.'' Nothing could be further from the truth, and that certainly is not true. But for the President to do nothing in facing this crisis is something that cannot be tolerated.  The proposal that has been discussed by the Budget Committee chairman, Senator Domenici from New Mexico, has suggested that we put caps on the system, somewhere around 7 to 7.5 percent growth caps. In other words, the Republican budget is suggesting not that we have cuts in Medicare, but that we have increases in Medicare, but those increases will be capped somewhere between 7 and 7.5 percent, at an amount that has been actuarially determined that we will now have Medicare and it will not go bankrupt in the year 2002.  Right now, Madam President, we have some 36 million people on Medicare. It is projected by the time 2002 comes, we will have something like 50 million Americans, 20 percent of all Americans, including myself, will be eligible for Medicare at that time.  So I only say, it is time to stop the demagoging. We have a very serious problem on our hands. I believe the Republicans have a solution to that problem, but we should be getting some leadership from the White House at this time. This is not something with which we should be playing politics.  I yield back to the Senator from Pennsylvania.                          ____________________
