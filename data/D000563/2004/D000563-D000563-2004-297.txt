President, last Sunday, April 25, the March for Women's Lives took place here in Washington. Its organizers estimated that more than a million men, women, and children from more than 57 countries gathered under the banner of reproductive rights, health, and justice for all women. Participants called on Congress and the administration not only to protect the right to choose but also to protect and promote family planning, maternal and child health care, and the empowerment of women in the United States and abroad.  An op-ed by Werner Fornos, president of the Population Institute, appeared that same day in the Chicago Sun-Times. The piece was entitled ``March is About More than Abortion,'' and it explained that the marchers' concerns went beyond the issue of abortion to include concerns about HIV/AIDS prevention, family planning, the President's imposition of a global gag rule on family planning providers, and the administration's refusal to release funds to the United Nations Population Fund to reduce the number of unintended pregnancies that can lead to abortion.  I ask unanimous consent that Mr. Fornos' article be printed in the Record.  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in the Record, as follows:              [From the Chicago Sun-Times, Apr. 25, 2004]                   March Is About More Than Abortion                           (By Werner Fornos)       Passing a barbershop window in Juneau, Alaska, the other      day, I spotted a placard inviting locals to join a rally in      Washington, D.C., today that could have significant      implications for the November presidential and congressional      elections.       If people from as far away as our country's northwestern-     most state converge upon the nation's capital in sufficient      numbers--say, a quarter of a million and upwards--it might be      time for President Bush and his political guru, Karl Rove, to      unbutton their collars and reach for the hyperventilation      bags. The performance of the Bush administration on women's      rights may be judged more by the turnout for this event than      by any poll or survey.       The purpose of the March for Women's Lives is to deliver to      our national leaders a strong, unequivocal message of support      for reproductive health and rights and justice for all women.       There are concerns well beyond those of hard-core feminists      that Bush administration policies are unduly influenced by      right-wing religious zealots and the Vatican, who oppose      modern contraceptives as well as abortion.       Much of this rising tide of reaction emanates from pro-     choice advocates infuriated by the refusal of the White House      and a Republican majority in Congress to acknowledge federal      law pronouncing abortion as a matter between a woman, her      conscience and her physician. But the march is about more      than the termination of pregnancies.       For example, a fact sheet about condoms was removed from      the National Institutes of Health Centers for Disease Control      and Prevention Web site and replaced with a document      emphasizing condom failure and the effectiveness of      abstinence.       No one is suggesting that condom failure should be ignored,      or that there is anything wrong with promoting abstinence.      The fact remains, however, that the condom, in addition to      being a method of preventing unintended pregnancy, is the      most effective defense against HIV/AIDS for sexually active      individuals.       In a world where 10 more people are infected with HIV every      minute, where half of the 40 million people already infected      are women, where HIV/AIDS is the leading cause of death among      African-American women ages 25 to 34 and the seventh leading      cause of death for white American women that age, it is      patently inexcusable to omit the condom option from what      should be the nation's most trusted source of medical      information.       To explain the removal of the condom fact sheet, the White      House Office of Science and Technology Policy offered the      flimsy excuse that the CDC ``routinely takes information      off its Web site and replaces it with more up-to-date      information.'' Updating the Web site is understandable,      expunging the role of the condom in preventing HIV is      simply indefensible.       If the Bush administration routinely ignores the      reproductive rights and health of women in the United States,      it is hardly surprising that respected international family      planning nongovernmental organizations give the White House      and U.S. congressional leadership low marks on their concern      for poor women around the world.       Within an hour or two after taking the oath of office,      President Bush signed the global gag rule, a policy to deny      U.S. funds to overseas family planning organizations that      provide, perform or counsel women on abortion. In the United      States, this would be a flagrant violation of the First      Amendment right to freedom of speech. But the Bush      administration, while robustly promoting democratization      worldwide, does not hesitate to penalize the world's poorest      women by withholding this right from family planning      providers overseas.       Then, too, the White House remains adamant in its refusal      to release a $34 million appropriation by Congress to the      United Nations Population Fund, the largest multilateral      provider of family planning and reproductive health services      to women in more than 140 developing countries.       Ironically, the combined impact of the Bush      administration's global gag rule and its refusal to release      the congressional appropriation for the U.N. agency has led      to thousands of abortions resulting from pregnancies to poor      women worldwide who have been denied access to family      planning information, education and supplies.       There is ample evidence that the availability of condoms      and other medically approved family planning methods already      has prevented substantially more abortions than the Bush      administration's policies have, can, or could. The women who      will march in Washington today understand the calculus of      reproductive health and family planning denial, even if many      of our national leaders do not.       Werner Fornos is president of the Population Institute and      the 2003 United Nations Population laureate.                          ____________________
