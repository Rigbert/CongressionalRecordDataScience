Mr. Speaker, the bill we are considering today is a bad bill. I will vote against it and I urge all people of conscience to vote against it. It is a bad bill because it penalizes children for the actions of their parents. This bill, Mr. Speaker, will put 1 million more children into poverty. How, how can any person of faith, of conscience vote for a bill that puts a million more kids into poverty. Where is the compassion, where is the sense of decency, where is the heart of this Congress. This bill is mean, it is base, it is downright low down.  We are a great nation. We put a man on the Moon. We have learned to fly through the air like a bird and swim like a fish in the sea. We are the world's only superpower. We did not do this by running away--by giving up. As a nation, as a people--as a government--we met our challenges--we won.  This bill gives up--it throws in the towel. We cannot run away from our challenges--our responsibilities--and leave them to the States. That is not the character of a great nation. I ask you, Mr. Speaker, What does it profit a great nation to conquer the world, only to lose it's soul? Mr. Speaker, this bill is an abdication of our responsibility and an abandonment of our morality. It is wrong, just plain wrong.  It was Hubert Humphrey, who said:       We can judge a society by how it treats those in the dawn      of life, our children, those in the twilight of life, our      elderly and those in the shadow of life, the sick and the      disabled.  I agree with Hubert Humphrey, my colleagues. What we are doing here today is wrong.  I say to you, all of my colleagues, you have the ability, you have the capacity, you have the power to stop this assault, to prevent this injustice. Your vote is your voice. Raise your voice for the children, for the poor, for the disabled. Do what you know in your heart is right. Vote ``no.''                              {time}  1630
