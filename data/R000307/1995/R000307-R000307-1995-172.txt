Speaker, I am pleased to submit for printing in the Congressional Record, pursuant to rule XI, clause 2(a) of the Rules of the House, a copy of the Rules of the Committee on Agriculture, which were adopted at the organizational meeting of the committee on January 11, 1995.  Appendix A of the committee rules includes excerpts from the rules of the House relevant to the operation of the committee. Appendix B includes relevant excerpts from the Congressional Budget Act of 1974. In the interests of minimizing printing costs, Appendices A and B are omitted from this submission.                 Rules of the Committee on Agriculture                         I. General Provisions       a. Rules of the U.S. House of Representatives.--The Rules      of the House shall govern the procedure of the Committee so      far as applicable, and the rules of the Committee shall be      interpreted in accordance with the Rules of the House, except      that a motion to recess from day to day, and a motion to      dispense with the first reading (in full) of a bill or      resolution, if printed copies are available, are nondebatable      motions of high privilege in committees and subcommittees.      (See Appendix A for the applicable rules of the U.S. House of      Representatives.)       b. Applicability to Subcommittees.--The following rules      shall apply to meetings, hearings, and other activities of      Subcommittees, which are part of the Committee and subject to      its authority and direction, only when specifically so      stated.            II. COMMITTEE OR SUBCOMMITTEE BUSINESS MEETINGS       a. Regular and Additional Meetings.--The Committee shall      meet on the first Tuesday of each month while Congress is in      session. The Committee also shall meet at the call of the      Chairman at such other times as the Chairman considers to be      necessary, subject to advance notice to all Committee      Members. Insofar as practicable, an agenda for all regular      and additional Committee meetings, setting forth all the      measures and matters to be considered, shall be furnished      each Committee Member prior to the meeting. Items may be      placed on the agenda by the Chairman or a majority of the      Committee. If the Chairman determines that any meeting      convened by the chairman need not be held, the Chairman shall      give all Members of the Committee notice to that effect as      far in advance of the meeting day as practicable, and no      meeting shall be held on such day. See Rule VI. e. for      provisions which apply to meetings of Subcommittees.       b. Special Meetings.--If at least three Members of the      Committee file a written request in the Committee offices      that a special meeting be called by the Chairman to consider      a specific measure or matter, the Chief of Staff shall      immediately notify the Chairman of the filing of such      request. If, within three calendar days after the filing of      such request, the Chairman does not call the requested      special meeting to be held at a time within seven calendar      days after the filing of such request, a majority of the      Members of the Committee may file in the Committee offices      their written notice that a special meeting will be held at a      specified date and hour to consider a specified measure or      matter. If such a notice is filed, the Committee shall meet      on that date and hour. Immediately upon the filing of such a      notice, the Chief of Staff shall notify all Members of the      Committee that such special meeting will be held at the      specified date and hour to consider the specified measure or      matter. Only the measure or matter so specified in the      meeting notice as filed by the majority of Committee Members      and transmitted to all Committee Members may be considered at      a special meeting.       c. Vice Chairman.--The Member of the majority party on the      Committee ranking immediately after the Chairman of the      Committee shall be the Vice Chairman of the Committee, and      the Member of the majority party on each Subcommittee ranking      immediately after the Chairman of the Subcommittee shall be      the Vice Chairman of that Subcommittee.       d. Presiding Member.--If the Chairman is not present at any      Committee meeting or hearing, the Vice Chairman or, in the      absence of the Vice Chairman, the ranking Member of the      majority party on the Committee who is present shall preside.      If the Chairman is not present at any Subcommittee meeting or      hearing, the Vice Chairman or, in the absence of the Vice      Chairman, the ranking Member of the majority party who is      present shall preside.       e. Open Business Meetings.--Each Committee or Subcommittee      meeting for the transaction of business, including the markup      of legislation, shall be open to the public including to      radio, television and still photography coverage, except as      provided by House Rule XI, clause 3(f)(2), except when the      Committee or Subcommittee, in open session and with a      majority present, determines by roll call vote that all or      part of the remainder of the meeting on that day shall be      closed to the public because disclosure of matters to be      considered would endanger national security would compromise      sensitive law enforcement information, or would tend to      defame, degrade or incriminate any person, or otherwise would      violate any law or rule of the House. No person other than      Members of the Committee or Subcommittee and such      congressional staff and departmental representatives as the      Committee or Subcommittee may authorize shall be present at      any business or markup session that has been closed to the      public. This clause does not apply to Committee or      Subcommittee hearings or to any meeting that, as announced by      the Chairman of the Committee or Subcommittee, relates solely      to internal budget or personnel matters.       f. Records and Roll Calls.--A complete record of all      Committee or Subcommittee action shall be kept in the form of      written minutes, including a record of the votes on any      question as to which a roll call is demanded. A roll call      vote shall be ordered on demand by one-fifth of the Members      present. The record of such action and the results of the      roll call votes during each session of Congress shall be made      available by the Committee, on request, for public inspection      during regular office hours in the Committee offices and on      telephone request. The information so available on roll call      votes shall include a brief description of the amendment,      motion, order, or other proposition; the name of each Member      voting for and each Member voting against such amendment,      motion, order, or other proposition; and the names of those      Members present but not voting. A stenographic record of a      business meeting of the Committee or Subcommittee may be kept      and thereafter may be published if the Chairman of the      Committee determines there is need for such a record. The      proceedings of the Committee or Subcommittee in a closed      meeting, other than roll call votes, shall not be divulged      unless otherwise determined by a majority of the Committee or      Subcommittee.       g. Quorum For Reporting Measures.--No measure or      recommendation shall be reported from the Committee or      Subcommittee unless a majority of the committee is actually      present.       h. Quorums--General.--A majority of the Members of the      Committee or Subcommittee shall constitute a quorum of the      Committee or Subcommittee for the purpose of convening      meetings, conducting business, and voting on any matter:      Provided, That the Chairman of the Committee may determine      that one-third of the Members of the Committee shall      constitute a quorum of the Committee at any meeting for such      purpose (other than for the reporting of any measure or      recommendation, and voting on the authorization of subpoenas      and on the closing of hearings and business meetings to the      public) if the Chairman gives written notice to that effect      to the Members prior to the meeting.       i. Prohibition on Certain Committee Meetings.--Without      special leave, neither the Committee nor any Subcommittee may      sit while the House is reading a measure for amendment under      the five-minute rule. (See Appendix A, House Rule XI clause      2(i).)       The Committee or Subcommittees may not sit during a joint      session of the House and Senate or during a recess when a      joint meeting of the House and Senate is in progress.       j. Prohibition on Proxy Voting.--No vote by any Member of      the Committee or Subcommittee with respect to any measure or      matter may be cast by proxy.       k. Location of Persons at Meetings.--No person other than a      Member of Congress or Committee or Subcommittee staff may      walk in or be seated at the rostrum area during a meeting of      the Committee or Subcommittee unless the Chairman or a      majority of the      [[Page H531]] Committee or      Subcommittee determines otherwise.       l. Consideration of Amendments and Motions.--A Member, upon      request, may be recognized by the Chairman to address the      Committee or Subcommittee at a meeting for not more than five      minutes on behalf of an amendment or motion offered by the      Member or another Member, or upon any other matter under      consideration, unless the Member receives unanimous consent      to extend the time limit. Every amendment, substitute      amendment, amendment to an amendment, or amendment in the      nature of a substitute made in Committee or Subcommittee that      is substantial as determined by the Chairman shall, upon the      demand of any Member present, be reduced to writing, and a      copy thereof shall be made available to all Members present:      Provided. That such amendment shall remain pending before the      Committee or Subcommittee and may not be voted on until the      requirements of this section have been met.       m. Submission of Motions or Amendments in Advance of      Business Meetings.--The Committee and Subcommittee Chairman      may request and Committee and Subcommittee members should,      insofar as practicable, cooperate in providing copies of      proposed amendments or motions to the Chairman and the      Ranking Minority Member twenty-four hours before a Committee      or Subcommittee business meeting.       n. Points of Order.--No point of order against the hearing      or meeting procedures of the Committee or Subcommittee shall      be sustained unless it is made in a timely fashion.                III. COMMITTEE OR SUBCOMMITTEE HEARINGS       a. Power to Hear.--For the purpose of carrying out any of      its functions and duties under House Rules X and XI, the      Committee is authorized to sit and hold hearings at any time      or place within the United States whether the House is in      session, has recessed, or has adjourned. See Rule VI. e. for      provisions relating to Subcommittee hearings and meetings.       b. Announcement of Hearings.--The Chairman of the Committee      or Subcommittee shall publicly announce the date, place, and      subject matter of any hearing to be conducted on any measure      or matter at least one week before the commencement of that      hearing unless the Committee or Subcommittee or the Chairman      of the Committee or Subcommittee, after consultation with the      Ranking Minority member of the Committee or Subcommittee, as      applicable, determines that there is good cause to begin such      hearing at an earlier date, in which case the announcement of      the hearing shall be made by the Chairman of the Committee or      Subcommittee at the earliest possible date. The Chief of      Staff shall notify the office of the House Daily Digest for      publication of the notice of the hearing in the Congressional      Record, and the office of the Official Reports to the House      Committees relating to such notice as soon as possible after      such public announcement has been made and enter the      announcement onto the Committee scheduling service of the      House Information systems.       c. Power to Subpoena.--For the purpose of carrying out any      of its functions and duties under House Rules X and XI, the      Committee is authorized to require, by subpoena or otherwise,      the attendance and testimony of such witnesses and the      production of such books, records, correspondence, memoranda,      papers, and documents as it deems necessary. A subpoena may      be authorized and issued in the conduct of any investigation      or series of investigations or activities by the Committee or      by a Subcommittee when authorized by a roll call vote of the      majority of the Members of the Committee, a majority being      present. Authorized subpoenas shall be signed by the Chairman      of the Committee or by any other member of the Committee may      designate. Notice of a meeting to consider a motion to      authorize and issue a subpoena shall be given to all Members      of the full Committee by 5 p.m. of the day preceding the day      of such meeting. Compliance with a      Committee or Subcommittee issued subpoena may be enforced      only as authorized or directed by the House.       d. Scheduling of Hearings and Witnesses.--Except as      otherwise provided in this clause, the scheduling of hearings      and witnesses and determination of the time allowed for the      presentation of testimony and interrogation shall be at the      discretion of the Chairman or a majority of the Committee or      Subcommittee. Whenever any hearing is conducted by the      Committee or Subcommittee on any measure or matter, the      Committee's or Subcommittee's minority party Members shall be      entitled, on request by a majority of them to the Chairman of      the Committee or Subcommittee before the completion of the      hearing, to call witnesses selected by them to testify with      respect to that measure or matter during at least one day of      the hearing.       e. Witnesses' Statements in Advance.--Each witness who is      to appear before the Committee or Subcommittee shall, insofar      as practicable, file with the Chief of Staff a written      statement of the witness's prepared testimony at least two      working days in advance of the witness's appearance in order      to permit the testimony to be distributed to and reviewed in      advance by Committee or Subcommittee Members. Witnesses shall      provide sufficient copies of their statement for distribution      to Committee or Subcommittee Members, staff, and the news      media. The Committee or Subcommittee staff shall distribute      such written statements to all Members of the Committee or      Subcommittee as soon as they are received as well as any      official reports from departments and agencies on such      subject matter.       f. Testimony of Witnesses.--The Chairman of the Committee      or Subcommittee or any Member designated by the Chairman may      administer an oath to any witness. Each witness who has been      subpoenaed, on the completion of the witness's testimony, may      report in person or in writing to the Chief of Staff and sign      appropriate vouchers, if any, for the cost of travel-related      expenses as authorized by the Rules of the House and other      relevant laws. All witnesses may be limited in their oral      presentations to brief summaries of their statements within      the time allotted to them, at the discretion of the Chairman      of the Committee or Subcommittee in light of the nature of      the testimony and the length of time available.       g. Questioning of Witnesses.--Committee or Subcommittee      Members may question witnesses only when they have been      recognized by the Chairman of the Committee or Subcommittee      for that purpose. Each Member so recognized shall be limited      to questioning a witness (or panel of witnesses) for five      minutes until such time as each Member of the Committee or      Subcommittee who so desires has had an opportunity to      question the witness (or panel of witnesses) for five      minutes, and, thereafter, the Chairman of the Committee or      Subcommittee may limit the time of further questioning after      giving due consideration to the importance of the subject      matter and the length of time available. All questions put to      witnesses shall be germane to the measure or matter under      consideration. Unless the Chairman or a majority of the      Committee or Subcommittee determines otherwise, no person      shall interrogate witnesses other than Members and Committee      or Subcommittee staff.       h. Open Hearings.--Each hearing conducted by the Committee      or Subcommittee shall be open to the public including to      radio, television and still photography coverage except when      the Committee or Subcommittee, in open session and with a      majority present, determines by roll call vote that all or      part of the remainder of that hearing on that day shall be      closed to the public, because disclosure of testimony,      evidence, or other matters to be considered would endanger      the national security, would compromise sensitive law      enforcement information, or would violate any law or rule of      the House of Representatives: Provided, That the Committee or      Subcommittee may, by the same procedure, vote to close one      subsequent day of hearing. Notwithstanding the      requirements of the preceding sentence, a majority of those      present, there being in attendance the requisite number      required under the rules of the Committee to be present      for the purpose of taking testimony (1) may vote to close      the hearing for the sole purpose of discussing whether      testimony or evidence to be received would endanger the      national security, would compromise sensitive law      enforcement information, or violate Rule III. k., or (2)      may vote to close the hearing, as provided in Rule III. k.      In any event, no Member of the House may be excluded from      nonparticipatory attendance at any hearing unless the      House by majority vote shall authorize the Committee or      Subcommittee, for purposes of a particular series of      hearings on a particular article of legislation or on a      particular subject of investigation, to close its meetings      to Members by means of the above procedure.       i. Quorum.--The quorum for taking testimony and receiving      evidence shall be two members of the Committee or      Subcommittee.       j. Record of Hearing.--The Committee shall keep a complete      record of all committee action which shall include--       (A) in the case of any meeting or hearing transcripts, a      substantially verbatim account of remarks actually made      during the proceedings, subject only to technical,      grammatical, and typographical corrections authorized by the      person making the remarks involved; and       (B) a record of the votes on any question on which a roll      call vote is demanded. Any public witness, during Committee      office hours in the Committee offices and within two weeks of      the close of hearings, may examine the transcript of his or      her own testimony and make such technical, grammatical and      typographical corrections as authorized by the person making      the remarks involved as will not alter the nature of      testimony given. Members of the Committee or Subcommittee      shall receive copies of transcripts for their prompt review      and correction for return to the Committee. The Chairman of      the Committee may order the printing of a hearing record      without the corrections of any Member or witness if the      Chairman determines that such Member or witness has been      afforded a reasonable time in which to make such corrections      and further delay would seriously impede the consideration of      the legislative action that is the subject of the hearing.      The record of a hearing closes ten calendar days after the      last oral testimony, unless the Chairman of the Committee or      Subcommittee otherwise determines. Any person requesting to      file a statement for the record of a hearing must so request      before the hearing concludes and must file the statement      before the record closes. No written statement becomes part      of the record and thus publicly available until such time as      it has been approved by the Chairman of the Committee or any      Committee staff the      [[Page H532]] Chairman designates, and the Chairman of the      Committee or Subcommittee or the Chairman's designee may      reject any statement in light of its length or its tendency      to defame, degrade, or incriminate any person.       k. Investigative Hearings.--The Chairman of the Committee      or Subcommittee at an investigative hearing shall announce in      an opening statement the subject of the investigation. A copy      of the Committee rules (and the applicable provisions of      Clause 2 of Rule XI of the house Rules, regarding      investigative hearing procedures, a copy of which appears in      Appendix A) shall be made available to each witness.      Witnesses at investigative hearings may be accompanied by      their own counsel for the purpose of advising them concerning      their constitutional rights. The Chairman of the Committee or      Subcommittee may punish breaches of order and decorum, and of      profressional ethics on the part of counsel, by censure and      exclusion from the hearings; but only the full Committee may      cite the offender to the House for contempt. Whenever it is      asserted that the evidence or testimony at an investigatory      hearing may tend to defame, degrade, or incriminate any      person--       (1) such testimony or evidence shall be presented in      executive session, notwithstanding the provisions of Rule      III. h., if by a majority of those present, there being in      attendance the requisite number required under the rules of      the Committee to be present for the purpose of taking      testimony, the Committee or Subcommittee determines that such      evidence or testimony may tend to defame, degrade, or      incriminate any person; or       (2) the Committee or Subcommittee shall proceed to receive      such testimony in open session only if a majority of the      Members of the Committee or Subcommittee, a majority begin      present, determine that such evidence or testimony will not      tend to defame, degrade, or incriminate any person.       In either case the Committee or Subcommittee shall afford      such person any opportunity voluntarily to appear as a      witness; and the Committee or Subcommittee shall receive and      the Committee shall dispose of requests from such person to      subpoena additional witnesses.       Except as provided above, the Chairman shall receive and      the Committee shall dispose of requests to subpoena      additional witnesses. No evidence or testimony taken in      executive session may be released or used in public sessions      without the consent of the Committee or Subcommittee. In the      discretion of the Committee or Subcommittee, witnesses may      submit brief and pertinent sworn statements in writing for      inclusion in the record. The Committee or Subcommittee is the      sole judge of the pertinency of testimony and evidence      adduced at its hearings. A witness may obtain a transcript      copy of his or her testimony given at a public session or, if      given at an executive session, when authorized by the      Committee or Subcommittee.       1. Broadcasting and Photography.--Television, radio and      still photography coverage of all or part of any Committee or      Subcommittee hearing or meeting shall be permitted, except as      provided in House Rule XI clause 3(f)(2): Provided, That when      such radio coverage is conducted, written notice to that      effect shall be placed on the desk of each Member. No      Committee or Subcommittee Chairman shall limit the number of      television or still cameras permitted in a hearing or meeting      room to fewer than two representatives from each medium      (except for legitimate space or safety considerations, in      which case pool coverage shall be authorized). Any      television, radio, or sill photography coverage of all or      part of a hearing or meeting shall be subject to the      provisions of House Rule XI, clause 3(f), which appear in      Appendix A.               IV. THE REPORTING OF BILLS AND RESOLUTIONS       a. Filing of Reports.--The Chairman shall report or cause      to be reported promptly to the House any bill or resolution      approved by the Committee and shall take or cause to be taken      all necessary steps to bring such bill or resolution to a      vote. A Committee report on any bill or resolution approved      by the Committee shall be filed within seven calendar days      (not counting days on which the House is not in session)      after the day on which there has been filed with the Chief of      Staff of the Committee a written request, signed by a      majority of the Committee, for the reporting of that bill or      resolution. The Chief of Staff of the Committee shall notify      the Chairman immediately when such a request is filed.       b. Content of Reports.--Each Committee report on any bill      or resolution approved by the Committee shall include as      separately identified sections:       (1) a statement of the intent or purpose of the bill or      resolution;       (2) a statement describing the need for such bill or      resolution;       (3) the results of each roll call vote on any amendment in      the Committee or Subcommittee and on the motion to report      such bill or resolution, including the total number of votes      cast for and the total number of votes cast against such      amendment or motion;       (4) the detailed statement described in section 308(a)(1)      of the Congressional Budget Act of 1974 if the bill or      resolution provides new budget authority (other than      continuing appropriations), new spending authority described      in section 401(c)(2) of such Act, new credit authority, or an      increase or decrease in revenues or tax expenditures, except      that the estimates with respect to new budget authority shall      include, when practicable, a comparison of the total      estimated funding level for the relevant program (or      programs) to the appropriate levels under current law;       (5) the estimate of costs and comparison such estimates, if      any, prepared by the Director of the Congressional Budget      Office in connection with such bill or resolution pursuant to      section 403 of the Congressional Budget Act of 1974 and      submitted in timely fashion to the Committee;       (6) any oversight findings and recommendations made by the      Committee or the Committee on Government Reform and Oversight      or both to the extent such were available during the      Committee's deliberations on the bill or resolution;       (7) a detailed analytical statement as to whether the      enactment of such bill or joint resolution into law may have      an inflationary impact on prices and costs in the operation      of the national economy;       (8) an estimate of the costs that would be incurred in      carrying out such bill or joint resolution in the fiscal year      in which it is reported and for its authorized duration or      for each of the five fiscal years following the fiscal year      or reporting, whichever period is less, together with a      comparison these estimates with those made and submitted to      the Committee by any Government agency (the provisions of      this clause do not apply if a cost estimate and comparison      prepared by the Director of the Congressional Budget Office      under section 403 of the Congressional Budget Act of 1974 has      been timely submitted prior to the filing of the report and      included in the report);       (9) the changes in existing law (if any) shown in      accordance with Rule XIII, clause 3, of the House Rules;       (10) the determination required pursuant to section 5(b) of      Public Law 92-463, if the legislation reported establishes or      authorizes the establishment of an advisory committee; and       (11) such other matter as the Chairman of the Committee      determines to be useful for public understanding of the      intent and effect of the bill or resolution.       c. Supplemental, Minority, or Additional Views.--If, at the      time of approval of any measure or matter by the Committee,      any Member of the Committee gives notice of intention to file      supplemental, minority, or additional views, that Member      shall be entitled to not less than three calendar days      (excluding Saturdays, Sundays, and legal holidays) in which      to file such views, in writing and signed by that member,      with the Chief of Staff of the Committee. All such views so      filed by one or more Members of the Committee shall be      included within, and shall be a part of, the report filed by      the Committee with respect to that measure or matter. The      report of the Committee on that measure or matter shall be      printed in a single volume, which shall:       (1) include all supplemental, minority or additional views      that have been submitted by the time of the filing of the      report; and       (2) bear on its cover a recital that any such supplemental,      minority, or additional views (and any material submitted      under subdivisions (C) and (D) of clause 2(l)(3) of House      Rule XI are included as part of the report.
