Speaker, I thank the majority leader for that.  Let me say that I would hope, given the fact that we have a maximum of eight or nine legislative days left before the end of the fiscal year, end of the September 30 fiscal year, that the CR hopefully will be a document on which we have consensus on all its parts.  The majority leader, I am sure, Mr. Speaker, has heard the same kinds of rumors I have heard, which is not unusual, that the Senate may pass a CR and then decide their work, at least prior to the election, is done.  If that is the case, or, in any event, whether it is the case or not, and we initiate a bill, it will be critically important that that bill be a bill that can be supported by both sides.  So I look forward to working with the majority leader to ensure that when a CR is brought to the floor, either a Senate bill--which will be a House bill amended by the Senate, I presume--or a House bill, that we have agreement, Mr. Majority Leader, on the component parts of that continuing resolution so we do not put at risk the shutting down of the government of the United States. I don't know whether the gentleman wants to respond at all.  I yield to the gentleman from California.                              {time}  1045  Mr. McCARTHY. I look forward to working with the gentleman.
