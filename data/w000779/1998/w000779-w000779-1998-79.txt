The program, if it receives the approval of fishermen on the West Coast, would be the first capacity reduction program to be ultimately funded by the fishing industry itself.  To comply with the requirements of section 504(b) of the Federal Credit Reform Act (2 U.S.C. 661c), an appropriation is required to cover the potential cost to the government for a debt obligation. My request assumed that the maximum potential cost to the government likely to be determined for the loan would be one percent, which would allow a loan of $5 million based on the $50,000 appropriated by the Committee. It is my understanding that if the Secretary of Commerce finds that the potential default rate for the loan is less than one percent, the loan amount would be accordingly higher than the $5,000,000 authorized by the report. For example, if the potential default rate for a future Pacific Coast buyback is determined to be one-half of one percent, the loan could be as high as $10,000,000 based on the appropriated $50,000. Is my understanding correct?
