Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.  Mr. Speaker, I just want to thank the gentleman for his consideration. We very much want the House to instruct the conferees to be very vigilant in maintaining the language as passed here yesterday, and I would ask the membership to support the full funding level for all participants in WIC.
