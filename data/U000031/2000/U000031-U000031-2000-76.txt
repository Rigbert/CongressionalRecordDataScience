Speaker, I yield myself 1 minute.  Mr. Speaker, I would like to say with the passage of this bill tonight, we will certainly end a nightmare that no family ever wants to experience, whether it be in Texas, Michigan, California, or any of the other 50 States.  I want to particularly commend the hard work and diligence of all Members on this legislation. It was about a year ago that our subcommittee first became involved in this, moving from the good work that had been done in the Committee on the Judiciary from a previous Congress. We quickly discovered that, in fact, the laws were too loose, the loopholes ought to be closed. Sadly, we still saw deaths even when that information became public.  Mr. Speaker, these drugs are available on the Internet. It has to stop. This bill does that. I look forward to working with all Members tonight to make sure that this is passed and, obviously, with the administration as they have indicated that they are going to support this legislation as well.
