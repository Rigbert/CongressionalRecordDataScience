  I am going to offer an amendment--a version of it was introduced as a separate bill last year as S. 2003. The cosponsors of the amendment are Senators Paul, Lee, Coons, Collins, Lautenberg, Gillibrand, and Kirk. I ask unanimous consent to add Senators Tester, Johnson of South Dakota, Sanders, Whitehouse, and Heller as cosponsors to the amendment.
