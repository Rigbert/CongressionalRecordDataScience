I would be glad to clarify that the intent of the legislation is not to exclude logging employment as defined in title 20 of the Code of Federal Regulations in section 655.103(c)(4) from the definition of ``agriculture employment'' for purposes of the new W agricultural visa, which will eventually replace the H-2A program. Consequently, logging employment would be covered in the definition of ``agricultural employment'' for purposes of the new W agricultural visa program. I also understand from Senator Feinstein, the author of these provisions, that it was not the intent of the measure to exclude logging employment from the new W visa program for agricultural workers.
