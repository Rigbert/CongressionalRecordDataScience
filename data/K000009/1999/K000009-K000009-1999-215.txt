I wanted to especially on this bill come down here to the floor and compliment the chairman of the full committee, the gentleman from Pennsylvania (Mr. Shuster) and the ranking member, the gentleman from Minnesota (Mr. Oberstar), for including language in this bill relative to a study by the Corps of Engineers on the Western Lake Erie Basin Watershed at the crossroads of the Great Lakes.  I want to just put on the record, without the help of these two gentlemen, our part of America could not solve the significant water problem that we have crossing several jurisdictions. This bill is so important. I hope every Member understands how hard these men have worked to really help every single corner of America. We have waited for years for this bill as our cities flood and our rural areas get devastated by extra water because of all of the development that has occurred in our region.  We cannot solve this problem without them and without the help of the Corps being the umbrella entity that brings all these multiple jurisdictions together across Indiana, Ohio and Michigan. I just want to thank them for being men of the future and paying attention to places like Toledo, Ohio and the crossroads of the Great Lakes. Our hats are off to them.  Madam Chairman, I include the following memorandum for the Record:                               Memorandum     To: Marcy.     From: George.     Subject: Western Lake Erie Basin Watershed Study Talking          Points.     Date: April 29, 1999.       The 1999 Water Resources Development Act, H.R. 1480,      includes a provision authorizing the Western Lake Erie      Watershed study.       The Western Lake Erie Basin is the crossroads of the Great      Lakes.       The Maumee River, which empties into Lake Erie at Toledo is      the largest tributary to the Great Lakes. My District and the      City of Toledo sit at the mouth of the Maumee.       The Corps of Engineers and other government agencies have      conducted numerous studies in the Western Lake Erie basin,      but no one has ever looked at the watershed as a whole.       We understand now the indispensable interrelationship      between the various elements of the watershed's ecosystem,      the water, the farmland, the cities, the suburbs.       If we are going to sustain the productive resources of the      Western Lake Erie Basin, we must understand how all these      elements work together.       I hope and expect that this study will lead to an      understanding of our region on which we can plan a      sustainable future.
