Chairman, I just want to commend the gentlewoman from Guam for bringing these issues to our attention and to say what a great leader she is on agriculture for the insular areas. We really, without her leadership, would not have been made aware. I know both the chairman and I, as ranking member, are very grateful to her, and we look forward to working with her through conference and for a final bill to be produced.
