President, I have an amendment at the desk on Reserve pay which I will be asking to be put in the queue for a vote tomorrow. This amendment I offered 2 days ago.  I am not going to belabor the issue other than to say to my colleagues, and for the record, that what it provides is that Federal employees who are members of the Guard and Reserves who are activated would have the difference in their pay--their military pay and their Federal pay--made up by the Federal agency for which they work. This is done by State governments and private companies and local units of government. It is not done by the Federal Government.  Frankly, this amendment was offered in good faith to have the Federal Government establish the standard so that activated Guard and Reserves who are Federal employees will receive this difference.
