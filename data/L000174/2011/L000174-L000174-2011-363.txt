President, I would like to join the Vermont Commission on National and Community Service in paying tribute to the outstanding Americorps men and women who have volunteered countless hours this past year supporting Vermont's communities, and communities around thecountry. The Vermont Commission on National and Community Service, first established by Governor Howard Dean in 1993, works with AmeriCorps volunteers, community volunteers and other organizations throughout Vermont to grow Vermont's dynamic communities. The service to others and civic engagement that the volunteer programs organized by the Commission promote are the cornerstone of Vermont's most treasured values.  Being a dedicated volunteer is often not an easy task. The Vermont Commission on National and Community Services allows servicemembers to shine through their vast opportunities and resources for our Vermont-based volunteers. Within the scope of their work, the Commission provides various opportunities to work in our communities through the AmeriCorps, Senior Corps and Learn and Serve America programs. The experiences of these volunteers will allow them to share their community values with the rest of Vermont and our great country.  I continue to be impressed with the achievements our dedicated professionals and young volunteers reach during their inspiring careers. I am pleased that the staff of the Vermont Commission on National and Community Service, along with their Americorps members, are being recognized for all that they have done day in and day out throughout Vermont. The skills and experiences of these volunteers are instrumental in helping our communities tackle tough and complex problems.  I am fortunate to call Vermont my home, and we are more than lucky to have so many local role models that continue to inspire our young citizens to get involved. Whether volunteering as an Americorps member, or helping a next door neighbor in need, Vermonters carry forward our longstanding tradition of community service and involvement. This is why Vermont continues to be the great State that it is today. To the staff and volunteers of the Vermont Commission on National and Community Service, again I say thank you for all that you do for Vermont.                          ____________________
