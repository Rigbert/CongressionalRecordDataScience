Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.  Mr. Speaker, I thank the chairman of our committee, the gentleman from California (Mr. Thomas) for facilitating this resolution moving forward.  I particularly want to commend my colleague, the gentleman from Indiana (Mr. Roemer), for sponsoring this resolution and for all his hard work in getting this body to pass legislation giving the Congressional Gold Medal to Father Theodore Hesburgh, the President Emeritus of the University of Notre Dame.  I leaned over to my colleague, the gentleman from Indiana (Mr. Roemer), and said that when we talked about him being a doctor or this, that, or the other, that really what he was was a parish writ large, not just for the United States but all the world.  The gentleman from Indiana (Mr. Roemer) I know is extraordinarily proud that his district is the home of Notre Dame, one of our Nation's great academic institutions. Whether it is in the classroom, the laboratory, or the athletic fields, Notre Dame is rightfully known for producing extraordinary leaders, including, I might say, our colleague, the gentleman from Indiana (Mr. Roemer), who received both his masters and his Ph.D. at that school.  I was, as all of us were, pleased to support the legislation granting Father Hesburgh a Congressional Gold Medal. I am honored to rise today in support of H. Con. Res. 344, which will grant use of the Capitol rotunda on July 13, 2000, for the presentation ceremony.                              {time}  1045  The Congressional Gold Medal is the highest honor, Mr. Speaker, that Congress can give to a private citizen of this Nation. We have given them to the heroes of our history, those who have displayed uncommon valor on the field of battle, courage in the pursuit of civil rights and insight in the quest of knowledge. Last October, Congress gave the Congressional Gold Medal to Father Hesburgh. We now will provide for the awarding of that medal.  For 35 years, Father Hesburgh guided one of our country's finest universities, through a period of unparalleled growth. I spoke at the beginning about the excellence of Notre Dame, not just on the athletic field but in the classroom and in the community. In large measure, it is because of the extraordinary people that have led Notre Dame, none of them more extraordinary than Father Hesburgh.  When he stepped down from the University's presidency in 1987, his tenure was the longest among active American college and university presidents. During his years as president of Notre Dame, Father Hesburgh used his leadership to seek the advancement of civil rights, peace and justice around the world. He has held 15 presidential appointments, confronting such diverse issues as the peaceful use of atomic energy, campus unrest, immigration reform and Third World development.  Throughout these efforts, Mr. Speaker, Father Hesburgh maintained an unwavering commitment to fairness, equality and justice. In 1964 when President Johnson awarded the Medal of Freedom to Father Hesburgh, he could have sat back and rested on his laurels as one of the most respected leaders of our Nation. He could have; but, of course, we know he did not. Rather he used his mantle of respect to fight for those whose voices are not always heard, whose issues are not always respected, and whose needs are not always met.  In those pursuits, he served not only his country, but most importantly, I am sure, to him, his God, and his faith. There is not enough time in this debate to review all the good work that Father Hesburgh has done in his life, but let me review just a few highlights.  He sought to bridge America's racial divide as chairperson of the Commission on Civil Rights from 1969 to 1972. He fought for the interests of the underdeveloped nations as chair of the Overseas Development Council for 11 years. He helped heal the scars of the Vietnam War with his service as a member of President's Ford's Presidential Clemency Board.  He worked to promote peace by organizing a meeting of world class scientists from both sides of the Iron Curtain urging the elimination of nuclear weapons.  After the meeting, he organized a convention of religious leaders who endorsed the views of the scientists. In addition, Mr. Speaker, to his honors, which include the Franklin Roosevelt Four Freedoms Medal, the Distinguished Peace Leader Award and the National Service Lifetime Award, Father Hesburgh has received 135 honorary degrees, the most ever awarded to any American.  Father Hesburgh is a wonderful, magnificent example of a good man who rose up and did great things. He however, was a humble person, walking closely with his God. I can think of no person for whom the honor is more appropriate.  Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues, as I know they will, to unanimously support this resolution.  Mr. Speaker, I yield 6 minutes to the distinguished gentleman from Indiana (Mr. Roemer).
