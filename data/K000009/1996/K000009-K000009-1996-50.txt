Speaker, a little over a year ago, our Jobs and Fair Trade Caucus brought together a small coalition of working women, consumer groups, and Members of Congress to launch what we have called the come shop with me campaign, a campaign to educate the American consumer about the link between the loss of U.S. jobs here at home, high prices, static wages, sweatshop working conditions in the developing world and even in some places here in this country and the record profits being made by certain multinational companies which keep U.S. prices high while relentlessly moving our jobs offshore.  We illustrated this link between loss of U.S. jobs and trade by targeting specific corporations, going to stores and checking prices, scouring annual reports and newspaper clippings, and most importantly, talking to consumers and workers, getting their side of the story.  Mr. Speaker, today we embark on a golden eagle campaign to recognize and reward fine U.S. companies that exemplify the best that is in us as a nation. Simultaneously, we will identify those companies and chief executive officers whose behavior is not exemplary and deserve to be labeled only as corporate vultures.  The corporate vulture label will be given to American corporations which are in need of vast improvement. These are the ones which exploit our marketplace yet have downsized their work forces, which have outsourced most of their production to foreign countries, which use sweatshop labor abroad and then import these transshipped goods back to the United States, keeping their prices high here at home and maintaining a shell company in our country, even while enjoying all of the benefits of being called an American company.  The vulture, a predator and a scavenger, is an appropriate symbol for identifying U.S. corporations that exploit foreign workers while getting fat on the backs of American consumers and giving back almost nothing in return.                              {time}  1515  But let us begin on the positive side of the ledger with our first award, the Golden Eagle Award, and we will do one of these each month between now and the end of this fiscal year. This very prestigious Golden Eagle Award recognizes a U.S. firm and its chief executive officer who exemplified the best in business behavior. We are proud of them as citizens of this great country. The Golden Eagle Award will be presented to a U.S. firm that treats its workers with dignity while making decent profits, resists the tide of downsizing and outsourcing production, contributes to the strengthening of our communities, charges a reasonable price for its products, and remains and prospers in the United States of America.  I am very pleased to present the first Golden Eagle Award on behalf of our caucus, along with a new U.S. flag flown over our Capitol, to Malden Mills in Methuen, MA, and more specifically I would like to present the first Golden Eagle Award to Aaron Feuerstein, the 70-year-old owner of Malden Mills whom the local press there has hailed as the saint in New England.  On December 11 last year a major fire struck Malden Mills, the company Mr. Feuerstein's grandfather founded in 1906, burning down 3 of 9 buildings and idling 1,800 employees, three-quarters of the work force at that company. But instead of laying off his work force and pulling up stakes for Mexico, as so many other textile and apparel firms have done across this land, Mel Feuerstein promised he would pay the workers their wages and, even more incredibly, their health care benefits, for 30 days, and when it became obvious that more time was needed, he extended the period to 60 days and then to 90 days.  When asked why he did it, Mr. Feuerstein replied simply, ``Because I consider the employees standing in front of me as the most valuable asset Malden Mills has. I don't consider them as just an expense which can be cut.''  What makes Mr. Feuerstein's story all the more remarkable is that he stayed in Methuen, MA, even in the face of adversity while most of his much larger competitors, some of the names you will even recognize, Sara Lee, Fruit of the Loom, continue to close plants in this country and give pink slips to workers and move their production offshore.  Over the past 20 years 292,300 workers, mostly women, have lost their jobs in our Nation in the textile and apparel industries. Forty percent of that industry in our country is without a job. But Aaron Feuerstein, and he is not a multinational, has tried to hold out, treated his workers well and has continued to make a profit. He is a shining example of what it means to be a good corporate citizen in the United States and try to struggle uphill against the vultures of the mega corporations that would like to snuff him out of business.  Mr. Feuerstein truly deserves our praise as a patriotic citizen. Along with our first Golden Eagle Award, we will mail to him today this brand new flag flown in his honor and his firm's honor over this Capitol of the United States. Mr. Feuerstein, thank you, thank you for your decency and for your leadership as a corporate citizen of this Nation.  By contrast, we have chosen to designate the Nike Corp. as the first recipient of our corporate vulture label. Nike has shut down all of its production in this country. It does not even produce one athletic shoe in the United States of America, even while it earns billions in profits off this marketplace. In fact, their profits have quadrupled, gone up over 4 times over the past 5 years, by aggressively marketing, and I underline the word ``marketing,'' many of their shoe products and marketing them to some of our most impressionable young people.  The company now commands over one-half, one-half of the men's athletic shoe market in this country. Not a bad racket if you are Nike, paying your women workers in Indonesia and China 12 cents an hour while charging our kids and our families $135 to $150 a pair for shoes, but not a good deal if you are a downsized American worker who used to make those shoes in Maine or in California, or a consumer who has to pay those high prices. Not a good deal for them. Or how about if you are an anonymous Chinese woman worker whose government makes its money off the sweat of your work? Not a good deal for you either.  Now Nike would like you to believe that they are a great American company. In fact, they have been spending $250 million a year out of the money they make off of you trying to convince you how good they really are. They bought so much advertising it is hard to turn on television without seeing it. Nike has virtually bought off the entire American sporting world to delude the American consumer about what is really going on here.  The truth of the matter is that all of Nike's 75,000 production workers, mostly poverty-stricken women and hungry girls, are in countries like Indonesia, Thailand, China, and South Korea, countries which are notorious for their sweat shop working conditions and bleeding all they can out of their people until they are finished with them. Then they throw them out the door, and there is another million people who are hungry, lined up to replace them to work for 10 cents an hour.  Now here at home Nike threatens to tear up our communities with their relentless marketing to our most vulnerable kids. You know what is happening. In some places in this country our children are killing one another for these shoes. As Phil Mushnick, a sports writer for the New York Post, courageously pointed out when he refused to endorse Nike shoes, he said, ``I saw the prices going from $40 to $90 to $100 and then $150, and in full cognizance that people were dying for these shoes, inner city kids, too, the kids that Nike wastargeting with their inner city role model marketing binge.''  For this our caucus can think of no other company more deserving of the label ``corporate vulture'' than Nike Corp.  Now Mr. Philip Knight, the chairman of the board of that company and its chief executive officer, took home compensation of over $1.5 million last year, not including his stock bonuses and other benefits and perks. I often ask myself whether this type of individual has any conscience left or if he ever had any, to profit personally off the meager wages paid to Asian women and the U.S. workers he has sent to the unemployment lines. Mr. Knight and Nike, for you our caucus designates the ``vulture'' label.  Mr. Speaker, I also wanted to place in the Record this evening in our battle, continuing battle for job creation in this country to give our workers and our communities a fair shake in the international market, some information on a bill moving through this Congress that Members should know about. It concerns our patent laws, the very basis for our collective intelligence as a people, the foundation of our new products where the genius for America's future lies.  The U.S. patent system is under attack, and the United States, without question, has the largest body of intellectual property in the world, protected from the time of George Washington and created by the first Congress of the United States. If this system is weakened, and there are many who would like to see that it is, America's job creation capacity will be even more seriously eroded.  Today I rise to point out that one of the bills moving in this Congress is a grave threat to our traditional patent system; that bill number, H.R. 2533, with a very innocuous title, ``The U.S. Intellectual Property Organization Act of 1995.''  Why am I concerned about it? Because why should our Nation pass a law that puts us at a greater competitive disadvantage with our trade competitors around the world? H.R. 2533 is tantamount to selling off our national heritage bit by bit. H.R. 2533 would subject our patent examiners to undue pressure by special interests by removing their current civil service status.  You know, there ought to be some things in this town not for sale.  H.R. 2533 would undermine the Constitution of this country by removing the Patent Office as a core Federal function, and congressional oversight in that bill becomes almost nil.  I ask my colleagues to pay attention to this bill, oppose H.R. 2533, and support H.R. 359, which restores patent terms and gives our patent and inventors, the geniuses of our country who are inventing our future, the kind of protection and respect that the Government of the United States and the people of the United States owe them.  Let me say to my colleagues, do not be fooled by the wolves at the door, and let me say you might ask yourself the question, ``Well, who would want to tamper with our patent system? In whose interests would it be to weaken the protections we give to our inventors?''  There is an article I am going to be placing in the Record called the National Security Report, lead article, ``American Patent System Subject To Foreign Power Grab.'' There are plenty of powerful interests around the world that would like to own the competitive genius of this country, and they know the only way they can do that is by changing the laws.  In fact, the Constitution of the United States, and I quote from the article I am going to enter in the Record,       In the war for global economic dominance, the fiercest      battles today are over intellectual property. Where nations      once fought for control of trade routes and raw materials,      they now fight for exclusive rights to ideas, innovations and      inventions.  The article referred to is as follows:          [From the ROA National Security Report, Sept. 1995]          American Patent System Subject To Foreign Power Grab                           (By Beverly Selby)       The recent book Patent Wars: The Battle To Own The World's      Technology, best describes the reason for the current      legislative struggle in the 104th Congress about intellectual      property. It states, ``In the war for global economic      dominance, the fiercest battles today are over intellectual      property. Where nations once fought for control of trade      routes and raw materials, they now fight for exclusive rights      to ideas, innovations and inventions.''       In 1947, intellectual property comprised just under 10      percent of all U.S. exports; today, the estimate is that      ``intellectual property accounts for well over 50 percent of      all American exports.'' The United States is a major player      in the world community because it has the largest body of      intellectual property in the world. Job creation      opportunities are directly linked with the patent system      which has been the secret of America's job creation and      economic power for over 200 years.       Today, in the 104th Congress, the debate is about restoring      the patent term, and other issues which will radically change      the American patent system. Legislation has been introduced      to restore the patent term, publish patent applications      before a patent is issued, re-examine issued patents, and      create a government Patent and Trademark Corporation.       On one side of the argument are multinational companies and      foreign interests, and on the other are independent      inventors, small businessmen, venture capitalists and      universities. The major issue is the patent term. Several      concerns have been raised about pending legislation and its      effect on the American patent system.       Last year when Congress approved legislation implementing      the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade (GATT), a      provision was included that dramatically changed the way      the U.S. patents will be issued. Historically, patents      have been awarded for a term of 17 years beginning when      the Patent & Trademark Office (PTO) grants a patent to an      applicant. However, beginning on 8 June of this year, the      PTO will issue patents for a 20-year term beginning when      the application was filed with the PTO.       The net effect of this change is to dramatically shorten      the useful life of breakthrough patents held by emerging      companies, which have led to the creation of entire      industries. Patents of highly technical, cutting-edge      discoveries take years to issue. Under current law, such a      delay in inconsequential as the patent holder is assured a      minimum patent term of 17 years because the time does not      begin to tick until the patent is issued. Not so with the new      20 year standard, as it often takes the PTO eight to nine      years or even longer to issue a patent, leaving the patent      holder with only a few years of protection, if any.       Given the vast amount of capital needed to sustain many      high growth companies, retaining exclusive use of the      underlying intellectual property for a full 17 years is      imperative if any emerging company is to recover its costs      and provide a competitive rate of return to its venture      investors.       Congressman Dana Rohrabacher (R-Calif.) has introduced      legislation that would cure the problem of a shortened patent      term. His bill, H.R. 359, would make U.S. patents valid for      17 years from date of issue, or 20 years from date of filing,      whichever period is longer. During the course of the GATT      debate last fall, United States Trade Representative Mickey      Kantor agreed the Administration would not oppose legislation      guaranteeing a minimum patent term of 17 years as it would      not constitute a violation of the GATT agreement.       Many changes to the American patent laws were proposed in      1994. The patent term limitation was passed because it was      piggybacked on the GATT-implementing legislation. This change      in the patent term weakens the American patent system and      penalizes the breakthrough patents. Also, these changes      facilitate widespread copying of the more important      inventions by foreign companies.       Three of these changes, when taken in combination,      establish a disastrous scenario that clarifies the reason for      the Japanese insistence that America adopt these changes.      These three changes are (a) a patent term measured from the      filing date (the GATT patent term), (b) publication in 18      months and (c) three party re-examination.       The scenario for important breakthrough (e.g. high-tech)      patent applications is disturbing. The breakthrough patent      application is filed and then it is published in 18 months.      Because of its importance, large multinational companies      rally to oppose the breakthrough patent by filing prior art,      and most likely by filing arguments opposing the issuance of      the breakthrough patent. Because of the significantly longer      pendency for important patents, the breakthrough patent is      far from issuing when the oppositions' are filed. The patent      examiner, who is reluctant to issue a breakthrough patent      having broad claims, enters new rejections based upon the      prior art submitted by the opposition. This further increases      the pendency time.       Currently, the patent officer permits the filing of      multiple re-examinations in sequence. Therefore, to be      consistent, the patent office will undoubtedly permit the      filing of multiple oppositions in sequence, opposition after      opposition, causing the examiner to enter new rejections as      new art is cited, further delaying the issuance of the      patent. Under the GATT patent term, the term of breakthrough      patent applications is further reduced by the long pendency.       Because of the 18 month publication requirement, companies      worldwide are able to copy and to develop the breakthrough      technology while the patent application is still pending. As      currently practiced in Japan, and as a direct result of the      publication,     competitive products begin to appear in the marketplace and      large companies ``flood'' the PTO with multitudes of      mundane improvement patents on the breakthrough      technology. As in Japan, these mundane improvement patents      are often issued before the breakthrough patent because of      the prosecution delays inherent with such a breakthrough      patent, and because delaying oppositions are not filed for      mundane improvement patents.       When and if the breakthrough patent finally issues, much of      the GATT patent term has expired, and its patent owner will      be competing with mature products in the marketplace and      ``floods'' of mundane improvement patents based upon the      patent owner's originally published breakthrough technology.      However, this is far from the end of the ordeal for the      patent owner. Now the competitors file a sequence of re-     examinations, one after another. A re-examination is a post-     issuance opposition. The company behind the re-examination is      kept secret, and an attorney is usually named as the re-     examination requester. A re-examination can take more than      five years. After a re-examination is completed, another, and      another, and another, can be filed. A patent cannot be      realistically enforced while a re-examination is in progress.      Hence, a sequence of re-examinations further dissipates the      effective term of the patent.       Now, new legislation is in progress to make re-examinations      third party proceedings. Presently, a re-examination is      conducted by the patent examiner. The requester can file      initial papers but is not permitted to intervene in the re-     examination. The new legislation permits the requester to      participate in the re-examination. This will change a re-     examination into a form of litigation with a team of opposing      attorneys arguing issues, filing briefs, and performing many      other complex litigation activities. The PTO has trouble      hiring and training qualified patent examiners; now the PTO      will have to train patent examiners to be litigation judges.       Even worse, many breakthrough inventions come from small      companies and individual inventors with limited resources.      Matching up such a patent owner against a team of attorneys      from a large foreign company will usually end in devastation      of the breakthrough patent. Even if the patent owner      prevails, another re-examination will be requested by another      large company citing a different stack of prior art      references and the attack will start all over again.       In Japan the combination of conditions has resulted in      important technologies being exposed and unprotected: a      patent term measured from the filing date (the GATT patent      term), publication after 18 months, and third party      oppositions. This has resulted in Japan becoming a nation of      copiers. Now, those seeking to copy American technology are      demanding legislation to deprive America of its innovative      talents. America must stand firm behind its inventors, small      businesses, research universities, and entrepreneurs, and not      permit its intellectual property to be copied with impunity.       Research universities also share a longstanding interest      and an active involvement in intellectual property issues      that affect higher education. Since the passage of Public Law      96-517 (The Bayh-Dole Act) in 1980, research universities      have been actively engaged in establishing patent protection      for university-developed technology and subsequently      licensing their patents to industry and small business.      Innovations resulting from university research are deemed      largely responsible for the spectacular growth of the      biotechnology industry, and of significant importance to the      microelectronics, computer and health care industries. These      innovations are culled from the fundamental scientific      explorations of university faculty, students and research      scientists and, as a result, tend to be at the cutting edge      of scientific theory and practice. As a consequence, patent      applications on university inventions have historically spent      years in the PTO before ultimately issuing as patents.       University licensing programs are generally dependent upon      patent protection to induce mature companies as well as small      businesses and start-up company investors to take a financial      risk on backing the further development of new, and often      early-stage, technologies. Consequently, university      technology transfer managers were indeed concerned to find      that H.R. 5110, in implementing the GATT, had potentially      shortened the long-established patent term of 17 years from      date of patent issue, and had done so despite the fact that      such action was not required by the GATT.       Our interests in enhancing the successful transfer of      university technology, and in helping to keep the U.S. as a      front-runner in commercially exploiting new technologies, are      not well-served by potentially diminishing the useful life of      our patents in an effort to reap an unquantified benefit from      harmonization with potentially less innovative nations who      stand to gain from shorter patent terms.       These are but a few of the concerns of the independent      inventor, venture capitalists and universities who are      relying on their patents for income and to create new      industries. What must be remembered is the fact that the U.S.      system is unique and was created by the founding fathers as a      means of generating jobs and prosperity for the country. To      date, the United States is leading the world in fundamental      patents, which are most often cited in patent literature      worldwide.       These patents are the way to chart the prosperity and      future for a nation because the patent holder will derive      income over a period of time. From those patents spring new      industries. At stake in the legislation now before Congress      is whether the patent system should be used to benefit the      American taxpayer and voter, or the world at large. The      choice of the future is ours.--NSR                               nsr focus       Experts warn that the current debate in Congress on patent      regulations can have a serious impact on the national      security of our nation. Critics of the new system, which      resulted from GATT negotiations and a deal cut with Japan      last year, contend that foreign firms will gain access to      American inventions, ultimately weakening the international      competitiveness of the United States.       Robert Rines, an inventor and prominent Boston lawyer,      claims that the new system is going to wreak havoc with      breakthrough inventions, which, historically, have come from      individual inventors or small firms, not from large      corporations.       The U.S. system awards patents to the original inventor,      not the first to file, as in other countries. Under the new      20-month publication provision, key concepts of an invention      become available to anyone before the inventor has a chance      to refile and win protection. That is why Japan, the      multinations and other big companies love it, and why,      according to Rines, ``the little guys are deathly afraid of      it.''       Beverly Selby's article is a fundamental document which      clearly details the fear and concerns of the small businesses      and American inventors, who, at the core of the U.S.      innovative process, are faced with new patent provisions that      fail to protect American technology and innovative small      business--AACG
