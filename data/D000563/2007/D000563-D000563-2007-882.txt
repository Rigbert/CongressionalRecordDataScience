President, this immigration bill will offer an opportunity for hundreds of thousands of people to come to the United States and go to work. But I believe there should be one guiding principle behind this bill: First offer the jobs to Americans. Those who are unemployed, those who are developing the skills should have the first chance to fill these jobs.  Senator Grassley and I have a bipartisan amendment which eliminates the loophole and makes it a requirement, when it comes to guest workers, that the jobs first be offered to Americans to fill. I think that is a reasonable starting point for any debate on immigration.  I yield the floor.
