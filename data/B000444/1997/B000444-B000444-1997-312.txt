 When I was chairman of the committee and a Republican was President, we held, on average, a hearing for judges once every 2 weeks and had usually five judges, circuit court and district court, who we heard.  Last year we essentially had one hearing every other month and we had to fight to get three to four on the agenda to be heard.
