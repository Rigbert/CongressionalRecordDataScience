 President I rise today to pay tribute to an Alabama couple who, in their persistent pursuit of justice, successfully raised awareness of illegal activities taking place in Marengo County in some of the highest levels of county government. Goodloe and Jean Sutton, who together head The Democrat-Reporter--Goodloe serves as editor and publisher and Jean as chief reporter--remind us of what the Fourth Estate is all about. Through their thorough and diligent coverage of questionable activities in the Marengo County Sheriff's office, former Sheriff Roger Davis was convicted on federal extortion charges; Sonny Breckenridge, who had been appointed by Sheriff Davis to lead the county's drug enforcement unit, was sentenced to life without parole for conspiring to protect drug dealers. Another deputy was also arrested. All are serving jail time for the deeds the Suttons helped to uncover.  Goodloe and Jean Sutton are to be commended. Not only have they helped to rid the Marengo County Sheriff's office of misdeeds and rampant corruption, but they have helped to restore the public faith in local government. They have also set an exemplary standard for others in the profession of journalism where truth should always be the highest and most important pursuit and consideration.  In addition to my statement, Mr. President, I believe it is fitting to include the following article about the Suttons, entitled ``Paper Tigers,'' that appeared in the September 28, 1998 edition of People Magazine.  I ask that the article be printed in the Record.  The article follows.                 [From People Magazine, Sept. 28, 1998]  Paper Tigers--Newshounds Goodloe and Jean Sutton Get the Goods on a                           Lawbreaking Sheriff                  (By Peter Ames Carlin and Grace Lim)       From where they sat in the tiny newsroom of The Democrat-     Reporter in rural Linden, Ala., Goodloe and Jean Sutton      sensed there was something wrong about Roger Davis. Not only      did the sheriff of Alabama's rural Marengo County (pop.      25,000) sell jewelry out of the trunk of his police car but      he seemed to enjoy throwing his weight around. ``Davis      thought being sheriff made him all-powerful,'' says Jean.      ``He was impressed with himself.''       But the Suttons were not, so when they learned that Davis      had skimmed money from the county, they featured the story in      their family-owned weekly newspaper. Ignoring threats and      boycotts by the sheriff's cronies for more than three years,      the couple kept on writing until Davis and two of his      deputies had earned jail terms and the modest, six-employee      paper had earned Pulitzer Prize consideration and a wall full      of journalism trophies. ``To take on the sheriff, the most      powerful political leader in a rural county, is beyond      gutsy,'' says Alabama Attorney General Bill Pryor, who      investigated the crooked sheriff.       Sheriff Davis, now 57, started dipping into the county till      in 1991, a year after the retired Alabama state trooper was      elected to his $35,000-a-year post. First he used public      money to buy his teenage daughter a $3,000 all-terrain      vehicle for Christmas, only later returning to the dealer to      pay with his own money. Davis funneled county dollars into      his account for several years, then extorted more than      $20,000 from bail bondsmen who had been operating illegally      without the required financial reserves. He wasn't subtle      about it. ``If he could control you by fear, he'd do it,''      says Goodloe. ``Or if he could do you a favor, he'd expect      you to repay him. And he charmed people too.''       Operating on a tip in early 1994, Jean Sutton first dug      into the county financial records and discovered that $9,000      in public funds delivered to Davis had never made it to the      office account. The Suttons ran the story as front-page news,      eliciting a denial from the sheriff. ``He told people he was      a good Christian,'' says Jean. ``When they asked why he      didn't sue us for libel, he'd say, `I prayed over it, and it      wasn't the right thing to do.' ''       Although Davis (who declined People's request for an      interview) dodged those first editorial bullets, battle lines      were drawn. Many of his supporters canceled their      subscriptions to The Democrat-Reporter, cutting its      circulation 20 percent from 7,500 to 6,000, and some local      businesses pulled their advertisements. ``As far as I know,      he did a good job sheriffing while he was in office,'' says      retired store owner Gaines Williamson, who once backed the      sheriff. ``Everybody knew him. We'd chitchat over a couple of      coffee.'' Some Davis partisans felt so strongly they even      phoned the Suttons, threatening to blow up the family van.      ``Remember,'' one letter assured them, ``your day will      come.''       For Goodloe, 59, the chance to take down a crooked sheriff      was worth the tension. The youngest of three kids born to      publisher Robert Sutton, who bought The Democrat-Reporter in      1917, and his wife, Lorie, Goodloe first set type at the      family newspaper when he was 12. He met aspiring writer Jean      Rodgers, daughter of Will and Mary, while studying journalism      at the University of Southern Mississippi, and the couple      married after graduating in 1964.       Moving home to Linden, Sutton succeeded his father as      editor and publisher of The Democrat-Reporter and installed      Jean, now 57, as chief reporter. The couple--who have two      sons, Goodloe Jr., 27, who works for the state Republican      Party, and William, 14, a high school freshman--gained a      reputation as uncompromising journalists. ``Goodloe can sell      a paper, that's for sure,'' says cement-company foreman Jerry      Stewart. ``There's a lot of controversy, which makes for      interesting reading.''       The Democrat-Reporter became even more interesting in May      1997, when two sheriff's deputies were arrested by federal      and state agents for conspiring to protect drug dealers--one,      Sonny Breckenridge, who was sentenced to life without parole,      had been appointed by Davis to lead the county's drug      enforcement unit. Meanwhile, with the Suttons' articles      pointing the way, the state and federal authorities began      closing in on the sheriff. By August of last year, Davis too     was behind bars, caught in a joint state and FBI sting while      squeezing a $975 payoff from an illegal bondsman. Two months      later, he pleaded guilty to federal extortion charges; he was      assessed $30,000 in fines and restitution. ``I would like to      apologize to my family, my friends and my church and to the      people of Marengo County,'' the sheriff said en route to      prison, where he'll serve 27 months. ``I'm sorry.''       Although their circulation has yet to rebound fully, the      Suttons vow to continue in Marengo County whether their      future holds trophies or threats. ``We're just humble      scribes,'' says Goodloe, who is also running to represent the      region in Alabama's House of Representatives. ``And we have      the best turkey hunting, the best deer hunting and the best-     looking women in the country. Why would anybody want to go      anywhere else?''                          ____________________
