REID. Let me say to my friend, a perfect example of that is what is going on on the floor as we speak. One of our colleagues, the distinguished junior Senator from Indiana, Mr. Bayh, has an issue. He offered an amendment to this bill.  The reason he offered it to this bill is he wanted to make a statement about something that is going on in China. He believes trade policies there are unfair and unbalanced. He offered an amendment on this bill.  You can debate whether it should be on this bill, but it is on this bill. He offered an amendment. We have a right to do that. He, as a result of what he has done, held up the nomination of Rob Portman, Congressman Portman to be Trade Representative. I like Congressman Portman, a good man. I think he will do a good job as our Trade Representative.  As we speak, because of this filibuster that he, in effect, is conducting--not necessarily on this bill, but he is not going to let Portman go forward, so we will have to vote 2 days from now--the parties have come together. They are talking. I am confident we will work that out and Portman will be approved tomorrow.  The answer is yes. One of the good things about this institution we have found in the 214 years it has been in existence is that the filibuster, which has been in existence since the beginning, from the days of George Washington--we have changed the rules as relates to it a little bit but never by breaking the rules.  I say to my distinguished friend, the senior Senator from Illinois, in all the political writings about filibuster, that is one of the things they talk about as a positive. It forces people to get together because sometimes in this body you become very fixed. You think you are the only person who knows what is going on and you need to examine yourself. The other person has an issue. The Senator from Illinois is absolutely right. It brings people together.
