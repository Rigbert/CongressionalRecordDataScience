Speaker, I rise today to honor and pay tribute to my friend and proud Navy veteran Carl Theodore Wolf, Jr., who passed away on Sunday, November 6, 2016. Carl was a caring member of his community, and he will be deeply missed.  Carl served in the U.S. Navy for ten years with honor and distinction. While serving in Germany on the Rhine River Patrol, Carl met his wife Anneliese. After their marriage on November 6, 1955, Carl and Anneliese made their first home in San Diego, California. A few years later, they would celebrate the birth of their daughter Brigitte. In 1967, the Wolf family picked up and settled down in Reseda, California.  Carl loved his country and his family. He was an avid reader and especially enjoyed history books. Carl truly enjoyed talking to people and relished recounting stories about his travels around the world while serving in the Navy.  Carl's dedication to his work, family, and country are a testament to a life lived well and a legacy that will continue. I was proud to call Carl my friend and I will deeply miss him. I extend my condolences to Carl's family and friends; although Carl may be gone, the light and goodness he brought to the world remains and will never be forgotten.                            ____________________
