Speaker, as so many of my colleagues, I went home this weekend and talked to our constituents about the very serious and all-important subject of war, and I thought that I would put some of this on the record tonight, because my constituents are asking me, is war the answer? Is war the answer to meet the terrorist threat? Who is really the enemy, and what are the roots of the terrorism that America faces?  I found a great ambivalence among the people, wanting to say, ``Well, we want to be united even though we do not understand the cause. We want to stand with the President. We may not agree with what is being done, but if we stand united, then we will win whatever we go into because we remember Vietnam, and the reason we lost in Vietnam is we were not united, and so this time united we stand.''  I just wanted to say to those who may not have lived during the Vietnam period, America did not lose in Vietnam because she was not united. America did not carry the day because there was no way any Western power could have carried the day in a country that was undergoing regime change, fundamental, a fight we never should have been into in the first place, and we asked the impossible.                              {time}  2320  So we think about what is happening with the terrorist situation and some of the breeding grounds for those who hate the West in the Middle East and Central Asia, and it is important to ask ourselves whether war will solve the problem; will solve the problem of growing terrorism; will solve the problem of hatred expressed against the United States and other Western countries and installations.  I have done quite a bit of research, and I want to put on the Record tonight what I call a terrorism chart that covers the entirety of the 20th century and goes back actually to 1902 and to how the original countries in the Middle East and Central Asia were formed. But it reminds us also, it takes us through the Suez crisis back in 1956; and then when I came of political age, the assassination of Robert Kennedy as a Democratic candidate for President by a Jordanian Arab national who felt he had lost his homeland in east Jerusalem. And still remaining, the Israeli-Palestinian conflict that remains unsolved and remains a lightning rod and source of discontent in that region of the world. Then, in 1968, the beginning of mass terrorism. One can go through 1979; we probably remember the Iranian hostage-takers, held 52 Americans for 444 days.  The point I wish to make is, with all of the turmoil, all of the assassinations, and the growing level of violence, did the Persian Gulf War really solve the growing level of terrorism and violence we see? Did the wars of the Middle East and Central Asia solve the terrorism that we now see springing up all the way from Malaysia to central and East Africa?  I think it is important for us to understand the roots of the terrorism that have resulted in the loss now last year of 3,025 additional lives here in our country. So I wish to place on the Record this summary. It also exists on our Web site.  Mr. Speaker, I wanted to quote from a very, very prescient author, Robin Wright, ``Sacred Rage,'' written back during the 1980s and recently updated from the first chapter where she talks about the crusade, that, indeed, the challenge of terrorism is really the challenge of meeting a different point of view arising globally from many sources. She quotes the former Lebanese Prime Minister, Saeb Salam, who said, ``The growth of Islamic fundamentalism is an earthquake.''  I can remember being elected in 1982, coming here in 1983, in the fall; and we saw the U.S. marine command center at Beirut's International Airport devastated by two car bombs and we lost 240 Marines, and Navy personnel dead. I can remember at that time becoming brutally aware of a changing world and the shifting sands of the politics of that region of the world.  In Robin Wright's book she talks about a wall in our State Department where if you walked in the door at that time, two greenish-black stone plaques listed in gold letters the names and dates of diplomats of the United States killed in the line of duty since the founding of our Republic. Over that period, from 1780 to 1967, over 187 years, we had lost 143 U.S. diplomats killed in the line of duty. But the second plaque that sits at the State Department was filled in equal number in almost 18 years. And, if one looks at the pace of terrorist attacks against the West, one sees that the pace is increasing in spite of wars, in spite of additional military actions. So one has to ask ourselves whether more wars lead to less terrorism or more terrorism, and whether war is really the answer to give at the root of what the problem is.  I commend this book, ``Sacred Rage,'' to those who are listening among our colleagues here and only end with one of the sentences in the book that points out some of the mistakes, particularly by the West, that have only provoked the Muslim fundamentalists rather than cope realistically with what they represent: ``The stakes have never been so high, the potential for misunderstanding and further violence never so great.''  Mr. Speaker, war may not be the answer to solving the terrorist threat.                          ____________________
