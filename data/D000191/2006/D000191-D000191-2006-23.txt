  Mr. DeFAZIO. Mr. Speaker, Medicare part D, confusing, complicated, very costly. In fact, the Bush administration lied about the cost. They had estimates that said it would cost $750 billion to $1 trillion, but they suppressed that to get votes from conservatives on their side. They said not a penny more than 400 million, and it is very costly to seniors.  We now have 3 million seniors who have fallen into something called the donut hole. They get to spend $2,600 out of pocket before they get any more Medicare prescription drug benefit, and they have to pay a higher price for the drugs during that time period than they could get at the local drugstore, let alone getting it from Canada or if it was centrally purchased by the government.  We have it in our power to fix it today, save the taxpayer $750 billion, get the seniors out of the donut hole, but they are going to say it is the custom and practice of the House not to consider such things.  The custom and the practice of the House is to fix problems confronting the people of the United States of America. It is cleared on my side of the aisle. If he objects, it is only the Republicans who object.  Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent to take up the bill, H.R. 752.
