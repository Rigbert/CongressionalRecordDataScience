President, I would like to recognize the Bove family of Burlington, VT, on receiving a prestigious honor from the National Association of Specialty Food Trades. In particular, I congratulate Mark Bove, President of Bove's, and his brother Rick, on receiving the Gold Sofi Award in the Outstanding Pasta, Rice and Grain category.  Bove's Restaurant opened on Pearl Street in Burlington in 1941 and has been a local favorite for generations. Marcelle and I enjoyed many of Bove's Italian specialties while we were dating. I was a student at Saint Michael's College, and Marcelle at the Jeanne Mance School of Nursing. To this day, Bove's continues to be a favorite among college students, and many return to the restaurant as alumni during their reunion weekends.  Much to our delight, Mark Bove began bottling his family's outstanding sauces for sale in grocery stores and now also sells Bove's specialties, including meatballs and lasagna, at retail sites around our country. When I come home from a long day in the Senate, I am delighted that Marcelle and I can still enjoy a dinner from Bove's, just as we did as students years ago. We have also enjoyed sharing their great dishes with other Senators and their staff at the annual Taste of Vermont in Washington.  Once again, I congratulate the Bove family for this high honor. I ask unanimous consent to have a copy of a July 6 article from the Burlington Free Press printed in the Record.  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in the Record, as follows:             [From the Burlington Free Press, July 6, 2009]             Business Monday: Bove's Wins Gold for Lasagna       Bove's famous frozen lasagna has been awarded the National      Association of Specialty Food Trades' prestigious Gold Sofi      Award in the Outstanding Pasta, Rice and Grain Category.       The all-natural, hand crafted lasagna is a frozen version      of the popular classic served at Bove's cafe on Pearl Street      in Burlington.       A year ago Mark Bove, president and sauceboy, introduced      the world to his family's recipe on The Food Network's      ``Throwdown with Bobby Flay,'' soon followed by an appearance      on ``The Today Show,'' where Bove prepared his lasagna for      Hoda Kotb and Kathie Lee Gifford. The national exposure sent      demand soaring.       ``I was making small versions of the lasagna at the      restaurant and shipping them around the country,'' Bove said      in a statement. ``We just couldn't keep up with demand this      way, which led me to produce the lasagna for retail.''                          ____________________
