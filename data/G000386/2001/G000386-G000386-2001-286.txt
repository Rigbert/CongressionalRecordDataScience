 President, in March I held a hearing on the growing threat of Ecstasy use in America. For a long time we've been hearing that the Ecstasy problem is coming. Well, it's arrived. We heard some disturbing news at this hearing. We heard first-hand testimony from two former users how this ``feel-good'' drug ruined their lives and almost killed them. It's clear to me that this drug is destroying families and lives. Ecstasy, like all drug use, is a serious challenge facing our country.  Ecstasy is a synthetic stimulant. It is called a club drug because it is most commonly used at parties and all-night dance clubs called raves. Its use by youth to enhance the experience of the music and the dancing in clubs, has become very popular. Because it is marketed in clubs, most users are young, as well as most sellers.  At the hearing in March, the White House released the latest Pulse Check report that outlined the recent trends in Ecstasy use. This report confirmed that most users are children and young adults. These drugs are clearly targeted at youths. Ecstasy is found primarily in pill form and manufacturers put cartoons and flashy corporate logos on the pills to make them more appealing.  Ecstasy use is spreading around the country and is affecting all areas. The Pulse Check report shows that both rural and urban areas are experiencing an Ecstasy explosion. In fact, 18 of the 20 cities in the report labeled Ecstasy as an emerging drug. This isn't the drug of the big city anymore, it is now in hometown America.  As the demand is increasing, the availability of Ecstasy is increasing too. The report shows that widespread usage and availability increased dramatically over the past year. Ninety percent of all drug treatment and law enforcement experts say that Ecstasy is readily accessible. If we continue to allow easy access to this drug at clubs and in schools, then this problem will just get worse.  One of the greatest dangers of Ecstasy is how it is used. The report stated that Ecstasy is losing its purity and is now commonly adulterated with other, even more dangerous drugs, such as heroin and amphetamines. Users usually don't know the level of the drug they are taking and will overdose easily. And at parties and dances, Ecstasy is most often taken with several other drugs, most commonly alcohol, but also LSD, marijuana, and cocaine. This deadly cocktail of drugs is making ambulances at clubs an all too common sight. These ambulances, that are now shuttling more unconscious youth than ever before from nightclubs to hospital emergency rooms, are often private ambulances that are hired by the nightclubs themselves. They wait outside the clubs until someone overdoses from the use of Ecstasy, thus bypasing 911 and the attention of the police. My outrage with this practice is heightened by the low level of care and lack of advanced life support that these ambulance crews provide at such dangerous moments. Many youth are not safely making it to hospital emergency rooms.  The situation is becoming an emergency. We need to make it clear to today's youth that this drug is very dangerous and that using it carries heavy consequences. This drug rips apart families and ruins lives at a very young age. Many youth start using this drug before they are old enough to fully grasp the results of their actions. We need to educate our youth and crack down on sellers to combat the increasing availability of this drug. We cannot let this attack on our Nation's youth go unchecked.                          ____________________
