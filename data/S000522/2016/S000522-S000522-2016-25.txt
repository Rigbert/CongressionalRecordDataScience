Sadly, the drumbeat for unilateral United Nations action on this issue continues. On October 14, the U.N. Security Council held a special debate, titled, ``Illegal Israeli Settlements: Obstacles to Peace and the Two-State Solution.'' The session was held at the request of Security Council members Egypt, Venezuela, Malaysia, Senegal, and Angola, with the backing of the Palestinians. Such one-sided initiatives only damage prospects for peace.  Last April, 390 Members of the House on both sides of the aisle signed a letter to the President. It was signed by so many of us, including some in this room, including Nita Lowey, Kay Granger, Karen Bass, Ted Deutch, Ileana Ros-Lehtinen, Ed Royce, Eliot Engel, Kevin McCarthy, Steny Hoyer, Nancy Pelosi, and myself--390 in all--that laid out the simple principles that have guided our policy. These principles include:  A refusal to support counterproductive efforts aimed at imposing a solution on the parties;  Opposition to Palestinian efforts to seek recognition of statehood status in international bodies; and  A willingness to oppose, if need be, a one-sided U.N. resolution by way of a veto.  I urge my colleagues to vote for this resolution.
