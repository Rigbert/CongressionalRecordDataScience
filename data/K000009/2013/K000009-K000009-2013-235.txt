Speaker, I join my fellow Co-Chairs of the Congressional Ukrainian Caucus, Reps. Sandy Levin and Jim Gerlach in rising today to support the passage of H. Res. 402, supporting the European aspirations of the people of the European Union's (EU) Eastern Partnership countries, and to express continued support for Ukraine as it moves closer to signing the EU Association Agreement.  In order for Ukraine to progress democratically and economically, it is imperative that the conditions of this agreement, as jointly initialed by the EU and Ukraine, are fully met--in law and in practice.  The critical November 28-29 Eastern Partnership Summit in Vilnius, Lithuania is quickly approaching, bringing with it the deadline for signing the Association Agreement. Accordingly, we urge the U.S. Department of State to advance all appropriate opportunities for cooperation with Ukraine to address the remaining required reforms, including electoral and rule of law reforms as well as issues related to selective justice, particularly the release of former Prime Minister Yulia Tymoshenko. Along with the clear democratic and economic benefits, we believe these reforms, coupled with international monitoring and oversight, provide the best opportunity to ensure free and fair elections in Ukraine in 2015 and beyond.  Consistent with our support for H. Res. 402, we applaud the EU's progress--much of itthrough the Eastern Partnership program--in helping to build democratic, prosperous, and stable societies throughout Eastern Europe and the Caucuses. Building on that progress is in the national interest of the United States; consequently, we call on the U.S. Department of State to direct needed resources to help support Ukraine's European choice.                          ____________________
