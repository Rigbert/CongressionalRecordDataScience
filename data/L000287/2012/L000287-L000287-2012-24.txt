I want to thank the gentleman for yielding.  Here we go again, Madam Speaker. Instead of working on legislation to help create jobs, House Republicans have gathered us here for political games. This bill is not constructive. Madam Speaker, it is destructive. It is disruptive to the most important task we face--helping struggling Americans get back to work and getting our economy moving again.  We've been down this road before. We fought this so-called ``battle'' last year. The debt limit is America's credit card bill, and just because we don't like the balance doesn't mean we don't have to pay it. It's just that simple. When you get a balance on your credit card, you pay it. We all do it. This exercise is a waste of time and taxpayer dollars.  I urge all of my colleagues to vote ``no'' on this bill. Let's come together and work for the good of this Nation and not partisan dissent. The time is always right to do right.
