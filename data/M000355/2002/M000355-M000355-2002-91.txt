 President, I say to my friend from Texas, I have enjoyed his wisdom over the last 18 years. I am going to save my remarks about how I feel about his departure until later in the year. We have just heard another example of the extraordinary wisdom of the senior Senator from Texas from which I have benefited for 18 years. I wish to tell him again how much his service has meant not only to his State but to our Nation.  I say to my friends from Wyoming and North Carolina, they will be relieved to know I do not intend to make my speech on the second-degree amendment. This is an amendment about which I am sure the junior Senator from South Carolina is going to be particularly enthusiastic. I say that with tongue in cheek. I will briefly describe what it is.  This is an amendment to provide a client's bill of rights for clients with Federal claims or who are in Federal court. Fundamentally, what this client's bill of rights would provide is an opportunity for an orderly and systematic notice from their lawyers of the fee arrangements to which they are subjecting themselves; in addition to that, a bereavement rule which would prevent the solicitation of business within 45 days of the occurrence of the event. That is a brief summary of what my amendment is about. There will be ample time for everyone to take a look at the amendment over the evening. It does not in any way detract from the underlying Edwards-Enzi amendment, which I support and commend the authors for offering. I think it is right on the mark. I would like to see these principles expanded to a larger class of clients so they, too, can receive adequate protection.  I yield the floor.
