 President, before the Senator from Texas leaves, I wish he could put back up the ad in the New York Times yesterday. It strikes me that the Cornyn amendment is an opportunity for Senate Democrats to have their reputation restored. I can't believe that Senate Democrats approved of this kind of trash that we have seen in the New York Times in this paid ad last Sunday which, I gather, cost over $100,000. This organization, MoveOn.org, is claiming it controls the Democratic Party. I don't believe that is true. But this is what they had to say back in 2004.  Someone named Eli Pariser, an employee of MoveOn, talking about the Democratic Party, said:       Now it's our party. We bought it. We own it. We are going      to take it back.  MoveOn is claiming they control the Democratic Party. If I were a Democratic Senator, I would be offended by MoveOn.org's claim, as Senator Cornyn pointed out in his comments, that they communicate on a near-daily basis with senior Democratic Members. Here is a quote:       I called over there and said ``you guys better have a      strategy on this.''  By ``there,'' Matzzie, who, I guess, is the head of MoveOn.org, meant the offices of Democratic leaders on Capitol Hill with which he or his staff communicate on a near-daily basis. According to Matzzie, Matzzie has personal relationships with several senior Democratic Members of Congress.  In short, it strikes me, listening to the Senator from Texas and reading the article in the New York Times myself Sunday, that this organization, this radical leftwing organization is attacking the patriotism of General Petraeus with this ad, accusing him, in effect, of treason--``Betray Us,'' it says--and is claiming control of our good colleagues on the other side of the aisle. I don't believe that. I don't believe that for a minute.
