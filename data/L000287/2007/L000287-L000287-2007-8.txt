Mr. Speaker, I want to take just a moment to pay tribute to our friend, our colleague, our beloved sister, Julia Carson. It is my belief that when the Almighty created this beautiful, charming woman, he threw away the mold.  Long before Julia Carson came here, she was a fighter, someone who stood up and spoke out for those that have been left out and left behind. She was a champion of ordinary people, a champion for justice, for civil rights, for human dignity. I want to thank her friend and our former colleague, Andy Jacob, whom I served with, for doing all he could do to have Julia Carson come to this place.  In this body, we are like a family, one family. We become like sisters and brothers. And I feel with the loss and passing of Julia Carson, we have lost a member of our family. The chain, the circle, has been broken.  I will never forget when I was much younger, on April, 4, 1968, almost 40 years ago, I was in her district. She was not representing the district then, but we were in the City of Indianapolis with Robert Kennedy when he announced to the crowd that Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr., had been assassinated. When Julia came here, she always said to me, John, you must come back to Indianapolis and visit. And I have gone back there.  We will miss her. She has gone on to a better place. And we will never, ever see her likeness again.                          ____________________
