He was a leader, when he was Governor, in helping people in his State move from welfare to work, to give people the dignity and independence that comes from the ability to earn a living. Those efforts depend on child care. They depend on assistance with transportation. They depend on assistance with education, with expanded Medicare coverage. In order for people to be able to move from welfare to work, we have to have the social supports in place to ease that transition. Those supports would be in jeopardy if we do not provide our States with the assistance we are discussing.  Furthermore, there are States that are scheduled to have an actual decline in the amount of Medicaid match that they receive from the Federal Government. That could not happen at a worse time. It would cause them to slash services even more. We cannot allow that to happen.  This is a temporary problem. We are proposing temporary assistance to our States. The economy is recovering, but the effects still linger. States are still seeing the demand for social services.  I ask, through the Chair, the Senator from Nebraska--yielding some of my time to him--whether he has seen the kinds of problems in his State that we are seeing in Maine where revenues have dropped unexpectedly one more time, causing the legislature and the Governor to confront a pending deficit in a budget that had already been enacted.
