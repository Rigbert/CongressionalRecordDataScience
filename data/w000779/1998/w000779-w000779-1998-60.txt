President, today I informed the minority leader that I will object to any unanimous consent requests to proceed to S. 2151 or any similar legislation containing provisions that would override Oregon's assisted suicide law. Should S. 2151, the Lethal Drug Abuse Prevention Act come to the floor, I intend to insist that this body clearly hear the arguments against this legislation before voting on it, even if I must filibuster to assure that this occurs.  Let me state, as I have done before on this floor, that I have personal reservations about the assisted suicide concept. I voted twice against assisted suicide in my home State, and I joined our colleagues in voting against Federal funding of assisted suicide.  I personally believe that nowhere near enough has been done to promote hospice care, pain management, comfort care, and other approaches to deal with the end of life.  The people of my State entered into an honest, direct, and exhausting discussion on the issue of assisted suicide--not once, but twice--through our public referenda process. I am not going to let that vote be set aside without an extended debate on the floor of the U.S. Senate.  S. 2151 attempts to override the popular will of the citizens of my State who have made a judgment about what is acceptable medical practice. Medical practice is a matter that has been traditionally left to the States to regulate. However, in overriding the will of the Oregon voters, S. 2151 strikes at the people across this country who are terminally ill and the millions of individuals who suffer in great pain daily.  Almost all of our States have laws in effect, or about to go into effect, with respect to physician-assisted suicide. All of our States have laws that regulate medical practice, including the use of controlled substances. The underlying message of S. 2151 is that the U.S. Congress knows better than voters in Coos Bay, Bend, and La Grande, OR. Does this Congress, meeting here in Washington, DC, believe it is better equipped than the citizens of my State to make moral decisions about acceptable medical practice in Oregon?  This Senator is not going to sit by while there is an abbreviated debate that cuts off the rights of Oregonians. I want the Senate to understand that today.  S. 2151 would amend the Controlled Substances Act to allow the Drug Enforcement Agency to deny DEA registration of providers determined to have assisted in causing or participating in a physician-assisted suicide. The advocates of this legislation say that good physicians would have no problem with this legislation.  The record shows otherwise. The record shows that more than 50 medical groups, including physicians, nurses, pharmacists, and hospice programs--a variety of medical groups--believe this legislation would have a chilling effect on pain management programs, on hospice care services, and on comfort care. I want my colleagues to understand that. More than 50 medical groups in our country believe this legislation will have a chilling effect on our ability to make sure that our citizens can get good pain management services, hospice programs and comfort care.  What is especially striking is that even Americans who are opposed to Oregon's law and are opposed to assisted suicide do not want to see the U.S. Congress overturn this law. Pain management, palliative care, and hospice services are still evolving fields. Not enough has been done to comfort patients in these tragic situations, and Americans know that in the current regulatory environment there can be a chilling effect on the pain management services by laws such as the one proposed in S. 2151. This legislation also runs counter to the recent Supreme Court decision on physician-assisted suicide that encourages the States to continue to debate this question.  Mr. President, this bill is not going to stop assisted suicide. What it is going to do is set up new roadblocks to ensuring that there are good pain management programs in our country. This bill is going to harm pain management for millions of Americans, turn the resources of the Drug Enforcement Agency from looking at drug diversion and drug trafficking to reviewing the intent of physicians and pharmacists as they try to alleviate the pain of their patients. That is not what the DEA was set up to do. It was not set up to deal with overseeing hospice programs, and the like.  If Congress tramples on the twice-expressed popular will of the people of Oregon, it is going to feed the fires of cynicism and frustration about Government across our land.  Mr. President, I will conclude with this. We all know that so often in coffee shops, churches, grange halls and senior centers, we hear Americans say: You know, our vote doesn't matter. After we vote, those politicians are going to say we really don't get it, the citizens don't understand. So we will just vote again; we will just vote, vote and vote until we set aside what their judgment has been.  I am here to say that I don't think the U.S. Congress knows better than those voters in Coos Bay and Bend and La Grande. I don't think the U.S. Congress, meeting here in Washington, DC, is better equipped than the citizens of my State to make a moral decision about what is acceptable medical practice in Oregon. This Congress should not try to settle this issue in a hasty debate in the last hours of the U.S. Congress.  I have informed the minority leader that I will have a hold on this legislation. Senator Grassley and I have, for some time, been encouraging Senators to announce publicly their intentions with respect to holds. I have done that in a letter to Senator Daschle. I will make that letter a part of the Record. I am going to insist on my rights as a Senator, representing thousands and thousands of Oregonians who have weighed in on this issue, that this Senate is going to have a real debate on this legislation before there is a vote on it. I am going to assure that there is such a debate, even if I must filibuster to assure that this occurs.  I ask unanimous consent that my letter to Senator Daschle be printed in the Record.  There being no objection, the letter was ordered to be printed in the Record, as follows:                                                  U.S. Senate,                               Washington, DC, September 23, 1998.     Hon. Tom Daschle,     Minority Leader,     U.S. Capitol, Washington, DC.       Dear Senator Daschle: I previously wrote you requesting I      be consulted should S. 2151 or any other legislation      concerning physician assisted suicide come to the Senate      floor for consideration.       I am now writing to clearly state that I will object to any      motion to proceed should S. 2151 or any legislation      containing provisions over-riding Oregon's physician assisted      suicide law come to the Senate floor.       Should you have any questions, please feel free to contact      Stephanie Kennan of my staff at 4-6070.           Sincerely,                                                        Ron Wyden.
