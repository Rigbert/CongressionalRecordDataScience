                   Drug Enforcement Administration  Mr. DeWINE. Mr. President, as the Senate reaches the conclusion of the Commerce-Justice-State Appropriations bill, I would like to speak a moment about an important US law enforcement agency funded in this bill--an agency dedicated to keeping drugs off our streets. I am specifically talking about the Drug Enforcement Administration.  Mr. President, in 1998, the DEA seized more drugs and arrested more traffickers than ever before. With limited funding, and unlimited hard work and dedication, DEA human resources are a vital source not just for our law enforcement activities, but for other nations as well. The DEA does its job without a heavy reliance on big ticket items like ships and aircraft. On the contrary, this agency relies primarily on manpower. Their manpower and skill are what makes them such an effective organization both inside and outside our borders.  Fortunately after 2 years of almost stagnant funding levels, the Republican Congress has been working to increase its investment in the DEA. Last year Congress provided the DEA with $1.4 billion in Fiscal Year 1999, an increase of roughly $60 million. This increase was possible largely through legislation Senator Coverdell and I introduced and Congress passed last year--the Western Hemisphere Drug Elimination Act. However, we need to do more.  Congress should continue its support of the DEA. Increasing our investment in DEA, which will in turn increase the strength and ability of our counter-narcotics strategy, is the only way to continue to increase the numbers of drug arrests and seizures.  Let me give you some examples of where more DEA resources have and can continue to make a difference. Mr. President, I have visited Haiti numerous times and have visited the Dominican Republic as well. It is truly unfortunate that roughly twenty per cent of the drugs entering the United States travel through these two countries. The Haiti-Dominican Republic transit route has become increasingly popular for drug traffickers because both governments do not present a real threat to drug traffickers. What makes matters worse is that our resources devoted to preventing drugs from reaching this island have been minimal at best.  When I visited Haiti back in March 1998, I was astonished to find out that there was only one DEA agent stationed in Haiti. When I visited the Dominican Republic on the same trip, I was disappointed to find out there were only two DEA agents stationed there. How can our government keep drugs from entering our country if we do not make a commitment to seize drugs along a major international route on the drug trafficking highway? When I returned from that trip, I worked with the DEA and the Attorney General to get additional agents assigned to both countries. I received a commitment to station seven DEA agents in Haiti and six agents in the Dominican Republic. The process has been slow in getting the agents to Haiti--because of language training in particular--but the increase in agents has already made a tremendous difference.  Since that trip back in March 1998, I have returned to Haiti and the Dominican Republic, and visited with the DEA agents stationed there. As a result of our increased DEA presence on the island, the DEA, in conjunction with the US Customs and with the Haiti and Dominican governments, has pursued several counter-drug operations. Their presence also has helped increase cooperation between the two nations.  I had the opportunity to visit the Haitian-Dominican border last November to observe a DEA-Customs counter-drug initiative called Operation Genesis. Until that time, there was virtually no cooperation between the two nations at the border. This lack of cooperation is a major reason why the island became a popular drug trafficking route. The objective of Operation Genesis was to help both countries better coordinate and cooperate with each other to prevent drugs from transiting the border.  The enhanced Haitian-Dominican cooperation through overall DEA efforts has proven successful. For example, last February, the Haitian National Police in coordination with the DEA, arrested relatives of the Coneo family--a well known Colombian drug trafficking family with connections in Haiti and the Dominican Republic. Heriberto Coneo's wife, son and his brother-in-law were arrested in Haiti for carrying false Dominican passports. Haiti later expelled them to the Dominican Republic, where they were arrested and placed in prison. This was a major victory.  Another example of this enhanced cooperation was the recent arrest of a Haitian National Police Division Chief who had fled to the Dominican Republic after his involvement in the deaths of more than 11 Haitians. The coordinated efforts by the DEA with these two countries resulted in the Dominicans arresting the police official and expelling him to Haiti.  The DEA also has helped train the Haitian National Police counter-drug unit. With DEA assistance, our Embassy in Port-au-Prince reports that the Haitian police has seized more than $1 million in money being smuggled out of the country in large sums.  I also have seen the DEA in action in South America, specifically in Peru and in Colombia. I walked through poppy fields in Neiva, Colombia where I saw first hand the source of the serious heroin problem plaguing our country today. We were in a region only 20 miles from the Colombian demilitarized zone. The DEA has been instrumental in working and training the Colombian National Police to seize drugs and arrest drug lords.  While, I have described a few success stories, I need to remind my colleagues that the DEA is producing incredible returns on a very small investment.  Imagine what more the DEA could do if they had more personnel. The fact is the DEA simply does not have the resources to meet their demanding and necessary tasks. With more resources, border initiatives like the one in Haiti and the Dominican Republic could be expanded, allowing for a greater reduction in the heavy trafficking that occurs between the two countries. With more resources, additional DEA agents can be sent overseas to assist law enforcement officials in learning ways to stop drug trafficking. That kind of investment--to build anti-drug operations in other countries--will build even more barriers to drugs outside our borders.  Mr. President, last March, Senator Coverdell and I, along with a number of our colleagues--Republican and Democrat--sent a letter to the Chairman and Ranking Member of the Commerce-Justice-State Appropriations Subcommittee, Senator Gregg and Senator Hollings, calling for building on this year's investment in the DEA and requesting additional funding for 300 additional DEA agents, analysts and support personnel, and for other DEA initiatives. This request would enable the DEA to carry out specific initiatives outlined in the Western Hemisphere Drug Elimination Act, a three year initiative for enhanced international drug eradication and interdiction efforts.  I recognize the serious budget challenges facing this Subcommittee and other Appropriations subcommittees as well. Chairman Gregg and Senator Hollings were extremely gracious in accommodating our request. Specifically, the Subcommittee earmarked $17.5 million for new DEA agents, analysts, and support staff for both international and domestic posts.  Mr. President, this is an important first step. It is my hope that as this bill moves to a conference with the House, the conferees will work to increase our overall investment in the DEA, so that specific priority requirements are not funded at the expense of other important DEA programs.  Again, Mr. President, since 1995 Congress has made great progress last year to increase our investment to revive our international counter narcotics strategy. Last year's passage of the Western Hemisphere Drug Elimination Act was the latest example of this progress. Not only did Congress pass legislation, but we also provided an $800 million down payment for the bill.  Unfortunately, the Clinton Administration is not showing a similar commitment. The President's Budget for Fiscal Year 2000 provided zero funding for provisions outlined in the Western Hemisphere Drug Elimination Act. In fact, it calls for more than $100 million less than our total anti-drug funding for 1999. The Coast Guard received zero funding for the acquisition of air/maritime assets; the Drug Enforcement Agency received zero funding for new agents; our Customs Service received zero funding for procurement of maritime/air assets and zero increases for U.S. Customs inspectors. This Administration has not demonstrated a commitment to fund a real, coherent international counter-drug strategy. What good is it to have tough drug laws here at home and a tough international counter narcotics policy at and beyond the border if you do not have the resources to enforce them?  Mr. President, I have repeatedly expressed my concerns that the Administration has not been doing enough in the fight against drugs. When the Clinton Administration took over, the DEA workforce dropped from 7,277 in 1992 to 7,066 in 1994. However, since the Republican takeover of Congress in 1994, we have fought to boost the workforce from 7,066 to more than 9,000. The Administration's latest action, or lack of action, only reinforces my belief that more can be done. There has been an increasing number of reports of outrageous amounts of drugs being distributed throughout our country that originates internationally and domestically. Why is that? Only the federal government can devote the resources to seize drugs outside our country. It is unfortunate that the Clinton Administration continues to fail to fully support this exclusive federal responsibility.  With increased DEA funding, we have the opportunity to eliminate one of the most glaring omissions in the President's budget. It is my hope that we will continue to search for additional funding to the DEA so that they can hire these new agents, analysts, and support personnel without having to sacrifice other important programs. These agents would work hand-in-hand with international law enforcement authorities to provide the intelligence, expertise, and even the manpower required to arrest the drug traffickers.  Mr. President, I have seen the DEA at work throughout the region. The agency is a group of hard-working dedicated individuals who risk their lives to create a healthy environment for democracies to flourish, while at the same time get the drugs off the streets of America. They do so much good with the limited resources they have. It is now time for us to pass this amendment, give the DEA additional resources and once again watch the number of arrests and seizures increase causing the flow of narcotics into our country to sharply decrease.  Mr. President, it is time to renew drug interdiction efforts; time to provide the necessary personnel and equipment to our drug-enforcement agencies, and time to make the issue a national priority once again.  Thank you, Mr. President. I yield the floor.  Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, I want to thank the managers of this bill for their hard work in putting forth annual legislation which provides federal funding for numerous vital programs. The Senate will soon vote to adopt the Commerce, Justice, State Appropriations Bill for the Fiscal Year 2000. I intend to support this measure because it provides funding for fighting crime, enhancing drug enforcement, and responding to threats of terrorism. This further addresses the shortcomings of the immigration process, funds the operation of the judicial system, facilitates commerce throughout the United States, and fulfills the needs of the State Department and various other agencies.  For many years, I have tried to cut wasteful and unnecessary spending from the annual appropriations bills--with only limited success, I must admit. Nonetheless, I will continue my fight to curb wasteful pork-barrel spending, and I regret that I must again come forward this year to object to the millions of unrequested, low-priority, wasteful spending in this bill and its accompanying report. This year's bill has over $1 billion in pork-barrel spending. This is a disgracefully huge increase over last year's FY 99 Commerce, Justice, State Appropriations Bill, which contained $361 million in pork-barrel spending. $1.2 billion is an unacceptable amount of money to spend on low-priority, unrequested, wasteful projects. In short, Congress must curb its appetite for such unbridled spending.  CBO projects that we will have close to a trillion dollar budget surplus over the next 10 years. However, if we continue with our current levels of wasteful spending, these budget surpluses may not occur. Pork-barrel spending today not only robs well-deserving programs of much needed funds, it also jeopardizes social security reform, potential tax cuts, and our fiscal well-being into the next century.  The multitude of unrequested earmarks buried in this proposal will undoubtedly further burden the American taxpayers. While the amounts associated with each individual earmark may not seem extravagant, taken together, they represent a serious diversion of taxpayers' hard-earned dollars to low priority programs at the expense of numerous programs that have undergone the appropriate merit-based selection process. Congress and the American public must be made aware of the magnitude of wasteful spending endorsed by this body.  I have compiled a lengthy list of the numerous add-ons, earmarks, and special exemptions provided to individual projects in this bill. It would take a substantial amount of time to recite this list to you. Instead, I will ask unanimous consent to include this list in the Record.  Mr. President, because of our nation's robust economy, we now have a balanced budget. But we cannot continue to bear the financial burden of servicing a $5.6 trillion national debt. We need to continue to work to cut unnecessary and wasteful spending so we can begin to pay down our debt and save billions in interest payments.  As I mentioned earlier, CBO recently projected that we will have close to a trillion dollar budget surplus over the next 10 years. These are projections and not real dollars until they materialize. Further, these surplus projections are all contingent on Congress maintaining the spending caps. Unfortunately, I already hear the grumbling to break these caps even as we have only deliberated on a small number of appropriations bills.  Simply because we can fund programs of questionable merit within the spending caps does not mean that we should. There is no room for pork-barreling when we are so close to breaking the caps. Last year alone, I uncoveredover $14 billion of wasteful spending in the appropriations bills. $14 billion funds a lot of worthy programs.  As a matter of simple fairness, we have an obligation to ensure that Congress spends taxpayers' hard-earned dollars prudently to protect our balanced budget and to protect the projected budget surpluses. The American public cannot understand why we continue to earmark these huge amounts of money to locality specific special interests at a time when we are trying to cut the cost of government and return more dollars to the people. Pork barrel spending cannot be justified in an environment where our highest fiscal priorities should be to save Social Security, and provide much needed tax relief such as: increasing the number of tax payers in the 15% tax bracket, elimination of the marriage penalty; reduced taxation of savings and investment income; repeal of the estate and gift tax; repeal of the Social Security Earnings Test; increasing the contribution level for 410(k), and 457 retirement plans; and increasing the contribution level for the traditional IRA to $5,000.  Let me say very frankly that I do not generally like the idea of griping year after year regarding Congress' appetite for wasteful pork-barrel spending. But it is a sad commentary on the state of politics today that the Congress cannot curb its appetite to earmark funds for programs that are obviously wasteful, unnecessary, or unfair. Unfortunately, however, Members of Congress have demonstrated time and again their willingness to fund programs that serve their narrowly tailored interest at the expense of the national interest.  I ask unanimous consent the list be printed in the Record.  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in the Record, as follows:   OBJECTIONABLE PROVISIONS CONTAINED IN S. 1217 THE DEPARTMENTS OF    COMMERCE, JUSTICE, AND STATE, THE JUDICIARY, AND RELATED AGENCIES                           APPROPRIATIONS BILL                             Bill Language                         Department of Justice       $2,500,000 for the operation of the National Advocacy      Center at the University of south Carolina       $5,000,000 for a task force in each of the paired locations      of Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, and Camden, New Jersey; Las      Cruces, New Mexico, and Albuquerque, New Mexico; Savannah,      Georgia, and Charleston, South Carolina; Baltimore, Maryland,      and Prince Georges County, Maryland; and Denver, Colorado,      and Salt Lake City, Utah       An earmark for funding for the care and housing of Federal      detainees held in the joint Immigration and Naturalization      Service and United States Marshals Service's Buffalo      Detention Facility       Funding for planning, acquisition of sites and construction      of new facilities; and for leasing the Oklahoma City Airport      Trust Facility       $50,000,000 for the Boys and Girls Clubs in public housing      facilities and other areas in cooperation with State and      local law enforcement       $3,000,000 for the National Institute of Justice to develop      school safety technologies       $5,200,000 to the National Institute of Justice for      research and evaluation of violence against women                               Judiciary       $2,700,000 to the ``Courts of Appeals, District Courts, and      Other Judicial Services'' for the Institute at Saint Anselm      College and the New Hampshire State Library       A $500,000 earmark for the National Law Center for Inter-     American Free Trade in Tucson, Arizona       $13,500,000 for the East-West Center in Hawaii       $125,000 for the Maui Pacific Center in Hawaii       $12,500,000 earmarked for the Center of Cultural and      Technical Interchange Between East and West in the State of      Hawaii       Language providing that all equipment and products      purchased with funds made available in this Act should be      American-made                            Report Language                         Department of Justice       A $30,000,000 earmark for the creation of two      counterterrorism laboratories at the site of the Oklahoma      City bombing and at Dartmouth College, for research of new      technologies and threat reduction for chemical and biological      weapons as well as cyber-warfare.       $2,300,000 to expand the multi-agency task forces in      Richmond and Boston, which are designed to keep firearms out      of the hands of criminals by enforcing Federal gun laws, by      implementing these programs in Philadelphia and Camden.       $25,000,000 is earmarked for expansion of the existing      ``Exile program'' in Philadelphia, PA and Camden, NJ and to      create new task forces in the following four crime corridors:      Las Cruces--Albuquerque, NM; Savannah, GA--Charleston, SC;      Denver, CO--Salt Lake City, UT; and Baltimore--Prince      George's County, MD.       $2,612,000 for a courtroom technology pilot program      involving 10 districts, including Colorado, the northern      district of Mississippi, Montana, New Mexico, South Carolina,      and Vermont.       $500,000 to establish a Bankruptcy Training Center at the      National Advocacy Center at the University of South Carolina       A $13,750,000 earmark for courthouse security equipment to      outfit newly opening courthouses in the following locations:      Omaha, NE; Hammond, IN; Covington, KY; Charleston, WV;      Montgomery, AL; Tucson, AZ; Phoenix, AZ; Charleston, SC;      Albany, NY; Los Angeles, CA; Sioux City, IA; Pocatello, ID;      Agana, Guam; Islip, NY; St. Louis, MO; Kansas City, MO; Las      Vegas, NV; Albuquerque, NM; Riverside, CA; Corpus Christi,      TX.       $500,000 for the acquisition and installation of      videoconferencing equipment in the following locations:      Leavenworth, KS; Dawson County, NE; Las Vegas, NV; Charlotte,      NC; and high-volume jail locations to be determined in New      Mexico and elsewhere.
