Stewart's nomination, in my experience and my judgment, I say to my friend from Mississippi that: If we had worked out an arrangement to vote on these judicial nominees on the calendar, the sort of thing we are talking about doing now, working out the amount of time to be taken on Stewart would be the least of our worries; it would be a relatively short time because it would be all part of the same package.  We could spend more time talking about how much time there will be on the floor than probably what there would be at that time. That is going to be the least of our problems. If we get some of these judges worked out and some idea of when other judges are coming up, that is going to be the easy thing to do.
