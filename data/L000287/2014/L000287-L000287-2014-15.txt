Speaker, I rise to pay tribute to a wonderful and beautiful spirit; Mrs. Mariella Ukina Ama Holman was a friend, mother, wife, teacher, activist, and trailblazer.  A woman of the world, Mariella Ukina Ama was born in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania on July 4, 1922 to Kiushu Amakaya and Ada Adams. Her father, an immigrant from Japan, changed his name to Frank Ama and worked as a cook and caterer, and her mother was a laundress. Mariella and her brothers--Charles, Lloyd, and Bobby--were expected to meet their parents' high standards and were determined to overcome all odds.  As a child of the Great Depression, she worked hard, stood strong, and held her head high as one of the few children of color at the historic Philadelphia High School for Girls. Mariella continued her education in Atlanta, where she graduated from Atlanta University Laboratory High School. She completed her formal education at the renowned Spelman College, where she truly found her voice. At Spelman, Mariella bloomed into a woman of culture and class--studying and excelling in French and the humanities--gradually becoming more socially and politically conscious and active.  While working at Hampton Institute, now Hampton University, she met her husband-to-be, M. Carl Holman. In 1945, Mariella and Carl married and returned to Atlanta to begin a family; they were proud to raise their children--Kerry, Karen, and Kent--in the heart of the Civil Rights Movement. Her husband, a professor at Clark College in Atlanta, helped co-found the Atlanta Committee for Cooperative Action (ACCA) and became the editor-in-chief of The Atlanta Inquirer, which developed into a leading, weekly journal and voice for equality and justice in our nation. In the 1960s when Carl joined the staff of the United States Commission on Civil Rights, the family moved to Washington, D.C., where he eventually served as the president of the National Urban Coalition.  Throughout their marriage, Mrs. Holman was the backbone of their beautiful family and home, while maintaining her own career as a skilled educator and an activist in her own right. She taught French at Booker T. Washington High School in Atlanta, and continued to teach in Washington, D.C. at Hart Junior High School until her retirement in the 1980s. In her classroom, she opened the minds of countless young people to a global language and community beyond the United States; she brought Europe, Africa, and the Caribbean to their front door through her creative and passionate instruction.  For years, Mrs. Holman also provided wise counsel to the architects--the movers-and-shakers--of the Civil Rights Movement. She opened her home to organizers for strategy meetings, and her hospitality, cooking, and warmth fed stomachs and reignited spirits. When her beloved husband passed away in 1988, Mariella continued to be the grounding, central force of her family, friends, and community for 26 years. Last week, on March 17, 2014, Mrs. Mariella Holman passed away surrounded by loving family and friends. Although I know that she lived a long and full life, I was still heartbroken to hear the news.  Mr. Speaker, I would like to extend my deepest condolences to her children--Kwasi (Kerry) G. Holman, Kinshasha (Karen) Holman Conwill, and Kwame (Kent) Holman; grandchildren--Monifa, Kevin, Donovan, and Camille; seven great-grandchildren; great-greatgrandchild; brother, Lloyd, and his wife, Muriel, of Philadelphia, Pennsylvania; and countless loving family members and friends. They were guided and grounded by this beautiful and strong matriarch, and today each and every one of them is in my thoughts and prayers.  Mella--as she was called by all who knew and loved her--will be truly missed. She touched so many with her warmth, her spirit, her cooking, and her timeless class, and I am proud to have known and loved this great and wonderful lady.                          ____________________
