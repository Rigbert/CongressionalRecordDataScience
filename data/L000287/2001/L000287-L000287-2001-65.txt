Mr. Speaker, I rise today to congratulate Calvin ``Cal'' Darden on his election to the Board of Directors for United Parcel Service. Mr. Darden, senior vice President of all U.S. operations for UPS, is the highest ranking African-American ever to serve at UPS. As a person who has invested a great deal of my life working to break down the racial barriers that divide our society, I commend him for his success. Through the success of Mr. Darden and others like him, we continue our journey toward a truly integrated society, toward what Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr., called ``the Beloved Community.''  Jim Kelly, the UPS Chairman of the Board, also appreciates the contributions of Cal Darden, albeit for different reasons. ``Cal Darden has devoted his professional life to making this company what it is today. It is due in no small measure to his efforts in the arenas of operations and customer service that Fortune Magazine just recognized UPS for the 18th consecutive year as `America's Most Admired' transportation company.''  Cal Darden joined UPS in 1971 as a part-time package handler while attending Canisius College. In 1972, he graduated from college and began his climb up the UPS corporate ladder as he was promoted into management. In addition to his successs at UPS, Mr. Darden has been active in the community as a member of the National Urban League's Board of Directors, 100 Black Men of North Metro Atlanta, and his work with the United Way.  Congratulations and best wishes, Cal Darden. Keep your eyes on the prize.                          ____________________
