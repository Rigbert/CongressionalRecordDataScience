President, I am voting in favor of Mr. Chertoff's nomination to be the Assistant Attorney General for the Criminal Division at the Department of Justice.  I have been concerned that Mr. Chertoff, like several of the President's other nominees for top positions in the Department of Justice, has a history of partisan political activities. Mr. Chertoff was special counsel to the Republicans in the Senate Whitewater investigation of President Clinton, which hardly provided a model for the apolitical and unbiased search for justice that ought to characterize the operations of the United States Department of Justice.  Fortunately, however, Mr. Chertoff also has an established track record as a Federal prosecutor apart from his involvement with the Whitewater Committee. More importantly, he has answered the committee's questions about his political activities and has given appropriate assurances that he will not allow partisanship to influence the exercise of his judgment on the legal merits of questions he will address as the Assistant Attorney General for the Criminal Division. I credit his assurances, and for that reason I am voting for his nomination.
