President, I will shortly be offering, as an amendment, an amendment to the substitute. It will be on behalf of myself and Senator John Cornyn. I will ask consent in a moment to suggest the absence of a quorum but, upon the rescission of the absence of a quorum, that I be recognized for up to 3 minutes.
