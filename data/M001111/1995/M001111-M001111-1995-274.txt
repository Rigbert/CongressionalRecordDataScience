 President, today I submit a resolution expressing the sense of Congress concerning the trafficking of Burmese women and girls into Thailand for the purpose of forced prostitution. This is identical to a resolution submitted in the House by Congresswoman Louise Slaughter.  I have long supported steps to help improve the gross human rights violations inflicted on women around the world. I am outraged at reports from Human Rights Watch and others citing the egregious abuse of Burmese women and girls who are lured into Thailand with false promises to work at good paying jobs, and then confined in illegal brothels. These women and girls live in brutal conditions, often forced to work 18 hours a day with several different clients. They are subjected to physical and sexual abuse that makes escape practically impossible. In addition, there is virtually no health care or birth control available, and the HIV virus is rampant among these women and girls.  Reportedly, these abuses take place with the knowledge of the Thai Government and the likely involvement of the Thai police. I am deeply concerned by reports that these officials not only fail to protect these women and girls, but actually provide support to the brothels and brothel owners.  Mr. President, this resolution seeks to call attention to these abuses. In addition to stating that sex trafficking is a violation of the fundamental principle of human dignity, it encourages the State Department to press the Thai Government to enforce the laws that can lead to the prosecution of these traffickers. It also encourages the Thai Government to ensure the rights and safety of Burmese women and girls in Thailand. In addition, any weapons and equipment sold to the Thai police by the United States should be kept out of the hands of those individuals who may be involved in trafficking these women and girls. And, finally, the United States Agency for International Development should target a portion of its assistance to Thailand for AIDS prevention and control.  We in Congress must act now to help stop these brutal practices. The savage treatment of Burmese women and girls in Thailand, and the abuses they are subjected to, must cease. I urge my colleagues to support this resolution and help send a message that the trafficking and forced prostitution of women and girls around the world is simply unacceptable.                          ____________________
