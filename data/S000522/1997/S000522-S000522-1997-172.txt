Mr. Chairman, I move to strike the requisite number of words.  Mr. Chairman, I will just take a minute or two to express my support for this resolution before the House.  I am a very strong supporter of Armenia, and I share the concern of the author of the amendment that Armenia and its neighbor, Azerbaijan, live in peace and harmony with each other. I would like to ask one question, if I could, of the sponsor of the amendment, my good friend from New Jersey, Mr. Pallone.  Just so it is very clear, and I think one of the previous speakers said this, so there is no ambiguity about it, is it the gentleman's intent to change the current U.S. position in support of the territorial integrity of Azerbaijan through this amendment?
