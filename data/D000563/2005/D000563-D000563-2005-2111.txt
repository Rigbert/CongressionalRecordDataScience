President, I want to explain briefly so the Senator from Alabama understands. We amended the term ``veteran'' in the amendment so it only applies to the situation where the veteran's indebtedness in whole or in part occurred during active duty. We were referring to veterans in general, and one person said: What if you were a veteran of World War II many years ago and your indebtedness had nothing to do with it? We have clarified it with this modification that it would be veterans whose indebtedness was incurred in whole or in part during their term of active duty.  I might also say to my colleague from Alabama, we have a legitimate dispute about the Servicemembers' Civil Relief Act. I would like to join with him to find out which one of us is correct because we have been told that this Civil Relief Act does not apply to debts incurred after military service begins. The most significant limitation is that its primary protections apply only to obligations entered into before a person is called to active duty.  So, ironically, it does not protect military families when they need it the most when additional debt is incurred to help make ends meet during active duty. Rather than belabor this point, I would like to join the Senator from Alabama and get to the bottom of it and find out who is right. It is an important point.  I yield the floor.
