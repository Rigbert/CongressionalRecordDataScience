President, through the Wilderness Act of 1965, Congress reserves the authority to designate as Wilderness Areas certain Federal lands with remarkable natural and ecological values. Over the last 53 years, the Wilderness Act has been referred to as the gold standard of conservation, providing the highest level of protections for some of America's most treasured public lands. In addition to congressionally designated Wilderness Areas, the Wilderness Act gave the Secretary of the Interior and the Secretary of Agriculture the authority to study and evaluate the wilderness characteristics of public lands under their respective jurisdictions. Once identified, the Forest Service manages lands with wilderness potential as an ``inventoried roadless area,'' and the Bureau of Land Management manages lands with wilderness potential as ``wilderness study areas.'' These designations are not always without controversy but are critical in providing a measure of interim protection for wilderness-quality lands while Congress deliberates on further, permanent protections.  The Crooked River Ranch Fire Protection Act, which the Senate Energy and Natural Resources Committee reported yesterday, adjusts the boundaries of the Deschutes Canyon-Steelhead Falls Wilderness Study Area in Central Oregon, removing over 600 acres of land from interim protection under the Wilderness Act. The Deschutes Canyon-Steelhead Falls Wilderness Study Areas contains cultural and historical artifacts, provides drinking water for thousands of Oregonians, and provides critical habitat for fish and wildlife species, some of which are threatened or endangered.  Proponents of this legislation argue that the release of the acres from interim protection under the wilderness study area designation is necessary. According to the proponents, the ``release'' language was necessary to allow Federal land managers greater flexibility in conducting hazardous fuels reduction projects to better protect the adjacent community, Crooked River Ranch, from the threat of wildfires. In truth, hazardous fuels reduction projects technically could have taken place under existing land designations.  Adding insult to injury, the Crooked River Fire Protection Act originally gave no direction on how the BLM should manage the released lands. In addition, the original bill fell short in addressing the wildfire concerns while allowing for the release of wilderness study area acreage from interim protection without any corresponding lands protections. This is just a lost opportunity for compromise and comity. In an attempt to provide local landowners some measure of certainty over how the released lands will be managed, I worked to clarify that the released lands will be managed in a way that improves fire resiliency and forest health, while preventing off-road recreational vehicle use, which could actually increase the risk of wildfires.  While these changes do not address the future management of the entire Deschutes Canyon-Steelhead Falls Wilderness Study Area, it does provide management direction for the released lands and pushes the BLM to meet the goals of the legislation: to promote fire resiliency and forest health. I am committed to finding a path forward for a solution for the entire wilderness study area in line with the traditions of compromise and doing things the Oregon way.                          ____________________
