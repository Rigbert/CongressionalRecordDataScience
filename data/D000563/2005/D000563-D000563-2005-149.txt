A bill to establish a National Methamphetamine Information Clearinghouse to promote sharing information regarding successful law enforcement, treatment, environmental, social services, and other programs related to the production, use, or effects of methamphetamine and grants available for such programs, and for the other purposes; to the Committee on the Judiciary.  Mr. DeWINE. Mr. President, today I am introducing a bill that would create a National Methamphetamine Information Clearinghouse (NMIC). This web-based source of information would promote sharing of ``best practices'' regarding law enforcement, treatment, environmental, social services, and other programs to combat the production, use, and effects of methamphetamine.  The purpose of the NMIC is to make a one-stop shop, where all the ``best practices'' in the fight against meth can be found--information from law enforcement, treatment-based organizations, social services and environmental agencies. It will be a website providing information that agencies and organizations submit, describing what has worked in their local communities. The people who have had success with addressing meth and meth-related issues will be providing this information. Additionally, there will be information and links regarding available grants for establishing and maintaining anti-meth programs.  The NMIC will serve two distinct populations--law enforcement and the broader community. The NMIC will contain a restricted access section where law enforcement will be able to post their successful strategies, training techniques, and conference notes so that other law enforcement will be able to get ideas and incorporate them in their own jurisdictions. The unrestricted portion of the website will include resources for other agencies and the public at large. For example, child protection agencies might post techniques on dealing with meth orphans, community health centers might post treatment options that provided them with some success, and environmental groups might post tips on cleaning up the toxic waste.  So, a landlord or hotel owner whose property was used as a meth lab and who wants to be able to rent out the property again, or the mother who wants to figure out if her child is a meth addict--and what to do if she is they would all be able to find useful information on the site.  One of our challenges in the fight against meth is finding those who need assistance and connecting them with those who can help--and that is exactly what this clearinghouse can do. Many people and organizations that have had some success in controlling meth are more than willing to share the techniques they found that work, if only they knew who needed the information. And, there are those who are just starting to attack the meth problem in their communities and need guidance as to how to make that start an effective one. The NMIC can help bring those groups of people together and enhance everyone's ability to fight the plague of meth.  NMIC will be housed under the auspices of the Department of Justice andwill be governed by an Advisory Council comprised of 10 members from a variety of agencies and organizations. It is this Council who will monitor the submissions to the Clearinghouse and make sure that the information found on the site is accurate, up-to-date, and useful.  The bill I am introducing today provides the basic outline of this idea, and over the next two months, I will be working closely with law enforcement and community groups to modify and improve the Clearinghouse before we move forward with this legislation next year. I look forward to that process and encourage all of my colleagues to join me in this effort to combat the meth problem.  I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be printed in the Record.  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the Record, as follows:                                S. 2046       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of      the United States of America in Congress assembled,     SECTION 1.
