Mr. Speaker, I rise to draw attention to the ongoing crisis in Chechnya, which began exactly 100 days ago today, when the Kremlin launched a massive military offensive in the region. In an ironic twist, details of this tragedy have been largely overshadowed by yesterday's announcement that President Clinton will travel to Moscow in early May to meet with President Yeltsin. He is proceeding despite the urgings of Congress and, apparently, officials within his own administration that he stay home. The Clinton administration has mishandled this crisis from the outset and, with yesterday's announcement, has proven that it has lost touch with reality where Yelsin is involved.  The administration should have taken advantage of Moscow's strong desire to secure United States participation in ceremonies commemorating the end of World War II, and pressured Moscow to agree to an immediate, unconditional cease-fire, and the deployment of a long-term OSCE mission in Chechnya. Again, the administration acquiesced, after Yeltsin made a concession about the planned military parade. But that parade is in May--Russia is committing atrocities right now.  One hundred days ago, Mr. Speaker, our administration characterized this crisis as an internal affair, better left to the Russians to handle. But the crisis, which many in Moscow and in Washington had hoped would go away, has not. About 24,000 individuals have been killed and hundreds of thousands have been driven from their homes. Gross human rights violations and atrocities have gone unchecked, as the humanitarian nightmare in Chechnya continues. The Russian campaign in the region constitutes a gross violation OSCE principles.  Nearly 2 months after the OSCE Permanent Council's decision of February 3, most of the problems raised at the time--for example, disproportionate use of force, gross human rights violations, unhindered delivery of humanitarian assistance, access to detainees--persist and have not been addressed in a meaningful manner, if at all.  During the Helsinki Commission's hearing in January, human rights champion Dr. Elena Bonner implored us, ``[F]rom outside Russia, the stable democratic societies of the West must employ all diplomatic means to pressure Mr. Yeltsin to call off his assault and negotiate with the Chechen leaders.''  As chairman of the Commission on Security and Cooperation in Europe, I have closely followed these troubling developments. I have repeatedly spoken out against Russian actions in Chechyna and the disappointingly muted response by our own leadership.  Mr. Speaker, I urge Secretary Christopher to press Foreign Minister Kozyrev to abide by the OSCE decisions, to agree to an unconditional cease-fire, and to accept a long-term OSCE monitoring mission, when they meet later this week in Geneva. The Russians continue to stall on all three points.  While they have hinted that they could accept an OSCE million in principle, they appear to be stonewalling. If the Russians finally agree to accept such a mission, painstaking care must be taken in the elaboration of its mandate. Russian good will alone will not be enough.  The last thing we need is an OSCE million which can be manipulated into a kind of Potemkin village to lend legitimacy to Russian policies in Chechnya.  Mr. Speaker, I regret the fact that the President has agreed to go to Moscow while Yeltsin continues his campaign of death and destruction in Chechnya. It is high time that President Clinton stop turning a blind eye toward the Chechen crisis and starts pressing Boris Yeltsin to end the senseless slaughter.                          ____________________
