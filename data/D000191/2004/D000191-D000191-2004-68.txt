Speaker, like those Members who rose before me, I support the underlying bill. It is a vital investment in our country. But I do object to the rule because it is long past time to begin to rectify this massive theft that went on.  Every day, today every Oregonian, every residential ratepayer, every business will pay, on average, 42 percent more for the electrons purchased from the same plants transmitted over the same electric lines as 4 years ago. Just one thing happened in between. That is the Bush administration, the Bush FERC and Kenny Boy Enron Lay, the President's previous largest single contributor until this year.  The Snohomish utility found that on 473 of 537 days, Enron manipulated the market. How can the Bush FERC say that is just and reasonable and not require that those illegal contracts achieved through market manipulation be voided? We do not know because they will not release the documents. They do not want people to know how involved Enron was in setting the national energy policy.  In the year before the Bush administration released their energy policy, Enron officials met with members of the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission and their staff on 272 occasions during one work year. That means on every day there was an Enron official in the FERC offices. Were they also in Vice President Cheney's office? We do not know because he is fighting release of those records. We need these illegal contracts to be voided, and we need all of the documentation released about this massive market manipulation.  This is continuing to cast a pall over the economy of the Pacific Northwest. We have some of the worst unemployment in the country over the last few years, and a good part is because billions of dollars have been illegally extracted from our ratepayers by the Texas-based Enron company with the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission appointed by President Bush standing by complicit, compliant and silent.
