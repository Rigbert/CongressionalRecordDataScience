 President, I would like to take a moment to express my concern about a provision included in the unemployment compensation bill before the Senate.  The provision I am concerned about deals with a reversal of a sound international tax policy reform. Back in 2004, Congress passed and President Bush signed a major bipartisan business tax reform bill. The centerpiece proposal in the international tax reform area was a restoration of the Finance Committee position from the 1986 Tax Reform Act on the treatment of interest for the purposes of the foreign tax credit.  This reform, known as World Wide Interest Apportionment, was due to take effect at the beginning of 2009, but its implementation was delayed for 2 years in order to pay for housing legislation enacted in July of 2008. I expressed my concerns at the time about delaying sound international tax policy in order to fund new spending priorities. However, my view lost out and the delay of this provision was used as an offset.  Now, here we are again, in need of revenue offset in order to fund other priorities. The proposal in the bill before us delays this important reform an additional 7 years, until December 31, 2017. I support the main provisions of the bill intended to provide relief to those struggling to find work by extending unemployment benefits and to provide a lift to the economy by extending the homebuyer tax credit and the expanded net operating loss carryback period for small businesses.  My opposition to this revenue offset rests in the bad tax policy this proposal represents. The interest allocation reform would, if allowed to take effect, lower the chance of double tax that arises under current law from the artificial overallocation of interest expense to foreign income, even when the debt is incurred to fund domestic investment. The current rules actually penalize domestic manufacturers that compete in global markets by making it more likely they will be double-taxed on their foreign income.  Several companies have spoken to my staff about the negative ramifications this delay will have on them. Some of these companies are just starting to grow their businesses beyond the U.S. borders. The delay of this important international reform will make it more costly for these companies to expand into these markets. If these companies cannot grow beyond the domestic economy, they will be unable to compete in the global marketplace.  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that a letter I received from John Deere explaining their concern about delaying the implementation of this provision be printed in the Record.  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in the Record, as follows:                                              Deere & Company,                                     Moline, IL, October 22, 2009.     Hon. Charles Grassley,     Senate Finance Committee,     Washington, DC.       Dear Senator Grassley: Deere and Company would like to      reemphasize to you the importance of worldwide interest      allocation and our strong desire that implementation of this      provision not be further delayed by using the provision as a      ``pay for'' for other issues. Further continued delays in      implementing this provision will make U.S. companies less      competitive with our foreign competitors.       We ask that you find a different offset to fund H.R. 3548,      the Supplemental Appropriations, and oppose using the Reid-     Baucus proposed delay of the interest allocation rules to      offset other tax policy. U.S. based employers like Deere      believe implementing World Wide Interest Allocation is      critically important international tax law.                                                Thomas K. Jarrett,                                              Vice President, Tax.
