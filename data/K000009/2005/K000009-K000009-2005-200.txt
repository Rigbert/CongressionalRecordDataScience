Speaker, on Tuesday, June 28, 2005, our community lost a great jurist, advocate and true friend with the passing of Roger R. Weiher. At 79 years young, he unexpectedly passed from this life.  An Army Air Corps veteran of World War II, Roger Weiher was raised in North Toledo and graduated from Woodward High School. He received undergraduate degrees from Western Michigan and John Carroll Universities, and earned his law degree back home at the University of Toledo. In addition to his law practice, Roger also served as Lucas County deputy clerk of courts and Ohio assistant attorney general. He began his judicial tenure with an appointment to Toledo Municipal Court in 1989 and was later elected to the position. Following a decade of service, Judge Weiher continued as a visiting judge even after retirement. His even-tempered, soft and patient nature made him a good judge and, as one of his colleagues noted, ``He understood people. That's what made him so effective on that court.'' Expecting to remain active following mandatory retirement from visiting judge duties at age 80, Judge Weiher planned next month to begin training as a mediator. His wife explained, ``He wasn't going to put his feet up.''  Roger was not only a fine public servant and respected attorney, but together with his first wife Evelyn Weiher, with whom he raised their son Tommy, he was well known in the theatre world. Evelyn was an actress, director, and teacher in the theatre, and when they settled back in Toledo the two established a theatre company in the 1960s which staged productions in the former State Theatre. Later productions were staged at Adrian's Croswell Opera House. Evelyn passed away following illness in 1983, yet Roger's passion for performing continued. Just last month he participated in his 49th consecutive Gridiron show, an annual event of the Toledo Junior Bar Association.  His wife Norma brought new joy into his life, and they were married in 1985. Always at his side, Norma was his true and faithful companion. She was with him even as he breathed his last from this life and entered into the next. We extend our heartfelt condolences to Norma, Thomas, stepdaughter Linda, brother Donald, and grandchildren. May the brightly burning light that was Roger Weiher in life remain in their hearts, giving them comfort for the journey ahead, and offering them peace in remembering the man who was husband, father, brother, grandpa, mentor, friend, and a man imbued with the spirit of justice borne of his faith and the rule of law.                          ____________________
