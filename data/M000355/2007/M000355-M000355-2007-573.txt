 We expected to have it week before last. We insist, however, on having the debate in the Senate in the way debates are always carried out in the Senate, in a fair and evenhanded way.  Our good friends on the other side of the aisle initially supported the Biden proposal, which came out of the Foreign Relations Committee. When that appeared not to have enough support, they adopted the Warner-Levin proposal. When that appeared to be inconvenient, they switched again and now support, I guess, what best can be called the Pelosi-Reid proposal, which they are attempting to get before the Senate today.  All along the way, for the last few weeks, Senate Republicans have been consistent in asking for a fair debate, and a fair debate includes, at the very least, one alternative supported by a majority of Senate Republicans.
