Chairman, now you know how it feels about California water. I got the drift of this thing.  Mr. Chairman, I certainly appreciate the gentleman's interest on this issue and appreciate the variety of opinions about it. I thank the gentleman, as well as the gentlewoman from Minnesota, who is the subcommittee's ranking member, for her willingness to work with the committee. As we work together to try to move forward with this bill, I hope a compromise will be found.
