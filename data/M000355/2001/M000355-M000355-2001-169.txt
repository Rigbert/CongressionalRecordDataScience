 President, I think it is appropriate to have at least a brief discussion before final passage--very brief because we have been on this 2 weeks. People do have a sense of what this issue is about.  One possibility, of course, would be to let that time we use on this subject count on the budget resolution. That would probably smooth the passage to approving this. We will get a report from our leader shortly.
