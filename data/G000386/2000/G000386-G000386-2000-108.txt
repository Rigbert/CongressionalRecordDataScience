 President, today is the celebration for Angels in Adoption and as a member of the Congressional Coalition on Adoption, I am proud to participate in such an important event.  I commend Diane, and Jim Lewis, from Marion, IA. I nominated this amazing couple as Angels in Adoption.  Diane and Jim Lewis are the proud parents of ten beautiful children, eight of whom are adopted. Five of their adopted children have special health care needs, some with physical needs, other with mental health needs. Two of their adopted children are biologic siblings and their adoption has allowed them to stay together. Their family now consists of children from several different ethnic and racial backgrounds. The Lewis' also are frequently foster parents to other children in need, usually those with special health care needs.  As special education teachers, the Lewis' have seen the need over many years for foster and adoptive parents for children who have special needs. The Lewis' are truly devoted to making the world a better place for children. By committing their lives to raising children who might not have otherwise had a chance, they have improved the lives of children and given us all something to aspire to. They are Angels in Adoption.                          ____________________
