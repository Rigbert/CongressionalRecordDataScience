President, I am going to wrap up. I read carefully what the senior Senator from Arizona had to say yesterday. I hope I have addressed each of the major points he raised. There was indeed an investigation. There were standards which the University of Phoenix agreed to follow and then failed to follow. There is an effort underway to make sure we protect the men and women in the military and their families from exploitation when it comes to their GI bills. We should continue that effort.  I hope my friend and colleague from Arizona who has made a record in the Senate of speaking up, standing up to avoid those misuses of Federal funds, will continue in that same vein when it comes to this issue. We want money well spent. We want our men and uniform well served.  I yield the floor.  I suggest the absence of a quorum.  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Flake). The clerk will call the roll.  The senior assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.  Mr. McCONNELL. Mr. President. I ask unanimous consent that the order for the quorum call be rescinded.
