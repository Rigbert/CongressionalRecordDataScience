I understand the background. As long, obviously, as we do have, within the structured rule, an opportunity to debate different points of view, that will be, I think, helpful to all the Members.  The gentleman from Texas did not mention in his initial discussion of the schedule whether or not there was any plan, at least on Monday, to do anything with respect to going to conference on the budget or instructions. Can we assume from that that there will be no action on the budget going to conference, at least on Monday night?  Mr. DeLAY. I appreciate the gentleman reminding me. The gentleman knows, of course, that the other body has already passed their version of the budget resolution; and in working with the other body, I really anticipate moving to go to conference on the budget as early as Monday afternoon of next week.
