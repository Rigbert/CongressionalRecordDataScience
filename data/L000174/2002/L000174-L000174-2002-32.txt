President, I mentioned that Judge Shedd tends to go even beyond where an activist U.S. Supreme Court has gone. In a 1997 case challenging the constitutionality of the Driver's Privacy Protection Act, Judge Shedd made a federalism ruling that went way beyond even the extreme federalism rulings of the U.S. Supreme Court, and it was so bad that the U.S. Supreme Court in a 9-to-0 opinion reversed Judge Shedd's ruling.  In Condon v. Reno, Judge Shedd ruled on the constitutionality of the Driver's Privacy Act, which essentially prohibited States from selling and sharing personal information gleaned as they were picking up driver's license information. He said that the Act violated the 10th Amendment as interpreted by the courts in New York v. United States and Printz v. United States. Three years later, Chief Justice Rehnquist wrote for the Court explaining that, to the contrary, neither of the cases applied. He did not get just one of them wrong, he got them both wrong. The Chief Justice wrote that because the Act did not require the States in their sovereign capacity to regulate their own citizens, but instead regulates the States as the owners of the databases. Therefore, the Act was consistent with the constitutional principles enunciated in New York v. Printz.  In Crosby v. South Carolina, he found the Family and Medical Leave Act unconstitutional on the grounds that it was not properly enacted under Congress's power. I mention this case because it is the second time Judge Shedd ruled in such a way in an important federalism case. He also ruled this way because he just took a magistrate judge's very brief report and did not put in any significant analysis of his own.  In this case, it is almost impossible to figure out his reasoning for why this important law with bipartisan support would be unconstitutional, especially when acts of Congress are entitled to a presumption of constitutionality. One would think if somebody really cared about the courts of appeal and the Supreme Court, they would have at least given us rigorous analysis instead of making what appears to be a somewhat arbitrary ruling.  In addition, he issued several opinions relating to a murder case where a privileged conversation between the defendant and his attorney was monitored and recorded on videotape by the county sheriff's department. Present in the room where the conversation was being monitored were several of the sheriff's deputies and the county prosecutor who subsequently handled the case. The defendant was convicted and sentenced to death but the Supreme Court of South Carolina reversed because of the nature of the videotaping. In its opinion, the Supreme Court of South Carolina--not one considered the most liberal of courts--used very strong language that condemned the failure to disqualify the local prosecutor's office. They cited the prosecutor's special responsibilities to do justice. And the South Carolina Supreme Court said it would not tolerate deliberate prosecutorial misconduct which threatens rights fundamental to liberty and justice. That is about as strong a condemnation by any state Supreme Court of a prosecutor's actions as I have ever heard.  So the federal prosecutions relating to the videotaping were then brought to Judge Shedd's courtroom. Both the prosecutor, Fran Humphries, and the defense attorney, Jack Duncan, were brought before a federal grand jury investigating these constitutional violations.  Mr. Duncan testified that he had not given a copy of the tape to a television reporter, while Mr. Humphries testified he had not immediately known the taping was taking place. Now each of themwas charged with perjury based on these statements. As I mentioned, the prosecutor and several of the sheriffs, were there watching the taping. So it was obvious he was not telling the truth.  Mr. Duncan, the defense attorney, was found guilty and sentenced to 4 months in prison. Even though the information seemed overwhelming against the prosecutor, Judge Shedd dismissed those charges.  This is enlightening because if anybody was hurt by the improper taping, it was the defendant and the defense attorney. If anybody truly committed a wrongdoing, as the South Carolina Supreme Court said in the strongest language against a prosecutor I can remember, it was the prosecutor. But having them both before his court, Judge Shedd in effect exonerated the prosecutor and sentenced the defense attorney to 4 months.  Think of yourself as the litigant before his court. Look at all of these cases I have talked about, and so many others. I do not fall in the category of the sides he tends to rule with. I am on the other side. It would be an awful sinking feeling to go in there knowing how good your case is but you are probably going to lose.  This particular decision shows disregard for the rights of Americans who, no matter what they have been accused of, should be able to expect privacy and not to be videotaped by the government when they are talking to their attorneys. The law is settled in this country that with attorney-client privilege you can sit down and talk with your attorney without the prosecutor videotaping what you are saying, without them listening to or eavesdropping on you.  There are a couple of people you are able to talk to with a reasonable expectation of privacy. You are able to talk to your spouse. You are able to talk to your attorney. You are able to talk to your priest in a penitent relationship. Here, the prosecutor violated that--something that every prosecutor's handbook in America says is wrong, something that hornbook law says is wrong, every ethics course says is wrong, and every bar association says is wrong. The Supreme Court of South Carolina unanimously said it was wrong but Judge Shedd said to the prosecutor: It is okay; we will get the other guy. Well, that calls into question his ability to be fair in criminal cases.  So I am concerned when I see his record as a Federal district judge, and I ask myself: If this is his record as a Federal district judge, how is he going to be as a circuit judge on the court of appeals? So I share some of the same concerns about his fairness that we have heard expressed from South Carolina and from throughout the Fourth Circuit.  I know arguments will be made on the other side, and this will be disposed of however the Senate decides to vote, but for me, I could not in good conscience vote aye on this nomination. I will vote no.  I ask unanimous consent that letters from the Leadership Conference on Civil Rights, Alliance for Justice, and others be printed in the Record.  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in the Record, as follows:         Leadership Conference on Civil Rights and Alliance for            Justice,                                  Washington, DC, August 30, 2002.     Hon. Patrick J. Leahy,     Chair, Senate Judiciary Committee, Washington, DC.       Dear Senator Leahy: We, the undersigned civil and human      rights organizations, write to express our strong opposition      to the confirmation of Dennis Shedd to the United States      Court of Appeals for the Fourth Circuit.       First, we want to comment on the Judiciary Committee's      level of review of this particular nomination. On July 11, we      sent a letter expressing concern that the Committee had not      received all of the information required to make a fully      informed decision about whether to elevate Judge Shedd to the      Fourth Circuit. We urged the Committee to take steps to      complete the record on this nominee, and to hold another      hearing to allow the Committee to fully examine the complete      record.       It now appears as if the Committee has declined to ensure      that it has obtained the complete judicial record and has      decided not to hold a second hearing on the nomination. We      are deeply troubled that the Committee may vote on the Shedd      nomination without first obtaining a complete record and then      providing an opportunity to publicly explore that record. The      many concerns that we have identified in Judge Shedd's record      produced thus far and which give rise to our opposition only      strengthen our conviction that a vote on the nomination      should occur only after a full record is obtained and      examined.       We strongly believe that the composition of the federal      judiciary is a civil rights issue of profound importance to      all Americans, because the individuals charged with      dispensing justice in our society have a direct impact on      civil rights protections for us all. As you know, the role of      the federal judiciary in protecting the rights of the      powerless is particularly acute in the Fourth Circuit, which      has the highest percentage of African-Americans of any      federal circuit in the nation.       The Fourth Circuit is also arguably the most conservative      of the federal circuits. Several of its most conservative      decisions have been subsequently reversed by the Supreme      Court as too extreme, including Condon v. Reno, a challenge      to Congress's power to protect the privacy of drivers'      license information; an attempt to overrule the Miranda rule;      and Virginia's attempt to limit the right of reproductive      choice. Because of the high percentage of minority citizens      in the circuit and the very conservative nature of the court,      it is imperative that any new appointment to this court be a      person of moderate views who is wholly committed to the goals      of equality and equal opportunity for all Americans. After an      extensive review of Judge Shedd's record, it has become clear      that he is not that nominee.       We are deeply concerned about Judge Shedd's reluctance to      follow the law in support of vigorous enforcement of legal      protections against discrimination for women and minorities.      During Judge Shedd's time on the bench, at least forty      African-Americans have filed employment discrimination cases      that were assigned to Judge Shedd's court. Of those, Judge      Shedd granted summary judgment for the employer in whole or      in part in almost every case. In one case, Bailey v. South      Carolina Dep't of Social Services, Judge Shedd granted      summary judgment to the employer, even though the EEOC had      determine there was reasonable cause to believe that the      plaintiff was not promoted due to his race. In another case,      McMillan v. Department of Corrections, the plaintiff alleged      discrimination in the denial of a pay increase by the      Department of Corrections. The plaintiff's supervisor had      requested a pay increase for the plaintiff. At the same time,      another State agency conducted an investigation into racially      discriminatory employment practices within the Department of      Corrections and concluded that White employees tended to do      significantly better than Black employees in performance pay      increases. Nevertheless, Judge Shedd refused to let this case      go to trial. In contrast to cases involving African-American      plaintiffs, in four out of five discrimination cases filed by      White male plaintiffs, Judge Shedd has denied summary      judgment and paved the way for trial.       Judge Shedd has an equally poor record in cases involving      gender discrimination. In one case, Roberts v. Defender      Services, Inc., he granted summary judgment to an employer in      a sexual harassment case, even after concluding that the      supervisor's conduct ``clearly was, from an objective      standpoint, sufficiently severe and pervasive to constitute a      hostile and abusive work environment.'' Despite that finding,      Judge Shedd concluded that the plaintiff had not provided any      evidence that she ``subjectively perceived the environment to      be abusive,'' reaching this conclusion despite the fact that      the record contained evidence that the plaintiff's supervisor      made sexual comments to her on a daily basis, that she told      him these comments were offensive, that she and a female      manager took steps to report the conduct to corporate      headquarters, and that she resigned from her job.       Judge Shedd has also exhibited a disturbing tendency to      resolve cases on summary judgment in favor of defendants,      even where genuine issues of material fact were clearly      presented. For example, in Alston v. Ruston, Judge Shedd      granted summary judgment on a Section 1983 complaint after      concluding, as a matter of law, that a prison guard had not      used excessive force--despite an affidavit and a well-pleaded      complaint from the plaintiff alleging that the officer had      sprayed him in the face with tear gas without justification,      advanced toward him ``swinging his fists and punching      [plaintiff] in the mouth,'' and wielded a broomstick until      another officer intervened. Given the evidence presented,      there was no room for Judge Shedd to conclude that excessive      force had not taken place as a matter of law. Nevertheless,      Judge Shedd made such a ruling and dismissed the plaintiff's      case.       In other cases, Judge Shedd has exhibited hostility toward      plaintiffs in civil rights claims involving allegations of      misconduct by law enforcement officers. For example, in Joye      v. Richland Co. Sheriff's Dep't., Judge Shedd dismissed a      Section 1983 claim brought by a person wrongfully arrested by      sheriff's deputies under a bench warrant issued for his son.      Despite the fact that the arrest warrant described a 31 year      old man, standing 5' 11'', the officers arrested the      plaintiff who was 61 years old and stood 5' 7'' tall. The      plaintiff argued that the officers had acted unreasonably in      arresting him, in violation of his 4th Amendment rights.      Judge Shedd, however, concluded that the plaintiff had not      stated a valid 1983 claim because the officers had a      ``reasonable, good     faith, belief, that they were arresting the correct person.''      He therefore rejected, as a matter of law, the contrary      conclusion of the magistrate that the officers were not      entitled to a ``good faith'' defense on these facts.       Judge Shedd's record also displays a consistent disregard      for the rights of people with disabilities. He has ruled      against disability rights plaintiffs in almost every      instance, departing from settled law and adopting tortured      interpretations of disability rights laws. In one case, Judge      Shedd approved a state health insurance pool's complete      exclusion from coverage of a man who was HIV positive. The      plaintiff who filed the case sought to have it decided on an      expedited basis, but died eight months later before any      decision was rendered. In another case, a magistrate had      found no evidence that the plaintiff's disability interfered      with his ability to do his job and recommended that the      plaintiff be permitted to proceed with the claim.      Nevertheless, Judge Shedd dismissed the plaintiff's claim,      concluding, without citing any evidence, that the disability      rendered the plaintiff unable to do his job.       We are also very concerned about Judge Shedd's views on      ``state's rights'' which would limit Congress's power to pass      laws that are applicable to the States. Shedd authored the      original district court opinion in Condon v. Reno, striking      down the Driver's Privacy Protection Act based on his belief      that the federal government did not have the power to require      States to ensure that State driver's license records would      remain private. Although the Fourth Circuit affirmed Judge      Shedd's decision, the Supreme Court unanimously reversed the      holding in a decision by Chief Justice Rehnquist. We are      unaware of any other instance in the last 50 years where a      district court judge has struck down an act of Congress on      federalism grounds only to be unanimously reversed by the      Supreme Court. Judge Shedd also struck down part of the      Family and Medical Leave Act (FMLA), in Crosby v. South      Carolina Dep't of Health and Envtl. Control, holding that the      11th Amendment doctrine of state sovereign immunity prevents      an employee from suing a State agency for violation of the      FMLA. This issue--because it calls into question Congress's      power to remedy sex discrimination in the workplace--has      profound implications for Congress's authority under Section      5 of the 14th Amendment.       Judge Shedd has also exhibited a high level of      insensitivity on issues of race. In a recent case, Judge      Shedd made several insensitive comments as he dismissed a      lawsuit aimed at removing the Confederate battle flag from      the South Carolina statehouse dome. According to press      accounts, Judge Shedd suggested that South Carolina, 30% of      whom are African-American, ``don't care if that flag flies or      not.'' He also analogized the Confederate battle flag, to      many a symbol of support for slavery and racist acts of      terror directed at African-Americans, to the Palmetto tree,      which is on the State flag, stating: ``What about the      Palmetto tree? What if that reminds me that Palmetto trees      were cut down to make Fort Moultrie and that offends me?''      Judge Shedd's hostility to the lawsuit in open court provides      strong evidence of a poor judicial temperament. His attempt      to minimize the symbolism of the Confederate flag to the      African American community and suggest it is comparable to an      image of the Palmetto tree reflects a stunning insensitivity      to the injurious impact this particular symbol still has on      many of our citizens.       In sum, Dennis Shedd's eleven-year record on the federal      district bench reflects hostility towards plaintiffs in civil      rights cases, including minorities, women and persons with      disabilities, a desire to limit Congress's authority to enact      protective legislation that is applicable to the states, and      insensitive to issues of race. Judge Shedd's view on these      issues render him a poor choice for the Fourth Circuit and we      therefore urge you to oppose his confirmation.

Hon. Patrick J. Leahy,     U.S. Senate, Russell Senate Office Building, Washington, DC.       Dear Senator Leahy: On behalf of the more than 500,000      members and supporters of People For the American Way (PFAW),      we write to express our strong opposition to the elevation of      Judge Dennis Shedd to the United States Court of Appeals for      the Fourth Circuit.       Judge Shedd's views on federalism are of grave concern.      Judge Shedd authored the original district court opinion in      Condon v. Reno, which struck down the Driver's Privacy      Protection Act based on his analysis that the federal      government did not have the power to require states to ensure      that driver's license records remain private. Although the      Fourth Circuit Court of Appeals agreed, an a unanimous      decision authored by Justice Rehnquist, the Supreme Court      unanimously reversed. PFAW is unaware of any other instance      in the last 50 years where a district court judge has struck      down an act of Congress on federalism grounds only to be      unanimously reversed by the Supreme Court.       In Crosby v. South Carolina Dept. of Health and Envtl.      Control, Judge Shedd also struck down part of the Family and      Medical Leave Act (FMLA), holding that the 11th Amendment      doctrine of state sovereign immunity prevents an employee      from suing a State agency for violation of the FMLA. This      issue--because it calls into question Congress's power to      remedy sex discrimination in the workplace--has profound      implications for Congress's authority under Section 5 of the      14th Amendment.       Judge Shedd has a troubling record on civil rights      enforcement. Throughout his eleven years as a federal      district court judge, Judge Shedd has dismissed almost every      civil rights case on behalf of minority claimants that has      come before him, thereby preventing the merits of these cases      from being heard by a jury.       For example, in Bailey v. South Carolina Dept. of Social      Services, Judge Shedd granted summary judgment to the      employer, even though the Equal Employment Opportunity      Commission (EEOC) had determined there was reasonable cause      to believe that the African American plaintiff was not      promoted because of his race. In McMillan v. South Carolina      Dept. of Corrections, a case involving allegations of race      discrimination, Judge Shedd refused to allow the plaintiff's      claim to go to trial, despite a finding by another state      agency that Caucasian employees tended to receive higher      performance pay increases than African-American employees.       In contrast, in four of the five cases filed in his court      by Caucasian plaintiffs alleging ``reverse discrimination''      in employment, Judge Shedd denied summary judgment and      allowed the case to proceed to a jury trial.       Judge Shedd's record also reflects insensitivity in civil      rights cases alleging discrimination based on gender. For      example, in Roberts v. Defender Services, Inc., a      recommendation of the federal magistrate and granted summary      judgment to the defendant. In Roberts, the record contained      evidence that the plaintiff's supervisor made sexual comments      to her on a daily basis, that she told him these comments      were offensive, that she and a female manager took steps to      report the conduct to corporate headquarters, and that she      resigned from her job. Despite this evidence, Judge Shedd      stated that while the supervisor's conduct ``clearly was,      from an objective standpoint, sufficiently severe and      pervasive to constitute a hostile and abusive work      environment,'' the plaintiff had not provided any evidence      that she ``subjectively perceived the environment to be      abusive.''       A number of Judge Shedd's opinions reflect a disregard for      laws protecting the disabled. For example, in Payette v.      Westinghouse Electric Corp., Judge Shedd effectively read the      right of employees to ``reassignment,'' a crucial protection      for those with disabilities, out of the Americans with      Disabilities Act (ADA). Congress explicitly included      reassignment to a vacant position, when the person is no      longer able to do his or her job, as one type of      accommodation required by the ADA. In Givens v. South      Carolina Health Insurance Pool, Judge Shedd ignored the plain      meaning of the ADA when he approved a state health insurance      pool's refusal of coverage for a man who was HIV positive. No      other medical condition was excluded, and the state had done      no actuarial analysis to justify the exclusion of individuals      with HIV/AIDS. While many courts have held that the ADA does      not prevent insurance plans from providing lesser benefits      for treatment of particular types of disabilities, this      ruling goes beyond those decisions.       Judge Shedd has exhibited a high level of insensitivity on      issues of race. In a recent case, Judge Shedd made several      insensitive comments as he dismissed a lawsuit aimed at      removing the Confederate battle flag from the South Carolina      statehouse dome. According to press accounts, Judge Shedd      suggested that South Carolinians, 30% of whom are African-     American, ``don't care if that flag flies or not.'' He also      analogized the Confederate battle flag, to many a symbol of      support for slavery and racist acts of terror directed at      African-Americans, to the Palmetto tree, which is on the      South Carolina State flag, stating: ``What about the Palmetto      tree? What if that reminds me that Palmetto trees were cut      down to make Fort Moultrie and that offends me?''       Given the importance of the Fourth Circuit and the current      ideological imbalance on the court, it is imperative that any      nominee to this court be a jurist of more moderate views who      will protect the civil and constitutional rights of all      Americans. Judge Shedd's record demonstrates that he is not     the nominee. PFAW urges the Judiciary committee to reject his      nomination.           Sincerely,                                                    Ralph G. Neas,     President.                                  ____                                        National Headquarters,                                     Chicago, IL, August 24, 2002.     Senator Patrick Leahy,     Member, U.S. Senate,     Washington, DC       Dear Senator Leahy: Let me lend my voice of opposition to      the chorus of discontent surrounding the nomination of Judge      Dennis Shedd to the Fourth Circuit Court of Appeals. I urge      you to oppose the Shedd nomination, based on the merits, and      the merits alone. A seat on the Fourth Circuit is too      important to the nation's judiciary not to be heavily      scrutinized.       As a native of South Carolina, I am deeply disturbed by the      direction taken by the Fourth Circuit in recent years. As a      Judicial Circuit with considerable influence on the Supreme      Court, those elevated to the Court should reflect the highest      American ideals of inclusion and equal protection under the      law. Moreover, the states included in the Fourth Circuit are      comprised of the highest percentage of African Americans,      than any other Circuit, thus judges on the Court must be      sensitive and respectful for the civil rights laws for which      we fought so hard.       Currently, the Fourth Circuit is the most extremist court      in the nation on civil rights issues, criminal justice      issues, and those involving the power of the federal      government, to enact legislation, which holds States      accountable for civil rights violations. The nomination of      Dennis Shedd threatens to take the Court in a further      extremist direction. For example, Judge Shedd's opinion in      the Condon v. Reno case suggests that he favors disempowering      Congress. American judges, and their rulings should protect      rights, rather than restrict the balance of power.       To preserve this nation's ideals of inclusion, and to      ensure equal protection under the law for all Americans, I      urge you, and other members of the members of the Senate      Judiciary Committee to vote ``No'' on the nomination of      Dennis Shedd.           Sincerely,     Reverend Jesse L. Jackson, Sr.                                  ____                                        South Carolina Legislative                                                 Black Caucus,                                  Columbia, SC, September 4, 2002.     Re Fourth Circuit Nomination of Judge Shedd.     Hon. Patrick J. Leahy,     Chair, Senate Judiciary Committee,     Washington, DC.       Dear Senator Leahy: The South Carolina Legislative Black      Caucus (SCLBC) was formed in 1975 soon after the Civil Rights      Movement in the 1960's. Presently, the SCLBC has 31 members;      seven senators and 24 representatives, including four women.      The SCLBC is dedicated to the struggle for fairness, equality      and justice for all South Carolinians, and to the civic and      political involvement of African-Americans, women and other      racial and ethnic minorities.       We seek to preserve the civil rights strides that occurred      in South Carolina over the decades, and we fight to prevent      any regressive step that threatens to rollback civil rights      and constitutional rights of African-Americans, women and      other racial and ethnic minorities. The nomination of U.S.      District Judge Dennis W. Shedd to the U.S. Court of Appeals      for the Fourth Circuit represents such a regressive step, and      accordingly, we strongly oppose the nomination.       African-Americans constitute a full one-third of South      Carolina's population, yet there is only one active African-     American federal judge in the state. And, there are only two      South Carolinian female federal judges, one on the federal      District Court and the other on the Fourth Circuit. This is      unfair and unjustified because there are many well-qualified      African-American and woman jurists and lawyers who deserve an      opportunity to serve this nation on the federal judiciary.       Because African-Americans are one-third of South Carolina's      population and the Fourth Circuit has a greater number of      African-Americans than any circuit, it is critical that any      nominee, especially one from South Carolina, be an unabashed      champion of civil rights. The appointee should have a record      that demonstrates fairness and justice to all people. Based      on our careful review of Judge Dennis Shedd's performance on      the U.S. District Court for the District of South Carolina,      we have concluded that his record shows a serious hostility      to civil rights and constitutional protections.       Since his appointment to the federal bench in South      Carolina, Judge Shedd has engaged in right-wing judicial      activism by imposing strict and exacting standards when      reviewing employment discrimination cases brought by African      Americans and women. He has dismissed almost every employment      discrimination, sexual harassment, civil rights and      disability case that has come before him. Judge Shedd seems      to believe that discrimination is not an actionable offense      even when the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission has      found ``reasonable cause'' that discrimination has occurred.      Judge Shedd, however seems to apply a more lenient standard      in reviewing discrimination cases brought by white men. Judge      Shedd has allowed four out of five ``reverse'' discrimination      cases to proceed beyond the summary judgment phase of      litigation.       This record shows that Judge Shedd does not have an abiding      concern for civil rights and fairness. It further shows that      Shedd lacks the requisite moderate reasoning to bring balance      to the Fourth Circuit. In fact, his membership to the Fourth      Circuit would push it further beyond the mainstream of      American values and would subject South Carolinians and      residents of other states within the Fourth Circuit to an      extreme right-wing interpretation of the nation's civil      rights laws and constitutional protections.       Accordingly we oppose Judge Shedd's nomination without      reservations. Hi values represents the Old South, where      African Americans and women were judged by different and      unequal standards.       We appreciate your attention.

Neal,     Chairman.                                  ____                                      National Association for the                                Advancement of Colored People,                                Baltimore, MD, September 17, 2002.     Re Fourth Circuit Nomination of Judge Shedd.     U.S. Senate, Washington, DC.       Dear Senator: On behalf of the NAACP, the nation's oldest,      largest and most widely-recognized grass roots civil rights      organization, I am writing to let you know of the      Association's strong opposition to the nomination of District      Court Judge Dennis W. Shedd to the Fourth Circuit Court of      Appeals. Delegates from every state in the nation, including      the five states comprising the Fourth Circuit, unanimously      passed a resolution from the South Carolina State Conference      in opposition to the nomination at the NAACP's annual      convention in Houston in early July.       Members of the NAACP believe that the Federal judiciary, as      the final arbiter of the U.S. Constitution, is the branch of      government primarily charged with protecting the rights and      liberties of all Americans. In many instances in our nation's      history, the courts have been the only institution willing to      enforce the rights of minority Americans. We cannot afford to      permit the Federal judiciary to retreat from its      constitutional obligation and resort to the type of judicial      activism that threatens civil rights and civil liberties.       No other federal circuit reflects this extreme right-wing      activism more than the Fourth Circuit Court of Appeal, which      is home to more African Americans than any other circuit. The      Fourth Circuit Court of Appeals' hostility to civil rights,      affirmative action, women's rights, voting rights and fair      employment is unrivalled. Its decisions are so far out the      mainstream that the Supreme Court has reversed the Fourth      Circuit on basic constitutional protections such as Miranda      warnings.       Judge Shedd's addition to the Fourth Circuit would further      relegate that court to the periphery of judicial mainstream.      His judicial record and testimony before the Judiciary      Committee reflect a disposition to rule against the plaintiff      in employment and discrimination cases. Moreover, his      restrictive view of federal legislative authority, as      indicated in Condon v. Reno, 972 F. Supp. 977 (D.S.C. 1997),      which struck down the Driver's Privacy Protection Act of      1994, 18 U.S.C. Sec. Sec. 2721-25 and was later overturned in      a 9-to-0 decision by the Supreme Court, confirms our      perspective that Judge Shedd's judicial philosophy and      temperament would further push the Fourth Circuit to the      right-wing.       Accordingly, as unanimously passed by the over 1,200      delegates to the 2002 NAACP National Convention, I ask that      you oppose the nomination and that you use your influence to      encourage the Senate Judiciary Committee to not vote him out      of Committee. However, if the nomination makes it to the      Senate floor, we ask you to vote against it.       I appreciate your attention and interest in this important      matter. Please do not hesitate to contact me or Hilary      Shelton, Director of the NAACP Washington Bureau at (202)      638-2269, if we can be of assistance.           Sincerely,                                                      Kwesi Mfume,     President & CEO.                                  ____         South Carolina State Conference, National Association for            the Advancement of Colored People,                                      Columbia, SC, June 24, 2002.     Senator Patrick Leahy,     Chairman, Judiciary Committee, Dirksen Senate Office          Building, Washington, DC.       Dear Chairman Leahy: We write to oppose the nomination of      Dennis Shedd to the Fourth Circuit Court of Appeals.       By now, you must be familiar with the importance of the      Fourth Circuit to the African American Community. Almost a      quarter of the Fourth Circuit's residents are African      American. The Fourth Circuit, with over 6 million African      Americans in the five states, has the greatest number of      African Americans of any Circuit Court in the country. The      Latino population within the Fourth circuit now at more than      one million persons, has nearly tripled in the last decade.      Based on these demographics, more may be at stake here for      the future of civil rights than in any other Circuit Court in      the country.       The Fourth Circuit is already an extremely conservative      Court on civil rights and Constitutional issues. This Circuit      ruled that     federal law-enforcement officials need not follow the Miranda      decision, only to be reversed by the Supreme Court. This      Circuit authorized drug testing for pregnant women without      their consent which was reversed by the Supreme Court. This      Circuit ruled that the Equal Employment Opportunity      Commission was limited to remedies contained in employee      arbitration agreements, and again, was reversed by the      Supreme Court. The Circuit also has been reversed recently in      capital habeas corpus cases and citizen suits under      environmental. laws. The Fourth Circuit has issued numerous      other opinions that are hostile to affirmative action,      women's rights, fair employment, and voting rights.       This is also the Court to which moderate African American      nominees were repeatedly denied membership. No fewer than      four African Americans were nominated to this Court by      President Clinton, only to have their nominations languish      for years due to Senatorial obstruction. Thus, if a nominee      is to be confirmed to this Court, the nominee must be a      jurist who will bring moderation and ideological balance to      this Court. It is our strongly held view that this nominee is      not Dennis Shedd.       Judge Shedd's judicial record reveals a deep and abiding      hostility to civil rights cases. A review of Shedd's      unpublished opinions reveals that Judge Shedd has dismissed      all but very few of the civil rights cases coming before him.      In nearly thirty case involving racial discrimination in      employment, he granted summary judgment for the employer in      whole or in part in all but one case; most of the cases were      dismissed altogether. Many of these cases were strong cases      with compelling evidence an litigated by experienced civil      right lawyers.       Gender and disability discrimination cases before Judge      Shedd fare no better. He has granted summary judgment on      every sexual harassment claim on which summary judgment was      requested. Collectively, these ruling leave us with the      distinct impression that, in Dennis Shedd's view of the      world, discrimination does not exist, and just as      importantly, a jury should never be asked even to decide that      question.       We are profoundly disturbed by the mounting evidence of      Judge Shedd's zealous efforts to assist the defense in civil      rights cases. There are repeated instances of Judge Shedd's      intervention in civil rights cases--without prompting by the      defendant--in ways that are detrimental to the plaintiff's      case. In a number of cases, Judge Shedd, on his own motion,      has questioned whether he should dismiss civil rights claims      outright or grant summary judgment. He has invited defendants      to file for attorney's fees and costs against civil rights      plaintiffs. These are not the actions of an impartial      decision-maker.       We are extremely concerned about Judge Shedd's rulings      promoting ``States' rights,'' and view these as a fundamental      encroachment on Congress's ability to enact civil rights and      other legislation. Judge Shedd has a very restrictive view of      Congressional power. He struck down the Driver's Privacy      Protection act of 1994 as legislation beyond Congress's      power, although this legislation was an ``anti-stalking''      measures designed to prohibit public disclosure of drivers'      license information. In an opinion authored by Chief Justice      Rehnquist, the Supreme Court unanimously overturned Judge      Shedd's ruling and refuted his reasoning. This stand as one      of the few occasions in which the Supreme Court rejected      unanimously a holding that Congress exceeded its power in      enacting a statute.       The question of judicial temperament is raised by Judge      Shedd's offensive remarks during a judicial proceeding about      an issue that strikes at the heart of many--the Confederate      flag. Judge Shedd presided over a federal lawsuit seeking the      removal of the Confederate flag from the dome of the South      Carolina Statehouse. According to press accounts of a hearing      held in the case. Judge Shedd made several derogatory      comments about opposition to the flag. First, he attempted to      marginalize opponents to the flag by questioning whether the      flag matters to most South Carolinians. (It does, and thirty      percent of South Carolina's population is African American.)      He also minimized the deep racial symbolism of the flag by      comparing it to the Palmetto tree, which appears in South      Carolina's State flag.       Our membership in South Carolina, deserves to be      represented on the Circuit by a nominee who has a record of      judicial impartiality, is committed to the progress made on      civil rights and individuals liberties, and has a deep      respect for the responsibility of the federal judiciary to      uphold that progress. Dennis Shedd is not that nominee. We      urge you and the Senate Judiciary Committee to vote against      his nomination.           Sincerely,                                                    James Gallman,     President.                                  ____                                         The National Black Caucus                                         of State Legislators,                               Washington, DC, September 19, 2002.     Hon. Patrick J. Leahy,     U.S. Senate, Chair, Committee on the Judiciary, Dirksen          Senate Office Building, Washington, DC.     Re Fourth Circuit Nomination of Judge Shedd.       Dear Senator Leahy: The National Black Caucus of State      Legislators (NBCSL) is the body that represents some 60      African American state legislators in 44 states, the District      of Columbia and the U.S. Virgin Islands. Last year, we      celebrated our 25th year of involvement and dedication to      many of the most pressing social issues and policies that      impact our legislators' districts and the nation at large.      Our commitment is to our constituents as well as the national      agenda. Our dedicated work is to maintain the highest values      of civil and human rights insuring that African Americans are      a fair and representative part of the political and social      equations of this great nation.       In their letter to you, dated September 4, 2002, members of      the South Carolina Legislative Black Caucus have spoken      clearly and definitively in opposing the nomination of Judge      Dennis Shedd to the Fourth Circuit. In reviewing the      information presented therein and having also researched the      history and record of Judge Shedd, we find it woefully      deficient regarding the issues of fairness, equality and      justice. Moreover, as has been pointed out by our colleagues      in South Carolina ``African Americans constitute a full one-     third of South Carolina's population yet there is only one      active African American federal judge in the state.'' In that      there are unquestionably ``many, well-qualified African      American . . . jurists'' in South Carolina, this is rightly      seen as an unfair and unequal treatment in the sight of fair      representation. Further, considering the existent      disproportionate representation of jurists of Color,      certainly an effort must be made to insure that any South      Carolina nominee be a strong advocate of civil and human      rights. Rather, Judge Shedd's performance on the U.S.      District Court for the District of South Carolina      demonstrates what could be construed as hostile to civil and      constitutional rights.       We have learned that Judge Shedd's insensitivity to      fairness has been demonstrated in his review of employment      discrimination cases brought by African Americans and in      fact, women, even in such cases when the Equal Opportunity      Commission has found ``reasonable cause.'' But, we have also      found that in furtherance of this questionable action, when      white men bring cases of ``reverse'' discrimination, those      cases proceed. We also note that there have been concerns      raised about the number of unpublished opinions issued by the      Judge and further that such concerns regarding the decisions      were reversed or vacated by the Fourth Circuit Court of      Appeals.       The Fourth Circuit must have a judge who is mindful of the      rightful place that African Americans have in this nation,      and be a strong advocate of civil rights, human rights and      constitutional rights. Any nominee should have demonstrated      his dedication to such virtues and ideals. No other      individuals should be considered for this important position.       For these reasons among others raised by our South Carolina      Legislative Black Caucus, we cannot support the nomination of      Judge Dennis Shedd for the Fourth Circuit and would ask that      the opinion of our body be strongly considered in this      matter. Should you have any questions, or require additional      comment, please contact me.           Very truly yours,                                                  James L. Thomas,                                                        President.
