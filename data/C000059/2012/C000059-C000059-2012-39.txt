Speaker, I rise today to honor and pay tribute to an individual whose dedication and contributions to southern California are exceptional. Southern California has been fortunate to have dynamic and dedicated community leaders who willingly and unselfishly give their time and talent and make their communities a better place to live and work. Brian Moore is one of these individuals. At a luncheon on May 31, 2012, Brian will be honored for his work as the original Deputy District Engineer for Project Management in the Corps of Engineers Los Angeles District. After 35 years of service with the Corps of Engineers, Brian will be retiring.  As the Deputy District Engineer for Project Management, Brian serves as Deputy to the Commander and Senior Civilian in the District and directs the Programs and Project Management Division. The Division is responsible for management of all the District's major programs and projects. The Los Angeles District covers projects for civil works, military, and environmental programs in Southern California, Southern Nevada, and Arizona and has a workload of more than a billion dollars in fiscal year 2009. The Programs and Project Management Division has nearly 100 project managers, schedulers, and budget analysts assigned to the management of more than 400 projects in navigation, flood control, environmental restoration, military construction, and environmental cleanup.  The Division also manages more than $300 million in projects for other agencies such as Department of Homeland Security, the Veterans Administration, the Environmental Protection Agency, and others. Mr. Moore has over 35 years of experience with the Corps of Engineers in planning, construction, and project management. He is a graduate of the University of California at Berkeley with a Bachelors of Science Degree in Civil Engineering and holds a Master Degree in Water Resources Systems from Cornell University. He is a licensed professional engineer in the State of California.  I have come to know Brian well through many years working together on a variety of public projects in southern California. I can personally attest to Brian's incredible work-ethic, professionalism, and positive attitude. Brian is married to Dr. Nancy Moore who is a research engineer at Rand Corporation in Santa Monica. Both he and Nancy are avid skiers and Mr. Moore also enjoys golf.  In light of all Brian Moore has done for southern California, it is only fitting that he be honored as he retires from the Army Corps of Engineers. Brian's tireless passion for public service has contributed immensely to the betterment of our region and the state and I am proud to call him a fellow community member, American and friend. I know that many community members are grateful for his service and salute him as he retires and moves onto the next phase of his life.                          ____________________
