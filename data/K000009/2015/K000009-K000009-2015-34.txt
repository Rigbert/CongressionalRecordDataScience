Speaker, tonight I rise, as dean of the Ohio delegation, to bring to my colleagues' attention and those who are listening that one of our great Members of Congress from Ohio, Congressman Lou Stokes, who served so ably, with such dignity, with such acumen, and with such heart has been diagnosed with a very serious type of cancer. His days with us are numbered.  I know that many Members hold memories of Lou, and there will be many tributes paid to Congressman Louis Stokes of Ohio. Without question, his service was legendary, along with his brother, who became the first African American mayor in our country, the city of Cleveland.  If we look coast to coast, the people of Ohio are walking in prayer with the Stokes family now. If Congressman Stokes is listening, I hope he knows that the love of this House, the place to which he dedicated the best years of his life, are with him.  Thank you, Congressman Louis Stokes of Ohio, for what you have done for America, for the people of Ohio, and for the people of Cleveland. History will record the greatness of your service to others. We love you. We pray with you. We walk with you.                          ____________________
