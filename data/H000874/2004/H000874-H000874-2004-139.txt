Speaker, I thank the gentleman for that explanation, I suppose is the kindest adjective to apply. I appreciate the gentleman's observation. I will say that the gentleman treats gingerly the changing of opinions. That is, obviously, as the gentleman noted in his closing argument, the subject of debate and also subject to discussion that goes on on this floor, which is clearly appropriate.  But I will tell the gentleman that his party believed that the keeping of the votes open for an extended period of time, i.e. in excess of 20 minutes, was corrupt, and the Vice President said it was corrupt. The Vice President said it undermines civility. The Vice President, when he then had my job, minority whip, said that it was undemocratic.  The gentleman has indicated that we did, in fact, from time to time, keep the vote open for longer than 20 minutes. The gentleman is absolutely accurate. But we did not claim it was undemocratic, undermining civility or corrupt. It was the gentleman's side that claimed that.
