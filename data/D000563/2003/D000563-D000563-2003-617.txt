President, today I am introducing the Consumer and Small Business Energy Commission Act. I am pleased to have the support of the Senator from Michigan, Senator Stabenow, in introducing this legislation. This legislation will allow us to better understand the causes of energy price spikes from the consumer and small business perspectives, and better address this pressing issue.  The Consumer and Small Business Energy Commission Act would establish a Consumer and Small Business Energy Commission. The members would be appointed on a bipartisan basis by the Speaker and Minority Leader of the House and the Majority and Minority Leaders of the Senate, as well as the President. The Commission would be comprised of representatives of consumer groups, the energy industry, small businesses, and the Administration. The Commission will study the causes of energy price spikes and issue recommendations on how to avert price spikes in the future.  Sine 1990, residential heating oil, residential natural gas, commercial natural gas, industrial natural gas, and gasoline have all had significantly fluctuating prices. Gasoline price spikes have become commonplace in the Midwest. Escalating home heating and cooling bills have crippled family budgets in the Midwest and Northeast. Farmers and industries dependent on natural gas for the production of fertilizer and other chemical products have also suffered economically. Most recently, natural gas prices have skyrocketed and gasoline prices have shown little sign of falling from the historic highs of the past few months.  We need a comprehensive study of these problems. Some past studies have assessed the long-range supply and demand for energy product. The Federal Trade Commission studied gasoline price spikes in the Midwest, and Senator Levin has embarked on a series of hearings exploring gasoline pricing issues. Other studies have investigated narrow or specific abuses of market power in the energy industry, such as in California. The Consumer and Small Business Energy Commission will look at the entire picture, focusing on price fluctuations of all consumer energy products. The list of potential causes that need to be studied includes: insufficient inventories, supply disruptions, refinery capacity limits, insufficient infrastructure, possible regulation problems, flawed deregulation, excessive consumption, over-reliance on foreign supplies, insufficient investment in research and development of alternative sources, opportunistic behavior by energy companies, and abuse of market power.  We need to give consumers and small businesses a voice. When consumers go to pay their grocery bills, or their tuition bills, or even their residential electricity bills in most states, and when small businesses go to pay for raw materials, prices are fairly predictable. But when they go to pay for their heating and cooling, natural gas, or gasoline, families and businesses face the frustrating reality of wild price swings.  We need to bring consumers and small businesses to the table together with representatives of the energy industry and government. We need these groups to work collectively, and to consider the range of possible causes of energy price spikes.  A measure very similar to this bill enjoyed strong, bipartisan support last year, and passed as an amendment to the Senate energy bill by a vote of 69-30. The minor changes to this bill include adding direct representation of small businesses to the Commission, expanding the participation of Administration representatives in the study phase, and establishing an Executive Committee to expedite the issuance of the final report, which will include recommendations.  By enacting the Consumer and Small Business Energy Commission Act, we will be able to better understand the causes of energy price spikes and hopefully avert them in the future. I urge my colleagues to join me as a cosponsor of this important legislation. I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be printed in the Record.  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the Record, as follows:                                S. 1192       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of      the United States of America in Congress assembled,     SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.       This Act may be cited as the ``Consumer and Small Business      Energy Commission Act of 2003''.     SEC. 2. FINDINGS.       Congress finds that--       (1) there have been several sharp increases since 1990 in      the price of electricity, gasoline, home heating oil, natural      gas, and propane in the United States;       (2) recent examples of such increases include--       (A) unusually high gasoline prices that are at least partly      attributable to global politics;       (B) electricity price spikes during the California energy      crisis of 2001; and       (C) the Midwest gasoline price spikes in spring 2001;       (3) shifts in energy regulation, including the allowance of      greater flexibility in competition and trading, have affected      price stability and consumers in ways that are not fully      understood;       (4) price spikes undermine the ability of low-income      families, the elderly, and small businesses (including      farmers and other agricultural producers) to afford essential      energy services and products;       (5) energy price spikes can exacerbate a weak economy by      creating uncertainties that discourage investment, growth,      and other activities that contribute to a strong economy;       (6) the Department of Energy has determined that the      economy would be likely to perform better with stable or      predictable energy prices;       (7) price spikes can be caused by many factors, including      insufficient inventories, supply disruptions, refinery      capacity limits, insufficient infrastructure, over-regulation      or under-regulation, flawed deregulation, excessive      consumption, over-reliance on foreign supplies, insufficient      research and development of alternative energy sources,      opportunistic behavior by energy companies, and abuses of      market power;       (8) consumers and small businesses have few options other      than to pay higher energy costs when prices spike, resulting      in reduced investment and slower economic growth and job      creation;       (9) the effect of price spikes, and possible responses to      price spikes, on consumers and small businesses should be      examined; and       (10) studies have examined price spikes of specific energy      products in specific contexts or for specific reasons, but no      study has examined price spikes comprehensively with a focus      on the impacts on consumers and small businesses.
