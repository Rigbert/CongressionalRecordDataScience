 I am seriously concerned that current minimum labor standards are in serious jeopardy.  I offered this amendment during the committee markup. Many of my colleagues have voted against the adoption of the amendment, said that they did not want H.R. 5 to apply to minimum labor standards. They were in agreement. I find it disingenuous that these same colleagues claims to support my amendment, yet voted against it. Let us make it clear today that we value the safety and well-being of working Americans. I urge all Members to support this amendment.
