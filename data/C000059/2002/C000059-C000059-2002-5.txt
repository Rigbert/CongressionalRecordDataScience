Speaker, I am pleased and honored to welcome Chaplain Fred Huscher as our guest chaplain in the House of Representatives today. Chaplain Huscher serves as the Riverside County Sheriff's Department chaplain and is visiting Washington, D.C. as a member of the FBI Chaplains Steering Committee.  Chaplain Huscher served honorably in the United States Air Force and then graduated with a degree of theology from Concordia Seminary in Springfield, Illinois, in 1964. He moved on to work as pastor in Oregon and Washington and obtained his Doctor of Ministry degree from Concordia Seminary in Fort Wayne, Indiana. He settled in California in 1973.  After serving as vice president of the Concordia University in Irvine, California, Chaplain Huscher was hired in 1997 to be department chaplain and peer support coordinator for over 3,000 personnel of the Riverside County Sheriff's Department, located in my congressional district. There he contributed greatly to the well-being and overall morale of the sheriff's department.  Some of his accomplishments include acting as a state chaplain for the Peace Officers Research Association of California, serving on a panel for the California Department of Justice Commission on Peace Officer Standards and Training, and serving as the FBI chaplain for Los Angeles Field Office and the Riverside Resident Agency.  Chaplain Huscher's life has been marked by continual service and dedication to the word of God, his community, and his country. It is my distinct pleasure to welcome him to Washington today and thank him on behalf of the United States House of Representatives for our opening prayer.                          ____________________
