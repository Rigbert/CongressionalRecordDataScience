But I hope there are Senators in this body who will do town meetings. I expect there probably are some. I think they are the most advantageous thing we could possibly do in rural States like mine and, I think, like the distinguished Presiding Officer's State. I do not think either one of us would ever come back here if we were not willing to do them. I think that is the experience of most Senators.  I yield the floor.
