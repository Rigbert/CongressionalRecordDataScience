Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.  I thank the gentleman for his comments and especially the gentleman from Minnesota (Mr. Oberstar) for his comments. I can assure him there will not be any less out of this conference than we passed in the House, and I am praying that there will be more.  It is ironic that when we meet with the other side of the aisle, I know I am not supposed to mention that, I want their number, and we are suggesting that maybe their number is correct, but I am faced with a very difficult task now of bringing a third party into this agreement; and I am not giving up on this legislation. I think it is vitally important for the Nation.  I think if we stand together shoulder to shoulder that we will eventually prevail. If we do not, it will be a terrible disservice to this Nation as far as our transportation, not wants, but needs; and I want to stress that.  I believe, Mr. Speaker, that when I first came out 3 years ago for $375 billion I was correct then. I am more correct now, and I will be more correct in the future. It is a number that we need to solve this very serious problem. We all know, and anybody on this floor that has constituents knows, that the one issue we all share in common is not the necessary fear of terrorism. That is very serious in itself, but it is the constant problem of moving oneself, be it their children or himself or herself, to and from the home, to school or to work, and to receive goods on time, and we have to understand that; and the public is crying out, let us solve this problem, and they are willing to pay for it.  I have lost that battle now, but in the House bill my colleagues are well aware we have a reopening clause, and I am going to continue the pursue, and I am confident that the public finally will raise up and say let us fix it. This extension gives us some time. I am hoping we will not have to ask for another, but let us fix the problem of this transportation challenge we have in this Nation. Let us do it quicker than later.  Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.
