Of course they all want the support of everyone living in Iowa because the Iowacaucus is coming up pretty soon. I thought about that as they went to meet these Christian leaders in Iowa, just across the river from my home State of Illinois. I thought about how they had just left their discussions here in Washington, talking about Syrian refugees.  The most humbling humanitarian crisis in the world today is occurring in Syria. They have had a civil war which has gone on for years. Millions of people have been displaced and thousands have been killed. I met some of them just a few months ago when I went to Greece and saw these refugees streaming away from the camps in Syria trying to find a safe place. I can't imagine what it must be like for a husband to turn to his wife and say: We have to move. Pick up the kids. Whatever you can carry is all that we are taking. We are going to try to find a safe place to live.  I saw hundreds and thousands of them--families streaming out of this war-torn area. Very few of them have ever made it to the United States--about 2,000. Part of the reason is we have an elaborate, lengthy background check before anyone can be admitted as a refugee. In fact, it takes anywhere from 18 to 24 months of waiting to see if you might legally become a refugee in the United States of America.  Well, these Republican Presidential candidates and 25 Governors have said: We don't want any Syrian refugees. We are not going to allow them to come to the United States during a period of a ``pause''--as some say. Others have taken more extreme positions. It is hard to imagine. If our goal is to keep Americans safe, why are these Republican candidates focusing on Syrian refugees? You see, since we have allowed about 2,000 refugees into the United States over the last 4 years, not one single Syrian refugee has been arrested and accused of terrorist activity--not one. After a lengthy background check, we believe we have done everything humanly possible to keep those away who would be any danger to our country.  I met some of those Syrian refugees who have made it here, in the city of Chicago. If you think they are terrorist threats to the United States, for goodness' sake, take a few minutes and sit down and talk to them and hear their stories of how their families went through extreme hardships--some of them with children who were being killed in Syria during the war--and as they fled with the clothes on their backs, they appealed to the United States to be allowed to come here as refugees and then waited up to 2 years to go through every one of the possible background checks before they finally made it.  What happens when they get here? Well, initially they need some help. Many of them don't speak English very well. Some of them are not financially ready to take care of themselves. But do you know what happens after a few months? They find a place, go to work, and join a long parade of those who have come to the United States as refugees and called it home. That includes 400,000 Vietnamese refugees who came to the United States and are now a great part of our country. It includes 650,000 Cuban refugees who came to the United States, escaping Castro. Included in those 650,000 refugees were the fathers of two U.S. Senators, one of whom is running for President of the United States. They came to the United States and made an important contribution to the Senate and our Nation--refugees. I heard one of them say: Well, it was different then. We are dealing with terrorism today.  Really? What were we dealing with when we accepted Cuban refugees? We were dealing with a Communist regime in Cuba that was friendly with the Soviet Union, which had nuclear weapons pointed at the United States, and we were accepting refugees from that country. I am glad we did. We were living in a very dangerous time when they were accepted, and on balance we found that history has proven that those refugees from Cuba have become an important part of the United States.  We accepted over 200,000 Soviet Jews who were being persecuted in that country and wanted to come to the United States so that they could practice their religion freely. In my hometown of Springfield, IL, the synagogues opened their doors and said: We will sponsor these families as they come to our Midwestern community. We brought refugees from the Soviet Union in, and they became part of the United States.  The story is told over and over again. Yet Republican Presidential nominees and Governors describe refugees as just terrorists on the run. They say they are not carefully screened and are still allowed in the United States. That is the way they describe it. It is not true. We know it is not true.  When I consider those Republican Presidential nominees going to Iowa to pose for holy pictures with religious leaders after they said we would exclude these poor people who are simply trying to find a safe place for their families, it is hard to imagine.  This morning's New York Times tells a totally different story. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that this article in the New York Times be printed in the Record.  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in the Record, as follows:                [From the New York Times, Nov. 17, 2015] A Manhattan Hardware Store Welcomes Refugees as Governors Vow To Shut                                 Them Out                             (By Jim Dwyer)       Chris Christie of New Jersey and at least 25 other      governors have said they do not want Syrian refugees to come      to their states.       Then again, there is Wankel's, a family-owned hardware      store that opened on the Upper East Side of Manhattan in the      19th century. For decades, it has hired people who came to      the United States fleeing violence and persecution.       ``People coming from really bad situations, trying to make      a better life in America,'' said Sean Wankel, 32, vice      president of Wankel's. ``Or a life.''       The refugees come to Wankel's through resettlement agencies      like Catholic Charities or the International Rescue Committee      and stay for a few months or years as they get their bearings      in a new world. On a wall map, colored pins mark the three      dozen countries from which the Wankel workers have come.       Felix Royce, 39, started in the store two months ago. Like      many before him, he is new to retail work; in Nigeria, he had      been a pastor and an author. He said the picture on his book      jacket made him a target of the Boko Haram, a murderous sect      of anti-Western Islamists who rose in a swamp of official      corruption and violence. Among Boko Haram's infamous      atrocities was the kidnapping of scores of schoolgirls in      2014.       ``They organize mock street fights and send little kids      with suicide bombs,'' Mr. Royce said. ``ISIS is more sensible      than Boko Haram. You would have insiders, police officers and      politicians who collaborate with the Boko Haram. You didn't      know who to trust.''       In fear of his life, he said, he made his way to Houston      and applied for asylum, appearing without a lawyer three      times in front of immigration judges before being formally      admitted to the United States. He, his wife and their two      children now live in the Bronx, aided by the International      Rescue Committee.       ``I am sitting here,'' he said, ``trying to put my life      together. We are just trying to find our feet.''       Mr. Royce said he had been closely following the news of      the attacks in Paris on Friday evening by bombers and gunmen      connected to the Islamic State, also called ISIS or ISIL.       A tiny fraction of the refugees leaving Syria have been      permitted into the United States--fewer than nine a week      between Oct. 1, 2011, and Sept. 30 of this year, a total of      1,854--as an estimated four million people fled the      deteriorating nation. President Obama said the United States      would accept 10,000 refugees from Syria in the coming fiscal      year. Republicans in Congress and in statehouses are      objecting, saying that terrorists like those involved in the      Paris attacks could camouflage themselves in the stream of      legitimate refugees.       Representative Paul D. Ryan, Republican of Wisconsin, the      newly inaugurated House speaker, called for a ``pause'' in      the refugee resettlement program. Mr. Christie, seeking the      Republican presidential nomination, released a letter he sent      to the president.       ``I write to inform you that I will not accept any refugees      from Syria in the wake of the deadly terrorist attack in      Paris,'' he wrote, saying federal screening procedures were      inadequate. ``Neither you nor any federal official can      guarantee that Syrian refugees will not be part of any      terroristic activity.''       New Yorkers might imagine police barricades being set up      around the World Trade Center on Sept. 11, 2001, to prevent      people from fleeing the collapsing towers because no one      could guarantee they would not be part of any future      terroristic activity.       It is not clear whether Mr. Christie or any other governor      can refuse to ``accept'' refugees. As a practical matter, New      Jersey does not have border controls, and probably could not      set up traffic lanes for citizenship papers at places like      the Lincoln Tunnel.       Other Republican candidates, including Ted Cruz and Jeb      Bush, said they would permit Christian refugees from Syria,      but not Muslims.       At the hardware store where he has found work, in a city      where he and his family have taken refuge, Mr. Royce was      polite in assessing the proposed restrictions.       ``Some people are saying, let them be, let them stay      there,'' he said. ``I wouldn't subscribe to that. There are      innocent ones out there. This would mean there is no hope for      them. If you screen, there are good ones among the bad.      Everyone from Syria is not from ISIS. If you leave everybody,      ISIS will take advantage of them.''       Mr. Wankel was asked if his business had room for Syrian      refugees.       ``Certainly,'' he said. ``If they are coming through the      International Rescue Committee or Catholic Charities, I'd do      it. They have a tough life. If I was in Syria, I'd want to      get the heck out.''
