President, let me first say to my friend from Alabama that as to the last comment he made about whether at the last minute someone may come along and try to torpedo this, I suspect that might be the case. It is like when I had the amendment to make English our national language--and 89 percent of the American people were for it; 70 percent of the Hispanics were for it--and yet some of the liberals in this Chamber were catering to La Raza, an extremist group, in trying to torpedo what we are doing, and merely doing what 51 other countries have done, making English the official language.  I also want to say to my friend from Alabama, I have never been prouder to serve on the Armed Services Committee with any member more than I am to serve with him. It was you and seven other of the Republicans who tried from the very beginning to give the President everything he needed to interrogate these people, to prosecute these people, and to get as much human intelligence as possible to save American lives. I thank the Senator publicly for standing up as one of all nine of us.
