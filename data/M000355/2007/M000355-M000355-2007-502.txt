 President, let me just note the remarks of the majority leader that there are at least three amendments, hopefully, we can vote on today: the pending Cochran amendment; there will be a minimum wage amendment, on which Senator Grassley and Senator Baucus are working; and the so-called county payments amendment, which also has bipartisan support, which was referred to by Senator Reid. It would be my hope that we could vote on all of those today. We have, as the majority leader indicated, the cloture motion vote in the morning, so I think it would be good to dispose of those three for sure today, if not others.  Mr. President, I yield the floor.                          ____________________
