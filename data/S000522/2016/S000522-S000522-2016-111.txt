Thank you so much for those comments. I couldn't agree more that the megatrend in society is to embrace the unborn. It is the ultrasound technology--the window to the womb--that has made the difference. So thank you for your outstanding comments.  I would like to now yield to the gentleman from Ohio, Steve Chabot, the prime sponsor of the partial-birth abortion ban. It is one of the most hideous methods of abortion and has awakened many Americans to the violence that is inherent in every abortion. Steve Chabot is the man who wrote that law.
