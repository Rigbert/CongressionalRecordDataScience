President, before giving all the remaining time to Senator Mikulski, I would like to make one point. In the CRS report to which the Senator referred, essentially he failed to note a footnote that says essentially that it does not appear that any evidence has been produced of actual violations of these provisions by Bull's Eye in the case at hand.  If you assume they violated the law, then, of course, the exemption applies. The facts we know now suggest they knew nothing about the disappearance of the weapons, and this legislation will bar the individuals from court.  I add one simple point. Even if we are slightly in doubt debating this issue, we should support Senator Mikulski's amendment which puts them in court.  I yield the remaining time to Senator Mikulski.
