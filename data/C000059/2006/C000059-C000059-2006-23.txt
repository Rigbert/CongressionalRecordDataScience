Speaker, H. Res. 541 commends the great American ingenuity and level of excellence represented by our National Laboratories, particularly the National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST), whose work is so consistently stellar that it is often taken for granted.  American John Hall, who is one of the three scientists sharing the Nobel Prize for Physics, is the third NIST scientist to win a Nobel Prize. He is sharing the Prize for Physics with American Roy J. Glauber and German Theodor W. Haensch. Their studies reversed the earlier belief that the quantum theory of the behavior of particles did not describe the behavior of particles of light. These scientists, in fact, have changed the modern understanding of the behavior of light. Their discoveries could allow better GPS systems, better space navigation, and even better digital animation.  The 2005 Nobel Prize for Chemistry was won by American Robert H. Grubbs, from Southern California's California Institute of Technology, American Richard R. Schrock, and Frenchman Yves Chauvin. They made great breakthroughs in their work with olefin metathesis. This is a chemical reaction describing the changing of bonds between atoms.  Their work has great commercial potential in areas like pharmaceuticals, the biotechnology industry, and the foodstuff industry. The great work that these scientists produce contributes to our competitiveness and to our great standard of living.  I want to commend all of these outstanding scientists for their contributions to physics and chemistry and to the Royal Swedish Academy of Scientists for their recognition of their achievements, and to NIST and its laboratories who have supported research that strengthens our global competitiveness through the development of groundbreaking technologies.
