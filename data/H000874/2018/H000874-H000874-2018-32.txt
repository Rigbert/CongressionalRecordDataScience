Speaker, I yield to my friend.  Mr. McCARTHY. Mr. Speaker, the gentleman has already voted for funding of the wall. So my question is: Democrats had to vote for it with 60, the gentleman voted for it on here to fund the wall. Is the gentleman now saying he does not want to fund any of the wall going forward?
