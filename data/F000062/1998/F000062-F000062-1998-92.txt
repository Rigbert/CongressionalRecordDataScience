  Mr. President, this amendment is sent to the desk on behalf of Senator Boxer and myself. Essentially, what this amendment would do is authorize the U.S. Secretary of Education to award, on a case-by-case basis, Pell grants for students taking a 5th year of postbaccalaureate teacher education courses in order to get a teaching credential in a State that requires a 5th year.  This was brought to my attention, Mr. President, by the new chancellor of the California State University, Dr. Charles B. Reed. I want to just read an opening paragraph.       When I came to the California State University in March of      this year, I established as a top system priority      strengthening and improving the quality of our teacher      preparation programs. Over the next decade, in California      alone, we will need an additional 250,000 new K-12 classroom      teachers. In addition to our changing demographics, the      shortage of teachers in California is particularly acute due      to the State's classroom size reduction initiative. . . .  The Governor of our State has quite rightly determined that K through 3 should have class sizes of not more than 20 students per teacher. This is a real improvement and, of course, it will mean that more teachers will be necessary in the future. Additionally, there is an extraordinarily large number of teachers who are due to retire over the next 10 to 20 years.  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to have that letter printed in the Record at the end of my statement.
