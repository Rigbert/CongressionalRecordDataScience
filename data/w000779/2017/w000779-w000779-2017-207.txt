President, before he leaves the floor, I want to commend my colleague from Connecticut for a very thoughtful speech. I think he has made the case that the challenge ahead is really a two-part drill--first, to stop something that is especially ill advised, and second, to then move to a better way that really focuses on sunlight and bipartisanship. So I thank my colleague for his very thoughtful comments.                     Thinking About Senator McCain  Mr. President, I am here to speak about healthcare, but before I turn to that subject, I want to spend a few minutes talking about our wonderful colleague John McCain.  Some of the most satisfying moments I have had in public life have been serving with John McCain. When I came to the U.S. Senate--Oregon's first new U.S. Senator in almost 30 years--I had the honor of being chosen to serve on the Senate Commerce Committee, which was chaired by John McCain. And what an exhilarating way to begin serving in the Senate. We tackled big, meaty, important issues of the future--the question of multiple and discriminatory taxes on internet commerce. We focused, for example, on Enron and what went wrong there when so many consumers were ripped off. We dug into consumer rights. John McCain was an early advocate for saying that if you rode on an airplane, it didn't mean you ought to sacrifice basic consumer rights, and some of those same issues are getting more attention today.  Then, of course, we built on this floor the Y2K measure. When everybody was so concerned about what would happen at that time, Senator McCain gave me the honor of being his Democratic partner in putting together a bill. We had the benefit of incredible work from the private sector and first responders and smarter Federal policies. We all know that some of the calamitous predictions about Y2K didn't come to pass.  John McCain did some extraordinary work at that time. As a young U.S. Senator, what a thrill it was to be able to be involved with a real American hero on some of those first experiences I had in the Senate.  As we begin to absorb the news of last night, what struck me is that now we are counting on John McCain's legendary strength to give cancer its toughest fight ever--toughest fight ever.  I just wanted to come to the floor today and say we are rooting for you, dear friend. We are rooting for you and Cindy and your wonderful family, and we are thinking about you this afternoon.                               Healthcare  Mr. President, it is my sense that if you thought the TrumpCare debate in the Senate had met its end on Tuesday, it is pretty obvious you ought to be thinking again. The zombie stirs once more.  The latest attempt by the majority to cobble together 50 votes, according to reports, comes down to waving a $200 billion slush fund in front of Senators from States that expanded Medicaid under the Affordable Care Act.  As the ranking Democrat on the Senate Finance Committee, I am very pleased that the Presiding Officer joined the committee this year. We have studied this one-time slush fund, and the theory, of course, is that it is supposed to be enticing enough for a Senator to vote for a bill that still slashes Medicaid to the bone.  Let's be realistic about what the slush fund represents in the context ofthe overall plan. Senate Republicans are steering tens of millions of Americans toward a cliff and are offering the world's smallest pillow to break the fall.  Before I go further on the specifics of what the majority has on offer, I want to step back and take a look at what the American people have been subjected to over the course of this debate. The reason I want to do this is that, even by Beltway standards here in Washington, this is the absolute worst of this city.  In the crusade to repeal the Affordable Care Act, the ACA, there has been the AHCA--the House TrumpCare bill. That is the one that earned the big victory ceremony with the President of the United States in the Rose Garden. Next, we had the BCRA--the Senate TrumpCare bill. Then, there was a second version of the BCRA. Then, along came something called the ORRA, the bill I have called ``repeal and ruin,'' which got its start back in 2015. Then, this morning, the public got a look at a third version of the BCRA. My sense is, if you are having coffee in Coos Bay, OR, or in Roseburg over lunch or something like that, your head is going to be spinning as you hear this news.  I also want to make sure folks know about the strategy that has come out of the White House over the last few days. The President first endorsed the Senate's TrumpCare bill, but then it was repeal only. Then, while the country watched the administration sabotage the Affordable Care Act, the President said that everybody ought to just sit back and watch what happens. Then it was back to calling for the Senate majority to pass TrumpCare.  Nobody in this Chamber, with the possible exception of Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell, can claim to really know what is coming down the pike on American healthcare. So with the health and well-being of hundreds of millions of Americans at stake, this shadowy, garbled, and wretched process really just leaves your jaw on the floor.  Senate Republicans seem to be speeding toward a vote on something. As I mentioned, there is the prospect of this $200 billion slush fund being dangled out there to help round up votes. My sense is that this slush fund is of zero consolation to the millions of Americans who live in States that didn't expand Medicaid. It is of zero consolation to the tens of millions of middle-class families who are going to have their tax cuts or healthcare ripped away and see their premiums skyrocket. It will be of zero consolation to middle-class families who are panicked over whether they are going to be able to take care of elderly parents and grandparents when long-term care through Medicaid is cut.  Make no mistake about what this slush fund really does; it just delays a little bit of the pain for a short time in States that expanded Medicaid. But the slush fund is going to run dry. That is a fact. State budgets are going to get hit like a wrecking ball. That is the reason so many Governors are so unhappy with what is on offer.  There is no escaping the consequences of whatever the Senate passes. If you had objections to TrumpCare or a repeal-only bill yesterday, this doesn't change a thing.  A few hours ago, the nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office--for folks who don't follow the lingo and CBO, those are our nonpartisan umpires. They put out an analysis of the third version of the Senate Republican healthcare bill. If you were hoping that was the charm, the news doesn't exactly help your cause.  The CBO found that it is still going to send premiums through the roof. The new version is going to kick 22 million Americans off their healthcare. It is still going to make healthcare unaffordable for millions of Americans with preexisting conditions. That is especially troubling to me--and I know the Presiding Officer is very interested in the policy foundations of these big issues. Before the Presiding Officer came to this body, I worked with one of our former colleagues, and we put together what is still the only comprehensive bipartisan health reform--seven Democrats, seven Republicans--that has been introduced in this body. One of the priorities that those Senators--and some of those colleagues on the other side of the aisle are still here; they were cosponsors of this bill, and many of the Democratic sponsors are still here. There was bipartisan agreement that there should be an airtight, loophole-free commitment to protecting people with preexisting conditions. As I said, seven Democrats, seven Republicans signed off on that bill. A number of them from both sides still serve in the U.S. Senate today.  Now what is being discussed is an approach that would make healthcare unaffordable for millions of people with preexisting conditions, really taking a big step back--and I have heard my colleague speak about this, commenting on TV shows and the like--toward the days when healthcare in America was for the healthy and the wealthy. That is what you get if you don't have airtight protections for those with preexisting conditions, if you don't have what we had in our original bill by seven Democrats, seven Republicans--airtight protections, loophole-free protections for those with preexisting conditions. If you don't have it, you are marching back to the days when healthcare was for the healthy and wealthy, where you could not move to another job if you got a great opportunity because you had a preexisting condition. You were immobilized. That is where this is going with the proposal to make healthcare unaffordable for millions of people with preexisting conditions, turning back the clock, moving away from what has strong bipartisan support in this Chamber with Senators on both sides who are still here.  For those who care about the affordability of health coverage, there is a statistic that really leaves you without words. Under the Senate Republican bill, in 2026, a middle-aged American who brings home $26,500 annually will face a deductible of $13,000--$13,000. If you are watching this, remember that figure the next time you hear that the Senate Republican bill lowers costs or puts the patient at the center of care. If this bill becomes law, that individual with a $13,000 deductible is one bad injury or diagnosis away from personal bankruptcy. How does that figure compare to the system on the books today, you might ask? Under the Affordable Care Act, that same individual's deductible is $800.  The other option being put forward by Senate Republican leaders is a repeal-only strategy, and they claim it would have a 2-year transition. But the numbers from the Congressional Budget Office make clear that the idea of a transition after a repeal bill passes is a fantasy.  ``Repeal and run'' means that 17 million Americans lose coverage in the first year; 32 million Americans lose coverage within a decade; premiums in private market plans double. It is easy to see why. My colleague in the Chair, the Presiding Officer, knows so well about the signals that are sent to the private marketplace; we are talking about the marketplace. If you are pouring gasoline on the fires of uncertainty in the private insurance sector and people can't plan and they can't calculate, what will happen during this 2-year transition? You are going to have bedlam in the marketplace. It is a prescription for trouble, and premiums and private market plans will double.  The numbers I am talking about are real lives. I was the director of the Gray Panthers senior citizens group for almost 7 years before I was elected to the Congress. This is my background. As I started to see government reports and the like, I came to realize that those reports--all those facts and figures on pieces of paper, long sheets of paper, figure after figure--are not really what this debate is all about. This is a debate about people, about their hopes and aspirations and what they want for the future. Families are worried, for example, about how they are going to pay for the care of an older parent. I think about those seniors I met as director of the Gray Panthers. They did nothing wrong. They scrimped and saved, and they didn't go on the special vacation. They didn't buy the boat. They did everything right. They educated their kids and tried to sock away a little money. What we know is, growing old in America is expensive. In spite of being careful about costs all their lives, when a spouse needed extra care or they had early onset of healthcare problems, they went through all the money they saved. Then they needed Medicaid.  Medicaid now picks up the costs of two out of three nursing home beds inAmerica. What is not known is very often seniors need not just that care, but they need home and community-based care. They need a continuum of services so they get the right kind of care at the right time.  They are looking at this bill. They are saying this is going to make my prospects for being able to afford care--whether it is nursing homes, home and community-based services--an awful lot harder to figure out in the days ahead.  We have young people who have been through cancer scares. We have single parents who work multiple jobs to put food on the table. This is what I am hearing about at home. When I had the good fortune of being chosen Oregon's first new Senator in almost 30 years, I made a pledge that I would have an open meeting, open to everybody in every one of my State's counties. We have 36 counties in Oregon.  This year, so far, I have had 54 open-to-all town meetings. Each one of them lasts 90 minutes. There are no speeches. People say what they want. They ask a question. It is the way the Founding Fathers wanted it to be. They are educating me, and I am trying to respond. I am trying to take back to Washington, DC, which often strikes them as a logic-free zone--I am trying to take their thoughts back to Washington, DC. Frankly, my highest priority has been to find common ground with people of common sense on the Finance Committee, especially in the healthcare area, because long ago I decided if you and your loved ones don't have your health, nothing else really matters.  At those 54 town meetings--they have been in counties where Donald Trump won by large numbers or Hillary Clinton won by large numbers--each one of those meetings has been dominated by the fears of Americans of all walks of life, of all political philosophies worried about what is going to happen to their healthcare.  Frankly, their worry seems to be just as great in rural communities that President Trump won by large majorities because Medicaid expansion in my State has been enormously helpful. So many Oregon communities, under 10,000 in population, have been able to use Medicaid expansion at a hospital to maybe hire another person. It has really been a lifeline. They have an awful lot of people between 55 and 64. They are going to be charged five times as much as young people here, and they are going to get fewer tax credits to deal with it.  In all of these counties--counties won by Donald Trump, counties won by Hillary Clinton--fear about healthcare has been front and center. People are fearful and obviously would like some clarity, some sense of what is coming next.  One of our colleagues whom I do a lot of work with, Senator Thune--a member of the Finance Committee and his party's leadership--spoke to a reporter a little bit ago. He couldn't say what the Senate would take up, if the first procedural vote passes next week, whether it would be TrumpCare or a straight repeal bill.  My sense is, everybody is being asked to walk into this abyss on healthcare but particularly colleagues on the other side of the aisle. To be in the dark about what is on offer a few days before a vote that affects hundreds of millions of Americans, one-sixth of the American economy--for them to be in the dark, someone like myself, the ranking Democrat on the Senate Finance Committee that has jurisdiction over Medicare and Medicaid and tax credits, strikes me as very odd, even by the standards of the beltway.  The American people are now left guessing about what comes next. The only guarantee, should the first procedural vote succeed, is that both options Senate Republican leaders put on the table are going to raise premiums, make care unaffordable for those with preexisting conditions, and leave tens of millions of Americans without health coverage.  I want to repeat a message that I and other Democratic Senators have been delivering for days. The choice between TrumpCare and straight repeal of the Affordable Care Act is false. Nobody is being forced to choose between calamity and disaster.  Democrats and Republicans absolutely can work together on the healthcare challenges facing the country. As soon as there is a willingness to drop this our-way-or-the-highway approach--this partisan approach known as reconciliation--there will be a good-faith effort on our side to find common ground.  I heard enough of the back-and-forth in this debate to know there is a bipartisan interest; for example, in flexibility for States. I know the President of the Senate is especially interested in this issue--flexibility for the States. He has given it a lot of thought. I want him to know I am always open to talking to him about this issue.  In the bill I described earlier--seven Democrats, seven Republicans--we had a special section which became law in the Affordable Care Act that in effect provided for what are called innovation waivers. The theory--and I am sure my colleague in the Chair has been thinking about these issues as well--is based on the idea we both have heard for years, conservatives have said, if those folks in Washington will just give us the freedom, we can find better ways to cover people, hold down the costs, and make what works in Louisiana work for us, and folks in Oregon can pursue what works for folks in Oregon.  I said, at the time, that every single bill that I would be part of in this debate about fixing American healthcare would have a provision that would respond to this argument that the States are the laboratories of democracy. We would have a provision that would allow considerable flexibility for States to take their own approaches.  I continue to feel very strongly about it. I wrote an entire section of my comprehensive bill to give States flexibility, and fortunately it was included in the Affordable Care Act. There ought to be room to work on these kinds of issues, State flexibility. There ought to be room to work on a bipartisan basis with respect to bringing down prescription drug costs.  I have indicated to the President of the Senate, I think the lack of transparency in the pharmaceutical market has really been a major factor in the reason that our people get hammered by escalating drug prices.  We have heard for so long that some of the middlemen--they are called pharmaceutical benefit managers. They came into being a few years ago. They said: We will negotiate for businesses or States or labor unions. We will negotiate a better deal for the consumer.  Consumers said: Hey, we will see that in our pocketbook. At home we would see that at a pharmacy, at Fred Meyer or Rite Aid or Walgreens or any of our pharmacies. These are all big pharmacies around the country. Right now, as of this afternoon, we don't know what these middlemen put in their pocket and what they put in our pocket.  There ought to be an opportunity to find common ground. I think there ought to be a chance for Democrats and Republicans to work together on approaches like my SPIKE bill, which says that when a big pharmaceutical company wants to drive up the prices, they should have to publicly justify why they are doing so.  There ought to be ways for Democrats and Republicans to work together and bring down prescription drug costs. There certainly is bipartisan interest in getting more competition and more consumers into the insurance markets. That means more predictability and certainty.  My view is, if you are serious about really helping to make the private insurance market robust, you have to stop this crusade to repeal the ACA. Insurers are making decisions right now. All eyes are on this body to bring certainty back to the marketplace.  The reality is, there is only a very short time with respect to 2018 premiums. I know there are Republican Senators who would like to tackle challenges on a bipartisan basis. The message my colleagues and I are sending on this side of the aisle is, there are a lot of open arms here. Instead of taking the partisan route and causing devastation in our healthcare system, let's work together to make healthcare better and more affordable for all Americans.  I consider that kind of bipartisan cooperation to be the premier challenge of my time in public service, to work with colleagues, common sense, looking for common ground. I have heard one after another of my colleagues on this side of the aisle state that in just the last few days.  Let us set aside this partisan our-way-or-the-highway approach, opt for the alternative, which is more sunshine and more bipartisanship. I will pledge to you everything in my power on the Senate Finance Committee to bring that about.  Mr. President, I yield the floor.  I suggest the absence of a quorum.
