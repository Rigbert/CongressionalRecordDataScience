Speaker, what we have done, in conjunction with discussions with Mr. Blunt, is, we expect no further votes after this vote. We will consider the balance of the bill tonight, and tomorrow we expect six votes. The first one will be a 15-minute vote and the balance will be 2-minute votes.  We wanted to announce that so Members can be prepared for that tomorrow.                          ____________________
