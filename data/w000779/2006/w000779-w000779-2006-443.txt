President, a headline in today's Wall Street Journal warns consumers that they will soon face a ``pay to play'' Internet where those businesses and consumers who want to continue to see equal content get equal treatment will have to pay more. Rather than let them continue to have the freedom to choose whatever content, applications and services they want, the big network operators want to control the content consumers can access. Allowing the big network operators to discriminate on the Net is bad news for consumers, small businesses, schools, libraries, nonprofits and any other user who enjoys their freedom of access.  That is why today I am proposing legislation that will codify the principle of network neutrality. I want consumers, small businesses and every other Internet user to continue to enjoy tomorrow the full array of content, service and applications they enjoy today.  My legislation, the Internet Non-Discrimination Act of 2006, will establish the principle of network neutrality by requiring the operators of the network to treat all content on the Internet equally. It will ensure transparency so that everyone can easily determine all rates, terms and conditions for the provision of any communications. Transparency coupled with a complaint process before the Federal Communications Commission will encourage compliance.  This legislation has been developed in consultation with a number of consumer groups and businesses, and I ask unanimous consent the text of the bill be printed in the Record.  There being no objection, the text of the bill was ordered to be printed in the Record, as follows:                                S. 2360       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of      the United States of America in Congress assembled,     SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.       This Act may be cited as the ``Internet Non-Discrimination      Act of 2006''.     SEC. 2. FINDINGS.       Congress finds the following:       (1) Since passage of the Telecommunications Act of 1996,      the Internet has grown robustly. Today, Americans are      changing how they access the Internet, moving from dial-up to      broadband for their home connections. According to the Pew      Internet and American Life Project, 72 percent of Americans      use the Internet and 59 percent of Americans with home      Internet have a high-speed Internet connection.       (2) Americans use the Internet for many daily activities.      Over 17 percent of Americans have sold something over the      Internet. Everyday, approximately 60,000,000 Americans use      search engines to get access to information. 80 percent of      Americans have looked online for health care information. In      growing numbers, Americans are using the Internet to place      phone calls, watch their favorite televisions shows or      movies, and play games.       (3) The growth of the Internet and its success are due in      large part to the freedom that has always existed on the      content and applications layer of the Internet. Innovation      has thrived on this layer, as anyone with a good idea has the      ability to access consumers. The continuation of this freedom      is essential for future innovation.       (4) Freedom on the content and applications layer has also      led to robust competition for retail goods for consumers.      Consumers can shop at thousands upon thousands of retailers      from their home computers, including small businesses located      miles away in other towns, States, and even countries.       (5) Such freedom is leading to the development of important      new entertainment offerings, on-demand video and movie      purchases, Internet Protocol television, and enhanced gaming      options. The entertainment options available in the future      will only be limited by the bandwidth that can be used and      the innovation of people all over the world.       (6) Despite the growth of the Internet and increased access      to the Internet for Americans, there is very little choice in      who provides them high-speed Internet access. According to an      April 2005 White Paper by Harold Feld and Gregory Rose, et.      al., entitled, ``Connecting the Public: The Truth About      Municipal Broadband'' only 2 percent of Americans get high-     speed Internet access from someone other than their local      phone company or cable provider. According to the Federal      Communications Commission, approximately 20 percent of      Americans do not have a high-speed Internet access provider      that offers them service.       (7) As more and more Americans get high-speed access to the      Internet without having much choice of who their provider      will be, it is important that Congress protect the freedom on      the Internet to ensure its continued success.
