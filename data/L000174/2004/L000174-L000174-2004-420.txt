President, I will take a moment.  I commend both the Republican and Democratic leaders for opening the Senate today. I was recollecting, as I came in, we had another majority leader from Tennessee, Howard Baker--the Democrat leader was Robert Byrd; both distinguished friends and colleagues--and there had been an explosive device put outside the Capitol one evening, something that could not be done today because there are changes in our security. But the majority leader recessed that evening--it was going to be a late-night session. We adjourned a little earlier than we anticipated because we had worked out something and needed time for drafting and worked out a logjam we had, and there was an explosive device put out--and the distinguished Presiding Officer remembers this time very well because he was also serving here, as I was, at the time--blowing out both the Republican and Democratic cloakrooms.
