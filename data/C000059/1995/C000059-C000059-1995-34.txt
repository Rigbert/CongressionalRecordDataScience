Speaker, today I am introducing the Federal Oil and Gas Royalty Simplification and Fairness Act of 1995. This bill amends the Federal Oil and Gas Royalty Management Act with respect to leases of Federal lands and the Outer Continental Shelf [OCS], but does not affect leases on Indian lands. the goal of my legislation is to establish certainty in procedural matters for royalty payors in their dealings with the Department of the Interior, eliminate certain burdensome reporting requirements and simplify others so as to streamline the royalty management program and provide for the equitable collection of royalties.  Approximately 80 percent of the nearly $1 billion annual Federal onshore mineral revenues are generated from oil and gas royalties, as is nearly all of the $3 billion collected annually from OCS lessees. Obviously, the Nation benefits from this revenue stream and it's in our best interest to maintain a royalty system that encourages private industry to participate in onshore and offshore oil and gas development, where appropriate.  But, Mr. Speaker, a serious shortcoming for the industry today is that effectively there is no statute of limitations concerning the Federal Government's auditing of royalty payments. This means that an oil and gas producer's books are never closed out and the Department of the Interior may inquire into royalties owed on production from many decades ago. While the DOI agency charged with such auditing, the Minerals Management Service [MMS], has worked toward a policy of closing out audits within a 6-year period, the Government is not now statutorily required to meet that goal. The Fairness Act would do so prospectively, that is, for production from the date of enactment forward the Secretary of the Interior would be barred from bringing actions against lessees 6 years after the obligation to pay royalty accrues. Of course, the time limitation does not run where fraud is alleged, nor when tolling agreements are reached by the parties.  Another inequitable provision of current law which the Simplification and Fairness Act addresses is the requirement that interest be paid by lessees who have underpaid their royalties, yet the Government does not pay interest on overpayments. My bill establishes reciprocity with respect to interest payments, but first requires a royalty payor--and the Secretary--to ``cross-net'' royalty overpayments against underpayments among all one's public domain or acquired lands leases within any State or collectively for OCS leases. This will effectively reduce interest obligations the Federal Government would owe on overpayments and provide the industry with a mechanism to simplify their procedures within each State in which they do business on Federal leases.  Other provisions of the Simplification and Fairness Act grant relief for small producers who pay royalty out-of-pocket, provide enforcement and compliance relief for producers of de minimis amounts of oil and gas, streamline onerous and costly reporting requirements and thereby reduce the Federal Government's cost of royalty accounting without loss of revenue to the U.S. Treasury nor to the States which share in the onshore mineral leasing revenues.  Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to cosponsor the Federal Oil and Gas Royalty Simplification and Fairness Act of 1995. Let's provide certainty for our domestic industry in its dealing with the Department of the Interior and establish an equitable royalty system for lessor and lessee alike.                          ____________________
