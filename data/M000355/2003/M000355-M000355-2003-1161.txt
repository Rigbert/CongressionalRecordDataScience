  The reason for that, obviously, is that we had known since the election what was going to happen and we were working long on it. We have known since November 5, 2002, what was going to happen. I have heard on the other side it was 6 weeks, but in fact there were 24 days after Senator Jeffords switched to get the resolution passed. But the chairmen switched almost immediately. I handed my gavel over to Senator Dodd, Senator Bennett handed his over, Senator Bond did; I believe everybody did, including Senator Kyl.  We have known now for 70 days who was going to be in the majority--70 days. It seems to this Senator that we have had adequate notice for quite some time who was going to be in the majority and yet we have killed a week in failing to address the people's business from last year because of an apparent unwillingness to recognize who is in the majority around here.
