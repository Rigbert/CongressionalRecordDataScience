Mr. Speaker, this week we will have the opportunity to right the wrong done to America's seniors only 2 years ago when President Clinton pushed through Congress--against the vote of every Republican--a tax package raising the tax on Social Security benefits.  The Clinton tax hike increased the financial burden on some 9 million middle-income seniors by an estimated $500 per year. And let us not forget that the Clinton tax package hit seniors in other ways as well, including the increased energy tax and increased Medicare premiums.  Furthermore, this was all laid on top of already inequitable circumstances such as the ``notch'' disparity and the Social Security earnings test. After years of service to their Nation as workers, soldiers, mothers and fathers, America's seniors hardly deserve this biased treatment in their retirement years.  It wasn't until the mid-1980's that the Federal Government began to tax seniors' Social Security benefits. At that time--and against my vote, I might add--Congress applied Federal income taxes to 50 percent of Social Security benefits for seniors earning $25,000 as individuals or $32,000 as couples. President Clinton increased to 85 percent the amount of income subject to taxation for seniors making only $34,000 a year.  The only message this conveys is that careful savings and planning for retirement do not pay off. Is this the message we want to send to American workers?  Furthermore, the Social Security tax is a clear violation of the pact with America's seniors which the Social Security Program represents. Seniors work hard all their life and have a substantial portion of their income taken from their pay check and placed in holding for their retirement as Social Security benefits. To tax this income when seniors collect it is no less than double taxation.  The Social Security tax should be eliminated. I encourage my colleagues to take this first step toward resolution and to support the repeal of the Clinton Social Security tax hike as included in H.R. 1215.                          ____________________
