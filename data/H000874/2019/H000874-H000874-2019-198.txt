Speaker, the defense bill passed this House with almost every Republican voting against it. It was a bill that provided $733 billion, a figure that the Joint Chiefs of Staff suggested publicly. It was a figure that I know personally was a figure that was deemed acceptable by the leadership of the authorizing committee and the appropriating committee on the Republican side. The rhetoric was totally partisan.  We have now made a deal, and we are now going to save defense because we did $5 billion more. The figure last year, of course, was somewhere around $700 billion, a little over.  I will tell my friend that we believe on our side of the aisle that the opposition to the defense bill was totally partisan, no attempt at bipartisanship. Yes, the Republicans had some success in getting bipartisan bills through. Why? Because we were prepared to vote in a bipartisan way.  That is the difference. We were prepared to vote in a bipartisan way. We were prepared to accept my friend's party was the majority.  Mr. Speaker, we understand when you are in the minority you work to get the best objective you think is possible. We did that, and the gentleman, Mr. Speaker, says that they got bipartisan bills done because Democrats voted for them, including me. But I know the number was an acceptable number, and it was a number suggested by the Joint Chiefs of Staff. Yet we heard rhetoric after rhetoric of how this was letting down the Defense Department.  What did they do? They made a deal, not $733 billion, $738 billion. My goodness, what an extraordinary difference. They voted against funding the men and women in uniform, funding operations, and funding overseas contingencies.  I hope that we get off this. If you want to talk bipartisan, act bipartisan, Mr. Speaker. Talk is cheap. It was clear that Democrats, in fact, when the Republicans were in the majority, did vote on a number of occasions, not every occasion, for bipartisanship. But you can't have bipartisanship if you don't introduce a bill.  Mr. Speaker, the Republicans have the majority in the United States Senate on the committee. They don't need 60 votes in the committee. They don't need 60 percent. They don't need two-thirds. All they need is a simple majority to pass a bill out of committee, as the gentleman pointed out when he said we did fund some pieces of government before. Why? Because we got bipartisan agreement.                              {time}  1230  And I have never seen, as I say, in three decades, the Senate fail to even introduce an appropriation bill prior to the end of July.  I hope the Senate will move with some degree of alacrity. I hope that we will get to agreement on these 12 bills. I hope that we will fund the government and not have a shutdown, as we had the last time. The first time it has ever happened in a new Congress where the government was shutdown--all over the wall--which a number of Republicans have said is not a useful thing to do.  I won't name them. I am sure the minority whip, the Republican whip,knows a lot of them. They served in this body. Some are chairman of committees over there now.  So I am hopeful that we will move together on the appropriations process and do our business, do it on time, as we have done here in the House so that the American people can be well-served.
