 President, finally, the amendment would send the wrong signal to the rest of the world about the Senate's intentions on climate change. It would suggest that we want to ignore the clear imperative to act, despite the efforts of the administration to motivate the international community in advance of the Copenhagen summit.  There is some concern also about small emitters. EPA is not planning to regulate small emitters. EPA Administrator Lisa Jackson has clearly stated on several occasions that the agency will not regulate small emitters. She said it in her confirmation hearings, she said it again at Senate budget hearings, and she reiterated that comment when she appeared before the Senate Interior Appropriations Subcommittee hearing on EPA's fiscal year 2010 budget just a few months ago.  In fact, Administrator Jackson has sent a draft deregulatory rule to the Office of Management and Budget for review which would establish clearly that all but the very largest sources of greenhouse gas will be preemptively exempted from the stationary source permitting requirements in the Clean Air Act.  She has no intention of regulating small sources that emit under 25,000 tons of carbon dioxide or any small farm.  Mr. President, 25,000 metric tons is a very high threshold. According to EPA, it is equivalent to the emissions from burning 131 trainloads of coal per year--these would be exempted--or burning 2.8 million gallons of gasoline annually.  The 25,000-ton threshold would exempt every small source, focusing only on 13,000 of the largest emitters in the United States.  Let me say that again. The 25,000-ton threshold which EPA intends to proceed with, and which my side-by-side amendment would have had as one of the two criteria, would exempt every small source, focusing only on the 13,000 largest emitters in the United States.  EPA intends to only regulate the largest facilities, and these facilities are, almost without exception, already regulated under the Clean Air Act for emissions of other pollutants such as soot, smog-forming nitrous oxides, or acid-rain-inducing sulfur dioxide.  Let me now explain why the Murkowski Amendment would impact the joint EPA-Department of Transportation rulemaking on automobile greenhouse gas emissions.  This rulemaking is of critical importance, and the regulation implementing this law was negotiated by the White House in cooperation with automakers, the States, and labor.  But according to a letter I received from EPA Administrator Lisa Jackson last night, the impact of the Murkowski amendment ``would be to make it impossible for the EPA to promulgate the light-duty vehicle greenhouse-gas emissions standards that the agency proposed on September 15, 2009.''  She writes:       Because of the way the Clean Air Act is written,      promulgation of the proposed light-duty vehicle rule will      automatically make carbon dioxide a pollutant subject to      regulation under the Clean Air Act for stationary sources, as      well as for light-duty vehicles. The only way that EPA could      comply with the prohibition in Senator Murkowski's amendment      would be to not promulgate the light-duty vehicle standards.  These standards are something Senator Snowe and I have worked on for at least 7 years now, beginning with the SUV loophole and ending with the bill that became law, would be totally undermined. By undermining the negotiated agreement between States, the amendment would also likely result in States moving forward with their own tailpipe emissions standards.  As I indicated before, in 2002 California enacted a landmark law to reduce tailpipe emissions standards by 30 percent for all new sedans, trucks, and SUVs by 2016.  I also stated that 14 other States--namely, Arizona, Connecticut, Florida, Maine, Maryland, Massachusetts, New Jersey, New Mexico, New York, Oregon, Pennsylvania, Rhode Island, Vermont, Washington, and the District of Columbia--have adopted or announced their intention to adopt California's greenhouse gas emissions controls.  The amendment would have been a major roadblock in efforts to improve fuel economy standards for vehicles.  I don't think we can bury our head in the sand when it comes to climate change.  I would like to conclude by reminding my colleagues that it makes no sense at this particular point in time to put on the floor a major amendment which well could have devastated both the EPA and any effort to get to cap-and-trade legislation when, in fact, the EPW Committee is struggling to write a comprehensive bill which has an opportunity to pass this body.  Again I say, if people do not want the Clean Air Act prevailing, then the only way you can do that is with a cap-and-trade bill. That is the way the committee of this body is proceeding. I believe it is the correct way.  I believe our Nation is in serious jeopardy, as is the rest of planet Earth, with global warming. I believe it is real. Just this week, the Journal Nature published a new paper that found rapid deterioration of the ice sheets on Greenland and Antarctica. Yesterday on this floor, I showed the deterioration in the Arctic. I showed the deterioration in Greenland. I showed the deterioration in the Chukchi Sea. I showed the deterioration off Barrow, AK. It is happening all over the world.  The Flat Earth Society cannot prevail. I think there is a real danger signal out there for planet Earth. We know we cannot reverse it. We know that greenhouse gases do not dissipate and go away after a period of time in the atmosphere. We now know these gases that began during the Industrial Revolution are still present in the atmosphere, and we know that the Earth is not immutable, that it can change. We look at other planets and we see that they have changed over the millennia. What we do here to protect our planet Earth for the next generations is so key and critical.  This discussion has to be joined in an appropriate way, and an appropriate way is when a cap-and-trade bill is produced by the Environment and Public Works Committee and the chairman of that committee is on this floor and the bill is open for amendments and there is a free flow of debate and discussion.  I believe the science is real. I pointed out yesterday we have a project in intelligence whereby the satellites are tracking deterioration in the ice shelves of the world. I hope to present more of that information when there is a bill on the Senate floor.  I ask unanimous consent to have printed in the Record Administrator Lisa Jackson's letter.  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in the Record, as follows:                                       United States Environmental                                            Protection Agency,                               Washington, DC, September 23, 2009.     Hon. Dianne Feinstein,     U.S. Senate,     Washington, DC.       Dear Senator Feinstein: Thank you for your letter about      Senator Lisa Murkowski's Amendment Number 2530 to H.R. 2996,      the Department of the Interior, Environment, and Related      Agencies Appropriations Act. As you noted in your letter,      Senator Murkowski's amendment would prohibit the      Environmental Protection Agency from using any funds made      available under the Act to take any action that would have      the effect of making carbon dioxide a pollutant subject to      regulation under the Clean Air Act for any source other than      a mobile source.       You asked me what the practical impact would be if Congress      enacted Senator Murkowski's amendment. Perhaps the most      striking impact would be to make it impossible for the      Environmental Protection Agency to promulgate the light-duty      vehicle greenhouse-gas emissions standards that the agency      proposed on September 15, 2009. Because of the way the Clean      Air Act is written, promulgation of the proposed light-duty      vehicle rule will automatically make carbon dioxide a      pollutant subject to regulation under the Clean Air Act for      stationary sources, as well as for light-duty vehicles. The      only way that EPA could comply with the prohibition in      Senator Murkowski's amendment would be to not promulgate the      light-duty vehicle standards.       As you know, promulgation of EPA's light-duty vehicle      greenhouse-gas emissions standards is an essential part of      the historic agreement that President Obama announced earlier      this year with the nation's auto-makers, the State of      California, the Department of Transportation, and EPA. That      agreement attracted broad, bi-partisan support. The joint      DOT-EPA standards are projected to save 1.8 billion barrels      of oil over the life of the program, which is twice the      amount of oil (crude oil and products) imported in 2008 from      the Persian Gulf countries, according to the Department of      Energy's Energy Information Administration Office.      Additionally, the standards are projected to help save      consumers more than $3,000 over the lifetime of a model year      2016 vehicle and reduce approximately 900 million metric tons      of greenhouse gas emissions. Enactment of Senator Murkowski's      amendment would pull the plug on those extraordinary      accomplishments.           Sincerely,                                                  Lisa P. Jackson,                                                    Administrator.                               Exhibit 1                                               September 24, 2009.     Hon. Dianne Feinstein,     U.S. Senate, Hart Senate Office Building, Washington, DC.       Dear Senator Feinstein: We are writing regarding Senator      Murkowski's Amendment Number 2530 to H.R. 2996, the      Department of the Interior, Environment, and Related Agencies      Appropriations Act. As manufacturers, we are sympathetic to      the thrust of Senator Murkowski's amendment that the      Congress--and not simply EPA acting under the provisions of      the current Clean Air Act--should determine how best to      reduce U.S. greenhouse gas emissions economy-wide.       However, the amendment raises additional issues that must      be considered where complicated and interconnected      environmental and legal issues are at stake. We are concerned      that due to the complex interactions among regulations under      the various sections of the Clean Air Act, the amendment may      impact significantly pending regulations in the mobile source      sector--despite language in the amendment that would appear      to leave the sector unaffected. In a letter to Senator      Feinstein dated September 23, Administrator Jackson stated      EPA's interpretation that the Murkowski amendment as filed      would ``make it impossible for the Environmental Protection      Agency to promulgate the light-duty vehicle greenhouse-gas      emissions standards that the agency proposed on September 15,      2009.''       While the author of the amendment appears not to intend      this outcome, we feel compelled to express our concerns. It      is critical that the national program for regulating      greenhouse gas emissions from autos be finalized early next      year. Failure to do so would subject automakers to a      patchwork of conflicting state and federal regulations.       Therefore, we respectfully oppose the adoption of the      Murkowski amendment as written to H.R. 2996.           Sincerely,     Dave McCurdy,       President & CEO, Alliance of Automobile Manufacturers.     Michael Stanton,       President & CEO, Association of International Automobile      Manufacturers.
