 We have come very close to a very modest number of amendments. My side would be more than happy to accept time agreements on all of the amendments. I want to second what the majority leader says, that I hope we can indeed work out an agreement for a modest number of amendments with time agreements and wrap up this bill because I certainly share his view that most Members support the underlying measure and the additions to which the majority leader has referred.
