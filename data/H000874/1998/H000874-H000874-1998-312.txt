Speaker, I enthusiastically rise to join my colleagues in praising the passage of legislation renaming the North/South Center at the University of Miami for my friend and our former colleague and Chairman of the House Foreign Affairs Committee, Dante B. Fascell. This legislation is well deserved. The North/South Center should bear his name, for he was its creator.  Dante, now 81 years old and living in Clearwater, Florida, served in the House for 38 years, from 1954 through his retirement in 1992, representing South Florida with dignity, reverence for his office, and the rare ability to please all the members of his diverse constituency. He was one of the most respected Members during the time he served in Congress, and I am pleased to have had the opportunity to work with him and to learn from him.  Known as an outstanding legislator and negotiator, Dante fine-tuned his interest in foreign affairs with his particular focus on Latin America and the Caribbean. He conceived of the idea for the North/South Center, a scholarly institution for the free exchange of views to promote understanding, cooperation and democracy in the region. This idea became reality in 1990. Importantly, ahead of his time, Dante had the clairvoyance to see the increased interdependence of the two hemispheres, and that trend's connection with the City of Miami.  The North/South Center at the University of Miami has turned Fascell's ideas into reality. The school plays an invaluable role in helping the Administration and federal agencies conduct American public policy, and is called upon frequently to present its views. Moreover, it provides research, public outreach, and cooperative study opportunities on a variety of timely issues, as well as education and training programs for scholars and others throughout the Western Hemisphere.  I applaud the decision of the University of Miami to rename the North/South Center in honor of Dante B. Fascell. It's new name will ensure that the contributions of this fine public servant to the common good of South Floridians, and the nation, will always be at the forefront of our minds.                          ____________________
