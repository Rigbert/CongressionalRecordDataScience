I look forward to working with him to respond to the challenges President Duterte's policies pose to our relations with his government, as we seek to continue our strategic cooperation with the Philippines.  Mr. President, on a separate but related matter, we are seeing another missed opportunity to reform the criminal justice system in Indonesia. President Joko Widodo took office in 2014 amid the hopes of many that he would improve on the country's history of human rights abuses. Instead, he reinstated the death penalty for drug trafficking, and the head of his government's antinarcotics agency recently expressed his approval of President Duterte's approach to combating illicit drugs. To the contrary, it is a serious mistake, and I urge President Joko to reverse course and focus on improving his police force and judicial system.  Any government that uses capital punishment risks taking innocent life. But it is a particularly egregious practice in a country like Indonesia, where executions are peddled as effective justice despite a weak judicial system that is vulnerable to abuse, and to the detriment of its reform--nor is torturing and burying those suspected of involvement in the drug trade effective law enforcement. It is an abuse of power, it prevents remedies to deeply flawed practices within the security forces, and it belies the legitimacy of the government.  We have a complex relationship with both Indonesia and the Philippines due to our own history in the region. However, we also share many interests. I have supported assistance for both countries, but I have also supported conditions on U.S. assistance related to progress on human rights and reform of the judiciary, police, and armed forces. Unfortunately, I fear that the progress that has been made is now at risk of being eroded.  Often, we are presented with the false choice of supporting human rights or national security. I see no such dichotomy here. Consider the impact of our complicity in these governments' actions, both on our own legacy and on the efforts we are undertaking to help improve security and stability in the region. The Philippines and Indonesia cannot combat extremism or profess to govern legitimately by murdering innocent and nonviolent people, by creating a culture of lawlessness and impunity.  The United States is far from perfect. We have not done as well as we should in addressing the illicit drug problem in our own country. Many Americans need and want treatment and cannot get it. But we should not support those who make a practice of using excessive force or the death penalty, rather than protecting the rights of due process and fair trials.  I ask unanimous consent that two articles on this subject, both published in the New York Times last month, be printed in the Record.  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in the Record, as follows:                [From the New York Times, Aug. 13, 2016] Indonesia's Push To Execute Drug Convicts Underlines Flaws in Justice                                  System                           (By Joe Cochrane)       Jakarta, Indonesia.--Sixteen years ago, Zulfiqar Ali left      his native Pakistan for Indonesia in search of a new life.      Last month, that life was on the verge of ending in front of      a firing squad.       Mr. Ali has been on Indonesia's death row since 2005, after      he was convicted of heroin trafficking. A government-ordered      inquiry later found that he was probably innocent. Still, in      July, he was one of 14 convicts, most of them foreigners, who      were taken to the prison island of Nusakambangan off Java's      southern coast to be put to death.       Minutes before they were to be executed, on July 29, Mr.      Ali and nine other convicts were given a reprieve, for      reasons the government has yet to explain. But four were shot      dead as scheduled, including a Nigerian who supporters say      was framed. And Mr. Ali, like the rest who were spared,      remains condemned.       More than a year after Indonesia drew international censure      by putting to death 12 foreigners convicted of drug crimes,      the country has resumed a war on narcotics by way of      executions--and has again put a spotlight on its profoundly      flawed justice system.       Critics in Indonesia and abroad say those flaws go so deep      that the country should not employ the death penalty at all.      Researchers have found that many condemned convicts were      tortured by the police into confessing, did not receive      access to lawyers or were otherwise denied fair trials.       The resumption of executions means ``that the government      has ignored that there is something seriously wrong with our      judiciary and law enforcers,'' said Robertus Robet, a      lecturer and researcher at the State University of Jakarta's      sociology department. He characterized the government as      ``trigger-happy.''       ``When you execute someone, you execute the possibility of      finding out the truth,'' he said.       Amnesty International has denounced ``the manifestly flawed      administration of justice in Indonesia that resulted in      flagrant human rights violations.'' Similar concerns have      been raised by the United Nations and the European Union,      which sent a delegation to try to persuade Indonesia to spare      inmates who were condemned to die last year.       Indonesia has long had the death penalty, but its use was      sporadic in the years before President Joko Widodo took      office in October 2014. Declaring drug abuse a ``national      emergency,'' Mr. Joko denied clemency appeals from 64 death      row inmates who had been convicted of drug crimes, most of      them foreigners, and the government set a goal of executing      all of them by the end of 2015.       That did not happen, but five drug convicts were put to      death in January of that year, and eight more in April. (An      Indonesian was also executed for murder in January.) Among      the convicts executed in April, seven of whom were      foreigners, were Andrew Chan, 31, and Myuran Sukumaran, 34,      Australians who were arrested in 2005 trying to smuggle      heroin out of Bali, the resort island.       The men admitted their guilt, but their lawyers said the      judge in the case was corrupt, having offered a lesser      sentence in exchange for a bribe. Indonesia rejected appeals      by the Australian government to spare them, and Australia      withdrew its ambassador in protest.       Also executed in April was Rodrigo Gularte, 42, a Brazilian      convicted of drug smuggling who had repeatedly been given a      diagnosis of schizophrenia and bipolar disorder. Indonesian      law forbids the execution of mentally ill convicts.       Dave McRae, a senior research fellow at the Asia Institute      at the University of Melbourne in Australia who has      researched the use of capital punishment in Indonesia, said      that the deficiencies in the justice system here could be      found in most countries that still used the death penalty.       ``A lot of the objections to Indonesia's use of the death      penalty--inconsistent and arbitrary sentencing and      application of the death penalty, allegations of corruption      and wrongful convictions, questions over access to lawyers      and interpreters and adequacy of representation--are      questions that are raised all over the world,'' he said.       Such concerns have been raised about the cases against some      of the convicts spared last month--and some who were      executed, including the Nigerian, Humphrey Jefferson Ejike      Eleweke.       Mr. Eleweke was arrested in 2003 after the police found      heroin at a restaurant he ran in Jakarta, the capital; he      said an employee had planted it. His lawyers say that the      police beat him until he confessed.       They also say that by law, an 11th-hour appeal for clemency      issued to Mr. Joko should have automatically halted his      execution. Last week, legal activists filed a complaint with      a judicial watchdog against Indonesia's attorney general,      saying that Mr. Eleweke's execution and those of two others      should have been stopped because of those appeals, according      to local news reports.       ``We cannot have the death penalty here because of the      judicial system--it's problematic, it's dysfunctional,'' said      Ricky Gunawan, director of the Community Legal Aid Institute,      a nongovernmental organization that represented Mr. Eleweke.       Another allegation of corruption emerged just before the      executions last month, when one of the men put to death, an      Indonesian named Freddy Budiman, was quoted as saying that he      had paid senior law enforcement officials more than $40      million to let his drug smuggling operation continue before      he was arrested.       That accusation was included in a report released by a      rights activist, Haris Azhar, who had interviewed Mr. Budiman      in prison; shortly thereafter, the police, the military and      Indonesia's anti-narcotics board, all of which were      implicated in the report, filed a criminal defamation      complaint against Mr. Azhar. On Thursday, Mr. Joko ordered      those agencies to investigate the corruption allegations.       The case of Mr. Ali, the Pakistani who was spared      execution, has also raised concerns.       Mr. Ali, who immigrated to Indonesia in 2000, was accused      of drug dealing in 2004 by a friend, Gurdip Singh, who had      been caught with heroin; Mr. Singh later said the police had      pressured him and offered a reduced sentence to name      accomplices. Mr. Al's lawyers say their client was arrested      without a warrant at his home, where no drugs were found, and      signed a confession after being beaten so badly in custody      that he needed two operations.       Though Mr. Ali retracted his confession and Mr. Singh      withdrew his accusation, both men were sentenced to death in      2005. But the severity of Mr. Ali's beating drew attention to      the case, and the government ordered an unusual inquiry,      which concluded that he was likely to be innocent.       The government never acted on those findings, and Mr. Ali      and Mr. Singh were among those who nearly faced a firing      squad.       ``He was never involved in drugs,'' Mr. Ali's wife, Siti      Rohani, who lives in West Java Province with their three      children, said in an interview.       A spokesman for Mr. Joko, Johan Budi, denied that the      judicial system was dysfunctional, saying the executions had      followed legal procedures.       Mr. Ali, along with Mr. Singh and several of the other      convicts who were given reprieves, is still in prison on      Nusakambangan Island, where Indonesia conducts executions.      Ms. Siti said she and her husband's family in Pakistan were      in a torturous state of limbo.       ``We're just confused because there is no certainty about      my husband's fate,'' she said.       M. Rum, a spokesman for the attorney general's office,      declined to explain why Mr. Ali and the other convicts had      been given reprieves, saying only that it was ``for judicial      and nonjudicial reasons.'' But he said the executions would      eventually be carried out.                                  ____                [From the New York Times, Aug. 2, 2016]      Body Count Rises as Philippine President Wages War on Drugs                          (By Jason Gutierrez)       Manila.--Since Rodrigo Duterte became president of the      Philippines just over a month ago, promising to get tough on      crime by having the police and the military kill drug      suspects, 420 people have been killed in the campaign,      according to tallies of police reports by the local news      media.       Most were killed in confrontations with the police, while      154 were killed by unidentified vigilantes. This has prompted      114,833 people to turn themselves in, as either drug addicts      or dealers, since Mr. Duterte took office, according to      national police logs.       Addressing Congress last week in his first State of the      Nation address, Mr. Duterte reiterated his take-no-prisoners      approach, ordering the police to ``triple'' their efforts      against crime.       ``We will not stop until the last drug lord, the last      financier and the last pusher have surrendered or been put      behind bars or below the ground, if they so wish,'' he said.       But human rights groups, Roman Catholic activists and the      families of many of those killed during the crackdown say      that the vast majority were poor Filipinos, many of whom had      nothing to do with the drug trade. They were not accorded an      accusation and a trial, but were simply shot down in the      streets, the critics say.       ``These are not the wealthy and powerful drug lords who      actually have meaningful control over supply of drugs on the      streets in the Philippines,'' said Phelim Kine, a deputy      director of Human Rights Watch in Asia.       Critics of the president's campaign have rallied around the      case of Michael Siaron, a 29-year-old rickshaw driver in      Manila, who was shot one night by unidentified gunmen as he      pedaled his vehicle in search of a passenger. When his wife      rushed to the scene, a photographer took a picture of her      cradling his body in the street, and the photograph quickly      gained wide attention.       Scribbled in block letters on a cardboard sign left near      his body was the word ``pusher.'' His family members insist      that he was not involved in the drug trade, though they said      he sometimes used meth.       Indirectly acknowledging criticism that his policies      trample over the standard judicial process, Mr. Duterte said      that human rights ``cannot be used as a shield to destroy the      country.''       He has called for drug users and sellers to turn themselves      in or risk being hunted down, a threat backed up by the      bodies piling up near daily on the streets of Philippine      cities.       The approach appears to be driving down crime: The police      say that they have arrested more than 2,700 people on charges      related to using or selling illegal drugs, and     that crime nationwide has fallen 13 percent since the      election, to 46,600 reported crimes in June, from 52,950 in      May.       Mr. Duterte's crackdown has been hugely popular. Filipinos,      pummeled by years of violent crime and corrupt, ineffective      law enforcement, handed him an overwhelming victory in the      May presidential election, and have largely embraced his      approach.       A national opinion poll conducted after his election and      just before he took office found that 84 percent of Filipinos      had ``much trust'' in him.       The model for Mr. Duterte's policies is Davao City, where      he was mayor for most of the past 20 years. Draconian laws      there, including a strict curfew and a smoking ban as well as      a zero-tolerance approach to drug users and sellers, have      been credited with turning the city into an oasis of safety      in a region plagued by violence.       The dark side of that approach was that more than 1,000      people were killed by government-sanctioned death squads      during his administration, according to several independent      investigations.       Mr. Duterte has denied having direct knowledge of death      squads, but he has long called for addressing crime by      killing suspects, whom he calls criminals and has referred to      as ``a legitimate target of assassination.''       He has repeatedly said that those hooked on meth, the most      popular drug here, were beyond saving or rehabilitation.       He ran for president largely on the pledge of applying the      same policies nationwide, promising to kill 100,000 criminals      in his first six months in office. While the number may have      been typical Duterte bravado, the threat of mass killing      appears to have been real.       On Tuesday, the International Drug Policy Consortium, a      network of nongovernmental organizations, issued a letter      urging the United Nations drug control agencies ``to demand      an end to the atrocities currently taking place in the      Philippines'' and to state unequivocally that extrajudicial      killings ``do not constitute acceptable drug control      measures.''       Ramon Casiple, a political analyst at the Institute for      Political and Electoral Reform, said that he shared those      concerns but that it was too early to decide whether Mr.      Duterte's approach is effective. ``Let's give him his 100      days,'' Mr. Casiple said.       Mr. Duterte has recently raised his sights beyond street-     level users and dealers, accusing five police generals of      protecting drug lords, though he presented no specific      evidence.       He also publicly accused a mayor, the mayor's son and a      prominent businessman of drug trafficking, threatening their      lives if they did not surrender.       But the people killed on the street tend to be more like      Mr. Siaron, the rickshaw driver.       Mr. Siaron lived with his wife in a shack above a garbage-     strewn creek. Having never finished high school, he survived      on odd jobs like house painting and working in fast-food      restaurants.       Lately he had been pedaling a rickshaw, earning about $2 a      day ferrying passengers through the warren of alleyways in a      run-down part of metropolitan Manila.       On the night he died, he had stopped by his father's fruit      stand to ask for an apple.       Then he told his father he would seek one more fare before      heading home. As he rode off, gunmen on motorcycles sped by,      pumping several bullets into him.       What happened next turned him into a national symbol of the      human toll of Mr. Duterte's war.       When she heard he had been shot, Mr. Siaron's wife,      Jennilyn Olayres, ran into the street, burst through police      lines and collapsed next to him on the asphalt. The      photographer snapped the picture: a distraught woman cradling      her lifeless husband under a streetlight, a Pieta of the      Manila slums.       The police have not commented publicly about the case and      have not accused Mr. Siaron of selling drugs.       ``My husband was a simple man,'' Ms. Olayres said at his      wake several days later. ``He may have used drugs, but he was      not violent and never bothered anyone. His only concern was      looking for passengers so we can eat three meals a day.''       During his speech to Congress, Mr. Duterte dismissed the      photo, which had appeared on the front page of The Philippine      Daily Inquirer the previous day under the banner headline      ``Thou shall not kill.''       ``There you are sprawled on the ground, and you are      portrayed in a broadsheet like Mother Mary cradling the dead      cadaver of Jesus Christ,'' he said. ``That's just drama.''       But if the antidrug campaign has targeted people on the      margins of society, Mr. Siaron is an apt symbol.       ``We're small people, insignificant,'' Ms. Olayres said      through sobs as she stood next to her husband's coffin. ``We      may be invisible to you, but we are real. Please stop the      killings.''                          ____________________
