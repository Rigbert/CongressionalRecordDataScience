President, I come to the floor to discuss a very important issue facing American workers--millions of whom will be barred from organizing or exercising their labor rights unless Congress intervenes.  Eight million workers will no longer be able to join a union or fight collectively for better pay and working conditions--including those already in a union, who will be forced to leave when their current collective bargaining agreements expire.  This includes more than 800,000 nurses--40,000 nurses in my home State of Illinois alone.  This will happen because the Bush administration's National Labor Relations Board recently decided which types of workers are considered ``supervisors.'' By law, if you are considered a ``supervisor,'' then you are not allowed to join a union.  In a series of rulings, the NLRB has decided the fate of America's workers, and it did so behind closed doors. These changes--some of the biggest decisions in years have stripped millions of American workers of their rights under the National Labor Relations Act.  This flies in the face of what Congress intended more than 60 years ago.  Moreover, at a time when several states are suffering from nursing shortages, this will further worsen the nursing crisis. More than 72 percent of hospitals experience nursing shortages, and 1.2 million nursing positions need to be filled within the next decade. By denying 800,000 nurses the right to collectively bargain, pay will surely decrease and nurses' working environment will deteriorate, thereby driving even more nurses out of the profession and discouraging people from becoming nurses.  Clearly, this law must be clarified so that American workers receive the labor law protections that Congress envisioned.  Many courts, including the United States Supreme Court, have struggled with how to apply the definition of ``supervisor.'' It is time for this Congress to step up and make clear that the American worker has the right to organize.  Therefore, early in the next Congress, I hope that every Senator will join Senators Dodd, Kennedy and myself in introducing legislation to amend the National Labor Relations Act to clarify the definition of ``supervisor.''  The legislation we envision will use a commonsense definition of the term that is faithful to Congress's intent in 1947, to delineate the relationship between supervisors and employees.  I look forward to working with my colleagues on both sides of the aisle in the 110th Congress to pass this much-needed legislation so that millions of working Americans will be able to retain their right to join a union and collectively bargain.                          ____________________[Page S11683]From the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]                        DEFINITION CLARIFICATION
