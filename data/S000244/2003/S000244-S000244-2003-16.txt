Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.  Mr. Speaker, today we are considering Senate 1685, a bill authored by Senator Grassley that represents a fair and reasonable compromise regarding the reauthorization of the employment eligibility verification pilot project.  The Immigration Reform and Control Act of 1986 made it unlawful for employers to knowingly hire or employ illegal aliens and required employers to check the identity and work eligibility documents of all new employees. Unfortunately, illegal aliens have used the easy and cheap availability of counterfeit documents to make a mockery of this law. Today's document-based verification system just does not work. It frustrates employers who do not want to hire illegal aliens but have no other choice than to accept documents that have a high likelihood of being counterfeit.  In 1996, Congress responded to this state of affairs by creating a pilot program under which employers who elect to participate may submit the Social Security and alien identification numbers of newly hired employees to be checked against Social Security Administration and INS records.                              {time}  1730  This weeds out bogus numbers provided by illegal aliens and thus ensures that new hires are genuinely eligible to work.  The pilot program has been a great success over its 6 years of operation. A recent study found that 96 percent of participating employers believed the pilot to be an effective and reliable tool for employment verification, 94 percent believed it to be more reliable than the IRCA-required document check, and 83 percent believed that participating in the pilot reduced uncertainty regarding work authorization. The study recommended the continuation of the pilot.  Last month, this body considered H.R. 2359, introduced by the gentleman from California (Mr. Calvert), that would have extended the pilot program for an additional 5 years. It would have allowed employers throughout the Nation to voluntarily participate. Currently, the Department of Homeland Security is required to operate the pilot in at least five of the seven States with the highest estimated number of illegal aliens.  Senate 1685 also extends the pilot for an additional 5 years. It also takes two steps to address the concerns of some of our colleagues that aspects of the pilot program can be improved. First, the bill delays nationwide expansion for a year. It provides that employers in all States shall be able to participate in the basic pilot program no later than December 1, 2004. In addition, not later than June 1, 2004, the Secretary of Homeland Security shall complete a report evaluating whether any problems identified in the 2001 report on the basic pilot program have been substantially resolved and describing what actions the Secretary shall take to resolve any outstanding problems before undertaking the expansion of the program.  Senate 1685 also addresses the immigrant investor visa program. To encourage economic development through the program, Congress created a 5-year temporary pilot program in 1993 that set aside 3,000 immigrant visas each year for aliens who invested at least $500,000 in designated regional centers. A regional center is any economic unit, public or private, which is involved with the promotion of economic growth, including increased export sales, improved regional productivity, job creation, or increased domestic capital investment. A center seeking approval must submit a proposal showing how it plans to focus on a geographical region within the United States to achieve the required growth. Once a center has been approved, an alien applicant can receive an investor visa by showing that he will make the qualifying investment within the approved regional center. In 2000, Congress extended this program until September 2003.  Senate 1685 extends this pilot program for an additional 5 years and also allows the Department of Homeland Security to process investor visa petitions involving regional centers expeditiously, as compared to nonpilot program investor visa petitions.  I urge my colleagues to support this bill. The legislation will provide willing employers throughout the Nation the tools they need to hire a legal workforce.  Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.
