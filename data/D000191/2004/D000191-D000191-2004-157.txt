Speaker, I would like to take a few minutes to discuss H.R. 4323. This legislation has the best of intentions. It would provide authority for the Secretary of Defense to expedite procurement of equipment that is necessary to protect against combat deaths. While I agree with the premise, I am concerned about the details of the bill.  Obviously, we all, regardless of political party, want our men and women in uniform to have the equipment they need to protect themselves and successfully carry out their mission. Just last month, I voted in favor of H.R. 4200, the fiscal year 2005 Department of Defense Authorization Act. This legislation boosted funding above and beyond the levels requested by President Bush for a variety of critical equipment like armored Humvees, advanced body armor, and roadside bomb suppression devices.  H.R. 4200 also included a provision to speed up the procurement of equipment necessary to prevent combat casualties that is identical to the text included in H.R. 4323. While I had some reservations about the provision, I supported its inclusion in H.R. 4200 and voted for final passage of the bill because it contained a variety of important pay and benefit improvements for our men and women in uniform. And, as I mentioned, it increased funding for critical equipment. I was hoping that the procurement provision could be fine-tuned in the conference with the Senate.  However, the House Republican leadership decided to bring the procurement provision to the floor as a stand-alone measure, H.R. 4323, in order to fast-track the bill through Congress and get it to the President without getting bogged down in the various debates surrounding H.R. 4200. The bill is on the floor this week under a procedure that prohibits amendments to perfect it.  I voted against H.R. 4323 because I am concerned about rushing through a bill that, while well intentioned, may not provide the benefit to our men and women in uniform that its proponents claim.  The bill would require that the Secretary of Defense establish an expedited procurement process for equipment that can prevent combat casualties occurring in the field. In order to speed up the process and allow a contract to be awarded within 15 days of an identified need, H.R. 4323 would waive the statutory requirement that the equipment be tested and evaluated for effectiveness.  Some of my colleagues may remember during the Vietnam War when modified M-I6swere rushed into soldiers' hands. Tragically, the weapons were not adequately tested prior to distribution in Vietnam. It turns out they jammed frequently, causing untold number of deaths when soldiers' were left without an automatic weapon when facing enemy fire.  Rather than waiving the requirement that emergency equipment be tested and evaluated for effectiveness, as H.R. 4323 currently does, and risk the repeat of another debacle like the M-16 during Vietnam, I believe this bill should accelerate the testing and evaluation of critical equipment so that it can be procured more quickly, but still safely.  It does our soldiers no good to have equipment procured and distributed quickly if it doesn't work as its supposed to. Amending H.R. 4323 to keep the requirement that equipment to be procured under this new streamlined authority still be tested would ensure that the equipment our troops need would provide the expected level of protection.                          ____________________
