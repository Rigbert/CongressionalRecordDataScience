 I wanted to paraphrase. Tell me if I am misquoting. I do not have it in front of me, but when we were debating this bill on the floor, the Senator said--we were talking about emergency funding--something to the effect of if this is not an emergency, I do not knowwhat an emergency is. Is that a correct paraphrase?  Mr. McCAIN. That is absolutely my conviction, that the reason why we have emergency funding from time to time in times of crisis is for when there is an emergency. I will repeat: I do not know of a greater domestic emergency than the care we owe the men and women who have served this country.  I thank my colleague. I yield the floor.
