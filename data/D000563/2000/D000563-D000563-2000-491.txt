 Senator Gramm came to the floor and waved Vice President Gore's book, saying it calls for a $3 tax increase but could not point out the page. It is not in there, nor is there a statement made by the Vice President to that effect.  Because of the political pain my Republican colleagues have experienced in just voting against the tax program which Governor George W. Bush proposed, they are asking Members to vote against a tax program which Vice President Gore has never proposed.  This is easy. Vote yes; save a copy of the last roll call.
