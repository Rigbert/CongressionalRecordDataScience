 President, all of us in this Chamber know the dedication of those on our staffs who work tirelessly to keep us informed and keep this process moving forward. And, once in a great while, a staffer comes along who becomes so much a part of the process, so much a presence in this place, that few can't imagine the Senate without them.  Ed Hall, staff director on the Committee on Foreign Relations, is one of those people.  A dedicated public servant for more almost 25 years now, he has been a rock-solid steady hand, an extraordinary professional, and--above all--a gentleman.  Now he is completing his final week with the U.S. Senate. And we wish him well.  But before he goes, I hope Ed won't mind too much, though I know he will, if I take a few minutes to pay tribute to him. Ed is one of those rare, talented staffers who always seems to know the answer before we ask the question. He always has the facts.  He conscientiously attends to the details of the hearings, the legislation, the briefing books, the negotiations--with a trademark combination of wisdom and graciousness, and without ever expecting a word of thanks, much less an entire speech.  All of us know and appreciate the hard work and dogged efforts of our staffs, but too often it goes unspoken. And rarely is it expressed on the Senate floor. Bud Ed Hall is an exceptional man who deserves exceptional recognition for making what we do here possible.  He is here when most of us arrive. And he is here long after most of us have gone home.  He is one of the most decent, hard-working, fair-minded and open-hearted men I have met, loyal almost to a fault, a professional with no agenda but to promote the work of the committee, and to look after its staff.  Ed is perceptive about human nature and profoundly patient with it. But what has always impressed me is his encyclopedic grasp of the legislative process, along with expert insight into parliamentary procedure.  It takes that kind of experience, wisdom and finesses to get things done around here, and make no mistake, Ed Hall gets things done.  Ed developed these traits, I am sure, at Harvard and Michigan, as an Assistant U.S. Attorney, then in private practice, the Marine Corps Reserve and through a series of positions of distinction on Capitol Hill.  He started in 1975 with Senator Claiborne Pell on the Rules Committee, moving 3 years later to the Commerce Committee as Chief Counsel for Senator Howard Cannon.  Then Ed practiced law for a while in Idaho, but as anyone who knows him could tell you, Ed Hall is no simple country lawyer, to borrow a phrase that was popularized by my Senate colleague Sam Ervin, who was here and Ed and I first arrived, so he came back to the Senate as Chief Counsel on the Foreign Relations Committee, again working with Senator Pell.  A few years later, I had the good sense and the good fortune to retain Ed as Minority Staff Director.  If there is one thing that I think I will always remember when I think of Ed, it is his unique take on the legislative process and the goings-on of the Senate.  He has been known to say that if you know what to listen for, you learn after a while that the Senate produces a kind of music, combining rhythm, pace and melody wholly unique to this place.  Ed Hall has always known what to listen for.  As both minority and majority staff director, Ed's role has been a kind ofconductor, orchestrating our work to the music of the Senate.  During my time on the committee as ranking Democratic member, and then as chairman, Ed oversaw Senate consent to ratify the chemical weapons convention, the reorganization of the U.S. foreign affairs agencies, the debate deciding the expansion of NATO, and the establishment of a way to pay our country's arrearage to the United Nations.  He did it in close coordination with his Republican colleagues on the committee--sometimes at odds over small matters of language. Sometimes at odds over major issues of fundamental principle. But Ed has always bridged the gap.  He treats all parties with respect, and tries to accommodate all interests involved. His success in so doing is evidenced by the close personal friendship he shared with Admiral James ``Bud'' Nance, Staff Director for my distinguished colleague from North Carolina, Chairman Helms, until Bud passed away in 1999.  Bud and Ed genuinely cared for one another, and the maturity and mutual approval that they brought to the job filtered down through all the ranks of their respective staffs.  It is not for nothing that some of the younger staff members refer to Ed Hall as ``Daddy Ed.'' He has led by example, bringing out the best in those for whom he is responsible and helping them feel that what they do is more than a mere job.  But, though I can't imagine where he finds the time, Ed Hall's work doesn't end when he leaves his office.  Ed's collaborative and caring approach to working with others is consistent with his religious convictions. He has been modest about them while in the office, but generous in expressing his faith through intense involvement in community affairs.  Ed has long been active in the work of ``The Green Door,'' a nonprofit organization that helps the mentally ill achieve independence and self-sufficiency.  He is a member of the board of directors for Episcopal Relief and Development, which provides assistance to those in need in the United States and abroad.  And he has been an at-large trustee for the Virginia Theological Seminary, where he will soon be vice president for Institutional Advancement.  We can only hope that Ed's new position will give him more time with his family. To his wife, Sherry, let me say thank you for all the times she kept his dinner warm on my account.  Ed Hall has always seen to it that I receive the best possible preparation for a speech, and that the staff maintain a modest collection of quotations for such occasions, and that it is always at hand.  So it will be no surprise if Ed recognizes something that the English essayist G.K. Chesteron once said:       The Christian ideal has not been tried and found wanting;      it has been found difficult and left untried.  Well, I am here to tell you that while some may have found it difficult, and perhaps some have not tried hard enough, Ed Hall is living proof of a transcendent ideal that people of all convictions will recognize: he is an abundant spirit, a humble soul.  He is a pillar of this institution. In a place where turnover is the order of the day, he has been a rarity, and he leaves a legacy of service for which the Senate will be forever grateful.  I ask my colleagues to join me in saluting Edwin K. Hall.                          ____________________
