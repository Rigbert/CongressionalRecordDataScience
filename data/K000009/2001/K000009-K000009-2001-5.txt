Speaker, I rise to express my sincere disappointment with the Republican House conferees and their leadership who gave the big insurance companies their holiday wish and abandoned the millions suffering from mental illness when they killed the mental health parity amendment in conference.  Mental illnesses are brain disorders. They are as much physical illness as diabetes or heart disease. Members of Congress and federal workers already have health insurance providing parity for mental health benefits. Other Americans deserve the same protection. The cost of parity is low and the benefits are significant. For example, in my own state of Ohio mental health and substance abuse costs for state employees dropped with parity.  There are 54 million Americans with mental illness, two-thirds of whom receive no treatment. The Wall Street Journal has estimated that untreated mental illnesses cost U.S. businesses $70 billion a year in lost productivity and absenteeism; other estimates are much higher. Parity is inexpensive, support for it is broad, the authorizers have not acted, and those who opposed the amendment should be ashamed for voting to protect unconscionable discrimination.
