President, a few days after the mass shooting in Orlando, I received a very powerful letter from Ella Staats, a young Vermonter who, like Americans across our land, was sickened and horrified by this senseless act of hatred that we saw in Orlando.  What was pointed out to me in this letter, this eloquent, passionate heartfelt letter, is that Ella is 15 years old. In her letter addressed to me, under the auspices of the Young Writers Project, she explained that even at her age, she has ``already seen so many mass shootings that it is becoming harder and harder to faze [her].'' Ella calls on Congress to act, writing: ``It is time that the gun laws in our country were completely reformed'' so these violent and hateful acts will be prevented.  After I read and reread her eloquent letter, I was moved. I sat down in my home in Vermont, and I started to draft a response, going through all the votes I had taken over the years. I started looking up all the hearings I had convened on gun violence, all the bills I authored and cosponsored, those I moved through the Judiciary Committee and even on the Senate floor, but then I stopped--this was just a catalogue.  I decided the nature and the quality and the moving aspect of Ella's letter deserved a response on the Senate floor because Ella has given voice to something urgent that many people in Vermont and across the country are feeling right now.  Here is my reply to Ella:  Dear Ella, thank you for your thoughtful letter. I have read it several times and I want you to know how powerful it is to speak up about issues as important as this one. Some worry that many of your generation have disengaged from involvement in the big issues of our day, but your letter gave me hope. You are right. It is long past time for Congress to reform the laws that allow mass gun violence to flourish in our country.  You deserve to feel safe. You should not have to fear that guns designed for the battlefield will end up in the hands of terrorists or violent criminals. A large majority of our fellow Americans feel just as we do and support sensible answers. But your government has let you down. Time and time and time again, commonsense remedies are thwarted by obstruction and inertia and powerful lobbies, and only if more people like you stand up will we be able to change this.  Ella, I want you to know that I have been working for years to find practical solutions that will stop the gun violence that continues to touch every corner of our country. But I bet that the last thing you want is a list of all the bills I have written or voted for but have not passed. You want to know how we are going to overcome the well-funded opposition to passage of laws that will reduce gun violence.  First, we must remember the amazing men, women and children who die from gun violence every day. Sadly these tragedies are not limited to mass shootings. It is essential that we pay attention to the loss that thousands of mothers and fathers, sons and daughters feel each day because of a shooting that could have been prevented.  Second, we need new voices like yours. We need you to hold us accountable. We need more people to demand reform so that we can finally overcome the well-funded opposition to commonsense laws that would keep guns out of the hands of criminals and terrorists.  Ella, I share your frustrations and I beg you not to become numb to this hatred and violence. I urge you to speak out in your community, on social media and to demand accountability. It often takes time--too long a time--but speaking out, sharing your ideas and views, and contacting your elected representatives makes a difference. I hope the votes that I cast on your behalf tonight demonstrate that I hear you and I agree that we must act to prevent the next Orlando. Ella, thank you for doing that--for speaking out and for holding us accountable.  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that Ella Staat's full letter be printed in the Record.  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in the Record, as follows:                             (By Ella Staats )       Dear Senator Leahy:       I am a Vermont teen who has been deeply saddened by the      Orlando shooting. I am enraged at this terrible act of      targeted violence against the LGBT+ community, saddened by      the immense loss of life, and mourning for the victims and      their families.       It is time that the gun laws in our country were completely      reformed. It is time that people with such senseless hatred      cannot commit such a terrible crime so easily.       I would expect and, frankly, hope that you and every      Congressperson around the United States are receiving      thousands more letters like this one.       Because something needs to change.       I am a teenager growing up in a world where, at 15, I have      already seen so many mass shootings that it is becoming      harder and harder to faze me.       But the homophobia, and the scale of this attack deeply      disturb me. I may not know everything about politics, but I      am urging you to please, please do something. Something big.       This may not be a long letter, but I hope I have gotten my      point across.       I am tired of excuses. I am tired of waiting. I am tired      because I know this is not the last awful shooting I will see      in my lifetime. Unless this government finally steps up and      makes a change, this will continue to be the norm.       And a country where something like the Orlando shootings is      commonplace is not a country I want to spend the rest of my      life in.
