Madam Speaker, even if President Clinton bows to the pressure of the pro-abortion lobby and vetoes the partial-birth abortion ban, the fact that the Congress, in what will be, as it was previously, a bipartisan vote in support of the ban and the fact that the American people of all political persuasions, men and women of all ages, are beginning, and I mean just beginning, to face the truth and reality about the cruelty of abortion on demand will have made all of this worth the effort.  I chair the subcommittee on International Operations and Human Rights. I also am chairman of the Helsinki Commission. I have been in this body now for some 16 years, Madam Speaker. I have always found when we work on human rights issues, it is never easy, whether it be trying to help a Soviet Jew, whether it be trying to help a persecuted Christian in the People's Republic of China, there are always these so-called unwanted people everywhere. Regrettably, the human rights abuse in this country is that which is directed at the most innocent and the most defenseless of all human beings, unborn children. This is the violation of human rights in the United States of America in 1996, the killing of unborn children, 1\1/2\ million or so per year on demand, and most of them are for birth control reasons, not the hard cases, life of the mother or even rape and incest. They constitute a very small, infinitesimal number of the abortions. Most of the abortions are done on demand.  Madam Speaker, I believe very strongly that the 22-year coverup of abortion methods, including chemical poisoning of babies is coming to an end. I think most people are beginning to realize, salt solutions are routinely injected into the baby's body, killing that baby, because of the corrosive impact of the salt. And they are appalled.  Another method of abortion, the most commonly procured method, is the dismemberment, D&C suction method, where the baby's body is literally ripped to shreds. We have, because of the leadership of subcommittee Chairman Charles Canady's bill, hopefully, achieved the end of a very gruesome method of abortion, the partial-birth abortion method. This method in recent years has been done increasingly. It is being done in the later terms, in the 6th, 7th, 8th, 9th months of the babies' gestational ages. And, hopefully, even though the President may veto this, this will be the beginning of an effort to outlaw this sickening form of child abuse.  This picture to my left is truly worth a thousand words. It shows what the doctor does, and I just would like to use the doctor who is one of the pioneers of this gruesome method. I will just very succinctly read his statement as to how this method is done. His name is Dr. Martin Haskell, a doctor who performs partial-birth abortions by the hundreds. He has said, and I quote,       The surgeon takes a pair of blunt, curved Metzenbaum      scissors in the right hand. He carefully advances the tip      curved down along the spine under his middle finger until he      feels contact at the base of the skull under the tip of the      middle finger. The surgeon then forces the scissors into the      base of the skull. Having safely entered the skull, he      spreads the scissors to enlarge the opening. The surgeon then      removes the scissors and introduces a suction catheter into      this hole and evacuates the skull contents. When the catheter      is in place, he applies traction to the fetus, removing it      completely from the patient.  What this so-called doctor is describing, Madam Speaker, is infanticide. The baby is partially born, and this so-called doctor then kills the baby in this hideous method. Hopefully, this legislation will get a second shot, not withstanding the President's veto, so we can outlaw this gruesome form of child abuse and banish it from this land.                          ____________________
