 President, to reiterate what the majority leader indicated, as a result of this agreement, which did take a while--and I know some of our colleagues wondered if we were ever going to get there--we will complete the bill tonight, and we will have no votes tomorrow or Monday.  This was a successful example of good negotiation--although it took a while--for a favorable result.
