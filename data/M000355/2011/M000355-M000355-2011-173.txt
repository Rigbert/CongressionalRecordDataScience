 President, I rise today to pay tribute to an accomplished educator and veteran who has dedicated his life to teaching young Kentuckians. Mr. Grover Cleveland ``G.C.'' Garland was involved with the Laurel County School System for over 50 years, where he played a vital role in changing the face of education in Laurel County before finally retiring in 1988.  G.C., 79, graduated from Bush High School in 1948 at the age of 16. At 18, he began teaching at Sasser School, part of the Laurel County School District, after only 2 years of college--his oldest student was 16, barely 2 years younger than him. G.C. spent another year teaching before he joined the U.S. Air Force to serve his country in the Korean war.  G.C. received his basic training in San Antonio, TX, and was transferred around before ending up in Fairbanks, AK. While on leave from his duties G.C. met his wife of 56 years, Joan, at the Ocean Wave Skating Rink in Fariston, KY.  In January 1956, G.C. was discharged from the Air Force and returned to Kentucky, where he returned to school at the University of Kentucky and received a degree in secondary education. He majored in math, history, and political science. After graduation, G.C. and his family returned to Laurel County and he began teaching at Bush. During his 8 years at Bush, G.C. received his master's degree and also assumed the role of part-time guidance counselor.  In 1965, G.C. assumed the position of central office supervisor after Laurel County School Superintendent Hayward Gilliam asked him to help build Laurel County's first million-dollar high school. He spent 13 years as supervisor before being hired as the Laurel County superintendent in 1978. In his 10-year tenure as superintendent, he oversaw several major projects, including the construction of Cold Hill Elementary and junior high schools North and South Laurel Middle Schools.  In 2006 Mr. Garland was honored when the Laurel County school administration named one of the new office buildings after him--the G.C. Garland Administration Building, on the campus of London Elementary School. Furthermore, two of G.C.'s daughters, Jan and Sharon, currently work at Bush Elementary School.  Grover Cleveland ``G.C.'' Garland's lifetime of work and dedication to the education of Kentuckians is truly an inspiration to the people of our great Commonwealth. The Laurel County Sentinel Echo recently published an article highlighting and thanking G.C. for his service to the people of Kentucky. I ask unanimous consent that the full article be printed in the Record.  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in the Record, as follows:          [From the Laurel County Sentinel Echo, Spring 2011]                           Building a Legacy                            (By Sue Minton)       For more than 50 years Grover Cleveland (G.C.) has been      involved with the Laurel County School System, except for      four years he served his country in the U.S. Air Force, and      one year teaching another county.       The 79-year-old entered Murray Elementary School (Clay      County) at the age of five     and finished his elementary years at Burning Springs      Elementary.       ``Burning Springs was a three-room elementary school and      they didn't teach every grade every year,'' Garland said.      ``They were not teaching the fifth grade the year I was      supposed to be in the fifth. I was promoted to the sixth      grade and this put me two years ahead of myself. I always did      well academically, but socializing and sports were a problem      for me. I was a nerd in today's language.''       Before Garland entered high school, his parents moved from      Clay County to Laurel County and he continued his education      at Bush High School, graduating in 1948 at the age of 16.       Then having completed two years of college, the 18-year-old      found himself teaching at a one-room school.       ``The year was 1950 and I was teaching in the Laurel County      School District at Sasser School, teaching grades first      through eighth,'' he recalls. He had one student, a girl, who      was 16, just two years younger than he was at the time.       ``That first year I also had two beginners. This concerned      me,'' he added. ``I thought, how would I ever deal with them.      By the end of the school year I was more proud of them than      any of the other students. You could really see what they had      accomplished.''       For his second year Garland was transferred to Valley      Grove, the last one-room school built in Laurel County. ``I      had only taught there half a year when I received greetings      from President Harry Truman. I didn't let them draft me; I      joined the Air Force. The Korean Conflict was raging at that      time.''       Garland received his basic training at Lackland Air Force      Base in San Antonio, Texas. He was later transferred to      Keesler Air Force Base in Biloxi, Miss., where he remained      for two years before going to Low Air Force Base in Denver,      Colo.       ``I was in Denver three months before I was transferred to      Fairbank, Alaska with Project Remote,'' he said. ``While      there I developed back trouble and was transported to a      bigger hospital at Scott Air Force Base in Illinois. The      doctors were getting ready to do surgery when the surgeon      went on leave. I was sent to Walter Reed Medical Center in      Washington, D.C. where I had surgery.''       ``After recovering from back surgery, I returned to Laurel      County to get my wife, Joan, and my car,'' he added. ``I got      married before going to Alaska, but she couldn't go with me.      I only had about six months left in my enlistment period and      we returned to Washington, D.C.''       Although both Garland and his wife, Joan, were from Laurel      County, they had not met before.       ``I met Joan on leave from the Air Force at the Ocean Wave      Skating Rink at Fariston,'' he recalls. ``We planned on      getting married at Christmas in 1954, but I got my orders for      Alaska in October. I asked her if we could get married before      I left and she said `yes.' '' The couple have been married 56      years.       In January 1956, Garland was discharged from the U.S. Air      Force. He and Joan returned to Kentucky and Garland returned      to education.       He attended the University of Kentucky, receiving a degree      in secondary education majoring in math, history and      political science. While at UK, Garland taught one year at an      elementary school in Bourbon County. Also, his son, Ronald      Wayne, was born. (Wayne is now a chemical engineer for      Eastman Chemical Company in Kingsport, Tenn.).       Garland and his family moved back to Laurel County and he      started teaching at Bush School. For eight years he taught      mostly math.       He remembers teaching trigonometry to one senior class.      ``The class had an average I.Q. of 120. Those students have      gone on to do great things. I wish we put more emphasis on      the Gifted and Talented Program these days.''       ``Also, our daughters, Sharon and Jan, were born during my      tenure at Bush.''       Garland later accepted the responsibilities of a half-time      guidance counselor.       ``The guidance counselor program began while I was at      Bush,'' he said.       ``I picked-up my master's degree while I was teaching at      Bush and it was at this time the National Defense Education      Act began. The government got all excited after Russia      launched the satellite Sputnik, thinking other countries were      superior to the United States in math and science. This      spurred more training for math teachers and guidance      counselors. I was in both categories, so I got a lot of those      institutes. I made a summer job out of going to school. Joan      said I was a professional student.''       It was during one of the institutes at UK during the summer      of 1965 that Garland was contacted by then Laurel County      School Superintendent Hayward Gilliam. ``Mr. Gilliam told me      he wanted to bring me into the central office as a      supervisor. He said he was going to build a new high school      and wanted me to help him. At that time we still had 12 to 14      one-and-two room schools. They had been good in their day,      but their day had long since passed.''       Garland relates a story pertaining to a one-room school.       ``When I went into the central office it was during Lyndon      Johnson's term and they had just discovered poverty in these      hills.' The Council of Southern Mountains in Berea had      gathered some books they wanted to send to our one-and-two      room schools. People had donated the books; they were mostly      for adults. One of the schools received some of these books      in a blue footlocker. A representative from the council came      down to see where his books had gone and what good they had      done. I took him to the school. They had a substitute teacher      that day and she had no idea where his books had gone. He      noticed a big blue patch on the front door and said `at least      the box was useful.' They had taken part of the footlocker      and patched a hole on the front door.''       He recalls how the new school, Laurel County High School,      was built.       ``Before I took the supervisor's job I talked to some      people and was told they didn't think the district could      build a new school. The district was in debt. But, Mr.      Gilliam was determined. That was the same year of the      Elementary and Secondary Education Act (ESEA), the ``big''      federal aid program that offered funds to areas in poverty.      It was broken down into different programs, one being the      Title I Program. Laurel County's first allotment of Title I      money was $414,860. That was a lot of money in those days. We      still had those one-and-two room schools, were short on      teachers and short overall on classrooms. The people over      ESEA first said no construction with the funds. Susan Lou      Young and I came into the central office at the same time as      supervisors and we went with Mr. Gilliam to Frankfort to      speak with the state coordinator of Title I. We were told we      could not use the funds for construction. Mrs. Young said,      `Looks like we are just too poor to be helped.' The      coordinator later said he thought about that and went to      Washington, D.C. They agreed some of the money could be used      for construction.''       Among the first building projects were libraries and      reading rooms on the existing consolidated schools, followed      by a lunchroom at Bush School.       Mr. Gilliam approached Garland saying he could purchase a      60-acre farm for $2,000 an acre if he could get $80,000 from      the Title I money.'       ``We told them in Frankfort how we were going to do away      with the one-and-two room schools and consolidate so the      students could have more Title I services,'' Garland added.      ``London School, and independent district, was bursting at      the seams and had no room to expand. At this time they merged      with the Laurel County School District, and in the 1970-71      school year Laurel County High School opened, partially built      with Title I funds.''       ``This was the first million-dollar school in Laurel      County,'' he added. ``And the four old high schools became      junior highs.''       After 13 years as a supervisor and federal programs      coordinator with the school district and the retirement of      both Mr. Gilliam and the assistant superintendent, Garland      pitched his hat in the ring for superintendent.       In 1978 Garland was hired as superintendent with a two-year      contract. Joe McKnight came on-board as assistant      superintendent.       In 1980 Garland's contract was not renewed and with 30      years of service to the district, he retired.       ``That fall, the political climate changed. The      superintendent was terminated and I applied to come back,''      Garland said. ``I was hired, finished the former      superintendent's term and received a four-year contract. I      was superintendent for 10 years minus the 6 or 7 months when      my contract was not renewed, retiring under my own steam in      1988.''       Under Garland's administration, Cold Hill Elementary and      the junior high schools, now North and South Laurel Middle      Schools, were the major projects.       In 2006, Laurel County's current school administration paid      tribute to his legacy in education by naming one of the new      administration office buildings after him--the G.C. Garland      Administration Building, located on the campus of London      Elementary School.       Assistant Superintendent Joe McKnight succeeded Garland as      superintendent. ``Joe did a lot for the system. The second      high school, north Laurel High School, Hunter Hills and the      new Bush school were built while he was superintendent.''       With two daughters in education--Jan teaching fifth grade      and Sharon a guidance counselor, both at Bush Elementary      School--Garland thinks the education field has changed a      great deal.       ``The facilities have changed dramatically over the years.      We have always had good people, but there is no comparison to      the facilities today as to 1965 when I went into the central      office. Teachers are better trained today, at least in terms      of college years and degrees and there is more and better      funding of services for students. Teachers see it harder      because of paperwork involved and discipline. I think      paperwork takes away from time that could be used for      instruction. But I guess students are like the rest of us,      they are spoiled by all that has been handed to them. I just      hope we don't hand them the debt to pay.''       ``I don't think society in general appreciates a good      education. Not necessarily the children. I think we are a      spoiled society. In my days in school when they talked about      rights, they talked about responsibility as well. Since the      60s we have majored on rights with very little talk about      responsibility.''       ``Again, we have always had good people in the Laurel      County School System and I was always for the principals and      assistant principals,'' he said. ``In my time we kind of used      them as a board of directors. They made it easier on us in      the central office. They had a hand in setting the policies      and they backed the policies.''       Garland said he missed the students terribly for a while      after he left the classroom, as well as the good people he      worked with at the central office and the school system in      general.       ``I worked with a lot of good people,'' he said. ``We had a      great team. I give any credit due to my family, my church and      all the people I worked with. Also, I think we all owe a debt      of gratitude to our current board members and to all who have      ever served in that role.''                          ____________________
