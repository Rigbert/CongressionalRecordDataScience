That is the reality. Is it any wonder that the approval rating of Congress is in single digits when you take a hard look at what this does to our Nation? At a time when we need Congress to work together, the Speaker will not call the bipartisan bill from the Senate. The Senate will not take up postal reform. The Senate refuses to even cut the $4 billion subsidy to the biggest oil companies in America.  It is a disappointment to me because many of us worked hard to come here. I feel honored to have this job and feel a responsibility to the people we represent. I think the Senate, on those two votes I mentioned, and the House with their action today have let down the people of this country.  I would like to yield to the Senator from California. I have another statement to make, but I want to give her a chance.  I yield the floor.
