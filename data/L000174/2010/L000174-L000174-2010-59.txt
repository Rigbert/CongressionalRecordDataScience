President, 2 weeks ago, before the Thanksgiving Day recess, I urged Republicans and Democrats in the Senate to come together and take action to begin to end the vacancy crisis that is threatening our Federal courts. My call was not extreme nor radical nor partisan. I asked only that Senators follow the Golden Rule. Regrettably, that did not happen, and that is really too bad for the country.  There are now 38 judicial nominees being delayed who could be confirmed before we adjourn--38 judicial nominees who have had their hearings and whose qualifications are well established.  Two weeks ago, I asked the Republican leadership to treat President Obama's nominees as they would have those of a Republican President. I asked for nothing more than that we move forward together in the spirit that we teach our children from a young age by referring to a nearly universal rule of behavior that extends across most major religions and ethical behavior systems.  I urged adherence to the Golden Rule as a way to look forward and make progress. I had hoped that we could remember our shared values. That simple step would help us return to our Senate traditions and allow the Senate to better fulfill its responsibilities to the American people and the Federal judiciary.  Yesterday, I listened to my dear friend, the senior Senator from Connecticut, Mr. Dodd. He gave a lesson similar to others I have heard from Senators over the years--it could have been said by Senators of either party--about why in the Senate we need to work together on certain shared issues. We have 300 million Americans, but only 100 of us have the privilege to serve in this body to represent all 300 million. Senators should certainly stand up for their political positions, but there are certain areas in which the American people expect us to come together. They certainly do not expect us to stall judicial nominations for the sake of stalling, especially nominations that have the strong support of both Republicans and Democrats and that come out of the Judiciary Committee unanimously.  Had we adhered to the Golden Rule, 16 of the judicial nominees being held hostage without a vote, who were each reported unanimously by all Republicans and Democrats on the Judiciary Committee, would have been confirmed before Thanksgiving. So too would an additional nominee supported by all but one of the committee's 19 members. They would be on the Federal bench and Federal judicial vacancies would have been reduced to less than 100. Instead, the across-the-board stalling of judicial nominations that I have been trying to end has continued. We have noncontroversial nominations being delayed and obstructed for no good reason. There is no good reason to hold up consideration for weeks and months of nominees reported without opposition from the Judiciary Committee. I have been urging since last year that these consensus nominees be considered promptly and confirmed. If Senators would merely follow the Golden Rule, that would have happened.  As the Senate recessed, the Washington Post and the Charlotte Observer each criticized the stalling of noncontroversial judicial nominees in editorials published the weekend of November 19. The Washington Post entitled its editorial ``Unconscionable Delays for President Obama's Court Picks'' and recognized that ``even nominees without a whiff of opposition are being blocked'' and concluded ``the hold-up of nominees who have garnered unanimous, bipartisan support is particularly offensive.'' The Charlotte Observer entitled its editorial ``Senate Must End Games, Confirm Strong N.C. Judges'' and called what is going on ``infantile political gamesmanship'' and ``partisan high jinks'' in its comments about the delays in considering Judge Albert Diaz and Judge CatherineEagles. In an opinion column in Politico, a former judge appointed by a Democratic President and one appointed by a Republican joined together to call for the Senate to address the judicial vacancies crisis. They cited the use of ``secret holds and filibusters to block the votes'' and observed:       Fewer nominees have been confirmed during the Obama      administration than at any time since President Richard Nixon      was in office. These tactics are, as one senator noted,      ``delay for delay's sake.'' They are creating an      unprecedented shortfall of judicial confirmations and,      ultimately, a shortage of judges available to hear cases. For      many Americans, this means justice is likely to be      unnecessarily delayed--and often denied.  I will ask that copies of these pieces be printed in the Record at the end of my statement.  In addition to letters from the President of the United States, the Chief Judge of the United States Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit, the Chief Judge of the United States District Court for the District of Columbia, and the American Bar Association that I placed in the record with my statement on November 18, I have now received a copy of the November 19 letter to Senators Reid and McConnell from the Federal Bar Association that I will ask also be print in the Record at the conclusion of my statement.  The Federal Bar Association President notes that ``the large number of judicial vacancies prevents the prompt and timely administration of justice'' and that this ``is causing unnecessary hardship and increased costs on individuals and businesses with lawsuits pending in the federal courts.'' She also notes that seven of the judicial nominees who were reported with near unanimity but are being stalled would fill judicial emergency vacancies: Albert Diaz of North Carolina, Kimberly Mueller of California, Ray Lohier of New York, John Gibney of Virginia, Susan Nelson of Minnesota, Mary Murguia of Arizona and Charlton Reeves of Mississippi.  As of today there are 110 vacancies on the Federal courts around the country; 50 of them are for vacancies deemed judicial emergencies by the nonpartisan Administrative Office of the U.S. Courts. We already know of 20 future vacancies. In addition, the Senate has not acted on the request by the Judicial Conference of the United States to authorize 56 additional judges, which will allow the Federal judiciary to do its work. So we are currently more than 190 judges short of those needed. I urged, before the last Presidential election, that we pass legislation to create additional judgeships, but unfortunately it was blocked.  The vast majority of the President's judicial nominees are consensus nominees and should be confirmed by large bipartisan majorities. Many of them will be confirmed unanimously. These are well-qualified nominees with the support of their home State Senators, both Republicans and Democrats. I have not proceeded in the Judiciary Committee with a single nominee who is not supported by both home State Senators. I have worked with all Republican Senators to make sure they were included in this process. President Obama has worked hard with home State Senators regardless of party affiliation, and by doing so has done his part to restore comity to the process, as have I as chairman.  Regrettably, despite our efforts and the President's selection of outstanding nominees, the Senate is not being allowed to promptly consider his consensus nominees. To the contrary, as the President has pointed out, nominees are being stalled who, if allowed to be considered, would receive unanimous or near unanimous support, be confirmed, and be serving in the administration of justice throughout the country.  We have had nominees on whom we have had to file cloture to get to a vote, then the rollcall vote is 100 to 0 or 99 to 0. This makes no sense. It breaks with every tradition in this body. I speak as one who has been here 36 years. There is only one Member of this body who served here longer than I have. I know both Republican and Democratic leaders and Republican and Democratic Presidents and we have never seen this happen. It is counterproductive.  Like the President, I welcome debate and a vote on those few nominees that some Republican Senators would oppose. Nominees like Benita Pearson of Ohio, William Martinez of Colorado, Louis Butler of Wisconsin, Edward Chen of California, John McConnell of Rhode Island, and Goodwin Liu of California. I have reviewed their records and considered their character, background and qualifications. I have heard the criticisms of the Republican Senators on the Judiciary Committee as they have voted against this handful of nominees. I disagree, and believe the Senate would vote, as I have, to confirm them. That they will not be conservative activist judges should not disqualify them from serving.  But that is not what is happening. Republican Senators are not debating the merits of those nominations, as Democratic Senators did when we opposed the most extreme handful of nominees of President Bush. What is happening is that judicial confirmations are being stalled virtually across the board.  What is new and particularly damaging is that 26 judicial nominees who were all reported unanimously by the Senate Judiciary Committee, without Republican opposition, are still being delayed. These nominees include Albert Diaz and Catherine Eagles of North Carolina. They are both supported by Senator Hagan and Senator Burr. Sadly, Senator Burr's support has not freed them from the across the board Republican hold on all judicial nominees. Judge Diaz was reported unanimously in January, almost 12 months ago, and still waits for an agreement from the minority in order for the Senate to consider his nomination so that he may be confirmed.  Also being delayed for no good reason from joining the bench of the most overloaded Federal district in the country in the Eastern District of California is Kimberly Mueller, whose nomination was reported last May, more than seven months ago, without any opposition. Her nomination is one of four circuit and district nominations to positions in the Ninth Circuit currently on the Executive Calendar that Republicans are blocking from Senate consideration. In addition to the Liu and Chen nominations, the nomination of Mary Murguia from Arizona to the Ninth Circuit has been stalled since August despite the strong support of Senator Kyl, the assistant Republican leader.  Justice Anthony Kennedy, a Republican nominated by a Republican President, spoke to the Ninth Circuit Judicial Conference about skyrocketing judicial vacancies in California and throughout the country. He said:       It's important for the public to understand that the      excellence of the federal judiciary is at risk.  He added:       If judicial excellence is cast upon a sea of congressional      indifference, the rule of law is imperiled.  The Advisory Board of the Ninth Circuit sent a letter last week to the majority and minority leaders urging action on pending nominations to address the growing vacancy crisis in that circuit. The Board writes: ``Allowing the current judicial vacancy crisis to continue and expand--as it inevitably will if nothing changes--is unacceptable. The current situation places unreasonable burdens on sitting judges and undermines the ability of our federal courts to serve the people and businesses of the Ninth Circuit.'' I will ask that this letter be printed in the Record at the conclusion of my statement.  The District of Columbia suffers from four vacancies on its Federal District Court. We have four outstanding nominees who could help that court, but they are now being delayed. Beryl Howell was reported by the committee unanimously. She is well known to many of us from her 10 years of service as a counsel on the Senate Judiciary Committee. She is a decorated former Federal prosecutor and the child of a military family. Robert Wilkins was also reported without opposition. James Boasberg and Amy Jackson could have been reported before Thanksgiving, but were needlessly delayed in Committee for another 2 weeks.  John Gibney of Virginia, James Bredar and Ellen Hollander of Maryland, Susan Nelson of Minnesota, Edmond Chang of Illinois, LeslieKobayashi of Hawaii, and Denise Casper of Massachusetts are the other district court nominees reported unanimously from the Judiciary Committee and could have been confirmed as consensus nominees long ago.  Another district court nominee is Carlton Reeves of Mississippi, who is supported by Senator Cochran and is a former president of the Magnolia Bar Association. Only Senator Coburn asked to be recorded as opposing his nomination. I believe Mr. Reeves would receive a strong bipartisan majority vote for confirmation.  Counting Judge Diaz, there are seven consensus nominees to the circuit courts who are being stalled on the Senate Executive Calendar. Judge Ray Lohier of New York would fill one of the four current vacancies on the United States Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit. He is another former prosecutor with support from both sides of the aisle. His confirmation has been stalled for no good reason for more than 6 months, as well. Scott Matheson is a Utah nominee with the support of Senator Hatch who was reported without opposition. Mary Murguia is from Arizona and is supported by Senator Kyl and was reported without opposition. Judge Kathleen O'Malley of Ohio, nominated to the Federal Circuit, was reported without opposition. Susan Carney of Connecticut was reported with 17 bipartisan votes by the Judiciary Committee to serve on the Second Circuit. James Graves of Mississippi was reported unanimously to serve on the Fifth Circuit.  Many of these nominees could have been considered and confirmed before the August recess. 23 of them could have been considered and confirmed before the October recess. They could and should have been confirmed before the Thanksgiving recess. They were not. They are being held in limbo. They do not know where their life should be at this point, and their courts are empty.  They were not considered because of Republican objections that, I suspect, have nothing to do with the qualifications or quality of these nominees. These are not judicial nominees whose judicial philosophy Republicans question. Most of them were voted for by every single Republican on the Senate Judiciary Committee.  The President noted, in his September letter to Senate leaders, that the ``real harm of this political game-playing falls on the American people, who turn to the courts for justice,'' and that the unnecessary delay in considering these noncontroversial judicial nominations ``is undermining the ability of our courts to deliver justice to those in need . . . from working mothers seeking timely compensation for their employment discrimination claims to communities hoping for swift punishment of perpetrators of crimes to small business owners seeking protection from unfair and anticompetitive practices.''  I think the Senate should end this across-the-board blockade against confirming noncontroversial judicial nominees. Democrats did not engage in such a practice with President Bush, and Republicans should not continue in their practice any longer. With 110 vacancies plaguing the Federal courts, we do not have the luxury of indulging in these kinds of games.  The Senate is well behind the pace set by the Democratic majority in the Senate considering President Bush's nominations during his first 2 years in office. In fact, at the end of President Bush's second year in office, the Senate, with a Democratic majority, had confirmed 100 of his Federal circuit and district court nominations. I know because they all, every one of them, were considered and confirmed during the 17 months I chaired the Senate Judiciary Committee. Not a single nominee reported by the Judiciary Committee remained pending on the Senate's Executive Calendar at the end of the Congress.  In sharp contrast, during President Obama's first 2 years in office, the minority has allowed only 41 Federal circuit and district court nominees to be considered by the Senate. In fact, in 2002, we proceeded in the lameduck session after the election to confirm 20 more of President Bush's judicial nominees. There are 34 judicial nominees ready for Senate consideration and another 4 noncontroversial nominations on the committee's business agenda. That is 38 additional confirmations that could be easily achieved with a little cooperation from Republicans. That would increase the confirmation from the historically low level of 41 where it currently stands, to almost 80. That would be in the range of judicial confirmations during President George H.W. Bush's first 2 years, 70, while resting below President Reagan's first 2 years, 87, and pale in comparison to the 100 confirmed in the first 2 years of the George W. Bush administration or those confirmed during President Clinton's first 2 years, 127.  During the 17 months I chaired the Judiciary Committee during President Bush's first 2 years, I scheduled 26 hearings for the judicial nominees of a Republican President and the Judiciary Committee worked diligently to consider them. During the 2 years of the Obama administration, I have tried to maintain that same approach. The committee held 25 hearings for President Obama's Federal circuit and district court nominees this Congress. I have not altered my approach and neither have Senate Democrats.  One thing that has changed is that we now receive the paperwork on the nominations, the nominee's completed questionnaire, the confidential background investigation and the America Bar Association, ABA, peer review almost immediately after a nomination is made, allowing us to proceed to hearings more quickly. During 2001 and 2002, President Bush abandoned the procedure that President Eisenhower had adopted and that had been used by President George H.W. Bush, President Reagan and all Presidents for more than 50 years. Instead, President George W. Bush delayed the start of the ABA peer review process until after the nomination was sent to the Senate. That added weeks and months to the timeline in which hearings were able to be scheduled on nominations.  I was puzzled to hear the ranking Republican on the Senate Judiciary Committee say a few weeks ago that ``President Obama's nominees have fared better and moved better than President Bush's nominees.'' I have worked with the ranking Republican in connection with our consideration and confirmation of the President's two nominees to the Supreme Court, Justice Sotomayor and Justice Kagan. He opposed both, but agreed that the process was fair. I have worked with him on procedures to consider the President's other nominees and with some exceptions we have been able to have the Judiciary Committee consider and report them. In terms of comparisons, however, we actually reviewed far more of President Bush's nominees during his first 2 years than we have been allowed to consider during President Obama's first 2 years.  The comparison is that I held 26 hearings for 103 of President Bush's Federal circuit and district court nominees and the committee favorably reported 100 of them. All 100 were confirmed by the Senate. We did that in 17 months. By comparison, during the 19 months the committee has been holding hearings on President Obama's Federal circuit and district court nominees, we have held 25 hearings for 80 nominees. Of the 75 favorably reported, only 41 have been considered by the Senate. Several required cloture petitions and votes to end unsuccessful Republican filibusters. There were no Democratic filibusters of President Bush's nominees during the first 2 years of his Presidency.  In sum, the bottom line is that the Senate has been allowed to consider and confirm less than half of the Federal circuit and district court nominees we proceeded to confirm during President Bush's first 2 years. Forty-one confirmations does not equal or exceed the 100 confirmations we achieved during the first 2 years of the Bush administration. For that matter, the 75 Federal circuit and district court nominees voted on and favorably reported on by the Senate Judiciary Committee does not equal the 100 we reported out in less time during the Bush administration. How the ranking Republican can contend that President Obama's nominees ``have fared better and moved faster than President Bush's nominees'' during their first 2 years in office is beyond me.  When I became chairman of the Senate Judiciary Committee midway through President Bush's first tumultuous year in office, I worked hard tomake sure Senate Democrats did not perpetuate the judge wars as a tit-for-tat. Despite the fact that Senate Republicans pocket-filibustered more than 60 of President Clinton's judicial nominations and refused to proceed on them while judicial vacancies skyrocketed during the Clinton administration, in 2001 and 2002, during the 17 months I chaired the committee during President Bush's first 2 years in office, the Senate proceeded to confirm 100 of his judicial nominees.  This chart shows where we were. President Clinton became president and in the first couple of years we went from the 109 vacancies down to 49. Then the Republicans took over, they started pocket-filibustering, and the vacancies went up to 110.  Democrats were in charge for 17 months with a Republican President. We said we were not going to play the games that they did with President Clinton. We brought judicial vacancies down to 60 under President Bush. We actually moved judges faster for President Bush than the Republicans did when they regained control of the Senate.  Towards the end of President Bush's presidency, we got the vacancies down to 34. However, since President Obama has been in power, confirmations have been held up, and vacancies again reached 110. That might sound good in some kind of fund-raising letter. It doesn't sound good if you are the one trying to have your case heard in a court. It does not sound very good if you are the prosecutor and you want a criminal prosecuted and the judge is not there.  What I cannot understand is why, having worked with President Bush to bring the Federal court vacancies down from 110 to 34, and the Federal circuit vacancies which were at a high of 32, down to single digits, judges are still being blocked. It looks like old habits die hard.  By refusing to proceed on President Clinton's nominations while judicial vacancies skyrocketed during the 6 years they controlled the pace of nominations, Senate Republicans allowed vacancies to rise to more than 110 by the end of the Clinton administration. As a result of their strategy, Federal circuit court vacancies doubled. When Democrats regained the Senate majority halfway into President Bush's first year in office, we turned away from these bad practices. As a result, overall judicial vacancies were reduced during the Bush years from more than 10 percent to less than 4 percent. During the Bush years, the Federal court vacancies were reduced from 110 to 34 and Federal circuit court vacancies were reduced from a high of 32 down to single digits.  This progress has not continued with a Democratic President back in office. Instead, Senate Republicans are returning to the strategy they used during the Clinton administration of blocking the nominations of a Democratic President, again leading to skyrocketing vacancies.  Last year, the Senate confirmed only 12 Federal circuit and district court judges, the lowest total in 50 years. The judiciary is not supposed to be political or politicized. When litigants are in a Federal court, they assume they will get impartial justice, regardless of whether they are a Republican or a Democrat. But this kind of game playing, of holding up nominees of a Democratic President, hurts the whole administration of justice.  This year we have yet to confirm 30 Federal circuit and district judges. We are not even keeping up with retirements and attrition. As a result, judicial vacancies are again at 110, more than 10 percent.  There are also the personal consequences. We have highly qualified people who get nominated for the Federal court, with backing from the Republican and Democratic Senators from their State. They are in a law practice, and everybody congratulates them. However, their firms are limited in what cases they can take if the nominee stays on, and they end up in limbo.  Many of those people are taking a huge cut in pay to go on the Federal bench. Suddenly, they are forced to wait for 6, 7, 8 months, without being able to earn anything. Then eventually they are confirmed 100 to 0. This needs to change.  Regrettably, the Senate is not being allowed to consider the consensus, mainstream judicial nominees favorably reported from the Judiciary Committee. It has taken nearly five times as long to consider President Obama's judicial nominations as it did to consider President Bush's during his first 2 years in office. During the first 2 years of the Bush administration, the 100 judges confirmed were considered by the Senate an average of 25 days from being reported by the Judiciary Committee. The average time for confirmed circuit court nominees was 26 days. By contrast, the average time for the 41 Federal circuit and district court judges confirmed since President Obama took office is 90 days and the average time for circuit nominees is 148 days--and that disparity is increasing.  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the materials to which I referred be printed in the Record.  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in the Record, as follows:               [From the Washington Post, Nov. 19, 2010]        Unconscionable Delays for President Obama's Court Picks       Mary Helen Murguia enjoys the support of her two Republican      home state senators, Jon Kyl and John McCain of Arizona. The      Senate Judiciary Committee unanimously approved her      nomination in August. Yet Ms. Murguia, President Obama's pick      for a seat on the U.S. Court of Appeals for the 9th Circuit,      has yet to receive a full vote on the Senate floor.       Albert Diaz, a 4th Circuit nominee, has waited even      longer--nearly one year--for his floor vote after receiving a      thumbs-up from all 19 of the Judiciary Committee's members      and winning the backing of his Republican home state senator,      North Carolina's Richard Burr.       Even trial court nominees--typically not the target of      stall tactics or intense attacks--are getting caught up in      the perplexing political game. Kimberly J. Mueller, for      example, also earned unanimous approval from the Judiciary      Committee for a California trial court that is among the      busiest in the country; she has spent the past six months      waiting for final approval.       In all, 23 of Mr. Obama's nominees are awaiting a Senate      floor vote; 16 of them received unanimous approval from the      Judiciary Committee and the vast majority were deemed ``well      qualified'' by the American Bar Association. Eight--including      the three mentioned above--have been tapped for seats      designated ``judicial emergencies'' because of the length of      the vacancy and the workload of the court.       There is plenty of blame to go around for the delays,      starting with the president, who has been slow and often late      in sending up names. The White House has also been timid in      fighting for nominees. Senate Majority Leader Harry M. Reid      (D-Nev.) has not been assertive in scheduling floor votes,      and the push by some interest groups to win confirmation for      liberal favorites such as controversial 9th Circuit pick      Goodwin Liu may be holding up progress on the broader slate      of more moderate nominees. Republicans, including Minority      Leader Mitch McConnell (Ky.), have been all too eager to      object to votes even on nominees with bipartisan support. The      stall tactics are undoubtedly payback for Democratic      filibusters of controversial but highly qualified nominees of      President George W. Bush. The difference today is that even      nominees without a whiff of opposition are being blocked.       Presidents deserve significant deference in judicial      nominations, and every nominee deserves an up-or-down vote.      But the hold-up of nominees who have garnered unanimous,      bipartisan support is particularly offensive. These nominees      should be confirmed swiftly before Congress recesses next      month.                                  ____              [From the Charlotte Observer, Nov. 21, 2010]Senate Must End Games, Confirm Strong N.C. Judges; Congress' Failure To                     Approve Diaz, Eagles Is Shameful       So here we are, 297 days after the Senate Judiciary      Committee unanimously--unanimously!--recommended Judge Albert      Diaz of Charlotte for a seat on the federal appeals court.      Thanks to infantile political gamesmanship, the Senate still      has not confirmed him. And so a judge that most everyone      agrees is well-qualified languishes in limbo and a busy court      one step below the U.S. Supreme Court remains in a staffing      crisis.       Time is running out on the Senate to do the right thing. If      it does not confirm Diaz in the current lame duck session,      his nomination expires. That would be an ignominious chapter      for that once-august body. Facing the same fate: Catherine      Eagles of Greensboro, another qualified, non-controversial      nominee who in May easily won the Judiciary Committee's      approval for a federal judgeship in North Carolina.       Diaz and Eagles are among a couple dozen capable judges      whose careers are being hamstrung by partisan high jinks. The      whole farce helps explain why the public is disgusted with      how Congress operates these days. Many members put party      before country.       Democrats and Republicans alike have blocked skilled      judicial nominees over the years, particularly in North      Carolina. Today,     each party claims that the other is to blame for the current      impasse. It appears, though, that Sen. Mitch McConnell, R-     Ky., is the biggest impediment.       Republican Sen. Richard Burr and Democratic Sen. Kay Hagan      both support Diaz and Eagles. Burr should publicly and      privately work to persuade McConnell to permit up-or-down      votes on these nominees, without a paralyzing 30 hours of      debate on each and every one of them.       This all matters because dozens of seats have reached a      level of ``judicial emergency,'' according to the      Administrative Office of the U.S. Courts, meaning the      workload is unsustainable and judges are needed. That      includes the 4th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals in Richmond,      Va. North Carolina is the largest of five states in the      circuit but until recently had only one of its three seats on      the bench filled.       Diaz, a special Superior Court judge specializing in      complex business litigation, is trying to fill a seat that      has been vacant for three and a half years. Eagles, a senior      resident Superior Court judge, would fill a judgeship that      has been vacant for nearly two years. Both received the      highest rating from the American Bar Association--     ``unanimously well qualified.''       McConnell recently reversed his position on earmarks. If he      has any sense, he'll now reverse himself on blocking      qualified judges this state and the nation need.                                  ____                   [From the Politico, Nov. 18, 2010]                   Let's Fix Judicial Nominee Process                 (By: Abner J. Mikva and Timothy Lewis)       When the Senate left for the election recess, it had      confirmed just one of the 48 pending judicial nominees. Its      failure to consider nominations has exacerbated a vacancy      crisis for our federal courts that has reached critical      proportions.       Almost one in eight seats on the federal bench is empty and      has been for months. This grave problem is only likely to      worsen as more judges retire and senators block efforts to      appoint new ones.       As federal judges appointed by presidents from different      parties, we urge the Senate to end the excessive      politicization of the confirmation process that is creating      these delays.       This obstruction and the way it undermines our democratic      process would be outrageous at any time. But it is especially      shameful now, because many of these qualified nominees      received bipartisan support when nominated and were then      approved by the Senate Judiciary Committee with broad      support. Yet they have waited more than a year to be      confirmed because the Senate never put their nomination to a      vote.       Instead of confirming these nominees, some senators have      used secret holds and filibusters to block the votes, leaving      nominees in limbo for a year or more and undermining the      credibility of our judiciary. Fewer nominees have been      confirmed during the Obama administration than at any time      since President Richard Nixon was in office.       These tactics are, as one senator noted, ``delay for      delay's sake.'' They are creating an unprecedented shortfall      of judicial confirmations and, ultimately, a shortage of      judges available to hear cases. For many Americans, this      means justice is likely to be unnecessarily delayed--and      often denied.       There are now 106 vacancies on the federal courts, almost      half deemed so debilitating that they are labeled      ``emergencies'' by the Administrative Office of the U.S.      Courts. An additional six seats are slated to become vacant      in the next few months. This is untenable for a country that      believes in the rule of law.       An increasing number of public officials are now speaking      out. President Barack Obama called on the Senate to ``stop      playing games'' with the judicial nominations process.      Supreme Court Justices Anthony Kennedy and Ruth Bader      Ginsburg each independently criticized the partisanship that      has permeated the confirmation process. Several other former      federal judges joined us in writing a letter to Senate      leaders, expressing our dismay and calling for a better      confirmation process.       With the Senate now back for the lame-duck session,      political pressure on nominations may not be so intense. This      is the time for the Senate to return to an effective process      for confirming judges--one that can eliminate the appearance      of excessive partisanship and apply to both Democratic and      Republican administrations.       Only in this way can we begin to restore the public's faith      in the integrity of our judiciary, a crucial element of our      Constitution's delicate system of checks and balances and      fundamental to our democratic system of government.                                  ____                                          Federal Bar Association,                                      Office of the President,                               New Orleans, LA, November 19, 2010.     Hon. Harry Reid,     Majority Leader, U.S. Senate, The Capitol, Washington, DC.     Hon. Mitch McConnell,     Minority Leader, U.S. Senate, The Capitol, Washington, DC.       Dear Majority Leader Reid and Minority Leader McConnell: I      write on behalf of the approximately sixteen thousand members      of the Federal Bar Association (FBA) to encourage expedient      Senate floor action on the judicial candidates reported out      of the Senate Judiciary Committee and awaiting a Senate floor      vote. As the Senate reconvenes, there is a very real need--in      the interest of our federal court system--for the Senate to      fulfill its constitutional responsibility to vote on these      pending nominees.       The FBA is the foremost national association of private and      public attorneys engaged in the practice of law before the      federal courts and federal agencies. We seek the fair and      swift administration of justice for all litigants in the      federal courts. We want to assure that the federal courts are      operating at their full, authorized capacity and that justice      is timely delivered by the federal courts. The large number      of judicial vacancies prevents the prompt and timely      administration of justice in the federal courts. This is      causing unnecessary hardship and increased costs on      individuals and businesses with lawsuits pending in the      federal courts.       Our Association's interest is focused upon prompt,      dispositive action by the Senate in filling vacancies as they      arise on the federal bench. Prompt, dispositive action by the      Senate on judicial candidates will assure that lawsuits filed      in our federal courts are heard and decided with out delay.      The justice system suffers when vacancies are not filled in a      timely manner. Vacancies create a burden of added litigation      and economic costs that at times overwhelm the system and its      ability to hear and decide matters in a timely and effective      manner.       Seventeen of the 23 federal judicial candidates who await a      Senate floor vote have been approved by the Senate Judiciary      Committee by unanimous consent or without controversy. These      candidates deserve an up-or-down vote before the 111th      Congress reaches an end.       In particular, 7 of these 17 noncontroversial judicial      candidates cleared by the Senate Judiciary Committee have      been nominated to circuit and district court judgeships that      have stood vacant for substantial periods of time and are      associated with courts with especially high caseloads. These      vacancies have been designated as ``judicial emergencies'' by      the Judicial Conference, the policy-making body of the      federal judiciary, because each vacancy has existed for a      significant period of time and is associated with a court      that has caseloads that are considerably higher than normal.       The 7 candidates associated with judicial vacancies that      have been designated as ``judicial emergencies'' are:       Albert Diaz, nominated to the Fourth Circuit Court of      Appeals (North Carolina), to the judgeship vacated by Judge      William Wilkins on July 1, 2007; this vacancy has existed for      1237 days.       Kimberly Mueller, nominated to the Eastern District of      California, to the judgeship vacated by Judge Frank C.      Damrell on January 1, 2009; this vacancy has existed for 1091      days and is located in the federal district court with the      highest caseload in the nation.       Raymond Lohier, nominated to the Second Circuit Court of      Appeals (New York), to the judgeship vacated by Justice Sonia      Sotomayor on August 6, 2009; this vacancy has existed for 470      days.       John A. Gibney, nominated to the Eastern District of      Virginia, to the judgeship vacated by Judge Robert E. Payne      on May 7, 2007; this vacancy has existed for 1293 days.       Susan R. Nelson, nominated to the District Court of      Minnesota, to the judgeship vacated by Judge James R.      Rosenbaum on October 26, 2009; this vacancy has existed for      389 days.       Mary H. Murguia, nominated to the Ninth Circuit Court of      Appeals (Arizona), to the judgeship vacated by Judge Michael      Daly Hawkins on February 12, 2010; this vacancy has existed      for 280 days.       Carlton W. Reeves, nominated to the Southern District Court      of Mississippi, to the judgeship vacated by Judge William      Henry Barbour, Jr. on February 4, 2006; this vacancy has      existed for 1748 days, the longest period of any of these      seven candidates.       The Federal Bar Association as a matter of policy takes no      position on the credentials or qualifications of specific      nominees to the federal bench. The FBA's foremost interest      lies in the assurance of prompt, dispositive action by the      President in nominating qualified federal judicial candidates      and the Senate in either confirming or not confirming them in      a prompt manner. Such action will ultimately reduce the      number of vacancies to a more tolerable level.       The Federal Bar Association firmly believes that all      judicial candidates, once cleared by the Senate Judiciary      Committee, deserve a prompt up-or-down vote by the Senate.      Swift action is particularly needed on those candidates      associated with federal circuit and district courts whose      caseloads are in emergency status. We urge the Senate to vote      upon these pending nominees before the end of the current      legislative session.       Thank you for your support of the nation's federal court      system and your consideration of our views.           Sincerely yours,     Ashley L. Belleau.                                  ____                          Advisory Board of the Ninth Circuit,                                                November 24, 2010.     Hon. Harry Reid,     Majority Leader, U.S. Senate, Washington, DC.     Hon. Mitch McConnell,     Minority Leader, U.S. Senate, Washington, DC.       Dear Senators Reid and McConnell: We write to you as      members of the Advisory Board of the Ninth Circuit to seek      your assistance and commitment to solve a growing--and      increasingly urgent--crisis facing the federal courts of the      Ninth Circuit: the ever expanding number of vacancies on both     our district and appellate courts. This growing crisis      threatens the effective delivery of justice to the people and      businesses who come before our federal courts.       We recognize that you cannot solve this problem alone. The      President must select and submit to the Senate for review      nominees to fill these vacancies. Consequently, we are      seeking the assistance and commitment of the President to      address this crisis as well.       It is no exaggeration to call the growing number of      judicial vacancies on our federal courts a crisis. Between      1981 and 2008, there were on average 48 vacancies each year      for all of the lower federal courts, including vacancies      created by two bills expanding the number of federal judges.      Over this same period, the nomination and confirmation      process filled only 43 vacancies on average each year,      causing the vacancy rate to more than double in the last 30      years. In the Ninth Circuit, the number of vacancies has      doubled in the last 22 months.       This fact alone would signal a serious problem but the      situation is very likely to get worse. Over the next decade,      the number of vacancies on the lower federal courts is likely      to increase because of the age of current judges and the need      to expand the judiciary to keep up with caseload growth. The      Justice Department has estimated that annual vacancies over      the coming decade will average closer to 60 positions each      year. In the last two years, however, only 41 federal judges      have been nominated and confirmed to the federal district and      appellate courts nationwide. Unless something changes quickly      and dramatically, at the end of the coming decade, half the      seats on the lower federal courts could be empty.       The Ninth Circuit is fully immersed in this growing crisis.      There are currently 18 vacancies among the 142 authorized      appellate and district court Article III judges in the      Circuit. The President has forwarded to the Senate      nominations for ten of these vacancies but the Senate has yet      to act on them. While the Senate has confirmed seven nominees      to vacancies within the Circuit since January 1, 2009, seven      have been pending without a confirmation vote for more than      120 days and three of these have been voted out of the Senate      Judiciary Committee and forwarded to the full Senate for      action with little or no Committee opposition.       As you know, our federal judiciary at all levels is a      beacon of justice across the country and around the world.      The judges who sit on our federal courts are dedicated to      their jobs and committed to both the rule of law and the      ideal of justice for all. Allowing the current judicial      vacancy crisis to continue and expand--as it inevitably will      if nothing changes--is unacceptable. The current situation      places unreasonable burdens on sitting judges and undermines      the ability of our federal courts to serve the people and      businesses of the Ninth Circuit.       We recognize that both the President's role in nominating      individuals to serve as federal judges and the Senate's role      in reviewing and determining whether to confirm those      nominees are solemn and serious duties. The health and      integrity of an entire branch of our government depends on      the faithful and careful execution of these duties. We      believe, however, that a crisis in one of our branches of      government also demands swift, effective, and appropriate      action from the coordinate branches. According to the Library      of Congress, from 1977 to 2003, the average time from      nomination to confirmation for lower federal court judges was      less than 90 days. Current vacancies nationwide have been      pending for an unsustainable 516 days. On average, the      vacancies filled by the 41 judges confirmed during the 111th      Congress were pending 803 days from vacancy creation to      confirmation. We can and must do better.       For this reason, we ask you to make a commitment to a      confirmation vote in the Senate for each judicial nominee      within no more than 120 days after the Senate receives a      nomination from the President. We will make a similar request      of the President to forward nominations to the Senate within      no more than 120 days after the President learns of a      judicial vacancy. While Congress will ultimately need to pass      legislation to expand the federal judiciary, filling the      current vacancies in a more timely manner will do much to      alleviate the immediate crisis and improve the delivery of      judicial services to those who come before the federal      courts.       We are convinced that with your leadership and that of the      President we can solve the vacancy crisis facing our federal      courts. We urge you to make a clear and open commitment to      address the vacancy crisis in the Ninth Circuit as      expeditiously as possible. Thank you for your consideration      of this request.           Sincerely,         Todd D. True (Chair), Seattle, WA; Steve Cochran (Past-           Chair), Los Angeles, CA; Robert A. Goodin, San            Francisco, CA; Margaret C. Toledo, Sacramento, CA;            Janet L. Chubb, Reno, NV; Miriam A. Vogel, Los Angeles,            CA; Robert S.
