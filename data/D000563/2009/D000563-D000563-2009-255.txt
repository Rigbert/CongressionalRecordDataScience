I would say to the Senator from Ohio the difference is obvious. With Medicare, anyone who shows up age 65 is eligible for coverage, no questions asked, other than your age and whether you have contributed over the course of your lifetime. These health insurance companies cherry-pick the healthiest people they can, then try to deny coverage where they can as well, and that is how they make their profits.
