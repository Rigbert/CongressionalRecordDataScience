Speaker, I thank the gentleman for yielding.  I have come to the floor today to join my colleagues in addressing the serious issues of the Republican budget and the draconian cuts to education. The American public understands the importance of education. They understand now more than ever that we have to prepare the best educated young people for the challenges ahead. They want overwhelmingly to invest more resources, both Federal resources, local resources, in good, solid education for their youngsters and for the whole community.  Unfortunately, this budget takes exactly the opposite track. It disinvests in good, solid, well-established, innovative education programs.  Last Congress, we tried to move forward with an agenda of education reform and support that would truly represent a sound investment in the future of this country, particularly at a time when the old industrial age is yielding to the new information age.  Years ago, 20 years ago, 30 years ago, it would not be unreasonable for a young person to think that with a high school education he or she could leave that high school, find an adequate job, make a living to support a family, and, in fact, spend a whole career with those skills learned in high school. Today, every American understands that this is not the case, that today, in order to be an effective worker in almost every level of endeavor, you have to have postsecondary skills, either college or some technical training. The thrust and the consequence of this Republican budget is that those opportunities for higher education will be diminished.  We also understand, and the American people understand, that we have to have a solid basis in order to start our young people off on a solid path to educational achievement. That is why last year we spent a great deal of time on a bipartisan basis in developing the Goals 2000 program. Goals 2000 is an attempt, I think a very worthy attempt, to act as a catalyst from the Federal level for school reform at the local level, to provide the kind of resources, the directions and the standards that would be very necessary to move our elementary and secondary education system forward.  We also in the last Congress understood that in too many schools the education process is sacrificed to a climate of violence and intimidation, a climate that is too often indicated by pervasive drug use, and, as a result, we passed a Safe and Drug-Free Schools Act.  These legislative measures at the elementary and secondary level were important steps forward, but sadly, too, because of this budget, those initiatives will not receive the resources that are necessary to carry on that important work.  At the level of higher education, understanding, as the American people understand, the need for advanced skills, we sought to strengthen those existing programs, like the Pell grant and the Stafford loan program to make access to higher education something that would be available and affordable for all of our citizens. It makes sense, particularly as we move from this industrial age to the new information age which demands higher skills for everyone in our society.  Again, sadly, the thrust of this Republican budget is to undercut significantly the resources that will be available for higher education. This budget would cut student loan programs by more than $5 billion going forward for those young people that want to go on to higher education, postsecondary education.  This is going to be a tremendous burden on their lives and the lives of their families, because one of the persistent complaints, one of the persistent concerns that I hear from my constituents in Rhode Island, those working people which we all claim to represent, those working families, is that they have one or two youngsters in college and the cost of college is outrageous, and without adequate Federal assistance, they cannot send their children to the schools they want.  In some cases, they cannot send them to school at all or, in other cases, they have to make the very difficult choice of which child will be favored with a college education and which will be told, well, you have to fend for yourself in the job market without that education. That is a very, very cruel choice which I thought that we had basically prevented in the last 30 years by providing a strong Federal commitment to higher education. But, sadly, we seem to be going back to a point in time when those cruel choices were all too common.  All of this impacts mightily in the localities, the districts and the States that we represent. In my State alone, in Rhode Island, we estimate that next year we will lose about $14 million in resources for education, and that over the next several years, the next 7 years of this budget, we will lose more than $90 million.  Where will these cuts go to? First, I mentioned the Goals 2000 program. This is really the only money for reform and restructuring of our educational system that is available in my home State. It has been eagerly embraced by the commissioner of elementary and secondary education in my State, by all of the districts.  There is an active process, an exciting process of change that is being sponsored by this program; and, sadly, we will lose about $1.4 million roughly all of the money that has been committed. This will affect as many as 71 schools who are participating directly as schools in the program. This is going to set back reform which is necessary and which every American citizen recognizes is necessary. It will set it back perhaps fatally.  In terms of student loans, the budget cuts would raise the cost of a college education by more than $2,000 for over 36,000 college students and more than $9,400 for over 5,000 graduate students in Rhode Island.  Pell grants. Changes in the Pell grant program will reduce support to students in Rhode Island by nearly $2 million. An estimated 1,600 students in 1996 alone will be denied Pell grants as a result of this cut.  Title I program, another program very important to elementary and secondary education that provides compensatory education for low-income American. Under this budget, the funds would be cut by a total of about $3.5 million, and this has a real impact, not only again in the lives of these students but in the tax rolls in local communities. Because as the city of Providence and the city of Central Falls and the city of Pawtucket copes with these cuts, they have to turn, once again, to their very, very strained tax rolls to make up the difference, if they can make it up at all.  So this is not just a problem for the beneficiaries of the program. It is a problem for the fiscal health of our cities and towns in Rhode Island.  I mentioned before the Safe and Drug-Free Schools Act which so important last Congress, which directed resources to a problem that is gnawing at the heart not only of our educational system but of our society as a whole. That, too, is going to lose funds. These budget cuts result in about a $1 million loss in these funds, which are helping to keep programs going, to show young people that drugs are not anything but the path to destruction and that we have to choose another path.  I would also mention one other program which touches upon the issue of education and opportunities so importantly, and that is the national service program. Americorps in Rhode Island is a shining example of a program that is inspired perhaps by legislation but embraced by the business community and the local community as a whole. The director of Americorps in our State, Larry Fish, is the chairman of one of our largest financial institutions. We are very lucky to have every category of Americorps activity funded in Rhode Island.  We have a City-Year program, which young people are spending a year helping out all through the community. We have programs that are helping through the Children's Crusade to mentor young people in schools to help them get through school and get on into college. A wonderful program, but, once again, even though this is supported strongly with corporate contributions and corporate leadership in Rhode Island, this program, too, is being affected mightily, basically almost zeroed out, if not entirely. It would deny 450,000 young people in Rhode Island the chance to serve.  This program is so useful, too, because it embodies in my view the ethic that we should all have as Americans: serving our country, and by that serving getting a chance to go to school and educate yourself so that you can be better prepared as a citizen, as a worker, as an American. Sadly, again this program is being jeopardized by this budget.                              {time}  1500  Mr. Speaker, when we look at this budget and we look at the reality of the world, something is sadly wrong. At a time when we have to invest in education, at a time when our economic future is at stake and education will be the key to our success as an economy, as a society, as a world power, and as a source of opportunity for all of our citizens, we are turning our back on funding education.  This is a sad mistake which I hope we can rectify in the days ahead.
