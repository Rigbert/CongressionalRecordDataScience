Speaker, obesity and poor nutritional habits are growing problems in our Nation, particularly among our children and adolescents. Health costs alone will be stratospheric in the near future due to the poor eating habits of our youth.  The very foods children need for good nutrition are often grown in their own communities. Farm to Cafeteria projects across the country link farmers with local schools to serve students the freshest possible foods as part of the National School Lunch Program. When combined with nutrition education, farm visits, and school gardens, children learn to enjoy and even get excited about eating healthy--and at the same time family farmers strengthen their markets and community ties. While Farm to Cafeteria projects have proven cost-effective over time, schools often need assistance to cover the initial staff resources, training, and equipment required for a successful project.  To respond to this need, our colleague Ron Kind and I have introduced the bipartisan Farm to Cafeteria Projects Act (H.R. 2626) that is now a part of this bill. The Farm-To-Cafeteria provision establishes a $10 million competitive grant program to provide schools with up to $100,000 to cover these costs and garner long-term benefits for children, farmers, and their communities during the term of the reauthorization.  I ask my colleagues to vote for this piece of legislation, to show the country that we care about what our children are eating.                          ____________________
