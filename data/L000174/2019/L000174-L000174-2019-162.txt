President, I just note parenthetically that virtually every Republican and every Democrat in this body has voted for the bills that would open the government. Every single Democrat in this body is willing--if the Republican leader would bringthose bills back up--to vote for them, and the government would open. So I hope the Republican leader will allow the government to open. There are a lot of people who need to go back to work, and I will speak about this later today. It is going to be 10, 15 below zero in my home State at one point this week, making it more urgent that we reopen the government. We also have government contractors who would like to get back to work.                       Catholic Clergy Misconduct  Now let me speak about a different matter. I am going to speak as an individual more than as a Senator. My wife Marcelle and I, as Catholics, have shared the concern of many, whether Catholics or not, about the continued revelation of often gross misconduct on the part of some in the clergy and in the hierarchy of our church. We have seen this throughout the United States, including in our own State of Vermont.  I have rarely--rarely--spoken about religious issues in my capacity as a Senator, because I feel one's religion is private and certainly not political. However, I have spoken out about my concern and my dismay with what we have heard, and Marcelle shares those concerns with me.  I mention this because this past Sunday at mass at Holy Trinity Parish in the District of Columbia, we heard a sermon preached by Father Benjamin Hawley, a member of the Jesuits. When he finished his sermon, I will freely admit I wanted to stand up and applaud him. He spoke about what the church is finally doing in facing up to this, but then he spoke about how he was reacting and how one hopes we might react, what the reaction should be from the Pope straight down to every member of the clergy and every member of the laity. Except for some sermons preached by Marcelle's brother, Father Claude Pomerleau, I do not remember being so touched or affected by a sermon.  I had not met Father Hawley before, but after mass, I spoke with him, and I asked him if I could have his permission to put his sermon into the Congressional Record. He agreed.  I ask unanimous consent that the homily by Father Benjamin Hawley, S.J., of January 6, 2019, be printed in the Record at this time.  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in the Record, as follows:                  Homily for the Feast of the Epiphany       Today we celebrate the Feast of the Epiphany, the      appearance of Jesus the Messiah to the world.       In classical Greek the word ``epiphany'' can refer to the      appearance of dawn, as Isaiah, writing 500 years before      Jesus' birth, does in our first reading: ``See, darkness      covers the earth, and thick clouds cover the peoples; but      upon you the Lord shines, and over you appears his glory . .      . Raise your eyes and look about . . .''       This appearance can intimate--Jesus' touching your heart or      mine with peace in time of difficulty. Or the appearance can      be cosmic--the Prince of Peace revealed to Herod and to the      magi--and to our world today.       Is it possible to see Jesus' latest epiphany in three      recent events?       First, about 280 American bishops are in retreat just      outside Chicago--no lay staff, no other priests. Guiding      their retreat is Raniero Cantalamessa, a Capuchin priest, who      is the Preacher to the Papal Household. I have heard him      speak, and he is excellent.       Second, a hard-hitting eight-page letter from the Pope is      guiding their prayer.       Francis asks them to reflect on ``the steps you are taking      to combat the culture of abuse and to deal with the crisis of      credibility'' (page 1).       ``The church's credibility has been seriously undercut and      diminished by these sins and crimes, but even more by the      efforts made to deny or conceal them . . . (T)he mentality      that would cover things up, far from helping to resolve      conflicts, enabled them to fester and cause even greater hurt      to the network of relationships that today we are called to      heal and restore'' (p2).       ``Loss of credibility calls for a specific approach, since      it cannot be regained by issuing stern decrees or by simply      creating new committees or improving flow charts, as if we      were in charge of a department of human resources'' (p3).       Then, the Pope then takes them to task on infighting:       ``The loss of credibility also raises painful questions      about the way we relate to one another . . . (p3) This      requires not only a new approach to management, but also a      change in our mind-set, our way of prayer, our handling of      power and money, our exercise of authority and our way of      relating to one another and to the world around us . . .      (pp3-4).       Without (a) clear and decisive focus, everything we do      risks being tainted by self-referentiality, self-preservation      and defensiveness, and thus doomed from the start'' (p4).       ``Let us try to break the vicious cycle of recrimination,      undercutting and discrediting, by avoiding gossip and slander      in the pursuit of a path of prayerful and contrite acceptance      of our limitations and sins, and the promotion of dialogue,      discussion and discernment . . .'' (pp5-6).       Finally, third, the presidents of bishops conferences      worldwide will meet in Rome in late February in a meeting      organized by four church officials:       Blase Cupich, Cardinal-Archbishop of Chicago;       Oswald Cracias, Cardinal-Archbishop of Mumbai, India, and      member of the Pope's council of cardinals;       Charles Scicluna, Archbishop of Malta and head of      investigating abuses in the Vatican's Congregation for the      Doctrine of Faith; and       Jesuit Father Hans Zollner, president of the Center for the      Protection of Minors at the Gregorian University, the Jesuit      university in Rome.       The pope's letter seems to me right on target in tone and      content. A retreat for discernment is very Ignatian, and the      Vatican meeting will ensure worldwide applicability.       So, can you and I believe that Jesus' epiphany is the      motive force behind the bishops' retreat, the pope's letter      and February bishops meeting?       We are called by Jesus himself to be hopeful. But we are      also called to be thoughtful, discerning good and evil around      us. I find myself seesawing between hope and doubt, between      hope and fear, between hope and no-hope, as I reflect on the      good and evil. I want to have hope, but I have to admit that      having hope is hard, sometimes nearly impossible.       It is true that Jesus grew up and became the Messiah. But      Herod's murdering a generation of children went unpunished,      as far as I know, and the historical record on mass murderers      or mass abusers isn't promising.       I am grateful for what the bishops and Francis are now      doing. But I keep asking myself why it takes so much external      pressure to get them to do the right, decent thing that seems      so obvious and not even that hard.       Some days I feel like Candide, returning from his hero's      journey to cultivate his own garden. In my garden I can be      hopeful. But I can't live a solitary life. And when I re-     engage, I become discouraged when I find the bishops'      response so slow and so begrudging.       But then I wonder about how God's justice and mercy might      be made real in the next life, especially for bishops,      cardinals and popes, but for us too. I imagine Purgatory not      as a place of hellfire and smoke, but rather as a place where      kindly but determined angels would sit, like referees in      black and white stripped outfits, each one in comfortable      room in front of a large flat-screen TV, each with a recently      arrived soul.       In a gentle way the angel-referee would guide the deceased      not through an instant replay but a slow replay of their      lives, stopping the action and asking each bishop, cardinal      and pope--and each one of us--to reconsider individual events      in their lives, and asking questions like, What were you      thinking? How did that work out--for you and for everyone      else? If you had to do it again, how might you choose?       There would be no scoreboard, because God would want      everyone to win, and no time clock. Everyone would have time      and all eternity--with the angel-referee's prompting--to      rethink what they had said and done.       And some would have a very painful time of it, because      angels are messengers of God's justice. Their job is to      reveal justice to the minds of souls as yet living in      darkness. And the angel-referees would make the final call.       With that much time and such wise, persistent guides, most      would probably make it to die podium for their trophy. Angels      might have to guide a few of the obdurate to long-term      parking, but such souls would have had a chance and in the      end would have put themselves there.       In the meantime you and I are on the seesaw.       Jesus began his life in his mother's lap in the stable, as      the great artists have shown us, but surrounded by the blood      and death of children and the corruption of the Jewish king.       Jesus ended his life in his mother's lap, as Michaelangelo      shows us in the Pieta, still surrounded by the blood, death      and the corruption of civic and religious leaders.       My question to myself is always, Does it really have to be      this hard? And the answer seems to be, No, it doesn't have to      be. But, Yes, it is going to be this hard as long as people,      especially people in positions of power, make self-serving      choices. The blood, death and corruption are constants in      human life. And yet he is the Prince of Peace and the source      of our hope.       On this great Feast we can come to realize that, if you and      I have to live on the seesaw, then at least we can remain      anchored to hope there, because Jesus, the source of our      hope, accompanied by his Blessed Mother, has the power to      anchor us there in love.       So, in our Eucharist today let's share divine love and hope      with one another in communion and leave here, imbued with new      hope to share with our world, so the world too can find hope      and peace.
