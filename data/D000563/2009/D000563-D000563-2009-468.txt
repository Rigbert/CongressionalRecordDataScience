I know the Senator from Rhode Island is a former prosecutor, as is the Senator from New Mexico. When we come to the competitive nature of insurance companies--I know the Senator from Rhode Island was with me at a hearing recently in the Senate Judiciary Committee on the McCarran-Ferguson law, which in the 1940s exempted insurance companies--in this case, health insurance companies and medical malpractice insurance companies--from antitrust regulations, so that literally the executives of insurance companies--in this case health insurance companies--could all meet in a room and decide what the premiums would be in any given place in America, across the Nation. They could meet together and come to a common agreement as to which States would be dominated by which companies and, as I understand the McCarran-Ferguson law, the Federal Government would have no power to stop them.  We can stop virtually any other group of companies trying to do the same anticompetitive things, but there is no power to stop the health insurance companies because of McCarran-Ferguson under our Federal antitrust laws.  I say to the Senator from Rhode Island, does this not also suggest that when the health insurance companies threaten they are going to raise premiums, we ought to take them seriously? They have the power to do it,and they certainly have a long, rich history of doing that. So when they say: If you pass health care reform, we are going to raise premiums, count on it; they are going to do it.  If we do not create the competition of a not-for-profit public option health insurance company, they literally will not face competition.
