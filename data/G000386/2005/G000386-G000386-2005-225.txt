 President, this is another way of cutting back on the mortgage deduction, the charitable deduction, and the State and local tax deduction. When these provisions of phaseout of deductions were put in years ago, it was subterfuge for raising the marginal tax rate without raising the marginal tax rate.  From Iowa, we are very transparent. If one wants to raise the marginal tax rate, raise the marginal tax rate but do not do it by subterfuge. Besides, this amendment is not germane. I raise a point of germaneness.
