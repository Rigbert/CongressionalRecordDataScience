Mr. Chairman, I yield myself such time as I may consume, and let me just begin this debate by saying that today one of the most important pro-life amendments will be up before this Congress.  It is the amendment that separates abortion from family planning in our overseas population control programs. It is a policy that was in effect during the Reagan-Bush years and effectively erected a fire wall between family planning and the promotion of abortion on demand around the world, where approximately 100 countries protected their unborn. And regrettably they are under siege by organizations like Planned Parenthood and others in trying to bring down these laws.  So that is what the amendment is all about. I understand there will be a substitute that, frankly, is a fake, and we will talk about that during the debate.  Mr. Chairman, I reserve the balance of my time.  The CHAIRMAN pro tempore. Is the gentleman from California [Mr. Berman] the designee for the gentleman from Indiana [Mr. Hamilton]?
