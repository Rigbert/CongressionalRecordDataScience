Again, I say--and you emphasized it with your lifelong love of the Nigerian people and your knowledge of them--I think most Americans would be very encouraged to know just how strongly faith-filled the Nigerian people are. Whether they be evangelical, Catholic, or Muslim, they take their faith seriously. They are very ethical people, great people, very good business people.  If infrastructure and roads and bridges and the like were to become even more accomplished throughout Nigeria--as Nigeria goes, so goes the rest of Africa, it is often said--they will be a great trading partner. They are already a huge trade partner of the U.S., but that will grow exponentially, going forward.  Again, I have always been impressed with the faith of so many Africans, in general, but the Nigerians' faith in God is extraordinary.
