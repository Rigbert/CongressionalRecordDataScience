Southern California is fortunate to have dedicated religious organizations that willingly and unselfishly give their time to make their communities a better place to live, work and worship. From August 24, 2008 to August 27, 2008 Amos Temple Christian Methodist Episcopal, C.M.E., Church in Riverside, led by Pastor Julio A. Andujo, will serve as host for the 2008 Episcopal District of the Christian Methodist Church Conference.  The Conference will take place at the Riverside Convention Center in Riverside, California. The Right Reverend Bishop Henry M. Williamson, Sr., Presiding Prelate of the 9th Episcopal District of the C.M.E. Church will convene the annual conference.  The Christian Methodist Episcopal Church came into existence following the issuance of the historic Emancipation Proclamation, which signaled the movement from slavery to freedom, and gave former slaves the dignity and honor to worship in their own church.  On December 16, 1870, in Jackson, Tennessee, 41 delegates from the Colored Annual Conference of the Methodist Episcopal Church South organized their own separate and independent religious organization, chose a name for their Church and met all the requirements of the American Methodism.  The C.M.E. Church successfully met the challenges of providing higher education by establishing such historically African-American colleges as Lane College, Jackson, Tennessee, 1882; Paine College, Augusta, Georgia, 1882; Texas College, Tyler, Texas, 1884; Miles College, Birmingham, Alabama, 1905; and the Phillips School of Theology, 1958, Atlanta, Georgia.  Through the years the C.M.E. has shown a remarkable sensitivity to the spirit of changing times as evidenced by the 1954 resolution by the General Conference to change the name from the ``Colored Methodist Episcopal'' to the ``Christian Methodist Episcopal Church.''  The C.M.E. Church has continuously shown a commitment to higher education, civic pride and spiritual leadership. Under Bishop Williamson's leadership, the 9th Episcopal District has embraced his ``One Church One School Community Partnership Program'' which involves churches and schools in partnership to teach young people to value life and learning.  The Christian Methodist Church is truly a pillar in the community of Riverside, California and throughout the state and country. I commend the members and leadership of the C.M.E. for their dedication to worship, to their neighbors and to the Christian way of life.                          ____________________
