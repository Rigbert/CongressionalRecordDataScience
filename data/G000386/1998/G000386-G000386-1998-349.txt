 President, today I am proposing a private relief bill, under the Immigration and Nationality Act, that would classify Regine Beatie Edwards as a child, and therefore, allow her to become a citizen of the United States.  This bill originates from a request of Mr. Stan Edwards, a United States citizen and Regine's adopted father, concerning his daughter's naturalization application. Regine Beatie Edwards was born on August 3, 1980 in Germany and arrived in the United States with her mother on October 16, 1994. In 1997, Mr. Edwards, on several occasions, contacted the Immigration and Naturalization Service to obtain the proper form to apply for his daughter's naturalization. In response, the INS sent Mr. Edwards the form N-643, Application for Certificate in Behalf of an Adopted Child, and notified him that the adoption must be completed and that the application must be submitted by his daughter's 18th birthday. On January 13, 1997, Regine was legally adopted by Mr. Edwards. At this time, Regine was 16\1/2\ years old. After the completion of the adoption, Mr. Edwards delivered his daughter's application, in person, to the INS office in Omaha, Nebraska on March 27, 1997.  Over the following months, Mr. Edwards became concerned about the amount of time that had passed since the submission of the application to the INS. In January of 1998, the INS reported that Regine Edwards' application was to be denied because the adoption had not been completed by the child's 16th birthday and that the form N-643 was the incorrect form for application. This new information contradicted what the INS had previously told Mr. Edwards that Regine had to be adopted by her 18th birthday. The INS indicated that Mr. Edwards' daughter had met three of the four qualifications to qualify for citizenship. As a result of this misinformation, Regine did not meet the qualification of an adoption by a citizen parent before the child had reached the age of sixteen. In response to the incorrect information given in this case, the INS refunded the money for the N-643 application to Mr. Edwards.  I feel that Regine Edwards should not be denied citizenship due to the wrong information provided by the Immigration and Naturalization Service. The Edwards family fulfilled the qualifications that they were originally told by the INS were necessary. Unfortunately, Mr. Edwards was misinformed which has cost his daughter the opportunity for citizenship at this time. Mr. President, I ask you and my fellow colleagues to support this young woman by allowing her to fulfill her wish to become a United States citizen and not deprive her of this opportunity.                                 ______                                       By
