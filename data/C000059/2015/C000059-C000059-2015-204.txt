Chairman, I would urge a ``no'' vote on this amendment. I don't agree to the offset. The fact that we have an Oil Spill Liability Trust Fund, that should be accessed.  I will be happy to work with the gentlewoman to work with the authorizers where we can get more immediate response to these kinds of activities that happen from time to time around the country, but I urge a ``no'' vote on this amendment.  Mr. Chairman, I yield back the balance of my time.  The Acting CHAIR. The question is on the amendment offered by the gentlewoman from California (Mrs. Capps).  The question was taken; and the Acting Chair announced that the noes appeared to have it.
