 President, I ask unanimous consent that when the Senate considers the conference report to accompany the DOD authorization bill, the conference report be considered as having been read. I further ask that there be 2 hours for debate, to be equally divided between Senators Warner and Levin or their designees, and following the conclusion or yielding back of time, the Senate proceed to vote on adoption of the conference report, without any intervening action or debate.  I further ask consent that the Senate consideration of the conference report not be in order prior to 5:30 p.m. on Tuesday, September 21, 1999.
