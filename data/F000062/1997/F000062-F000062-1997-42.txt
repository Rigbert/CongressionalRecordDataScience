 830, the bill before us today, will improve the tools used by the Federal Food and Drug Administration to bring more, safe and effective drugs, biologics and medical devices to the American people more quickly.  FDA is one of our Government's most important agencies because FDA approves life-saving medicines and devices and FDA protects us from unsafe and ineffective medicines and devices. Thanks to FDA, products like defective heart pacemakers, dangerous intrauterine devices, and overheating infant incubators are not sold.  FDA's 2,100 scientists and 7,000 other employees monitor about $1 trillion worth of products each year, inspect over 15,000 facilities a year, and examine about 80,000 product samples. FDA finds about 3,000 products a year unfit for consumers and detains 30,000 imports a year at ports of entry.                      Hope for Cures for Diseases  Millions of Americans have serious, debilitating illnesses for which there is no treatment or cure. There are 3,000 to 4,000 genetic diseases alone. Cancer kills half a million Americans per year. Diabetes afflicts 15 million Americans a year, half of whom do not even know they have it. Fifteen thousand American children die every year. And, for children, the rates of asthma, bronchitis, sinusitis, heart murmurs, epilepsy, and anemia are on the rise. We put our faith in the medical industry and Government to find cures and therapies. Americans want an FDA that brings safe and effective drugs to market as quickly as possible to alleviate suffering, pain, and disease and to prevent death.  The bulk of the bill before us today, a bill to accelerate the approval of prescription drugs, biologics, and devices, is an important bill to the Nation and especially to my State. It is a good bill, except for section 807, ``National Uniformity'', provisions that could interfere with California's efforts to protect the public health laws.                           California's Role  California is the Nation's premier medical technology base, public and private. Many of the Nation's leading drug, biotech, and device companies collaborate with the State's nine academic medical centers and conduct some of the world's leading health research. The UC system has spawned 30 Nobel laureates. Forty percent of California's biotech companies were started by UC scientists.  The Nation's largest concentration of health care technology companies is in California who employ 165,000 people. California's 900 health care technology companies are producing leading edge products, for example, the first new therapy for cystic fibrosis in 30 years, Genentech; technology that enables doctors to do heart surgery without opening the chest cavity, Heartport; a cancer drug that is genetically engineered and stimulates the bone marrow to produce important white blood cells, Amgen; and linear accelerators for treating cancer, Varian, and intraocular eye lenses, Allergan.  California produces 19 percent of all U.S. medical instruments, 20 percent of all diagnostic materials, and 13 percent of all biologics. There are 915 drugs, biologics, and devices under development in my State.  So the bill before us is important to both the human health and the economic health of the Nation and of California.                             Key Provisions  The bill includes several improvements over current law that will bring more drugs, medical devices, and biotech products to people more quickly:  1. Extends User Fees: Extends for 5 years the Prescription Drug User Fee Act to accelerate drug and biologics approvals. The prescription drug user fees, enacted in 1992, have enabled FDA to hire 600 additional drug reviewers and FDA has cut drug approval times almost in half, from 29.2 months in 1992to 15.5 months in 1996, according to the drug industry. This means that patients have had access to drugs almost a year sooner. These include a new class of drugs for asthma; a new treatment for multiple sclerosis; five new cancer drugs; the first new insulin product in 14 years; and three new antiviral medicines for AIDS, including two protease inhibitors.  This bill reflects the agreement of the drug and biotech industries to pay over $500 million in new user fees over the next 5 years, which could bring to the public 1,000 medicines now in the pipeline. These renewed user fees could help FDA cut drug approval times even more, an additional 10 to 16 months.  2. Clinical Trials Database (the Feinstein-Snowe bill): Requires NIH to establish a database, including a 1-800 number, for patients and medical providers to obtain information on clinical trials on serious and life-threatening diseases. This provision incorporates S. 87, a bill I introduced with Senator Snowe, last August, was suggested by one of my constituents in a hearing of the Senate Cancer Coalition, which I co-chair. Facilitating access to information can help patients and their doctors learn about research underway and can expand the pool of research participants.  4. Pediatric Drugs: Provides 6 months of additional market exclusivity of a drug when the manufacturer, at the request of the FDA, conducts pediatric studies to support pediatric labeling for a drug.  According to the American Academy of Pediatrics, only 20 percent of drugs have been tested and proven to be safe and effective for use in infants and children. This creates serious problems for pediatricians who must prescribe with inadequate information or deny children important therapies. In a July 24 letter to me, they give the example of asthma and say that in most children it manifests itself by age five, but there is only one asthma drug labeled for children under age five.  5. Accelerating Approvals: The bill includes a number of provisions designed to modernize, streamline, and accelerate the drug and device approval process. For example, it allows products manufactured at a small or pilot facility to demonstrate safety and efficacy prior to scaling up to full manufacturing, unless FDA determines that a full-scale facility is necessary to ensure safety and effectiveness.  For biotech products, it establishes one license, rather than the current two, covering both the biologics or product license and the plant's manufacturing processes license . For medical devices it requires FDA to meet with manufacturers to establish the type of scientific data needed to demonstrate efficacy of the device and it requires FDA and the applicant to meet to evaluate the status of an application 100 days after submitting applications.               PreEmpting California's Public Health Laws  California has a long history of regulating nonprescription drugs and cosmetics and has led the Nation in many instances in protecting the public in these areas. For example, in 1981, California adopted a requirement that nonprescription drugs carry a label warning pregnant or nursing women to consult with their physician or pharmacist prior to using a drug. In the following year, FDA adopted the California requirement.  But section 807 of the bill, titled ``National Uniformity,'' restricts States' actions by prohibiting States from establishing or continuing, for nonprescription drugs, any requirement that is ``different from or in addition to or that is otherwise not identical with'' a Federal requirement. For cosmetics, Section 807 prohibits states from establishing or continuing requirements for packaging and labeling that are ``different from or in addition to or that is otherwise not identical with'' a Federal requirement.  California Attorney General Lungren, in a July 14 letter, cites the Sherman Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Law as an example. He argues, ``* * * we are concerned that this provision may be construed to preempt States from imposing any requirements on cosmetics or over-the-counter drugs, and could therefore prevent the State of California from enforcing significant laws dealing with the health and safety of its citizens in the absence of a specific FDA exemption.''  The California Department of Health Services has also raised concerns about the preemption language, concern about the bill's impact on their ability to protect the public health. I believe in allowing States to enact stronger laws to protect the health of citizens and introduced an amendment on September 15 to allow California's laws to stand.  I appreciate the colloquy of my colleague and the bill manager, Senator Jeffords, that clarifies the extent of preemption intended by the authors of the bill. Senator Jeffords clarified that it is not the intent of this bill to prohibit the state from issuing public statements to warn the public about public health dangers. He said that it is not the intent of the bill to preempt State enforcement authority such as California's power to embargo products and to license and annually inspect facilities. On advertising, he stated that it is not the intent of the bill to affect State laws that prohibit false and misleading advertising or to prohibit unsubstantiated claims for nonprescription drugs. My office will remain in communication with the State to determine if problems develop and work with Senators Jeffords and Kennedy in this regard.  The bill does include, at my request, an explicit protection--an exemption from preemption--for California's ``Proposition 65,'' a ballot initiative enacted in 1986 on a 63 to 37 percent vote which requires anyone exposing someone to chemicals known to cause cancer or birth defects to give a warning. Attorney General Lungren wrote on July 14 to Senator Jeffords, ``S. 830 [as reported from the Labor Committee] would, in the absence of specific FDA exemption, appear to prevent the State of California from enforcing both the Sherman Food, Drug and Cosmetic Law as well as Proposition 65, a state `Right to Know' statute, passed by the voters of California in 1986. * * * We therefore respectfully urge you to seek modification of your bill to address this issue.''  Proposition 65 has provided important protections to the public and has prompted manufacturers to reformulate products. Because of this law, for example, manufacturers removed toluene from nail polish, lead from antacids, and calcium supplements and leadfoil from wine bottles. I am pleased that the Senate agreed with my request to explicitly exempt proposition 65, preserving this important California law, and I thank my colleagues for their support.  I believe it is wrong to preempt California's progressive drug and cosmetic laws. The citizens of my State have chosen to safeguard the public health through a strong State law and I have worked to protect our State's laws in this bill.                               Conclusion  By extending prescription drug user fees, we can give FDA some of the resources it needs to bring products to the public and alleviate human suffering. I hope that this bill can move quickly to enactment so that the public will have a strong FDA.
