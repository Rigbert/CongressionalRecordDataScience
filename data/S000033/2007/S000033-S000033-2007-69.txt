 President, today I am introducing the Increasing American Wages and Benefits Act of 2007.  Since 2000, key economic indicators confirm that the economic security of Americans is moving in the wrong direction: nearly 5 million more Americans are living in poverty; nonelderly household income has declined by nearly $2,500; over 3 million manufacturing jobs have been lost; and 8.6 million more Americans are without health insurance. While the rich have gotten richer, every other income group over the past 7 years has lost ground economically, with the middle class and working families losing the most.  The Increasing American Wages and Benefits Act would begin to reverse this downward economic trend for workers employed in construction, forestry, ski resorts, stone quarries, asphalt paving, hotels, restaurants, landscaping, housekeeping and many other industries by reforming the H-2B guest-worker program.  Under current law and existing Federal regulations, employers applying for H-2B visas must first certify that capable U.S. workers are not available, efforts were made to recruit U.S. workers for these positions first, and the employment of guest workers will not adversely affect the wages and working conditions of similarly employed U.S. workers.  As documented by the AFL-CIO, Change to Win, the Southern Poverty Law Center and other groups, the H-2B program is frequently used by employers to drive down the wages and benefits of U.S. workers, while cheating H-2B workers out of earned benefits. These abuses have clearly undermined the legislative and regulatory intent of this temporary guest-worker program.  The Increasing American Wages and Benefits Act would reform the H-2B program to ensure that workers receive the wages and benefits they deserve and prevent employers from abusing the system.  Specifically, this legislation: requires employers to do a much better job at recruiting American workers first at higher wages before being able to hire H-2B guest-workers; provides the Department of Labor with the explicit authority to enforce labor law violations pertaining to the H-2B program; allows workers who have been directly and adversely affected by the H-2B programto have their day in court against unscrupulous employers; prohibits companies that have announced mass lay-offs within the past year from hiring H-2B guest-workers. Allows the Legal Services Corporation to provide the same legal services to H-2B workers as it provides to H-2A workers; requires employers to pay for the transportation expenses for H-2B guest workers both to the United States and back to their country of origin once the employment period ends; and provides other important protections for H-2B guest-workers.  This legislation improves and strengthens the H-2B program so that it can be used by employers during emergency labor shortages, while increasing the wages and benefits for both American workers and guest-workers.  I am proud that the Increasing American Wages and Benefits Act has the strong support of the AFL-CIO; the Service Employees International Union, SEIU; the International Brotherhood of Teamsters; the Southern Poverty Law Center; the Building and Construction Trades Department; the Laborers' International Union of North America; the United Food and Commercial Workers; the International Brotherhood of Electrical Workers; the Alliance of Forest Workers and Harvesters; the United Farmworkers of America; and the Farmworkers Support Committee.  I ask unanimous consent to have printed in the Record letters of support.  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in the Record, as follows:         American Federation of Labor and Congress of Industrial            Organizations,                               Washington, DC, September 19, 2007.     Hon. Bernard Sanders,     Dirksen Senate Office Building,     Washington, DC.       Dear Senator Sanders: The AFL-CIO strongly supports the      ``Increasing American Wages and Benefits Act of 2007,'' which      would strengthen necessary labor protections within the H-2B      seasonal non-agricultural guest worker program.       As demonstrated by a recent report issued by the Southern      Poverty Law Center, ``Close to Slavery,'' employers and      recruiters who seek to import seasonal workers through this      program have all too often engaged in questionable tactics      and subjected workers to exploitation. This exploitation      often goes undetected because the investigative and      enforcement mechanisms of the H-2B program are largely non-     existent.       Adequate enforcement of labor standards within the H-2B      seasonal guest worker program would not only help deter the      abuse of an imported foreign workforce, but would also      protect the wages and benefits offered to American workers,      who are unfairly forced to compete for jobs by employers who      appreciate the benefits of filling vacancies with a more      vulnerable workforce.       The suffering of one segment of our workforce has an      inevitable and damaging impact on every worker. We must stop      unscrupulous employers from padding their profit margins by      endangering workers and driving down wages and workplace      standards. We applaud your efforts to protect the living      standards of all who labor within our borders.           Sincerely,                                                   William Samuel,     Director, Department of Legislation.                                  ____                                        Immigrant Justice Project,                                  Southern Poverty Law Center,                               Montgomery, AL, September 17, 2007.     Hon. Bernie Sanders,     U.S. Senate,     Washington, DC.       Dear Senator Sanders: I write on behalf of the Southern      Poverty Law Center in support of the legislation you recently      introduced to reform the H-2B guestworker program. The bill,      ``The Increasing American Wages and Benefits Act,'' would      substantially improve the legal protections available to H-2B      workers and to American workers laboring in industries that      rely heavily on guestworkers.       Founded in 1971, the Southern Poverty Law Center is a civil      rights organization dedicated to advancing and protecting the      rights of minorities, the poor and victims of injustice in      significant civil rights and social justice matters. Our      Immigrant Justice Project represents low-income immigrant      workers in litigation across the Southeast.       During my legal career, I have represented and spoken with      literally thousands of H-2 guestworkers in many states.      Currently, the Southern Poverty Law Center is representing      workers in seven class action lawsuits on behalf of      guestworkers. We have also recently published a report about      the H-2 guestworker program in the United States entitled      ``Close to Slavery,'' which can be accessed at http://www.splcenter.org/pdf/static/SPLCguestworker.pdf.       Our report, which discusses in detail the abuses suffered      by guestworkers, is based upon thousands of interviews with      workers as well as a review of the research on guestworker      programs, scores of legal cases and the experience of legal      experts from around the country. As the report reflects,      guestworkers are systematically exploited because the very      structure of the program places them at the mercy of a single      employer and provides no realistic means for workers to      exercise the few rights they have.       The H-2B guestworker program permits U.S. employers to      import human beings on a temporary basis from other nations      to perform work when the employer certifies that ``qualified      persons in the United States are not available and . . . the      terms of employment will not adversely affect the wages and      working conditions of workers in the U.S. similarly      employed.'' Those workers generally cannot bring with them      their immediate family members, and their status provides      them no route to permanent residency in the United States.       The program is rife with abuses. The abuses typically start      long before the worker has arrived in the United States, with      the recruitment process, and they continue through and even      after his or her employment here. Unlike U.S. citizens, guest      workers do not enjoy the most fundamental protection of a      competitive labor market--the ability to change jobs if they      are mistreated. If guestworkers complain about abuses, they      face deportation, blacklisting or other retaliation.       Our report documents rampant wage violations, recruitment      abuses, seizure of identity documents and squalid living      conditions, among other things. H-2B workers simply have very      few legal protections under our current law.       In addition, H-2B workers cannot reasonably enforce the few      rights they have under our current system. Providing workers      a way to enforce promises made to them by employers and      giving them access to legal services attorneys are important      steps in helping workers combat abuse and protect their      rights.       In conclusion, current guestworker programs for low-skilled      workers in the United States lack adequate worker protections      and lack any real means to enforce the protections that do      exist under federal law. Vulnerable workers desperately need      Congress to take the lead in demanding reform of this system.      Passage of this bill would go a long way toward remedying the      abuses that vulnerable workers experience in U.S. guestworker      programs.           Sincerely,                                                       Mary Bauer,     Director.                                  ____                                          United Food & Commercial                             Workers International Union, CLC,                               Washington, DC, September 21, 2007.     Hon. Bernard Sanders,     U.S. Senate,     Washington, DC.       Dear Senator Sanders: On behalf of the 1.3 million members      of the United Food and Commercial Workers International Union      (UFCW), I am writing to thank you for introducing the      ``Increasing American Wages and Benefits Act of 2007.'' UFCW      supports this legislation that will improve the legal      protections to H-2B seasonal non-agricultural workers.       It is clear that the current temporary non-immigrant      programs have not worked as intended and it is long past the      time for reform. UFCW has long advocated for reform of      existing guestworker programs. Many employers and recruiters      who recruit and hire workers through this program have      engaged in questionable tactics, and many of the workers have      been subjected to exploitation.       In addition, we believe that many of these jobs could and      would be filled by American workers, especially if the      employers offer appropriate wages and working conditions to      attract domestic workers. The ``Increasing American Wages and      Benefits Act'' will increase the enforcement for the program,      deter abuse of guestworkers, and would improve the wages,      benefits, and working conditions offered to these workers and      all American workers, who are unfairly forced to compete for      these jobs.       UFCW has been a long-time proponent of reforming      guestworker programs because, in spite of the theory, the      real world impact is that they have created an underclass of      workers, have held down wages, discouraged reporting of      workplace complaints, and reduced workers' ability to      organize and collectively bargain. In addition, the result of      the existing programs is that they have engendered      discriminatory attitudes toward individuals who are afforded      neither full rights nor benefits on the job, nor      participation in our society. Our experience is that no      matter how many worker protections have been written into      temporary worker programs, the approach inherently provides      employers with the opportunity to exploit workers and turn      permanent jobs into low-wage, no-benefit, and no-future jobs.       UFCW supports your reform efforts and we look forward to      working with you to enact this important legislation.           Sincerely,     Michael J. Wilson,       International Vice President, Director, Legislative and      Political Action Department.                                       ____                                           Farmworker Justice,                               Washington, DC, September 19, 2007.     Re reform of the H-2B Temporary Foreign Worker Program.     Senator Bernard Sanders,     U.S. Senate,     Washington, DC.       Dear Senator Sanders: Thank you for introducing the      Increasing American Wages and Benefits Act to reform the H-2B      guestworker program for seasonal employment Farmworker      Justice, a national advocacy and litigation organization for      agricultural workers, has had substantial experience helping      U.S. and foreign workers affected by the H-2B program as well      as the H-2A agricultural guestworker program. Our research      and direct experience cause us to conclude that substantial      reforms of the program are needed. We support the legislation      and hope that Congress enacts it immediately.       Currently, the H-2B law instructs the Department of Labor      to prevent employers that hire H-2B guestworkers based on      claimed labor shortages from displacing United States workers      and from adversely affecting their wages and working      conditions. The law's provisions fail to achieve these      objectives. The law also fails to prevent exploitation of      foreign citizens who, due to their poverty and the temporary,      nonimmigrant status of the H-2B visa, are vulnerable to      accepting substandard and often illegal employment      conditions. Further, the Department of Labor's policies and      actions fail to meet the statutory goals. The H-2B law must      be improved and your legislation would do so.       The need for strong protections in guestworker programs has      been demonstrated time and time again, in the hiring of      Chinese workers in the 1860's to 1870's, in the employment of      Mexican workers in the Bracero guestworker program in the      1940's to 1960's, and in the H-2A and H-2B guestworker      programs. Many employers find guestworkers advantageous      because they usually come from poor countries, where wages      are a small fraction of those in the U.S., and often will      work at very high productivity rates for significantly lower      wages than will U.S. workers. Guestworker programs have      displaced U.S. workers and depressed wage rates.       Your legislation is also important because it would begin a      process of regulating the international recruitment of      guestworkers by labor contracting firms that are hired by      employers in the United States. The guestworker recruitment      system often enables the ultimate employers to escape      responsibility for the mistreatment of the foreign citizens.       While we support reform of the H-2B program, we remain      skeptical that any guestworker program is consistent with      America's economic and democratic freedoms. We are a nation      of immigrants, not a nation of guestworkers. In America,      workers should have the freedom to switch employers, demand      better wages and working conditions, join unions and become      citizens with the right to vote. Although reform is one      critical step to protect U.S. workers from displacement and      wage depression and guestworkers from exploitation,      ultimately Congress should consider abolishing the program      and replacing it with a system based on a true immigration      status for workers who are needed in this country.       Thank you very much for introducing the Increasing American      Wages and Benefits Act.           Sincerely,                                                  Bruce Goldstein,     Excecutive Director.                                  ____         Comite de Apoyo a los Transbajadores Agricolas--           Farmworkers Support Committee,                                Glassboro, NJ, September 19, 2007.     Re endorsement for the increasing American Wages and Benefits          Act.     Senator Sanders,     U.S. Senate,     Washington DC.       Dear Senator Sanders: CATA--El Comite de Apoyo a los      Trabajadores Agricolas, The Farmworker Support Committee, is      a grassroots migrant and immigrant worker organization whose      mission is to educate and empower workers so they are able to      defend their rights.       We at CATA acknowledge that the H-2B reform bill you have      prepared would provide greater protection to workers. Thank      you for your support in combating the abuse of current H-2B      workers.       We believe that maintaining equivalent wages between      American workers and guestworkers is critical for sustaining      appropriate working conditions and preventing the creation of      an underclass. We at CATA remain adamant that enforcement of      any legislation is key to its effectiveness at protecting      workers' rights.       We at CATA recommend further legislation to address the      portability of jobs to eliminate worker vulnerability under      the current law. We also insist on developing a mechanism for      H-2B workers to achieve permanent residence. Despite not      addressing these critical concerns that CATA has, the      Increasing American Wages and Benefits Act is a decisive step      forward for human rights.           Sincerely,                                              Nelson Carrasquillo,                                               Executive Director.                                 ______                                       By
