Chairman, while I recognize the gentleman's amendment is well intentioned, I have concerns about changing the caps under VOCA, and I want to make sure that there is a reserve fund for victims of crime to ensure that their needs are met.  If the gentleman will withdraw his amendment, I think we can work on this issue down the road to address his concerns.
