President, I am pleased that the Senate will agree to this resolution commemorating the 100th anniversary of the Long Trail and the Green Mountain Club. In March 1910, James P. Taylor, a teacher from Vermont, fulfilled a dream held by many when he founded the Green Mountain Club, and created a long-distance trail to extend from Massachusetts to Canada.  Spanning over 273 miles, the Long Trail is the oldest long-distance hiking trail in the United States, and has survived many floods, hurricanes, and harsh Vermont winters. The Long Trail's scenic and varied landscapes, from the alpine peaks of Camel's Hump and Mount Mansfield, to quiet woodland trails and mountain streams, have delighted countless tourists who have visited the Green Mountain state. Several Senators, a Secretary of Agriculture, and even a President have all enjoyed the trail.  It is only through the hard work of the thousands of Green Mountain Club volunteers that the Long Trail has flourished and grown during the last century. The Green Mountain Club has resisted efforts to build highways or commercial developments that intersect with the Long Trail, and helped to maintain pristine Vermont forestland that we all love for future generations to enjoy. They have protected the habitat of many important woodland species, including the black bear, the moose, the bobcat, and migratory songbirds.  I was pleased to secure funding to help the Green Mountain Club renovate their headquarters and visitors center in 2008 in anticipation of the centennial, so that Vermonters and tourists alike can enjoy Vermont's natural beauty for another 100 years. I join with all Vermonters, and the thousands of people from across the United States and around the world who have enjoyed the beauty of the Long Trail, in celebrating this centennial celebration.
