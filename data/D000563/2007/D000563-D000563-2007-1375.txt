President, the Senate has heard this song before. We heard it 2 weeks ago, and we have listened as seven or eight Members on the other side have come to the floor repeatedly day after day. They have sent letters and held press conferences saying they earnestly want us to move forward on this issue, though they voted against it. They voted against the motion for cloture that would have brought us to a debate on the issue, and it is on their own legislation.  We offered them two Republican amendments, the Warner amendment and the McCain amendment, one opposing the surge and one supporting the surge. They wouldn't accept it.
