 President, today I honor Ms. Gloria Martin, a legal assistant to the Battalion Commander, 1st Battalion, 210th Aviation Regiment, Fort Rucker, AL. Ms. Martin was hired at Fort Rucker in January of 1980. She has 24 years of exemplary and dedicated service to the United States Army and Fort Rucker.  This morning, the Army will honor Ms. Martin with the Army Outstanding Employee of the Year with a Disability Award. Later today, Ms. Martin will be honored by the Department of Defense as the Army's recipient of the DoD Outstanding Disabled Employee of the Year Award. Ms. Martin will also be honored with the Meritorious Civilian Service Award.  Ms. Martin was born on August 13, 1955, to Paul and Mallie Martin in Opp, AL. Ms. Martin has five brothers and sisters, including her twin sister Gladys. While Gladys was born healthy, Gloria suffered from serious abnormalities that she has battled her entire life. The debilitating effects of scoliosis, neurofibromatosis and osteoporosis required a series of major back surgeries, the first when Gloria was 5 years old making her childhood very difficult. Through all the surgeries and many months of recovery and therapy, Gloria showed great courage and strength by working extremely hard to complete her school work to remain with her peers. She completed elementary school on time, and she also completed high school on time. She went on to complete a business course as a member of the Dean's List at Douglas MacArthur Technical College and worked two jobs before being hired at Fort Rucker.  Gloria faced another major back surgery in 1992 and, despite complications that required a prolonged absence, she returned to her job at Fort Rucker with the same fierce determination and strength of will that had made her such a popular and respected colleague with so many of her fellow employees. A back injury in 2000 that left her with a compression fracture in her middle back did not deter Gloria from continuing to perform her duties from home as best she could. But Gloria returned to work at Fort Rucker with the help of a walker and cane even though she was in constant, often severe, pain.  Gloria Martin's tenacious and courageous service to the Army and Fort Rucker is being very rightly rewarded. She has a wonderfully supportive family, and she also loves her church, the First Assembly of God in Kinston, AL. She has held many leadership positions in her church and participates in community service activities. In a recent Army Flier article, Ms. Martin put her experience in perspective when she said, ``I think it's made me a stronger person because I grew up going to the Hospital and to doctor appointments a lot. I feel like it has strengthened my faith because when you have a disability, you have to depend more on God. My faith gives me confidence in my abilities. It gives me the strength to get up in the morning. I know that my faith in God and His care has enabled me to keep working.''  Gloria Martin is a very special lady, and I am very proud to join the Army and Department of Defense in honoring her tremendous accomplishments and extraordinary service to our military. She is a role model for us all. She is an example for so many others with disabilities and a true testament to what faith and personal courage can accomplish. She has touched many lives, and I thank her today for her service.                          ____________________
