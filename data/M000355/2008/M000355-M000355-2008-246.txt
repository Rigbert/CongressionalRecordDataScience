 President, our greatest successes in this Congress have come when both sides work together. We have seen it many times, from last year's Energy bill to the economic stimulus package. We started down the same path when we began the Medicare discussion a few months ago. Both sides wanted to prevent cuts to physicians in the Medicare Program, preserve access to the quality medical care our seniors have come to depend on, and improve the program with things such as electronic prescribing. Unfortunately, the majority walked away from these bipartisan discussions. With the deadline for action approaching at the end of the week, frankly, we need to pass a bill.  I am willing to consider many different options. Senator Grassley drafted a bill that would protect Medicare benefits for seniors and that could be signed into law by the President. It should be passed today in the Senate, but the majority has passed on an opportunity to do that.  I am going to resist the temptation to launch into a speech like my good friend from Illinois about how many times legislation has been blocked by the minority. I think the finger-pointing at this point on this bill is ridiculous. We have a couple of weeks to pass it. We need to get together and pass it.  If the other benefits and improvements to Medicare are unacceptable to the majority, my side is willing, as I suggested a few moments ago, to extend the bill passed in December of last year for 18 months, with a 1.1 percent update for 2009. It was acceptable enough to pass 6 months ago by unanimous consent, so it should be acceptable enough now. It is critical we prevent these cuts from taking effect. This bill would do that. The majority, unfortunately, has objected to that path.  It is some cause for confusion. I thought our friends on the other side were interested in preserving seniors' access to physicians from being compromised. As physicians face a 10.6 percent cut in Medicare reimbursement, we need to be working together. I know I speak for myself as well as Senator Grassley when I say we remain hopeful that the majority will stop playing partisan politics and return to the negotiating table so we can quickly pass this much needed legislation.                          ____________________
