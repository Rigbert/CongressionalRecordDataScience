President, I introduce a bill to establish Medicare Health Savings Account, HSAs. This bill will make HSAs available under Medicare in lieu of Medicare Medical Savings Account, MSAs. I have long been dedicated to quality health care and believe that seniors should have the ability to make their own decisions regarding their health care, so they can receive the health care they need and deserve. As a senior myself, I appreciate how imperative it is that we seniors be provided with a wide array of choices.  My desire to see my fellow Oklahomans and all Americans receive the best possible health care is evidenced by my involvement in various health-related issues. I have always been a champion of rural health care providers. In 1997, I was one of the few Republicans to vote against the Balanced Budget Act because of its lack of support for rural hospitals. At that time, I made a commitment to not allow our rural hospitals to be closed and am pleased we finally addressed that important issue in the Medicare Modernization Act of 2003 by providing great benefits for rural health care providers as well as a voluntary prescription drug benefit to seniors. In 2003, I also co-sponsored the Health Care Access and Rural Equity Act, to protect and preserve access of Medicare beneficiaries to health care in rural regions.  In order to assist my State and other States suffering from large reduction in their Federal Medical Assistance Percentage, FMAP for Medicaid, I introduced a bill in the 109th Congress to apply a State's FMAP from fiscal year 2005 to fiscal years 2006 through 2014. The purpose of this legislation is to prevent drastic reductions in FMAP while revision of the formula itself is considered.  I am a strong advocate of medical liability reform and have consistently been an original cosponsor of the Medical Care Access Protection Act and the Healthy Mothers and Healthy Babies Access to Care Act. These bills protect patients' access to quality and affordable health care by reducing the effects of excessive liability costs. I am committed to this vital reform that would alleviate the burden placed on physicians and patients by excessive medical malpractice lawsuits.  I have also worked with officials from the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services, CMS to expand access to life-saving Implantable Cardiac Defibrillators and many other numerous regulations that would affect my rural State such as the 250 yard-rule for Critical Access Hospitals.  As a supporter of safety and medical research, I have co-sponsored legislation to increase the supply of pancreatic islet cells for research and a bill to take the abortion pill RU-486 off the market in the United States.  In response to the shortages of flu vaccines experienced in years past, I introduced the Flu Vaccine Incentive Act to help prevent any future shortages in flu vaccines in both the 108th and 109th Congresses. My bill removed suffocating price controls from government purchasing of the flu vaccine while encouraging more companies to enter the market. Also, my bill freed American companies to enter the flu vaccine industry by giving them an investment tax credit towards the construction of flu vaccine production facilities.  As a result of my sister's death from cancer and a treatment we learned about not accessible in the United States that might have saved her life, Senator Sam Brownback and I introduced the Access, Compassion, Care and Ethics for Seriously-ill Patients Act, ACCESS, in the 109th Congress. This bill offered a three-tiered approval system for treatments showing efficacy during clinical trials, for use by the seriously ill patient population. Seriously ill patients, who have exhausted all alternatives and are seeking new treatment options, would be offered access to these treatments with the consent of their physician. I was pleased to learn that the Food and Drug Administration has announced a proposal to offer expanded access to drugs to terminally ill patients.  My resolution to designate April 8, 2006, as ``National Cushing's Syndrome Awareness Day'' was passed by unanimous consent in the 109th Congress. The intent of this resolution is to raise awareness of Cushing's Syndrome, a debilitating disorder that affects an estimated 10 to 15 people per million. It is an endocrine or hormonal disorder caused by prolonged exposure of the body's tissue to high levels of the hormone cortisol.  It was brought to my attention thanks to a staffer with Celiac Disease and an Oklahoma Celiac Support Group that there is a great need to raise awareness of celiac disease; therefore, I worked to get my resolution passed by unanimous consent to designate September 13, 2006 as National Celiac Disease Awareness Day. Celiac disease is an autoimmune disorder and a malabsorption disease that affects an estimated 2.2 million Americans. Celiac disease is, essentially, intolerance to gluten, a protein found in wheat, rye, oats and barley, as well as some medicines and vitamins.  Additionally, I have consistently co-sponsored yearly resolutions designating a day in October as ``National Mammography Day'' and a week in August as ``National Health Center Week'' to raise awareness regarding both these issues and have supported passage and enactment of numerous health-care-related bills, such as the Rural Health Care Capital Access Act of 2006, which extends the exemption respecting required patient days for critical access hospitals under the federal hospital mortgage insurance program.  As the Federal Government invests in improving hospitals and healthcare initiatives, I have fought hard to ensure that Oklahoma gets its fair share. Specifically, over the past 3 years, I have helped to secure $5.2 million in funding for the Oklahoma Medical Research Foundation, the Oklahoma State Department of Health planning initiative for a rural telemedicine system, the INTEGRIS Healthcare System, the University of Oklahoma Health Sciences Center, the Oklahoma Center for the Advancement of Science and Technology, St. Anthony's Heart Hospital, the Hillcrest Healthcare System, and the Morton Health Center.  As a long supporter of HSAs, I believe all people should have access to them since they provide great flexibility in the health market and allow individuals to have control over their own health care. Medicare MSAs have existed since January 1, 1997, revised in December of 2003, but they have not worked. No insurer whatsoever has yet offered any Medicare MSA under the current law. To fix this problem, my legislation creates a new HSA program under Medicare that incorporates a high deductible health plan and an HSA account while dissolving the existing Medicare MSA.  In tandem with my efforts, the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Service, CMS, are launching an HSA demonstration project that would test allowing health insurance companies to offer Medicare beneficiaries products similar to HSA. This activity points to the Administration's support of HSAs and desire to see all seniors receive the best possible coverage.  As the July 13, 2006 edition of The Hill, explains, ``no legislation is pending that would integrate HSAs into the Medicare program .  .  .'' Thus, my legislation is necessary because real Medicare HSA reform is needed in order for seniors to have true flexibility and freedom of choice in their health care.  Under my bill, beneficiaries who choose the HSA option will receive an annual amount that is equal to 95 percent of the annual Medicare Advantage, MA, capitation rate with respect to the individual's MA payment area. These funds provided through the Medicare HSA program can only be used by the beneficiary for the following purposes: as a contribution into an HSA or for payment of high deductible health plan premiums. However, the individual also has the opportunity to deposit personal funds in to the Medicare HSA.  My bill also guarantees that seniors be notified of the amount they will receive 90 days before receipt to ensure they have time to determine the best and most appropriate HSA to accommodate needs. The bill also allows the Secretary of Health and Human Services to deal with fraud appropriately and requires providers to accept payment by individuals enrolled in a Medicare HSA just as they would with an individual enrolled in traditional Medicare.  Please join me in supporting this important legislation to give our seniors more choices regarding their health care.                                 ______                                       By
