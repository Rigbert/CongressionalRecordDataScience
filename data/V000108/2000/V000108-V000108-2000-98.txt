Speaker, it is with great pleasure and admiration that I congratulate Pastor Charles Sims, Jr. for his ten years of dedicated service to Saint Philip Lutheran Church in Gary, Indiana. One of the longest tenured Lutheran pastors to serve in the city of Gary, the members of St. Philip deeply appreciate Pastor Sims unfailing dedication to strengthening the parish community. To recognize his commitment to St. Philip Church, his parishioners are hosting a celebration dinner in his honor, entitled ``Staying the Course, Answering the Call,'' on November 11, 2000.  From modest beginnings, St. Philip has grown into an integral part of the area and neighborhood. The community activism and social awareness displayed by the congregation has made a lasting difference to the citizens of Gary. The parishioners' outreach and concern for their fellow man can be attributed in large part to the efforts of Pastor Sims. He has consistently shown the courage and leadership necessary to effect change in his community.  Originally named Tarrytown Lutheran Church, St. Philip was constructed in 1956 to serve the spiritual needs of African-American Lutherans living on the far west side of Gary. During its dedication service on January 20, 1957, the congregation renamed the Church. On October 22, 1967 the members of the parish dedicated a new educational wing to the church. Located at 3545 West 20th Place in Gary, the church has been a foundation of the community for many years.  Many ministers sustained St. Philip during its first 34 years of existence. Some of the preachers held permanent assignments, while others worked on a part-time basis. On October 21, 1990 the loyal congregation of St. Philip was blessed to have Pastor Sims, a graduate of Chicago University's Lutheran Seminary, accepted the call to lead the St. Philip parish.  Mr. Speaker, I ask you and my other distinguished colleagues to join me in congratulating Pastor Charles Sims, Jr. for his decade of tireless service to the members of St. Philip Lutheran Church and the Gary community. We are fortunate to have such an outstanding leader in our community, and I hope the people of St. Philip enjoy many more decades under Pastor Sims' spiritual guidance. His vision and spiritual mission have made Northwest Indiana a better place to live and work.                          ____________________
