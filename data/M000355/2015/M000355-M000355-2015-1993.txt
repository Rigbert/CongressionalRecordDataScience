 President, yesterday the Senate passed a bipartisan terrorism risk insurance bill and sent it to the President for signature. We worked with our colleagues in the House and on the other side of the aisle to quickly process that bill in a timely manner, and I thank the Speaker and all Members of the Senate for granting unanimous consent to set up those votes yesterday.  This morning we will continue to debate the motion to proceed to the Keystone bill. Chairman Murkowski and several members of the energy committee will be here to talk about this bipartisan infrastructure bill.  No votes are scheduled for today, but we will have a cloture vote on the motion to proceed on Monday night. It is my hope that Chairman Murkowski and Senator Cantwell can begin the amendment process under the regular order. Unfortunately, some of our colleagues on the other side of the aisle continue to block our effort to even get on the bill, and therefore the cloture vote on Monday is required.  Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.
