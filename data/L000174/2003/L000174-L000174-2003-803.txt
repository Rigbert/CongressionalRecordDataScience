With all the distinguished leaders, I never saw a single one of them do that, even when over and over again they had an opportunity to do it. Many times when I was chairman of the Agriculture Committee, when I was chairman of Judiciary Committee, when I was chairman of the Foreign Operations Committee, and when I was chairman of a number of others, we would have hotly contested issues and cases where the ranking Member, the only other person on the floor, had to leave the floor for a phone call or something like that. And, of course, I always protected their rights. That is something that has been done. It is the role of the majority leader, of course, to try to move legislation forward. It has always been my feeling, whether being in the majority or in the minority, that the majority leader should do that. I think we can. But I also think everybody should realize that last week was a rather extraordinary week with, first, the services in Houston, and then the services at the National Cathedral, and then the Republicans had a conference where they had to go on Friday. A lot was chopped into that week.  I have already said the three judges which are on the Executive Calendar--those which were actually going to be put over by the Republicans initially in the executive markup--I said to the distinguished Senator from Utah, let us go ahead and vote them out so we can get them on the floor. But also the majority leader may not be aware of the fact--at least from some of his statements--that during 17 months we did get through 100 of President Bush's judges and got all of them confirmed on the floor. I know the distinguished Senator from Utah would like to come close to that record, a record that was not achieved when the Republicans were chairing that committee and when President Clinton was here. I know he would want to try for that now. Of course, I would be happy to go forward on those and vote those three out. There will be rollcall votes. I realize that last year sometimes we had 10 or 12 at a time by voice vote. I think that escaped the attention of the press, the White House, the Republican Senate campaign committee, and others.  I yield the floor.                          ____________________
