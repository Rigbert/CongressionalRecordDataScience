29,000 jobs are created, and these are not just construction jobs. They are engineering jobs, technical jobs, and manufacturing jobs for the equipment that goes into this or the steel that goes into this. These are small business jobs with a small business set-aside.  We are foregoing an incredible stimulus to our economy, putting hundreds of thousands of Americans back to work or at work, building us yet again toward a world-class infrastructure.  It is just shameful this has been bipartisan forever. Washington, canals and highways; Lincoln, the transcontinental railroad; Eisenhower, the national highway system; and Ronald Reagan put transit into the national highway program--now, we are here limping along with yet another patch that isn't adequate, won't give us the recovery we need, and won't give us the transportation infrastructure we need to be competitive in the 21st century.  It is a very sad day. We should reject this proposal and get to work.
