President, today I wish to commemorate the Lowell Milken Center's 2012 National Projects Kick-off. Located in Fort Scott, KS, the Lowell Milken Center discovers, develops, and communicates the stories of unsung heroes who have made a profound and positive difference on the course of history. The Lowell Milken Center was opened in 2007 as an international nonprofit organization focused on creating a better future by developing projects that teach respect and understanding. This approach has been built upon student-driven, project-based learning so that Americans and people around the world may learn that each of us has the responsibility and the power to take actions to improve the lives of others.  During its 6 years of operation, the center has hosted over 15,000 visitors and reached over 550,000 students in 5,000 schools by telling inspiring stories of unsung heroes to influence change in behaviors and attitudes. In May, I had the pleasure of visiting the Lowell Milken Center. During my visit, I was able to meet the center's visionary and founder Norm Conard and its program director Megan Felt. Both are outstanding Kansans who have helped shape the way we approach history and learning. Ms. Felt has been honored nationally and internationally for her projects with students, and she is the founder of the internationally acclaimed work, ``Life in a Jar: The Irena Sendler Project.''  Irena Sendler was a devout Catholic who helped save the lives of 2,500 children during the Holocaust in Poland. She smuggled children out of a Warsaw ghetto and placed them with families not threatened by the Nazis. Toward the end of the war, she was arrested, severely beaten, and almost died for her actions to save these children.  In 1999, three high school students from Uniontown, KS, uncovered the remarkable story of Irena Sendler after Uniontown High School teacher Norm Conard tasked his students to compete in a National History Day contest. The students investigated an article published in 1994 mentioning Sendler and uncovered a heroic story that had gone virtually unreported. The students eventually met their hero and began exchanging letters.  This relationship inspired the students to write a play about Sendler's life and work. ``Life in a Jar: The Irena Sendler Project'' continues to be performed in Uniontown, KS, and has been preformed across the U.S. and in Europe. Fortunately, this project brought Sendler much overdue national attention in Poland, and in 2007 Sendler was nominated for a Nobel Peace Prize. In 2008, Irena Sendler passed away at age 98.  The Lowell Milken Center continues to pursue those often missed in history books and to promote cross-cultural understanding in the world. It is an honor to represent the Lowell Milken Center in the United States Senate, and I commend their efforts to promote the unsung heroes who changed the world through the 2012 National Projects Kick-off.                          ____________________
