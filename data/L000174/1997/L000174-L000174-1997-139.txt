President, I am delighted that the Majority Leader has decided to take up the nomination of Arthur Gajarsa to be a United States Circuit Judge for the Federal Circuit. Mr. Gajarsa is a well-qualified nominee.  The Judiciary Committee unanimously reported his nomination to the Senate on May 22, 1997. The Federal Circuit desperately needs Arthur Gajarsa to help manage its growing backlog of cases.  We first received Arthur Gajarsa's nomination in April 1996. He was accorded a hearing in the last Congress on June 25, 1996, and was unanimously reported by Judiciary Committee to the full Senate 2 days later. Unfortunately, his nomination was never acted upon because of the Presidential election year shutdown of judicial confirmations in 1996.  The President renominated Arthur Gajarsa on the first day of this Congress for the same vacancy on the Federal Circuit, which vacancy has existed since November 1995. This vacancy has persisted for more than 1\1/2\ years. He has the support of both Senators from Maryland. He had a confirmation hearing on May 7 and the Committee considered and unanimously reported his nomination to the Senate 2 weeks later. This nomination has been pending on the Senate Calendar since May 22. Apparently, after these 2 months on the Senate Executive Calendar without action or any explanation for its inaction, the Republican leadership is prepared to allow the Senate to approve this nomination.  I am delighted for Mr. Gajarsa and his family that he is finally being confirmed. He will make a fine judge.                          ____________________
