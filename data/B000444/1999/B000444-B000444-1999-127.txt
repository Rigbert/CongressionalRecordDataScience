 President, if it will help my colleagues, we have been trying to equalize this. I am about to yield to Senator Dorgan for 15 minutes, but I say to Democrats who are waiting to speak, we have Tuesday as well. I will be yielding in the 5-to-7-minute range for people who wish to speak after this, if people want to speak. We will reserve enough time at the conclusion of this debate.  I yield 15 minutes to Senator Dorgan who has been, quite frankly, the leader on our side of this issue who has been trying very hard for a year to get us to this point of debate. I yield 15 minutes to my friend from North Dakota.
