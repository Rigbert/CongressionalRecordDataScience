  Mr. McCOLLUM. The gentleman is quite correct, I am not in disagreement, though I would suggest that we might be able to modify the gentleman's amendment to make it more palatable, because I think there is a question about how an offender would know under the broad language the gentleman has who all his victims are. Modification Offered by Mr. McCOLLUM to the Amendment Offered by Mr.                                 SANDERS  Mr. McCOLLUM. Mr. Chairman, I would like at the appropriate time, if now is the appropriate time, to ask unanimous consent to modify the gentleman's amendment to add at the end of the words, ``and where the identity of such victims and other persons can be reasonably determined.''  If the gentleman would concur in that, I ask unanimous consent, Mr. Chairman, that modification be made to this amendment.
