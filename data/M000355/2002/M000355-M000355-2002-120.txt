 President, I have been privileged over the past 18 years to serve what I believe to be the greatest men and women on the face of the earth, that is the people of the Commonwealth of Kentucky. Serving the people of Kentucky means, among other things, looking out for the best interests of farm families and farming communities.  When I came to Washington, my first priority was to become a member of the Senate Agriculture Committee. A few years later, I was able to secure a spot on the Agriculture Appropriations Subcommittee. Over these past two decades, I have had the good fortune to develop strong and close relationships with the men and women in Kentucky who work the land and who put food on our tables. We have worked together through good times and through lean times. Let me say that we have had some memorable moments and historic victories. In fact, some of those victories have been called ``miracles'' by the farmers I proudly serve.  We will have more victories in the future, but this year's farm bill is not one of them.  Every farm bill, because of the nature of regional interests and political compromise, has winners and losers. However, I am particularly struck by the amount of money and the way it will be spent in this farm bill. Not because I do not believe the Federal Government has a financial role in assisting our farmers and rural communities, I do. But because I believe the Government's financial role should be fair and equitable and based on good farm policy. Far, far too many of the Federal tax dollars spent in this bill, will go to far, far too few farmers. I don't believe that is good for agriculture and I don't believe it is fair for Kentucky. Here's the central weakness of this bill, big farm operators will be made stronger and the small family farmer will be made weaker. For this reason, I cannot vote ``yea.''  The winners in this farm bill include: Large farm conglomerates who, because of the three entity rule and commodity certificates, will be able to receive almost unlimited Federal payments. Big landlords are almost certain to receive far higher cash rents for their land. State and local governments will recoup higher property taxes as a result of escalating farmland prices. Argentina and Brazil will be winners because they are likely to face less competition from the United States in soybeans. Trade lawyers will be retained to defend the United States from numerous complaints in the WTO. And, tax specialists will be hired to help millionaires defer or shelter incomes so as to keep their adjusted gross income below $2.5 million per year so they can continue to receive farm subsidies.  It is a fact that in the United States only 40 percent of farmers receive Federal payments under the farm bill. And from 1996 to 2001, the top 10 percent of that 40 percent received 69 percent of all USDA payments and the top 20 percent of recipients received 85 percent of all payments. The remaining 80 percent of recipients received only 15 percent of all payments.  In Kentucky, only 25 percent of our 90,000 farms receive Federal payments under the farm bill. From 1996 to 2001, the top 10 percent of that 25 percent received 78 percent of all payments. This left 90 percent of Kentucky's farmers who are recipients receiving only 22 percent of the payments. In short, 3 out of 4 Kentucky farms will receive almost no direct Federal benefit from this bill.  Surprisingly this is all in a bill written by proponents proclaiming that their goal in writing it was to provide a safety net for the small family farm. Yet in this farm bill, Federal subsidies to the largest and richest farmers are the hallmark of their work. These same proponents, who oppose ending the death tax, which would do more for the family farm than any amount of subsidies, write a bill that concentrates federal farm subsidy payments even more in the hands of very few large crop farmers.  In fact, the commodity title essentially tells the farmer that the market doesn't matter anymore. The target prices now become the producer's price guarantee. This policy will encourage over-production which, in turn, will lead to lower prices. This, of course, favors larger farms, because the more you produce the more Federal payments you receive. The more money you have will also enable you to purchase more land to produce even more. This will put pressure on the smaller family farms to keep up. That will be difficult and I fear more and more family farms in Kentucky and across America will eventually disappear.  Now let us look at some of the losers. The U.S. taxpayer will be paying a lot more and receiving very little in return. American families ultimately will have to pay more for produce, peanuts, fish and meat. Market-driven farm policy is taking a step backwards. Young and aspiring farmers will find it even harder to buy farmland. Cash renters of farmland will be faced with higher cash rents.  I do commend a number of the bill's provisions such as the conservation and rural development programs. The cattlemen in Kentucky will be able to apply for EQIP funds to make environmental improvements on their ranches. Dairy farmers, particularly those in Kentucky, will benefit under a new national program. The hardwood tree farmers in my State also gain under the Conservation Reserve Program, but some of the most important provisions regarding hardwoods were deleted from the conference report at the last minute, which disappoints me. And the Nutrition Title makes improvements in our food assistance programs that help the neediest of our citizens. But these bright spots are not enough for me to vote for an agriculture commodity policy that overwhelmingly benefits the larger farm operators at the expense of the small family farm.  I find myself in agreement with some of my colleagues on the House side.Congressmen John Boehner (R-OH) and Cal Dooley (D-CA), both members of the Agriculture Committee and the Farm Bill Conference who voted against the conference report, stated that ``On the whole, this bill ignores the lessons of the past and the truth of the free market. It represents the most sweeping non-military expansion of the Federal Government since the Great Society and will create more problems than it will solve.''  I also agree with editorials in some of the newspapers across the country and in my State which have roundly criticized this farm bill. The Bowling Green Daily News editorial had this headline: ``It's Good Ole Politics Down On The Farm,'' observing it's just election year politics deciding how our tax dollars are being spent. And the Kentucky Post/Cincinnati Post called the bill ``Congressional Hogwash.'' The New York Times, with whom I don't usually agree, stated that ``The farm bill agreed to by a House-Senate Conference Committee last week is a regrettable reversion to some of the worst policies of the past.'' Even the Wall Street Journal called it ``one of the porkiest farm bills in history . . .''.  Other opponents of this bill include: Senators Pat Roberts, Richard Lugar, Charles Grassley, and Chuck Hagel, all strong supporters of American agriculture; the Center for Rural Affairs; the Organization for a Competitive Marketplace; the Sierra Club; the Environmental Working Group; Environmental Defense; the Humane Society; and the editorial board of the Washington Post.  During an election year it's not uncommon for politicians to hold their noses and vote for expediency. I could just vote yes and try not to upset anyone, because there will be many in Kentucky who will disagree with my vote. I cannot in good conscience say to my farmers, the overwhelming number of whom operate small family farms, that I believe this farm bill would be good for them in the long run. I don't.  I am therefore going to oppose this farm bill because it spends too much on too few, sets U.S. agriculture policy back 10 years by taking the forces of the market-place out of agriculture, probably violates our trade agreements, and most importantly I believe it hurts the small family farm, and therefore rural Kentucky.  To understand my decision on this farm bill, you have to understand the nature of the Kentucky farmer. We are proud to have more than 90,000 farms in our State. These farms, however, are not large farms. They are not the large, plantation-style farms managed and controlled by corporate boards. The average farm in Kentucky is 151 acres and is dwarfed by the size of the average 434 acre farm in the United States. These are the family farmers that I look out for and fight for every day.  It is these small family farms, that I believe are ultimately shortchanged by this bill, a bill that will put the government in charge of America's farms, cost roughly $180 billion over 10 years during a time of war and growing budget deficits, increase subsidies by 70 percent, including America's first national dairy subsidy, and funnel the bulk of those subsidies to a handful of large corporate farms.  This farm bill may be good politics, but it's terrible policy. It will serve some farmers in Kentucky, but not enough. For those reasons, I have no choice but to vote no.                           HARDWOOD FORESTRY  Mr. President, hardwood forests and related industries comprise one of the lead agricultural commodities in my State of Kentucky. I was pleased that versions of the farm bill considered by the Senate Agriculture Committee included incentives for expansion of hardwood acreage in Kentucky and throughout the United States. Particularly, I was pleased to have helped develop provisions in the Conservation Reserve Program recognizing hardwood forests for their unparalleled conservation value. Hardwood forests are one of our Nation's greatest naturally renewable resources providing a diverse landscape for wildlife, soil conservation, and improvements in water and air quality. And the aesthetic value of trees with seasonal changes in foliage cannot be disputed among tourists and our constituents enjoying their surrounding landscapes.  Unfortunately, in the final hours of the House-Senate Conference the incentives for hardwood forestry were scaled back with no opportunity for re-consideration, and in my opinion, no justification. In reviewing the final conference report, I was particularly concerned to see that an uncontentious provision with no financial impact was removed. This provision would have instructed the Secretary of Agriculture to ``take such steps as may be necessary to ensure that all hardwood sites annually enrolled in the conservation reserve program are reforested with hardwood species appropriate for the site being planted, and that the highest possible enrollment priority and conservation value is assigned to hardwood sites being offered for planting with hardwood species''.  I state my strong support for this hardwood target within the Conservation Reserve Program.
