Does the Senator from Iowa recall last year when there was a suspected leak of information from the Senate Intelligence Committee, the FBI, under Attorney General Ashcroft, called on every member of the Senate Intelligence Committee to submit to a polygraph--for every Senator to submit to a polygraph? I ask the Senator from Iowa, what is the likelihood that Attorney General Ashcroft is going to ask the highest ranking officials in the White House to submit to a polygraph and then disclose to the public whether or not they have agreed to do so?
