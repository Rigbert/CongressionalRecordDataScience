President, I think it is very obvious what is going on here. It has been 23 years since we have had a chance to vote on it. It probably will be the last time most Members--maybe all of the Members in this Chamber--will have a chance to vote to make English the national language.  Those who are offering this amendment today don't want English to be the national language. They use the word ``common,'' the common language.  Those opposing this amendment want an entitlement to have the Federal Government provide for language, services, and materials. They can do it now. If you pass this bill, they can still do it. It is just not mandatory. It is not something that can't be done; it doesn't have to be done. They say that national origin equates to language. Their claims are consistently refuted by the Federal Government, the most recent one being in 2001, the Sandoval case.  The opponents of this don't want people learning English but instead being served in foreign languages.  I think it is interesting that the word ``racist'' was used. I just wish the people here knew what has happened in the past and what I have been involved in in my State of Oklahoma. This is not the time to repeat what I said earlier. But the bottom line is I received the highest award given by the Hispanic community in the city of Tulsa. I started the first Hispanic community commission, and it is now a model for the Nation.
