We worked very closely with Senator Moran, Senator Shaheen, and many others, including Senator Gillibrand and Senator Murray, to come up with a package.  As the chairman announced previously, if this package had moved, itwould have also unlocked numerous other amendments that we had cleared on both sides. But, unfortunately, because of the objection of an individual whom the chairman has cited, we are now coming to final passage.  With that, I yield the floor.
