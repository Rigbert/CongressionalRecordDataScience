President, I have worked with my good friend from Iowa on accountability measures and will continue to do so but not for this amendment.  This is a one-size-fits-all. There is a reason the National District Attorneys Association and a reason the National Association of Police Organizations oppose it. This would make it impossible for small, rural communities to get bulletproof vests under the Leahy-Campbell bulletproof vest program. This would make it impossible for some of the small departments to have the money to pay for rape kits, so they would have to tell the rape victim: Sorry, we can't go after the person who raped you, even though they might come back, because we don't have the money. We don't have the money to test this rape kit.  This is a one-size-fits-all that is going to hurt law enforcement. It is going to hurt victims. We will pay the price of the person we lock up, but we won't do anything to help the victim? I oppose it.
