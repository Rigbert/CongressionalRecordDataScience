President, Vermont and the United States lost one of its most distinguished academics last winter. Leonard Rieser, a physicist, a professor, a dean, and chairman of the board of the Bulletin of Atomic Scientists, holder of so many titles that we couldn't repeat all of them, died at the same time his great gifts and talent were still expanding.  I knew Leonard and his wife, Rosemary, through their son, Tim Rieser. Tim has been the most extraordinary advisor to me for many years, and he holds the best attributes of his father: decency, a towering intellect, and a constant search for knowledge.  Leonard Rieser is a man who lived more in a decade than most people will live in a lifetime. He accomplished in a few years what others would be proud to have as their life's work. What is extraordinary is that he did it for decade after decade.  In Vermont and throughout the Nation, expressions of sorrow but also of admiration and gratitude for his life poured in. We have all benefited by his life. He leaves a great void, especially for his wife, his sons, Tim, Leonard, and Ken, his daughter, Abby, his grandchildren and all his friends.  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that just one of the many tributes written about him be printed in the Record at this point.  There being no objection, the tribute was ordered to be printed in the Record, as follows:      [From the Bulletin of the Atomic Scientists, Mar./Apr. 1999]                      Leonard M. Rieser, 1922-1998                            (By Mike Moore)       Leonard M. Rieser, 76, who chaired the board of the      Bulletin from 1985 to June of last year, died in December of      pancreatic cancer. His tenure as chairman spanned a      tumultuous era. When Rieser took the chair, the Bulletin's      ``Doomsday Clock'' stood at three minutes to midnight and      ``Evil Empire'' rhetoric still ricocheted back and forth      across the Atlantic.       But by late 1991, the United States and the Soviet Union      had signed the Strategic Arms Reduction Treaty, a coup      attempt in the Soviet Union had failed, and the United States      and Russia had begun to withdraw thousands of tactical      nuclear weapons from forward deployment. That fall, the board      voted to move the minute hand ``off the scale''--from 10      minutes to 17 minutes to midnight.       In speaking to the press after the meeting, Rieser      displayed the rooted-in-the-real-world optimism that      characterized his life. The Cold War was clearly over,      Leonard told the audience, as was the East-West arms race.      That was a cause for celebration, and it surely justified the      unprecedented seven-minute move. ``But the world is still a      dangerous place and governments continue to pour vast sums of      money and intellectual capital into weaponry. The Bulletin      has much work left to do. It will continue reporting on the      destructiveness of seeking military solutions to the world's      ills.''       He was surely right about the Bulletin having more work to      do. In 1995, the board moved the minute hand back onto the      scale, to 14 minutes to midnight, in part because of the slow      U.S. and Russian pace in cutting back nuclear arsenals. And      last June, the board moved the hand to nine minutes to      midnight, partly because of nuclear tests by India and      Pakistan, and partly because East-West arms reductions were      still agonizingly slow.       In December of 1942, Rieser, an undergraduate in physics at      the University of Chicago, enlisted in the army, but received      a deferment so he could finish his degree. After receiving      his baccalaureate, he was assigned to the Manhattan Project,      first in the Chicago laboratory and then at Los Alamos.       In later years, he seldom talked of his bomb-related work,      other than to say that he had no interest in pursuing weapons      work after the war. Al Baez, a physicist who met Rieser in      the late 1940s while both were graduate students at Stanford,      said they became lifelong friends partly because of their      mutual belief that scientists had a moral responsibility to      weigh the consequences of their work.       Rieser joined the Dartmouth College physics faculty in 1952      and remained active in Dartmouth affairs until his death. He      became dean of the faculty, provost, and the Sherman      Fairchild Professor in the Sciences. During the socially and      politically chaotic years of the late 1960s and early 1970s,      he helped transform Dartmouth from a small men's liberal arts      school into a more diverse coed institution.       Rieser retired as provost in 1982, the year he joined the      board of the Bulletin, but he remained chairman of      Dartmouth's Montgomery Endowment, which brings scholars,      artists, and political figures to the campus for periods      ranging from a week to a year. In 1984, he became the      founding director of the John Sloan Dickey Center for      International Understanding at Dartmouth.       Despite his decision to follow a largely administrative      track, he remained passionately committed to science, pure      and applied, and to the teaching of science. He was a member      of the American Physical Society, the American Association of      Physics Teachers, and the American Association for the      Advancement of Science (AAAS).       Rieser chaired the AAAS's Commission on Science Education      from 1966 to 1971, and he successively served as president-     elect, president, and chairman of the AAAS board in the early      1970s. He later chaired the association's Committee on Future      Directions and the Committee on Scientific Freedom and      Responsibility.       In 1974, Rieser was a co-founder of the Interciencia      Association, an organization based in Caracas that is      dedicated to uniting scientific communities in the Americas,      so they can more effectively promote the welfare of the      people. He later served as president of Interciencia, and he      was still a director at his death.       At various times, Rieser was president of the New England      Council on Graduate Education, an overseer at Harvard, a      member of the Commission on the International Exchange of      Scholars, a member of the Council on Humanities and Sciences      at Stanford, a trustee of Hampshire College, and a trustee of      the Latin American Student Programs at American Universities.       In 1990, Rieser became a consultant to the John D. and      Catherine T. MacArthur Foundation in Chicago. For four years,      beginning in 1993, he chaired MacArthur's Fellows program--     the so-called ``genius grant'' program in which scholars,      artists, and innovators of all description are awarded      handsome sums so they can more readily pursue their work by      freeing them of financial constraints.       The program's yearly awards regularly make headlines. They      have been applauded as being imaginative and visionary and      criticized for being too offbeat, ``too politically      correct.''       ``It was not a matter of `political correctness,' '' says      Adele Simmons, president of MacArthur. ``Leonard delighted in      finding people not already being supported by mainstream      institutions, and giving them an opportunity to look at      institutions and issues in a new way, getting people to      really think.''       Victor Rabinowitch, senior vice president of MacArthur,      said Rieser took particular     joy in mentoring younger people. ``He loved to play that      role. He was idealistic--but also realistic. He believed in      the goodness of people, a man of enormous decency. The      secretaries all adored him--he listened to them.''       An adjective often used to describe Rieser is      ``graceful''--in the sense that he was a considerate man, a      ``gentleman'' in the old-fashioned use of the term.      Listening, says Barbara Gerstner, assistant provost at      Dartmouth, was one of Rieser's greatest gifts. ``When he      conducted a meeting, he made sure that everyone's point of      view was heard and understood. A person could leave a meeting      unsatisfied with the result. But at least he knew he had had      a fair chance to be heard.''       MacArthur's Rabinowitch, who has attended high-powered      meetings throughout the world for most of his professional      life, says simply: ``Leonard was the most talented chairman I      have ever seen.''       Dorothy Zinberg, on the faculty at Harvard's John F.      Kennedy School of Government, recalls Rieser's ability to put      people at ease. She first met Leonard in the early 1970s,      when she ``parachuted into Washington'' to serve as the      ``token woman'' on the AAAS's Committee for Science and      Social Responsibility. It was a small but steller group that      included former Chief Justice Earl Warren and John Knowles,      then president of the Rockefeller Foundation, and Alan Astin,      a towering figure in Washington science policy. Zinberg, who      was then a young professor at Harvard, was ill at ease.      ``Don't worry,'' said Leonard. ``You have every right to be      here. Speak up.'' That she did, and she went on to serve on      several more aaas committees.       In the early 1990s, Zinberg was a consultant at the      MacArthur Foundation and often found herself working closely      with Rieser. ``Leonard challenged every statement to make      certain that no issue under discussion had been superficially      examined. Behind the boyish smile, the informal style, the      casual country clothes, and the droll humor lay a steely      determination to get things right.''       Leonard M. Rieser, according to those who knew him well,      did get it right.
