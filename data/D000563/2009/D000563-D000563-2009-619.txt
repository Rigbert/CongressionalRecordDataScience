That is where we want to take the money from to protect these jobs. The Senator said the TARP money was misspent, and we are saying we agree with the premise; that this is a better place to take money rather than to take it away from tax cuts to working families in the stimulus or the infrastructure projects that generate jobs.  I don't know that the Senator from Nebraska wanted to assume this role this evening. Occasionally, many of us are cast in these roles where we are objecting on behalf of other people who are not here. But I think when he reflects on this debate tonight, he will understand why Senator Boxer's approach to this is the most reasonable one. We are trying to protect 17,000 jobs across America. We are going to take the money out of the TARP funds from banks, and I think it is money well spent to create jobs across the United States. But to take it away from the stimulus program is to take away money that is going right now, today, into Nebraska for tax relief for your working families and into Illinois for the same.  I am sure most Republicans would agree that tax relief is a good thing. I myself think it is a good thing for working families. So I think what Senator Boxer has suggested is a much more responsible approach.
