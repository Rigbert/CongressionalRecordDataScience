Speaker, today I recognize and honor the life of Mr. George William Robertson, a community activist in Southern Maryland fondly known simply as ``Capt. Billy.'' Captain Billy was born in Baltimore on June 12, 1930, and grew up along the Potomac River. By the age of 19, he knew he wanted to live off the water and built Robertson's Crabhouse on the Potomac shores in Popes Creek. He purchased Capt. Drink's restaurant in 1986 and renamed it Capt. Billy's.  Captain Billy had many pastimes. In addition to his passions for the water and his restaurant, he owned Dahlgren Hardware Store in Virginia, was an avid horseman as he loved to race with friend Gene Euster, a zealous golfer, and a competitive bowler who was inducted into the Duckpin's Bowler's Hall of Fame. Another passion of his was cars, which he turned into a business by opening Capt. Billy's Auto Sales on U.S. 301 in La Plata. Every week with friend Dave Phillips, he attended car auctions throughout Maryland and Pennsylvania.  Captain Billy was diagnosed with gall bladder cancer in January 1999. Together with his friend Robert Mitchell, he sponsored a benefit golf tournament in August 1999 at Swan Point Golf Course in Issue. Four hundred golfers participated to raise $170,000 for the American Cancer Society. For his efforts to fight thedisease, the American Cancer Society recently presented him with the Excalibur Award. In addition, he was a strong supporter of Civista Medical Center in La Plata. At the first Mardi Gras Ball sponsored by the Physicians Memorial Hospital Foundation, he was crowned ``King Rex.'' Robertson also raised money for Richard R. Clark Senior Center in La Plata, Hospice of Charles County, United Way of Charles County, Melwood, local churches and schools, and supported Newburg Volunteer Rescue Squad, Bel Alton Volunteer Fire Department, and local softball and baseball leagues.  In closing Mr. Speaker, I would like to take this moment to speak on behalf of the people of Southern Maryland, for whom Captain Billy gave so much, and thank him for all that he has done to benefit our community and our country. We remember his life and the memories he has given us. On behalf of the people of my district, thank you Captain Billy.                          ____________________
