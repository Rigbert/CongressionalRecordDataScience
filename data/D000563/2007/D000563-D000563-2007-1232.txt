There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in the Record, as follows:                                 S. 956       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of      the United States of America in Congress assembled,     SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.       This Act may be cited as the ``Land Between the Rivers      Southern Illinois National Heritage Area Act of 2007''.     SEC. 2. FINDINGS.       Congress finds that--       (1) southern Illinois has a cohesive, distinctive, and      important landscape that distinguishes the area as worthy of      designation as a National Heritage Area;       (2) the historic features of southern Illinois reflect a      period during which the area was the strategic convergence      point during the westward expansion of the United States;       (3) the geographic centrality of southern Illinois ensured      that the area played a pivotal military, social, and      political role during the Civil War, which resulted in the      area being known as the ``Confluence of Freedom'';       (4) southern Illinois is at the junction of the ending      glaciers and 6 ecological divisions;       (5) after the expeditions of Lewis and Clark, the land      between the rivers became known as ``Egypt'' because of the      rivers in, and the beauty and agricultural abundance of, the      area;       (6) Native Americans described the area in southern      Illinois between the Mississippi and Ohio Rivers as the      ``Land Between the Rivers'';       (7) a feasibility study led by the Office of Economic and      Regional Development at Southern Illinois University      Carbondale that was revised in April 2006 documents a      sufficient assemblage of nationally distinctive historic      resources to demonstrate the feasibility of, and the need      for, establishing the Land Between the Rivers National      Heritage Area; and       (8) stakeholders participating in the feasibility study      process for the Heritage Area have developed a proposed      management entity and financial plan to preserve the natural,      cultural, historic, and scenic features of the area while      furthering recreational and educational opportunities in the      area.
