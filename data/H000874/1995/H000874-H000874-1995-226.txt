Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.  Mr. Speaker, for all of the reasons articulated by the distinguished gentleman from Louisiana, the chairman of the Committee on Appropriations, I rise in opposition to this motion. I think he is absolutely correct, and the reasons that he articulated were the reasons that undergirded the efforts of this House of Representatives to, in a fair and open manner, adopt legislation which would lead to a reasonable incremental adjustment in the pay of Members.  It is obviously a very politically difficult situation. No Member likes to vote on their raise, and, in fact, what we talk about here is not a raise in the classic sense. It is a cost-of-living adjustment; that is to say, a mechanism was established to keep Members even with the cost-of-living adjustment.  The gentleman from Louisiana pointed out that we do that for others, social security recipients, Federal retirees, and active Federal employees, some 2 million, as well as for members of the military. We do that so that their standard of living will not deteriorate as inflation occurs. That is the issue here, not a pay raise in the classic sense.  That resolution of a very thorny issue was arrived at through bipartisan work and agreement. The current speaker, Speaker Gingrich, was a part of that, Speaker Foley and the current minority leader, the gentleman from Missouri [Mr. Gephardt] was part of that, the distinguished ranking member of the Committee on Appropriations, the gentleman from Wisconsin [Mr. Obey] was part of that, and my good friend from California [Mr. Fazio] was a leader in that effort, the current chairman of the Committee on Appropriations was a part of that, the gentleman from California [Mr. Lewis], who was then chairman of the Republican Conference, was a part of that, in trying to deal with a very difficult issue, obviously, with our constituents so that they knew and we knew and our families knew what is the deal, how do we adjust congressional pay in a rational, reasonable way.  The failure to have done that over the years led to anomalies that outraged the American public and gave great fodder for talk show hosts.  What was that? As the gentleman has pointed out, for 3 or 4 or 5 years we would go with zero, and then because Members were falling substantially behind, the quadrennial pay commission would recommend a high figure, and we would take a portion of it, in one instance, for instance, a raise of $10,000, or approximately that figure. That is a very high figure when one hears about it being a raise and does not divide it by the 4 or 5 previous years that zero was the adjustment.  As a result, the public was outraged at our giving ourselves from this perspective such large pay raises. This, again, was an effort to avoid that consequence and to provide for an annual mechanism that would go into effect only in the event that Federal employees got a raise, so that if the other employees of the Federal Government did not get a raise, Members of Congress would not get a cost-of-living adjustment. We did that again to ensure that we were not treated differently.  We talked a lot about treating ourselves the same, covering ourselves by the same laws that we expect others to abide by, and that was the reason that we tied ourselves to other Federal employees. We are ultimately paid by the Federal Government, the Federal taxpayer. We are Federal employees, and if they did not get an adjustment, we felt we should not.  In this instance, they will get an adjustment, and the motion offered by the gentleman from Wisconsin will provide that we will not have an adjustment, and that will be the third year, and I do not think there is anybody on this floor that believes that next year the Members of Congress are going to have the ability or will to look their constituents in the eye and say, ``We are going to take one-fourth or one-half or three-fourths of or a whole of that adjustment which we have not taken.''                              {time}  1145  So, we will go 4 years in a row, and the difficulty that will then occur will be in 1997 there will be an effort, I predict, to do a larger number, a catchup, if you will, and the American public will then again say, ``Those guys don't get it. Why are they giving themselves such a big pay raise?'' And there will be no discussion about January 1993, or January 1994, or January 1995, or January 1996, or January 1997. That will be forgotten.  So, I rise to oppose this motion, not because I do not understand the concerns of my chairman, the concerns of my ranking member. I think I am a reasonably perceptive Member of this body in terms of the political realities of this body, and so I understand what the gentleman from Louisiana [Mr. Livingston] has said the realities are, and, having said that, I regret that we find ourselves in a position of suggesting this alternative.  Mr. Speaker, I yield such time as he may consume to the gentleman from California [Mr. Fazio], who has forever been a Member of this body who has taken a lot of flak, a lot of heat. He has had the courage to stand up for his 434 colleagues, but, much more importantly, for this institution, and for that I not only have great affection for the gentleman, but great respect.
