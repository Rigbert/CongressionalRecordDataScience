 I appreciate her team working with us to schedule that briefing for tomorrow. Here are the two areas in which we want to get a better understanding at the briefing:  No. 1, what preparations are being made to protect Americans?  No. 2, what are the administration's funding priorities given limited Federal resources?  Concern about the Zika virus is growing in our country, and protecting constituents, especially children, from a communicable disease is a high priority for all of us. I am looking forward to hearing more tomorrow about both the administration's proposed response and its priorities for combatting this disease.                          ____________________
