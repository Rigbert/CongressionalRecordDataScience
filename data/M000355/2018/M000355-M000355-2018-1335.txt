 President, yesterday, the Intelligence Committee took an important step toward confirming Gina Haspel to become the next Director of the CIA. A bipartisan majority voted to report her nomination favorably to the Senate. I look forward to promptly moving to a confirmation vote.  The committee's confidence is indicative of the strength of Ms. Haspel's testimony and her 30-plus-year record of CIA service. Throughout the process, she demonstrated candor, integrity, and a forthright approach to the committee's questions. She displayed the talent and expertise that make her uniquely qualified to face America's biggest national security challenges, whether in the area of counterterrorism or renewed international competition among great powers.  Out of the spotlight, whether at Langley or deployed abroad, Ms. Haspel has quietly earned the respect and admiration of those who matter most--the men and women of the CIA and distinguished current and former intelligence community leaders.  The safety and security of the American people depend on capable intelligence leadership. Gina Haspel is theright woman at the right time. Senators on both sides of the aisle agree. So I urge each of my colleagues to rise to the occasion and swiftly confirm our next CIA Director.                          ____________________
