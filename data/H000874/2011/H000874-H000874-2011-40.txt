Panetta's quote. I believe Mr. Panetta's quote is an accurate quote and, I believe, substantively correct.  Let me give the gentleman another quote from the former chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, Admiral Michael Mullen. I know the gentleman knows Admiral Mullen, who served so ably as the Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff.  He said, ``The most significant threat to our national security is our debt.''  He went on to say, ``And the reason I say that is because the ability for our country to resource our military--and I have a pretty good feeling and understanding about what our national security requirements are--is going to be directly proportional--over time, not next year or the year after, but over time--to help our economy.''  So I would agree with the gentleman that we need to reach a bipartisan agreement. I would hope the gentleman would share my view that we need to reach a bipartisan agreement on a big deal. A little deal, as the Speaker and I have discussed, will simply push off until next year a decision and the year after in just doing it incrementally. That will not give confidence to the markets. It will not give confidence to the business community. It will not help our economy either domestically or internationally.  So my concern, I tell my friend, is if we now walk away from the sequester, as we have walked away from too many agreements in the past, we will again remove the discipline, remove the incentive, remove the imperative, as the gentleman points out, for coming to a bipartisan agreement, which is Bowles-Simpson, Rivlin-Domenici, the Gang of Six.  As the 100, the 40 Republicans and 60 Democrats, as the 46 equally divided between Republicans and Democrats have said, we need to reach a balanced deal: a deal which will restrain and cut spending, a deal that will deal with entitlement sustainability over time, and a deal that will provide a revenue stream that will allow us to fund what we believe to be absolutely essential, of which, as the gentleman points out, and he and I agree, national security is one.                              {time}  1240  So I would hope that we would not walk away from that disciplinary incentive to, in fact, have Republicans and Democrats come to an agreement.  I yield to my friend.
