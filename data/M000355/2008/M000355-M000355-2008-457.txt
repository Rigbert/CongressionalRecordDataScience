 President, I say to my friend from Texas, he is entirely correct. There are multiple lawsuits pending against the companies. They are surely being pressured by their shareholders and their boards of directors on the issue of whether continued cooperation means the demise of the companies. The status quo, as the Senator from Texas indicates, is not acceptable. Not only that, but we know for a fact that the continuation of the status quo hampers the ability to go up on new targets prospectively, so we not only have a deteriorating situation in terms of continued cooperation from the communications companies--not because they are not public-spirited citizens, not because they don't want to help America, but because they run the risk of squandering all the assets of their companies and enhanced exposure to new actions that might occur by terrorists.  So the status quo is clearly not acceptable, I say to my friend from Texas. I think his question suggests the answer.  This is a very serious matter and I regret that we are where we are. We had gotten off, I thought, to a pretty good bipartisan start this year. I had hoped--and frankly expected--that we would be having another signing ceremony down at the White House on the Rockefeller-Bond bill in the next few days and we could breathe easy that we had done our job and had protected the American people to the maximum extent possible for the foreseeable future.  I yield the floor.
