Mr. Speaker, I rise today to include in the Record the following letter which provides information about my bill, H.R. 228, the Indian Employment, Training and Related Services Consolidation Act.                                                November 27, 2017.     Hon. Ryan Zinke,     Secretary, U.S. Department of the Interior,      Washington, DC.       Dear Secretary Zinke: We write today to provide information      about our legislation, the Indian Employment, Training and      Related Services Consolidation Act (H.R. 228 as     passed the House/S. 91 as reported by committee in the      Senate). Our legislation has bipartisan backing and the      support of a broad coalition of tribes and tribal      organizations.       During consideration of the legislation, a question was      raised as to whether any Head Start services would be      eligible for incorporation into a tribal ``477 Plan'' under      H.R. 228/S. 91. The answer is no--Head Start is an early      childhood education program, and does not fit into any of the      categories of eligible programs' purposes that are listed in      Section 6 of the bills. Head Start services are not eligible      under current law for incorporation into tribal 477 plans,      and will not be eligible under our legislation.       We wanted to take the opportunity to provide this      background should it be helpful in the future.           Sincerely,     Don Young,       Congressman for All Alaska.     Lisa Murkowski,       United States Senator.                          ____________________
