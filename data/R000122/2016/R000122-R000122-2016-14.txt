It is consistent, as the Senator has indicated, with the President's proposal with respect to force structure in Afghanistan and with our European Reassurance Initiative, where we are increasing our presence and cooperating more closely with our European allies. It is consistent with our position in the Pacific as articulated by Secretary of Defense Ash Carter. It is consistent with proposals that have been made in other areas, and it does not expand the authority of the President. It simply recognizes what he has asked not just of our Congress but more importantly of the men and women who wear the uniform in the United States. This instruction will help us in our deliberations, and I would thank the Senator and urge its passage.
