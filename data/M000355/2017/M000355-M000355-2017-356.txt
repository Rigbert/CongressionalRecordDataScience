 President, I further ask unanimous consent that the committee-reported amendment be withdrawn, the McCaskill substitute amendment, which is at the desk, be considered and agreed to, the bill, as amended, be considered read a third time and passed, and the motion to reconsider be considered made and laid upon the table with no intervening action or debate.
