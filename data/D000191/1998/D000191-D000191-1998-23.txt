Speaker, there is going to be a lot of talk today on the floor of the House about a surplus. Let us get one thing straight. There is no surplus. The so-called surplus, 100 percent of it is the Social Security Trust Fund. We are overcollecting today in Social Security taxes. Seventy-three percent of Americans pay more in Social Security taxes to the United States Government than they do income taxes, with the idea that that money will be available tomorrow and the day after to pay future Social Security benefits.  But guess what? The Republicans want to spend that money today. They want to over collect from 73 percent of the American public with the false promise of Social Security being there in the future, and they want to spend that money tomorrow in a new tax cut. That is the worst of bait and switch. At least they could have the guts to do both bills on the same day and say to the American people, ``Yes, we are spending your Social Security and tax cuts that will flow to a different group of people than paying the tax, but we think that's good policy. And don't worry, we'll somehow honor your benefits 10 and 15 years hence.''  This is bad legislation. The Republicans know it is bad. They want to give tax cuts. Yes, actually they are not bad tax cuts for the Republicans, probably the best tax cuts the Republicans have ever proposed because they are trying to hang Democrats out to dry. But we are not going to be hung out on the line here. It is the Republicans that are being hung out because they are spending the Social Security Trust Funds. They are not protecting the Social Security Trust Funds. What a magnanimous gesture. They will only spend 10 percent of them, and they will put the other 90 percent in a phony account in the Treasury that will be immediately borrowed and spent on other things.  Mr. Speaker, this provides zero protection for Social Security. What is worse, it spends the Social Security Trust Fund of tomorrow on tax cuts today.
