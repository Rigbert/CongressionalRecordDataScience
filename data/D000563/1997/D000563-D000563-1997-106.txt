President, I rise today to introduce the Employee Health Insurance Accountability Act of 1997. This measure will hold employer-sponsored health maintenance organizations accountable for patient injuries that result from their decisions regarding a patient's medical care.  Due to a loophole in the Employer Retirement Income Security Act of 1974 [ERISA], employer-sponsored health plans can escape responsibility for the effect their treatment decisions have on their patients' health. Many courts have held that ERISA preempts State lawsuits against the entities that provide employee benefits and retirement plans. This includes medical malpractice suits against an employer-sponsored HMO.  There are two primary victims under the current system. The first victims are the patients who are injured, because they are wrongfully denied treatment services by their employer-sponsored HMO's. Let me tell you just one story:  Due to her history of high-risk pregnancies, Ms. Florence Corcoran's physician determined that she should be hospitalized during the waning weeks of her pregnancy. Her employer-sponsored HMO disagreed and only authorized 10 hours a day of home nursing care. While the nurse was off-duty, Ms. Corcoran's unborn child suffered distress and died. Ms. Corcoran sued her employer-sponsored HMO, but the court held that ERISA preempted her claim. Ms. Corcoran, therefore, will never obtain proper redress for the death of her unborn child and her HMO will never be held accountable. She can only sue her doctor--not her employer-sponsored HMO--even though her doctor was not at fault.  Ms. Corcoran and others like her cannot bring suit in State court where they should rightfully receive redress for their losses. Instead, they are forced to sue in Federal court where they can only receive the cost of the medical benefit they were denied. Inshort, Ms. Corcoran's unborn child died needlessly, and the only penalty to the HMO is the few hundred dollars it would have cost to properly hospitalize her.  As Newsweek observed, if ``there's no financial penalty when [employer-sponsored] health plans are negligent, what's to stop these profit-driven creatures from delivering inadequate medical care?''  The other victims of the current system are the doctors who end up in court and are left holding the bag for the actions of the employer-sponsored HMO's. To quote the Chicage Tribune, ``[HMOs], which care for more than 60 million people, are telling courts across the country that they cannot be held responsible for medical malpractice in cases involving patients who receive care through an employer-sponsored health plan* * *. HMOs are shifting virtually all of the risk of patient care to physicians, even though the HMO's can force doctors to change their clinical decisions.''  Again, let me demonstrate with a real life example:  Mr. Basile Pappas was suffering from numbness in his arms and was unable to walk, so he sought treatment at a local community hospital at 11 a.m. The emergency room doctor on staff made a difficult diagnosis and determined that Mr. Pappas had a cervical epidural abscess, a condition that was compressing his spinal cord. The emergency room doctor correctly concluded that unless Mr. Papas was treated immediately by a spinal cord trauma unit he could suffer severe paralysis.  At 12:30 p.m. the emergency room doctor made arrangements to transfer Mr. Pappas to a local university hospital, the only hospital in the area with such a trauma unit. Mr. Pappas' employer-sponsored HMO, however, would not allow Mr. Pappas to be transferred to the university hospital because it was not part of his service plan. Even after the emergency room doctor explained to the employer-sponsored HMO the urgency of the situation, the HMO refused. Indeed, the employer-sponsored HMO's physician who denied the treatment request refused to even speak to the emergency room doctor.  The emergency room doctor expeditiously made other arrangements to transfer Mr. Pappas to a hospital with the appropriate facilities that could admit Mr. Pappas. Nonetheless, Mr. Pappas was not treated until 3:30 p.m. and now suffers from permanent quadripliegia resulting from compression of his spine by the abscess. A court determined that the employer-sponsored HMO was immune from liability due to ERISA, but the hospital and Mr. Pappas' physicians were left paying for Mr. Pappas' injuries although they had little to no culpability.  Congress clearly never intended ERISA to remove all consumer protection nor for it to be used as a tool by employer-sponsored HMO's to shirk their responsibilities. My bill, therefore, amends section 514(b) of ERISA to clarify that State medical malpractice suits against an employer-sponsored HMO are not preempted by Federal law.  The Employee Health Insurance Accountability Act resolves the current problem by doing three things:  First, the measure holds employer-sponsored health insurance plans accountable for the consequences of their treatment rules and coverage determinations. This will increase patient protection, and create a powerful incentive for employer-sponsored HMO's to provide necessity care.  Second, the measure provides patients with legal redress when their employer-sponsored HMO's treatment rules and coverage determinations cause them harm. Victims like Ms. Corcoran will no longer be left without the opportunity to seek just reparations for their injuries. And  Finally, the measure reduces the likelihood that doctors will be sued for coverage determinations beyond their control. They will no longer face lawsuits simply because injured patients cannot properly hold their employer-sponsored HMO accountable.  Thank you Mr. President for the opportunity to introduce this important initiative. I hope my colleagues will join with me and support the Employee Health Insurance Accountability Act in order to ensure that employer-sponsored HMO's can no longer escape liability for their actions.  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that a copy of the legislation be printed in the Record.  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the Record, as follows:       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of      the United States of America in Congress assembled,     SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.       This Act may be cited as the ``Employee Health Insurance      Accountability Act of 1997''.     SEC. 2. FINDINGS AND PURPOSES.       (a) Findings.--Congress finds that--       (1) employer-sponsored health insurers' treatment rules and      coverage determinations affect patients' receipts of health      care by restricting the health services that are available to      patients;       (2) physicians' behavior is affected by employer-sponsored      health insurers' treatment and coverage determinations;       (3) medical malpractice is almost exclusively within the      jurisdiction of the States;       (4) section 514(a) of the Employer Retirement Income      Security Act of 1974 (29 U.S.C. 1144(a) (``ERISA''))      generally preempts State lawsuits against the entities that      provide employee benefits and retirement plans while allowing      lawsuits against physicians;       (5) there is a split among the United States Courts of      Appeals on whether ERISA preempts medical malpractice suits      against employer-sponsored health insurers;       (6) in the jurisdictions in which the Courts of Appeals      have held that ERISA preempts medical malpractice suits      against employer-sponsored health insurers, patients who may      have been injured due to their employer-sponsored health      insurers' treatment and coverage determinations have been      left without a right of action under which to bring a lawsuit      to seek just redress for their injuries; and       (7) it is, therefore, necessary to amend ERISA to clarify      that State medical malpractice suits against an employer-     sponsored health insurer are not preempted.       (b) Purposes.--The purposes of this Act are as follows:       (1) To restore accountability to employer-sponsored health      insurers for the impact of their treatment rules and coverage      determinations on patients' health.       (2) To increase patient protection from adverse effects on      their health due to their employer-sponsored health insurers'      treatment rules and coverage determinations.       (3) To provide patients with legal redress when their      employer-sponsored health insurers' treatment rules and      coverage determinations cause them harm.       (4) To provide more equitable assignment of liability among      health care decision-makers so that plaintiffs are not forced      to attempt to hold physicians liable for the treatment rules      and coverage determinations of employer-sponsored health      insurers.
