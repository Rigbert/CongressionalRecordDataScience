President, I am pleased that the Senate is passing legislation to honor the contributions of John Marshall, the great Chief Justice of the Supreme Court, through the minting and issuance of a commemorative coin by the U.S. Treasury.  As an original cosponsor of S. 1531, the Chief Justice John Marshall Commemorative Coin Act, I have worked closely with Senator Hatch to do all that we possibly can to speedily pass this act into law.
