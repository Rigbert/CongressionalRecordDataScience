 President, the reversion of Hong Kong to the People's Republic of China is a historic event, the full impact of which may not be known for years. At midnight on June 30, the world watched as the flag of the United Kingdom came down over Hong Kong, the final chapter of over a century of the British Empire's presence in the Far East. July 1 dawned with the flag of China flying over Victoria Harbor, providing a great moment of pride for the people of China as Beijing recovered a territory lost in humiliating fashion to foreign powers.  For the cause of freedom, the reversion is a conundrum.  Some observers warn that China intends to trample Hong Kong's freedoms. After a decade in which millions have cast off the yoke of Communist rule of the Soviet Empire, the subjugation of the people of Hong Kong to the control of a dictatorial government in Beijing is surely a sad anomaly.  Others predict optimistically that in the end China, not Hong Kong, will be transformed by the new union. They point to the changes already underway in China, and foresee a more prosperous, open, plural, and democratic system for one-fifth of the world's population.  I believe the future of Hong Kong, like that of China, is not yet written. The actions of the United States will affect the ability of the people of Hong Kong to preserve their democratic freedoms and overall quality of life.  Visiting Washington recently on his first trip abroad as Hong Kong's Chief Executive, Tung Chee-hwa rightly took pride in the former colony's smooth transition to Chinese rule. But he also candidly acknowledged that preserving Hong Kong's economic vitality and expanding the democratic freedoms enjoyed by its 5\1/2\ million residents required not only a steady hand in Hong Kong, but also the sustained interest and support of the international community.  It is in this context that we must view the U.S.-Hong Kong extradition agreement.  Approval of the treaty is a risk, for it is predicated on a question which cannot be answered in the abstract. The question is this: will the Beijing Government adhere to its pledge to permit Hong Kong a high degree of autonomy for at least 50 years? In other words, will China abide by its promise to maintain ``one country, two systems?''  No one can answer that question definitively today--not the people of Hong Kong, not the British Government, not the Clinton administration, not even the gerontocracy in Beijing, which struggles to chart a course for China's modernization in the post-Deng Xiao Ping era.  Of course, there is always the risk that a treaty partner will prove to be unreliable. That risk is particularly acute here, where the treaty partner--the Hong Kong Government--will be overseen by a government in Beijing which has often failed to adhere adequately to commitments made to the United States.  Standing opposite that risk are the benefits that flow from having an extradition relationship with Hong Kong. For most of this decade, the relationship has undeniably been in our interests. Since 1991, more than 60 persons have been returned to the United States from Hong Kong pursuant to extradition requests, many of them for serious crimes such as narcotics trafficking. By contrast, we have extradited just seven persons to Hong Kong.  Moreover, the extradition treaty is a critical component of our overall law enforcement cooperation with Hong Kong authorities--cooperation which has proven enormously successful over the years in combating organized crime, drug smuggling, and international terrorism.  Finally, this treaty contains extraordinary protections against any attempt by Beijing to meddle with or politicize the extradition process.  Indeed, the treaty provides several protections against valid concerns that the PRC may renege on its pledge to permit Hong Kong to retain an independent judiciary. The treaty contains several safeguards; these include: First, a provision allowing the United States broad power to refuse to surrender U.S.nationals in cases relating to ``the defense, foreign affairs, or essential public interest or policy of the United States'' (Article 3); second, a provision permitting the Secretary of State to deny extradition if the request was politically motivated, or the person sought is likely to be denied a fair trial or punished because of his race, religion, nationality, or political opinions (Article 6); and third, a provision barring the retransfer of any fugitive beyond the territory of Hong Kong without U.S. consent (Article 16).  The Committee has added included two provisions in the resolution of ratification that provide additional protection. First, understanding No. 1 makes it plain that the United States will not permit the retransfer to the People's Republic of China of any persons surrendered under this agreement, unless the person being surrendered consents to the transfer. Understanding No. 2 makes a strong statement in support of the independence of the Hong Kong judiciary, by stating that any effort to curtail the jurisdiction and power of adjudication of the Hong Kong courts may be considered grounds for withdrawal from the Agreement.  In exercising its power to advise and consent, the Senate must balance the risks that China will interfere with the autonomy of Hong Kong against the likely benefits to U.S. law enforcement that will flow from the agreement. In my view, the benefits clearly outweigh the risks. And the safeguards in the treaty, in addition to the provisions in the resolution of ratification, provide strong protection of U.S. interests and of the rights of those persons who may be surrendered under the treaty.  By ratifying this treaty, the Senate will send a strong signal to the people of Hong Kong that we have confidence in their ability to make the unique ``one country, two systems'' formula work. We also send a strong message to Beijing that we will not tolerate any efforts to undermine the traditional autonomy and impartiality of Hong Kong's judiciary. I urge my colleagues to join me in supporting ratification of the Hong Kong extradition agreement.  Constitution and Convention of the International Telecommunication                                  Union       Resolved, (two-thirds of the Senators present concurring      therein), That the Senate advise and consent to the      ratification of the Constitution of the International      Telecommunication Union (ITU), with Annexes, signed at Geneva      on December 22, 1992, and Amendments to the Constitution and      Convention, signed at Kyoto on October 14, 1994, together      with Declarations and Reservations by the United States      contained in the Final Acts (Treaty Doc. 104-34), subject to      declarations and reservations Nos. 68, 73 and 82 of the 1992      Final Acts; declarations and reservations Nos. 84, 92, 97,      and 98 of the 994 Final Acts; and the understandings of      subsection (a), the declarations of subsection (b), and the      proviso of subsection (c).

(2) Geostationary-satellite orbits.--The United States      understands that the reference in Article 44 of the      Constitution to the ``geographical situation of particular      countries'' does not imply a recognition of claim to any      preferential rights to the geostationary-satellite orbit.
