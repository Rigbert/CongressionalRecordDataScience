President, I rise today for the purpose of engaging in a colloquy with my colleagues from the Senate Homeland Security Appropriations Subcommittee, Senator Stevens, Subcommittee Chairman Gregg and Subcommittee Ranking Member Byrd. We would like to discuss the intent of section 546 of the fiscal year 2007 Department of Homeland Security Appropriations conference report regarding the Western Hemisphere Travel Initiative, WHTI.  In 2004, Congress passed and the President signed into law the Intelligence Reform and Terrorism Prevention Act, which included a provision creating WHTI as a means of better securing our borders. The provisions require that all individuals, including U.S. citizens, present a passport or its equivalent in order to verify identity and citizenship when they enter the United States from neighboring countries, including Canada or Mexico. As currently set out by the administration, the law would take effect on January 1, 2007, for airports and seaports and on January 1, 2008, for land crossings.  As those deadlines loom ever closer, my colleagues and I have grown more and more concerned that the plan has been poorly planned and there is a considerable lack of adequate coordination not only among the Departments of Homeland Security and State, which are charged with implementing the initiative but also with the governments of Canada and Mexico. I fear that we face a train wreck on the horizon if the plan steams along as is.  The senior senator from Alaska most definitely recognizes how improper implementation of WHTI could impede the flow of people and goods across our borders. The residents of his home State especially would face unique challenges under WHTI because all Alaskans have to cross into Canada before entering the continental United States by land.
