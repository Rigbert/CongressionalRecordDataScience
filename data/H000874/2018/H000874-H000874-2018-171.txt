Speaker, reclaiming my time, I will look at those references.  I did vote to shut down, certainly, I think in--I am not sure of the January date. When we had the majority, won that vote, the majority leader came back to the floor within a few hours. We had a vote. We voted to open up the government. Almost every Democrat voted for that. The government opened, and then we got a deal.  So the issue that I asked the majority leader about he still has not responded to, notwithstanding our meeting in September, notwithstanding the representations made by the President of the United States, notwithstanding the fact that the court has said what was done was done incorrectly, and notwithstanding the President's request to solve this issue and send him a bill and he would sign it and take the heat for it.  I yield back the balance of my time.                          ____________________
