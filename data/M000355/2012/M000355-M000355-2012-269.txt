 President, I rise today in honor of MSgt Charles Hayes of London, KY. Master Sergeant Hayes served in the U.S. Air Force from 1972 to 1996, and was involved in both the Vietnam and gulf wars. Hayes volunteered to join at age 21 and continued to be a volunteer for the duration of his two-decade stint in the military.  During Hayes's extended period of time in the Air Force, he had the opportunity to visit a variety of foreign countries, including Germany, Turkey, and Thailand, just to name a few. Hayes enjoyed every aspect that went along with being a part of the Armed Forces. He flourished as a member of the U.S. Air Force in more ways than one.  What Hayes enjoyed most about the service was experiencing history in the making. Hayes remembers participating in the evacuation of Saigon, South Vietnam, in April 1975. It was a mission in which Hayes and his team were given the objective of recovering an American merchant ship that had been pirated by the Khmer Rouge navy. The ship was successfully recovered on May 13, 1975, and Hayes was an instrumental part of the operation, one that many of us remember paying close attention to while back home in the States.  Hayes also enjoyed the Air Force because it inspired its members to show initiative. In 1987, Charles was assigned public affairs duties for his section. He remembers how difficult and ``utterly impossible'' the men told him it was to get an article published in the base newspaper. Hayes took on the challenge of getting a story published head on, and that year he had 37 articles and 17 pictures with captions published in the newspaper.  Lt. Col. Richard Vaught recalls that Hayes was one of the best sergeants he has ever commanded. It wasn't unusual for those who worked with Hayes to speak highly of him. While serving as the squadron safety noncommissioned officer from 1990 to 1996, Hayes's unit received numerous honors and awards, including Best Small Unit Safety Program Award and Best Additional Duty Safety NCO Award.  Many different attributes have been used to describe Charles Hayes over the years. Talented, ambitious, reliable, and persevering are just a few of the countless positive references of the master sergeant. Lieutenant Colonel Vaught is recorded as saying, ``Charlie always knew how to get everything when nobody else could. If you go to war, he's the one you want to go with you. He'll get you everything and then some.''  Charles Hayes exemplifies every characteristic of a successful member of our Nation's Armed Forces. His dedication and service to our great country over 24 years will most certainly not go unnoticed and is the very cause of my standing here today. It is my wish that my colleagues in the Senate join me in commemorating MSgt Charles Hayes at this time.  There was an article published in Laurel County's local news magazine, the Sentinel-Echo: Silver Edition, in November of 2011. The article highlighted Charles Hayes and the outstanding dedication he has shown throughout the years in his involvement with the U.S. military. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that said article be printed in the Record.  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in the Record, as follows:          [From the Sentinel-Echo: Silver Edition, Nov. 2011]                           A Part of History                            (By Carol Mills)       Master Sergeant Charles Hayes, a Vietnam and Gulf War      veteran, volunteered to join the United States Air Force when      he was 21, serving from 1972 to 1996. He worked for 12 years      in security police and 12 years in computers.       What Hayes liked most about his 24 years of service was      being a part of history.       ``While my part was very small, the unit I was assigned to      (56 SPS, Nakhon Phanom RTAF, Thailand) was responsible for      assisting in the evacuation of Saigon, South Vietnam, and      Phenom Phen, Cambodia, in April 1975,'' 60-year-old Hayes      said. ``We were part of the recovery of the American merchant      ship, Mayaguez, which had been pirated by the Khmer Rouge      Navy. I lost 18 buddies on May 13, 1975, during the      operation.''       During the 1991 Gulf War, his unit (608 APS, Ramstein AFB,      Ramstein, Germany) was responsible for shipping all munitions      to the air bases in the desert, as well as thousands of tons      of other supplies.       ``I remember looking at what seemed to be miles of pallets      and wondering when we would get them all shipped down      range.''       After the Gulf War, Hayes's unit was kept busy supporting      United Nations' humanitarian missions in Eastern Europe and      Africa. In 1992, one of Russia's largest cargo planes arrived      at Ramstein AFB to receive donations. He was in charge of      ground safety while his unit loaded the plane.       ``We weren't able to use forklifts because the plane wasn't      configured for them. Because I was all over the operation,      the plane's crew must have figured I was a big wheel of some      kind and gave me three cases of Russian vodka.''       Hayes also liked the Air Force because it allowed him to      show initiative.       ``While sometimes routine duties were a little mundane,      additional duties allowed personnel an opportunity to show      initiative. In 1987, I was assigned public affairs duties for      my section. I was told that it was almost `impossible' to get      an article printed in the base newspaper and utterly      `impossible' to get an article published anywhere else.''       That year, Hayes had 37 articles and 17 pictures with      captions published in the base newspaper. Two articles were      published in command-level publications and two in a local      newspaper.       Lt. Col. Richard Vaught said Hayes was one of the best      master sergeants he ever commanded.       ``He's the type that if you needed anything done, he always      found a way to get it done when everyone else couldn't,'' he      said. ``He was the ultimate scrounger. I would say he was a      very talented individual. Charlie always knew how to get      everything when nobody else could. If you go to war, he's the      one you want to go with you. He'll get you everything you      need and then some. He just knew how to use all the various      avenues. I was quite happy to have him in my command.''       From 1990 through 1996, he was assigned the additional duty      of squadron safety non-commissioned officer. During his      tenure as safety NCO, his unit received a Best Explosives      Safety Program Award from both the command and USAF as well      as a Best Small Unit (under 600 personnel) Safety Program      Award. He also received a Best Additional Duty Safety NCO      Award.       Hayes also liked associating with other patriots.       ``When situations got tough, everyone got tougher,'' he      said. ``We all regarded a challenge as something to overcome,      not something to shy away from. Esprit de corps was highest      when things were toughest. I served with some of the best      people in the world.''       Hayes enjoyed the opportunities the Air Force had to offer.      ``I always held the attitude that I was stationed in the best      section of the best squadron on the best Air Force base in      the United States. I learned that education was the least      expensive hobby a person could have and completed a master's      in education before I retired.''       During his service he traveled throughout the British      Isles, France, Germany, Luxembourg, Belgium, Turkey,      Thailand, and several other countries to a lesser degree, and      has driven through every state except Maine, New Hampshire      and Vermont. He has also been to Alaska and Hawaii during his      service.       Before Hayes had lived in London, Ky., for five months, he      had spent more time in London, England, than in London, Ky.                          ____________________
