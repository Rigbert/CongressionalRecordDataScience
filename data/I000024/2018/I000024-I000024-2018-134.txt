President, I thank the Senator from Wyoming for the great remarks he made about Andrew Wheeler. You know, it is awfully hard to find anyone who knows him well who will say anything bad about him. I guess the only thing you can criticize him for is that he worked for me for 14 years.  But I will tell you, during that timeframe, over a 14-year period, I don't remember anyone ever accusing him of being unfair, of being negative in any way at all. But a couple of things were said, and I think I need to correct the record. I need to be the one to correct it because I am the guy he worked for over a long period of time--both in my personal office and in my capacity as chairman of the Environment and Public Works Committee. Because I know him so well, I have to correct the record on his behalf.  One allegation made against Andrew in a news article is that he retaliated against a witness at an EPW--that is Environment and Public Works--Senate hearing in 2005 because we were unhappy with the witness's testimony. Nothing in the news article was true or accurate. This was an article that came out just the other day.  The witness in question and the major source of the article was Mr. Bill Becker. He was then the president of STAPPA, the Association of State Air Directors. These are the State directors who are becoming more prominent in what they are able to get through.  Mr. Becker charged at that time that in retaliation for his January 2005 testimony, the committee launched an investigation into his organization's finances.  In reality, the investigation was actually launched almost a year before Mr. Becker appeared before the committee. That is a huge difference. The article cannot be true.  Prior to the hearing, my staff notified the minority staff of the committee that he was currently under investigation, and we recommended against calling Mr. Becker as a witness.  I still have a copy of the memo my staff prepared for me before the hearing in 2005, noting that they had notified the minority staff about the investigation. This is the memo, and I ask unanimous consent that it be printed in the Record.  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in the Record, as follows:  Timeline of EPA Grants Oversight Involving Federal Grants to STAPPA-                                 ALAPCO       March 3, 2004--EPW Committee hearing regarding EPA grants      management where EPA IG testified to an it audit involving a      non-profit receiving federal funding in violation of the      Lobbying Disclosure Act. Inhofe subsequently began a series      of information requests announced at the hearing and      thereafter gathering information concerning EPA grant      management.       May 4, 2004--Email to EPA requesting the amounts of EPA      grants awarded to the following organizations from 1988-2004:       Association of State Drinking Water Administrators       Association of State and Interstate Water Pollution Control      Administrators       Environmental Council of the States       State and Territorial Air Pollution Program Administrators       Association of Local Air Pollution Control Officials       Association of State and Territorial Solid Waste Management      Officials (An email was sent to EPA instead of a letter      pursuant to the request of the EPA citing administrative      convenience in responding to an email.)       May 20, 2004--Email to EPA following up on previous request      for grant amounts to previous requested groups.       July 9, 2004--Letter to EPA requesting information to      clarify material EPA provided in response to May email.       July 12, 2004--Telephone conversation with EPA Grants and      Debarment Director and EPA Project Manager of STAPPA-ALAPCO      grants regarding grants. EPW staff received previous      complaints concerning the particular funding arrangement for      STAPPA-ALAPCO. EPA confirmed that it has a special funding      relationship with STAPPA-ALAPCO as it provides funding      directly out of grants that are otherwise to be provided      directly to states, and other professional associations do      not have such a relationship. State that are members of other      professional organizations provide dues funding directly to      those organizations. EPA staff also referenced the House      Report language Inhofe used in his question to STAPPA-ALAPCO      as a specific directive to the EPA requiring state and local      air agency concurrence to continue the funding practice.                         STAPPA Funding Request        WE HAVE HAD CONCERNS ABOUT WHO THEY REPRESENT FOR YEARS       During the late 90's debate on Gasoline/Sulfur STAPPA took      a controversial position defending the auto industry against      the oil industry. At the time we received letters from 14      Governors taking the opposite position from STAPPA and heard      from several State Air Directors who complained that STAPPA      did not represent their views.            WE STARTED LOOKING AT THEIR FINANCES LAST SUMMER       May 4, 2004--You requested funding information on 6      different State associations, including STAPPA from EPA as      part of our Grants Oversight.       July 9, 2004--Requested additional info from EPA on all 6.       July 12, 2004--We requested more information from EPA on      STAPPA alone. We received no complaints about the other      organizations and STAPPA's funding arrangement appears to be      different from all of the others.            SENATE APPROPS STARTED LOOKING AT THEM LAST FALL       Fall 2004--Senate Approps Subcommittee included funding      language directed specifically at STAPPA                           NOTIFIED MINORITY       Prior to invite to testify, Inhofe staff told Jeffords      staff that we would be asking questions about their financing      and how they reach their decisions.       All of the IRS information we requested is available      publicly and is necessary to determine if they are giving the      EPA the same information they give the IRS. This is part of      our long term EPA grants management oversight.
