I have read the Constitution and seen what our job is. And, of course, we had a Republican President with a Democrat Congress at the time the Senator is speaking of. Now it is just the reverse; we have a Democrat President and Republican Congress. Obviously, there will be a difference from the beginning budget. The observation that I would make and would like to ask the Senator about is when we talk about the cuts, talk about the deficits--and the Senator was talking about the 1993 bill--in 1994, there was a tax increase that was recommended by the Democratic Party and by the President of the United States, Bill Clinton, that was characterized as the largest single tax increase in the history of public finance in America or anywhere in the world. I would like to ask the Senator two questions. He has been talking about the reduction that we are proposing in our bill in taxes, and I would suggest to the Senator that we are not proposing a reduction in taxes from the Senate even though I would personally like to have us do that. It is the House bill that is offering the reductions in their package.
