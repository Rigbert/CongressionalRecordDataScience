Speaker, I thank the gentleman for his comments.  First, let me say, as far as I know, the leadership didn't give any direction to the committee. The committee decided on its own that it thought that the cuts that were being proposed by the Republicans are very harmful to some very important programs in healthcare for seniors that the gentleman, in his previous remarks telling us what the schedule was, said were very important.  So the reason that we have concerns is we believe the offsets being proposed, Mr. Speaker, by the Republicans, and why we don't agree with the bill that is being brought forward is because we think it hurts the healthcare of millions of Americans.  Let me ask another question, Mr. Speaker, of the majority leader, and let me preface it with Mr. McCarthy said in response to my question about the CHIP program: Of course, it is offset.  Let me ask him a follow-up question.  Does the gentleman know whether the $7.2 billion for community health centers that provide primary care services to 26 million medically underserved Americans will be offset?  Mr. McCARTHY. Will the gentleman yield?
