 They took the number of $1.2 billion, which we passed last year and were supposed to continue this year, to reduce class size, only our commitment was to increase that to $1.4 billion so we would add on to those 30,000 teachers until we reached our verbal commitment of having 100,000 new teachers.  On paper, they took the $1.2 billion and put it into something called teacher assistance initiative. I have never heard of that. I do not know what it is. I have seen no language about it. I can tell my colleague one thing: sitting on the education committee in the Senate, it is not a program anyone knows about, and the language in the bill saysit is authorized, meaning we are going to have to go through hearings, pass a bill through the Senate and the House, and have it signed by the President before we leave in a few short weeks, and I just do not see that happening. Really it is smoke and mirrors.
