Speaker, I rise today to pay tribute to Green Bay Packers wide receiver Greg Jennings. Jennings, a native of my district from Kalamazoo, Michigan, was a star for the Packers in their recent 31-25 victory over the Pittsburgh Steelers in Super Bowl XLV.  Jennings began his football career playing for the Kalamazoo Central High School Maroon Giants. There, he was not only recognized for his accomplishments on the gridiron, but also as a basketball player, runner, and long jumper.  After high school, Jennings went on to play football at Western Michigan University where his athletic accomplishments continued to soar and he won the 2005 MAC Offensive Player of the Year Award. In 2006, Jennings was selected in the second round of the NFL Draft and signed to the Green Bay Packers. During Super Bowl XLV on February 6, 2010, he scored two touchdowns that helped to secure a Super Bowl victory for the Packers.  In his private life off the field, Jennings is a family man and a person of faith who continues to give back, including his work through The Greg Jennings Foundation. He is truly a model athlete and a treasure to southwest Michigan. True to his high school's moniker, Greg has truly been a Giant, both on and off the field. It is no wonder that the city of Kalamazoo proclaimed March 14th as Greg Jennings Day.                          ____________________
