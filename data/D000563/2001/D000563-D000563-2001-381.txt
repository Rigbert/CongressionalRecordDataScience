President, I will accept the statement of the Senator from Pennsylvania. I understand there is change, and with change there is pain. I hope we can do our best to be positive and constructive as the Senate leadership does change. I hope we can continue to show mutual respect for our colleagues, as I have great respect for the Senator from Pennsylvania. I think that is an important hallmark of this institution, and I think we should all make an extra effort to preserve that.                          ____________________
