President, as the distinguished Senator from Kentucky said earlier, we are on the Foreign Operations, State Department bill. We have virtually completed our work. There is a pending amendment. We are going to be ready very soon to go to third reading.  We have had a number of Members say they might have an amendment, and I am delighted to hear that, but if they ``might,'' they might want to do it while the bill is still on the floor because it is going to be gone.  Some of these amendments are very well thought out. Some Members have their press releases already written. But if Members want the press release released--as well as the well-thought-out amendment--one might want to do it while the bill is on the floor.  I have no desire to hold up this piece of legislation. Senator McConnell has no desire to hold up this legislation. We spent several hours of quorum calls Friday and today. If Members are serious about an amendment, bring it to the floor. Otherwise, from this Senator's point of view, as soon as there is not an amendment pending, I will have no objection to moving to third reading.  I suggest the absence of a quorum.
