 President, today I wish to pay tribute and respect to an accomplished Kentuckian and photo-journalist, Mr. Edward Reinke of the Associated Press. Mr. Reinke tragically passed away on October 18 after an accident several days earlier while he was covering the IndyCar race at Kentucky Speedway in Sparta, KY. He was 60 years old.  Ed Reinke was a mentor to countless photographers throughout his illustrious career and leaves behind him a legacy in the photo-journalism industry that is admired and respected throughout the world.  Edward J. Reinke was born and raised in Howard County, Indiana, and was a graduate of the University of IN. Ed began his photo-journalism career as an intern with the Cincinnati Enquirer in 1972. Ed worked as a full-time staffer until 1979 when he left to work for the Associated Press in Cincinnati. Ed also spent several years in the Washington, DC, bureau and on August 31, 1987, he came to Louisville, where he became the Associated Press's first staff photographer in Kentucky in 25 years.  During his 25-plus-year career, Ed built an impressive network of Kentucky AP-member photographers who encourage and help each other to this day by contributing pictures that can be shared among all AP-member newspapers. ``He was the hub of a very close-knit community,'' said John Flavell, Ed's personal friend of 25 years and photo editor at the Daily Independent in Ashland, KY.  Ed was driven by the philosophy that good photographers make themselves better by making pictures that mattered over long periods of time. He spent each day attempting to fulfill his motto: ``You don't just take pictures, you make good pictures.'' And Ed did just that.  He was often selected for special events around the world such as Super Bowls, World Series championships, Final Four tournaments, Summer and Winter Olympics, Masters and PGA Championships, President Bill Clinton's first inauguration, and Hurricane Andrew. In Kentucky, Ed was the Associated Press's lead photographer for almost every major event in my State's modern history, including the 2006 crash--of Comair Flight 5191, the 1988 Carrolton bus crash the Nation's deadliest drunk-driving accident--and the Kentucky Derby every year since 1988.  In stark contrast to covering these somber and significant events, Ed had also had the remarkable ability to find the ``quiet dignity'' in tobacco farmers, racetrack workers, and short-order cooks. Ed was a man of passion and compassion, and his life revolved around his commitment to his family and his work. ``His family was most important to him and he wasn't shy about telling it to those who understood,'' said Flavell. ``It was his family that made him.''  ``There's a big black hole in my soul and at the center of the photo-journalism universe with Ed Reinke gone, but it's his influence that will shine the brightest,'' Flavell says in remembrance of his friend.  Mr. President, I would ask my Senate colleagues to join me in extending my greatest condolences to Mr. Reinke's mother, Margaret L. Harmon Reinke, his wife, Tori, and his two sons, Wilson and Graham, for their loss. Edward J. Reinke was a true inspiration to the people of our great Commonwealth, and photo-journalists throughout Kentucky and the rest of the world owe him a debt of gratitude for the work and legacy he leaves behind.  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that an article appearing in the Ashland Daily Independent highlighting Ed's life and achievements be printed in the Record.  There being no objection, the article was ordered to be printed in the Record as follows:                 [The Daily Independent, Oct. 19, 2011]                           A Great One Passes                           (By John Flavell)       Chances are you don't know the name Ed Reinke, but you've      seen his work grace this newspaper for decades as a venerated      photo-journalist with the Associated Press. He passed away      early Wednesday morning after suffering a brain injury at      Sparta Racetrack two weeks ago.       Ed taught the lesson that good photographers make      themselves better by making pictures that mattered over long      period of time. Within that wisdom is his credo: ``You don't      just take pictures, you make good pictures.'' All within the      confines of journalism ethics.       Even though he covered great events like the Olympic Games,      World Series, and Super Bowls, Ed could quickly find the      quiet dignity in tobacco farmers, racetrack workers, and      short-order cooks.       Ed was a great teacher. A college student approached Ed and      wanted to know why she couldn't get the nice close-ups with      her normal lens, pointing to his long glass. He told her she      was lucky, with her short lens she could get really close to      her subject, saying, ``The rest of us don't remember how to      do that.''       And to see him work was like watching a master's class in      photo-journalism far beyond the classroom or textbook. During      a break one Derby Week morning at Churchill Downs, Ed struck      up a long conversation with an elderly African-American      gentleman who wiped dew off the seats around the paddock.      After the conversation, Ed said, ``makes me wish I worked for      NPR.'' The photo he filed of the worker put the guy in      exactly the dignified light Ed brought out in the      conversation.       I repeated that story to Ed last year after he asked about      audio recordings I made for slideshows. He wanted to know why      so much effort went into the audio track and I reminded him      of his paddock conversation and the influence it had on me.      He was genuinely touched. And I was touched when he once      drove from Louisville to Morehead to see a show I had at      Morehead State University, where we had the gallery to      ourselves. He looked at the seemingly endless row of images      and said, ``You probably should have edited tighter, but I'm      glad you didn't. We should talk about these.'' It was a nice      afternoon.       That's the way our relationship grew over the 25 or so      years. Conversations were long in-between, but lasted long as      we caught up with the professional and personal sides of our      lives. We started with the utmost respect for our ingrained      craft and took it to the personal level as we learned--     through maturity--that our photography was made by what we      are.       As Ed's family grew, so did Ed. We rarely see a man of his      stature in photo-journalism stop in the middle of talking      shop to talk about his wife and sons. When they hurt, it      showed in his voice and mannerisms. Most of the time, though,      times were good and his eyes would light up. His family was      most important and he wasn't shy about telling it to those      who understood it was his family that made him.       When Ed and I last spoke, he called to ask if I would be      attending a reunion at our alma mater, Indiana University's      School of Journalism. We both had other commitments     that weekend, and the conversation settled into a former      teacher there. Although we attended the school at different      times, we had similar stories about the Pulitzer nominee, who      had photographed the desegregation clashes in Arkansas. After      the obligatory words of praise for our mentor, we went      directly to the obligatory stories about him that made us      laugh the most.       Probably what I'll miss the most are those phone calls out      of nowhere that started with the words, ``I sure enjoyed that      picture you made.'' When I told Ed I'd miss the reunion      because I was taking a 45 field camera to the coast, he said,      ``I'd sure like to see those.'' It rarely mattered what the      pictures were about, we had reached a point when we knew the      pictures were about us. I'll miss that.       There's a big black hole in my soul and at the center of      the photo-journalism universe with Ed Reinke gone, but it's      his influence that will shine the brightest.                             More on Reinke       Ed used to wear a bright red jacket, which is how people      could quickly find him. Early one morning at Churchill Downs,      Ed spotted a former Kentucky Derby winner on the track on a      workout. He took off the jacket, stuffed it in his camera      bag, and snuck away from the crowd. A couple of us watched as      he stalked the backside to wait for the horse to come back      around. Ed wasn't particularly competitive, but he didn't      like finding a situation only to have another photographer      crash in.       The Kentucky Derby brings in photographers from all over      the world. During an early morning meeting of photographers,      Ed spotted a well-known group standing together. ``There      isn't many people I really dislike at the Kentucky Derby, but      they're all standing right there.''       During a conversation at a recent Kentucky Legislative      session, I commented to Ed his pictures were getting better      with age. After the obligatory expletive, which is what I was      after, he said, ``Well, if it has my name on it, I'm going to      keep trying.''       Ed liked using a Wild West vocabulary. The cameras were his      shootin' irons. Film rolls and the cards that came later were      his bullets or ammo.       Whenever asked if he got a dunk at a basketball game, Ed      would point to the stands and reply, ``Nah, but you see that      guy up there in the stands with the white shirt? Tack      sharp!''                          ____________________
