And if there was any doubt that Senate Republicans insist on being the party of no, their current decision to deny votes on these highly qualified, noncontroversial district court nominees--while we are in the middle of a judicial vacancy crisis--shows what they stand for. They care more about opposing this President than helping the American people.  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in the Record, as follows:                    [From Politico, Sept. 18, 2012]             The Case for Confirming District Court Judges                          (By Russell Wheeler)       The accepted wisdom on Congress is that the presidential      campaign is likely to crowd out most real work until after      Nov. 6, when all its focus abruptly changes to the fiscal      cliff.       There is, though, one important noncontroversial matter      that the Senate should take up now--as have previous Senates      at this time: confirming district judges.       A government that can't do its mundane business is surely      unlikely to be able to deal with more controversial problems.      History shows that the Senate should be able to confirm a      respectable number of long-standing district court      nominations before Election Day--certainly before      adjournment. If it cannot, this may signal that the past four      years of delayed and confrontational nominations have not      been an aberration but represent the new normal of district      court confirmations.       Sixty-one of the nation's 673 lifetime appointment district      court judgeships are vacant. President Barack Obama has      submitted nominees to fill 24 of the vacancies. Seventeen of      the 24 have cleared the Senate Judiciary Committee and are      awaiting final action by the full Senate.       As of Sept. 10, the Senate had confirmed 126 of Obama's      district nominees--81 percent. In comparison, President      George W. Bush had a 97 percent district confirmation success      rate in his first four years, and President Bill Clinton an      87 percent rate.       If the Senate confirms 10 of the 17 Obama nominees, this      would lift his four-year success rate to equal Clinton's.      Confirming all 17 would lift it to 91 percent.       Rates aside, however, even if all 17 were confirmed, Obama      would have made roughly 20 fewer district appointees than      Clinton or Bush. Obama has submitted fewer nominees.       Extended vacancies often mean long delays, especially in      civil cases. They often mean full caseloads for judges in      their 70s and beyond--despite statutory promises that, at      that age, judges who have put in substantial service are      entitled to scale back.       Filling judicial vacancies is part of the business of      government, and like much of that business, it is more      mundane than dramatic. Federal district caseloads consist      largely of commercial disputes and federal crimes like      immigration law violations--issues important to litigants and      collectively important to all of us. They are part of how our      society resolves disputes and help set the framework for      commercial and social intercourse.       But you might say, judges can't get confirmed this close to      a presidential election because opposition senators are      hoping their guy will soon be in the White House and make his      own nominations to those vacancies.       That may be true now for court of appeals nominees -- you      have to go back to the first Bush administration to find a      circuit confirmation after July of a presidential election      year -- but not for district courts. There's plenty of      precedent for late-election year confirmations.       In 1980, 1984 and 1992--when Presidents Jimmy Carter,      Ronald Reagan and George H.W. Bush were up for reelection--     the Senate each time confirmed roughly 10 district court      nominees between the political conventions and election day.      That number dropped to zero in 1996 under Clinton but shot up      to six in 2004 under Bush.       In years when the incumbent president wasn't on the ballot,      the Senate also confirmed district judges, including 10 in      September 2008--even as Obama's victory seemed increasingly      likely.       There's plenty of recent precedent for confirming at least      the 17 pending Obama nominees. But the past four years of      district confirmations haven't followed precedent.       Not only is the confirmation rate lower, at least for now,      but time from nomination to confirmation has spiked. Eight      percent of Clinton's district confirmations in the first four      years took more than 180 days, as did 27 percent of Bush's.      But it's now up to 67 percent for Obama.       The increase in time has been matched by an increase in      contentiousness. All of Clinton's district appointees were      confirmed by voice vote -- even those who merited more      attention, like the subsequently impeached and convicted      Thomas Porteous of New Orleans. All but four of Bush's      appointees were approved by either voice or unanimous vote.      Of the four, one got 20 ``no'' votes and one got 46.       Most of Obama's appointees have also been confirmed with      no, or token, opposition--even those who waited a long time.      But 11 received more than 20 ``no'' votes. It's hard to      believe, however, that the quality of Obama appointees      plunged so decisively compared with those of his immediate      predecessors.       So district confirmations--especially in double digits--in      the next several months may be iffy, and those who do get      confirmed will have waited considerably longer than late-year      confirmations in previous administrations.       We've come to accept, or at least recognize, as the new      normal that only six or seven out of every 10 circuit      nominees will get Senate approval. Are the district courts      next?
