Mr. Chairman, I move to strike the last word.  Mr. Chairman, I have just heard one of the greatest presentations of looney tunes I have ever heard. Very frankly, this is nothing to do with the parks. We do not invade the parks, we do not invade any of the other areas. We are trying to reestablish the congressional activity in designating land and not letting the U.N.  I have to remind people the U.N. organizations are not accountable. U.N. bureaucrats are far removed from the American voters, and remember, many of the U.N. delegates that make these decisions do not believe in privately-held property. Their countries are owned by dictators or owned by governments that do not have private property, and when they make decisions, the United States, under our Constitution affecting private property rights, that is wrong.  All my bill does is have the Congress get back involved in the designation of lands. If they are so heavily supported, those outside the parks, then I suggest respectfully they will be easily passed in this Congress. It does not affect any of the parks or any of the reference here or any of the Heritage Sites such as the Statue of Liberty. My bill does not affect that. All we do is put the committee, this Congress, back into the process of designating the lands.                                                       UNESCO,                                     Paris, France, March 6, 1995.     Hon. George T. Frampton, Jr.,     Assistant Secretary for Fish & Wildlife & Parks, U.S.          Department of the Interior, Office of the Secretary,          Washington, DC, USA.       Dear Mr. Frampton: I am writing to you with respect to a      letter from a group of North American conservation      organizations, addressed to Dr. Adul Wichiencharoen, Chairman      of the World Heritage Committee, and dated 28 February, 1995.      The World Heritage Committee is the executive body of the      Convention and is elected by its 140 States Parties. I note      that a copy of this letter was sent to your office. The      letter concerns the possible listing of Yellowstone National      Park on the List of World Heritage in Danger.       The World Heritage Committee had been made aware of some of      these concerns in a brief report by the United States      Delegate to the July 1993 meeting of the World Heritage      Bureau.       The fourteen organizations signing this letter are as you      know among the most prestigious and influential in the field      of natural resources conservation. We believe that the      concerns they raise about the threats to Yellowstone must be      carefully examined and addressed.       Included with their letter was a briefing book containing      copies of correspondence from the Governor of Wyoming and      Senator Baucus of Montana, each raises serious questions      about the potential damage to Yellowstone National Park, in      particular from the proposed mining operation. Similar      letters of concern are provided from professional geologists,      geomorphologists and hydrologists who have investigated the      proposed mining operation. This correspondence is sufficient      to raise considerable concern about the long-term      sustainability of the World Heritage values of this World      Heritage site.       From the report it appears that while a draft Environmental      Impact Statement has been prepared, it did not resolve      several major questions and many issues remain under review.      Thus it would appear premature to reach any conclusions at      this time.       With respect to the List of World Heritage in Danger, there      are no specific criteria. The Committee has the authority to      place a site on the List of World Heritage in Danger when it      is of the view that the World Heritage values for which the      site was inscribed are seriously threatened.       The procedure for listing normally involves a monitoring      report by the World Conservation Union (IUCN), in      consultation with the State Party and the management      authority responsible for the site. IUCN reports to the      Bureau of the World Heritage Committee which meets in July      and the Bureau makes a recommendation to the Committee, which      usually meets in December of each year.       While we have taken note that the conservative      organizations have requested that the World Heritage      Secretariat involve itself in the EIS process, we simply are      not staffed to do so. We would, however, be pleased to      address these organizations on any aspects of the operation      of the World Heritage Convention. We could also request IUCN      as our technical advisors, to review the Environmental Impact      Statement. We are confident that as the State Party      responsible for the implementation of the Convention the      essential professional skills are available to you.       It is important to note that Article 1 of the World      Heritage Convention obliges the State Party to protect,      conserve, present and transmit to future generations World      Heritage sites for which they are responsible. This      obligation extends beyond the boundary of the site and      Article 5 (A) recommends that State Parties integrate the      protection of sites into comprehensive planning programmes.      Thus, if proposed developments will damage the integrity of      Yellowstone National Park, the State Party has a      responsibility to act beyond the National Park boundary.       Examples of the need to act beyond park boundaries are      found at the Everglades National Park, Glacier National Park      and Glacier Bay National Park, all World Heritage sites. In      two of the sites the Government of British Columbia acted to      close major mining operations rather than risk possible      damage to downstream World Heritage values in both Canada and      the United States.       Clearly if there are threats to World Heritage values the      State Party has a responsibility to act. If enabling      legislation is not adequate, new legislation should be      considered, as was the case in Australia with respect to the      Tasmanian Wilderness World Heritage site.       The World Heritage Committee has the authority to act      unilaterally in placing a site on the List of World Heritage      in Danger. However, in the past the Committee has      demonstrated a clear desire to work in consort with the State      Party. In this respect we would appreciate receiving a      comprehensive report on the situation in time for the meeting      of the World Heritage Bureau to be held in Paris in early      July. Such a report would enable the Committee to give      serious consideration to the listing of Yellowstone National      Park on the List of World Heritage in Danger, should such a      decision be warranted, at its nineteenth session to be held      in December 1995.       The United States has an exemplary record in support of and      in accordance with the principles and requirements of the      World Heritage Convention. We look forward to continuing this      cooperation.           Yours sincerely,                                                 Bernd von Droste,     Director, World Heritage Centre.                                  ____                       Legislative Resolve No. 13       Be it resolved by the Legislature of the State of Alaska:       Whereas the United Nations has designated 67 sites in the      United States as ``World Heritage Sites'' or ``Biosphere      Reserves,'' which altogether are about equal in size to the      State of Colorado, the eighth largest state; and       Whereas art. IV, sec. 3, United States Constitution,      provides that the United States Congress shall make all      needed regulations governing lands belonging to the United      States; and       Whereas many of the United Nations' designations include      private property inholdings and contemplate ``buffer zones''      of adjacent land; and       Whereas some international land designations such as those      under the United States Biosphere Reserve Program and the Man      and Biosphere Program of the United Nations Scientific,      Educational, and Culture Organization operate under      independent national committees such as the United States      National Man and Biosphere Committee that have no legislative      directives or authorization from the Congress; and       Whereas these international designations as presently      handled are an open invitation to the international community      to interfere in domestic economies and land use decisions;      and       Whereas local citizens and public officials concerned about      job creation and resource based economies usually have no say      in the designation of land near their homes for inclusion in      an international land use program; and       Whereas former Assistant Secretary of the Interior George      T. Frampton, Jr., and the President used the fact that      Yellowstone National Park had been designated as a ``World      Heritage Site'' as justification for intervening in the      environmental impact statement process and blocking possible      development of an underground mine on private land in Montana      outside of the park; and       Whereas a recent designation of a portion of Kamchatka as a      ``World Heritage Site'' was followed immediately by efforts      from environmental groups to block investment insurance for      development projects on Kamchatka that are supported by the      local communities; and       Whereas environmental groups and the national Park Service      have been working to establish an International Park, a World      Heritage Site, and a Marine Biosphere Reserve covering parts      of western Akaska, eastern Russia, and the Bering Sea; and       Whereas as occurred in Montana, such designations could be      used to block development projects on state and private land      in western Alaska; and       Whereas foreign companies and countries could use such      international designations in western Alaska to block      economic development that they perceive as competition; and       Whereas animal rights activists could use such      international designations to generate pressure to harass or      block harvesting of marine mammals by Alaska Natives; and       Whereas such international designations could be used to      harass or block any commercial activity, including pipelines,      railroads, and power transmission lines; and       Whereas the President and the executive branch of the      United States have, by Executive Order and other agreements,      implemented these designations without approval by the      Congress; and       Whereas the United States Department of Interior, in      cooperation with the Federal Interagency Panel for World      Heritage, has identified the Aleutian Island Unit of the      Alaska Maritime National Wildlife Refuge,     Arctic National Wildlife Refuge, Cape Krusenstern National      Monument, Denali National Park, Gates of the Arctic National      Park, and Katmai National Park as likely to meet the criteria      for future nomination as World Heritage Sites; and       Whereas the Alaska State Legislature objects to the      nomination or designation of any World Heritage Sites or      Biosphere Reserves in Alaska without the specific consent of      the Alaska State Legislature; and       Whereas actions by the President in applying international      agreements to lands owned by the United States may circumvent      the Congress; and       Whereas Congressman Don Young introduced House Resolution      No. 901 in the 105th Congress entitled the ``American Land      Sovereignty Protection Act of 1997'' that required the      explicit approval of the Congress prior to restricting any      use of United States land under international agreements; and       Whereas Congressman Don Young has reintroduced this      legislation in the 106th Congress as House Resolution No.      883, which is entitled the ``American Land Sovereignty      Protection Act'';       Be it resolved that the Alaska State Legislature supports      House Resolution 883, the ``American Land Sovereignty      Protection Act,'' that reaffirms the constitutional authority      of the Congress as the elected representatives of the people      over the federally owned land of the United States and urges      the swift introduction and passage of such act by the 106th      Congress; and be it       Further resolved that the Alaska State Legislature objects      to the nomination or designation of any sites in Alaska as      World Heritage Sites or Biosphere Reserves without the prior      consent of the Alaska State Legislature.       Copies of this resolution shall be sent to the Honorable      Bill Clinton, President of the United States; Honorable Al      Gore, Jr., Vice-President of the United States and President      of the U.S. Senate; the Honorable Trent Lott, Majority Leader      of the U.S. Senate; the Honorable J. Dennis Hastert, Speaker      of the U.S. House of Representatives; and to the Honorable      Ted Stevens and the Honorable Frank Murkowski, U.S. Senators,      and the Honorable Don Young, U.S. Representative, members of      the Alaska delegation in Congress.                                                  State of Alaska,                                       Office of the Governor,                                             Juneau, May 11, 1999.     Hon.
