 Madam Speaker, the legislation before us today demonstrates that the system works. Title I of the legislation satisfies a top priority for the entertainment industry and ensures that one of America's most valuable assets will continue to dominate in global markets. Title II of the bill brings to a close a 4-year effort to bring common sense, fairness and clarity to the copyright music licensing system. This victory for small business should make Congress proud. I urge a unanimous vote in favor of this agreement and this bill.  Madam Speaker, I include in this part of the Record an exchange of correspondence between the gentleman from North Carolina (Mr. Coble) who is the chairman of the Subcommittee on Courts and Intellectual Property and myself.  The correspondence referred to is as follows:                                     Congress of the United States                                      House of Representatives                                  Washington, DC, October 7, 1998.     Hon. Howard Coble,     Chairman, Subcommittee on Courts and Intellectual Property.       Dear Mr. Chairman: I am writing to you regarding the      upcoming floor action on S. 505, a bill to amend title 17,      United States Code, to extend the term of copyright, to      provide for a music licensing exemption, and for other      purposes.       Among the negotiated portions included in the final version      was a provision concerning the burden of proof in determining      reasonableness of the license rate. I want to make certain      that this critically important provision concerning the      burden of proof is clearly understood in the license fee      determination provision, Section 512(4). Nothing in Section      512(4) shall change the burden of proof with respect to the      rates or fees under the consent decrees, which places the      burden of showing a reasonable rate or fee on the performing      rights society.       Mr. Chairman, I respectfully request your affirmation of      this understanding be included in the record for purposes of      providing legislative history on this subject.           Sincerely,                                      F. James Sensenbrenner, Jr.,     Member of Congress.                                  ____                                    Congress of the United States,                                     House of Representatives,                                  Washington, DC, October 7, 1998.     Hon. F. James Sensenbrenner, Jr.,     U.S. Representative for the 9th District of Wisconsin,          Rayburn House Office Building, Washington, DC.       Dear Representative Sensenbrenner: Thank you for your      letter of October 7, 1998, regarding the upcoming floor      action on S. 505, a bill to amend title 17, United States      Code, to extend the term of copyright, to provide for a music      licensing exemption, and for other purposes.       This letter is to affirm your understanding that nothing in      section 512(4) of the Copyright Act, as amended by the bill,      is intended to change the burden of proof with respect to      rates or fees under applicable consent decrees, which places      the burden of showing a reasonable rate or fee on the      performing rights society.       This letter, along with your letter, will be placed in the      Record for purposes of providing legislative history on this      subject.           Sincerely,                                                 Howard Coble,                                  Chairman, Subcommittee on Courts                                        and Intellectual Property.  Madam Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.
