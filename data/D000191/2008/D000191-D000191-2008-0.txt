No, it will give unprecedented, unbelievable authority to Henry Paulson, a Wall Street speculator who created the financial weapons of mass destruction and now says he knows how to disarm them. He can buy any asset he deems appropriate from anybody at any price.  I heard a much more sensible plan from William Isaac, head of the FDIC under the Reagan administration. Declare a banking emergency. Use the same insurance provisions they used for the Wachovia general creditors. Insure all general creditors and depositors in all banks in America. That would free up the lending, we would save $700 billion, and then we could begin to invest that money in putting America back to work.
