 President, the Senator from Nevada appeared on the floor and said similar words a year ago. I never expected he would come back a second time and do that again. I had his words printed up and gave a copy to my chairman and put one copy in my memory book. What should not be so rare, but I guess is rare, is the fact that women can do this work, women can participate in the great public policy debates of our day, women can work together, they can be effective and I think the fact that that is now becoming the given is important.  The message Senator Reid sent to young women who may be out there saying, could I do this job some day, is absolutely, yes, if they get an education.  The old proverbial myths that women cannot work together or women are jealous or women are this or women are that are not true. We are living examples of this, both Republican and Democratic women in the Senate. It is one of the great treats of our service that we are able to share, develop collegiality, be real professionals, and care about the people we represent.  It is a great pleasure for me to hear and see the Senator from Nevada saying these things, and also, as I said before, to be able to work with Senator Hutchison. We have become good friends in the process. We do not always agree, but that does not matter. The point is there is a basic integrity and a commitment to do the right thing for the people we represent and the people in the military.  So I thank Senator Reid and my thanks to my chairman. I yield the remainder of my time.
