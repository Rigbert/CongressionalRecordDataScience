 President, today I am introducing legislation, the Tuition Tax Elimination Act, which will help make college more affordable for thousands of young people all across America. I am pleased that Senators Sessions, DeWine, Hutchinson, Faircloth, Cochran, and Smith of New Hampshire have joined me as original cosponsors. This bill will eliminate a new Federal tax on the tuition expenses of students participating in State prepaid tuition programs. Here is how the tax came about.  It is no secret that many families in our Nation are struggling to finance their childrens' education. College tuition costs have skyrocketed in the past decade increasing 95 percent at private institutions and 82 percent at public institutions. Newsweek magazine reported last year that some families will spend more than $100,000 just to send one child to college.  To combat the high cost of a college education, many States, including Alabama, have set up prepaid tuition funds. These funds allow parents to make a tax-free investment, years in advance of their child's enrollment in college, with the guarantee that the child's tuition will be paid for by the State when he or she enrolls in college.  Last year, the IRS attempted to impose taxes on States operating prepaid tuition funds by claiming that the funds were not legitimate functions of the State and thus not exempt from Federal taxation. If the IRS had been successful in their attempt, many States would have been forced to terminate their prepaid tuition programs.  Fortunately, Senators McConnell, Graham, and I were able to get a provision in the Small Business Job Protection Act which clarified that prepaid tuition programs should not be subject to Federal taxes, since they are a legitimate function of State governments.  At the same time, the IRS was also attempting to impose a tax on the parents' contributions to these State prepaid tuition programs. What the IRS wanted to do was to count the annual increased value of the parents' contribution as income and tax it. Again, Senators McConnell, Graham, and I put a provision in the minimum wage bill last year to prevent the IRS from taking those actions.  However, there was a provision of that bill which I did not support. It provided that when a student enrolls in college under a prepaid tuition plan, the student must pay taxes on the difference between the value of the tuition costs, which are paid by the State, and the amount his or her parent paid for the contract. Essentially, this provision is a new tax on students. I attempted to offer an amendment to strike this provision, but unfortunately, no amendments were in order.  Mr. President, prepaid tuition programs are a creative way many States all across the country have developed to help more young people afford a college education. We need to do everything we can at the Federal level to encourage these types of programs.  The Tuition Tax Elimination Act will do that by relieving students from Federal taxes on their tuition expenses. This legislation will providethat distributions from qualified prepaid tuition funds are not to be counted as taxable income for the student, as long as the money is spent for the designated purpose.  This legislation is fully paid for with a provision which would suspend the automatic inflation adjustments used to award the earned income tax credit to individuals without children. President Clinton's 1993 tax bill expanded the EITC to cover individuals without children, and currently, a childless individual earning between $4,220 and $5,280 is eligible for a maximum EITC amount of $323. Each year, these income levels are adjusted upward for inflation. Many people have questioned whether we should even be providing the EITC to individuals without children. However, that is a question which can be addressed in other legislation. This offset does not eliminate the EITC for individuals without children; it simply eliminates the annual increase in the EITC calculation for individuals who have no dependents. This provision passed the Senate last year as a part of welfare reform, but it was dropped in conference.  Mr. President, the cost of going to college is now more expensive than ever, and is growing much faster than inflation. Eliminating the tax students will face on their tuition expenses is a real step toward making college more affordable for thousands of young people all across America, and I hope my colleagues join me in support of this legislation.                                 ______                                       By
