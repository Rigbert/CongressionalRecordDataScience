 President, as the chairman knows the FY 2003 budget request contained $60.3 million for carrier modifications but only $14.9 million of that total was allocated for M113 ``A3'' upgrades. I am supportive of transformation and understand the need to reallocate resources for that purpose. In this instance, however, I believe the Army's decision not to upgrade the remaining forward deployed 112 M113A2s of the 2nd Infantry Division in the Republic of Korea and the 352 M113A2s in Europe belonging to the 1st Infantry Divisions, will at a minimum, leave the soldiers in these front line units vulnerable in a potentially unstable and high threat environment.  Because of these concerns, I believe serious consideration should be given to using all the funds provided in this bill for M113 Carrier A3 upgrades and ask that you work with me on this issue during conference.
