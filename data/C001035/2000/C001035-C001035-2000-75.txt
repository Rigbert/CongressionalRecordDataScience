President, the year 2004 will mark the 400th anniversary of a small French settlement on Saint Croix Island, located in the Saint Croix River, which forms the boundary between the State of Maine and Canada. The 1604 settlement was the initial site of the first permanent settlement in the New World, predating the English settlement of 1607 at Jamestown, Virginia. Many view the expedition that settled on the Island as the beginning of the Acadian culture in North America.
