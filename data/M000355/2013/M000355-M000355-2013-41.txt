 President, Ford Motor Company has a proud 100-year history of manufacturing in Kentucky. Today the company announces a new model to be constructed in its Louisville assembly plant, further employing yet another generation of Kentuckians.  I congratulate Ford on this development and applaud its continued excellence in manufacturing in the Commonwealth of Kentucky.  I yield the floor.                          ____________________
