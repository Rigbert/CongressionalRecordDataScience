Many people around the world recognize that October 10, 2010 will be remembered as 10/10/10. In the Republic of China (Taiwan), however, 23 million people in Taiwan will be celebrating National Day. They remember October 10, 1911 as the birth of their country, and this year Taiwan will be celebrating the 99th anniversary of the Republic of China's National Day.  Taiwan has developed into a strong democracy that continues to promote the freedom of its people. The ingenuity and hard work of the Taiwanese helps to establish Taiwan as a leader on the yearly Index of Economic Freedom. They serve as a model for those across the world who aspire for the freedom and individualism that Taiwan protects for its citizens. As a leader of free people, I commend the Taiwanese government for serving as a beacon of light to people around the world.  The United States and Taiwan have a long history of mutual trade, leadership and friendship. I am proud that Taiwan remains a close friend of the United States. I am also pleased to call many of my counterparts in the Legislative Yuan my friends. As they celebrate their 99th National Day on October 10, 2010, my friends and the Taiwanese people have my warmest wishes.                          ____________________
