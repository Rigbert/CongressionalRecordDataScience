 Now retired, Mr. Sharpe opened his first business in Somerset, KY, in 1947. Since that time he's opened several more, pioneered the houseboat business, and has become an irreplaceable fixture in his community.  Lake Cumberland is known by many as the ``houseboat capital of the world''--a designation that is owed in no small part to Jim Sharpe. Jim was one of the first to pioneer the industry--building his first houseboat in1953. Much has changed since he sold that first 10-by 24-foot steel boat, and Jim has been there for it all, often leading the way. Houseboats are now much bigger--up to 20 by 100 feet--and are made of aluminum and have on-board heating and cooling systems. One thing that never changed, though, is Jim's passion for building his customer's ``dream boat.''  Despite being one of the founding fathers of the industry, houseboats do not constitute the totality of his life's work. Jim has owned and operated several other businesses in Somerset in addition to Sumerset Marine. In 1966, he developed Food Fair groceries, which he grew into a chain of 13 stores. Two year later, he opened Somerset's first fried chicken restaurant, Kettle Fried Chicken, and in 1974 he bought a car dealership, Pulaski Motor Company.  Although he is now retired, Jim still has plenty to keep him busy. Jim and his wife of nearly 65 years Mary Jo have four children and nine grandchildren, and he has also found time to pick up golf and travel the country.  Jim Sharpe's drive and determination in his business, his commitment to his community, and his love of his family can serve as an example to us all. I ask that my U.S. Senate colleagues join me in honoring this upstanding Kentucky citizen.                          ____________________
