GREGG. I happen to believe the H-1B program is one of those programs that expands jobs in the United States, and by getting people here, you actually create jobs and you will create more jobs for Americans rather than lose jobs.  So, no, I don't happen to think you create a uniform rule that says nobody can come here if somebody else can take the job because then you are going to get the bureaucracy behind that which would basically bar those people from ever getting here. That becomes then a bureaucratic nightmare for building those jobs. It makes much more sense to bring these smart, intelligent people here, have them create jobs here, rather than leave them creating jobs in China and India.  Bill Gates speaks to this far more eloquently than I do. He speaks to most things more eloquently than I can because he can pronounce the words. But as a practical matter, he says these people are centers for the energy that creates the ideas, that creates the jobs that drive the economy. And if you leave them in China, if you leave them in India, as those types of individuals creating jobs, they become huge competitors to the entrepreneurship of America. If you bring them here, they become adjuncts to our economy.  I think the proposal makes a lot of sense from the standpoint of job creation and from the standpoint of making our economy stronger, so I will be offering it later in the day.  I yield the floor.
