President, I listened closely to the statement made by Senator McConnell of Kentucky, the Republican Senate leader. I applaud him and other Senators who have spoken out against the so-called filibuster that has been initiated by the Senator from Texas and at least one other Senator.  It is not technically a filibuster, as Senator Reid said, but the object is to slow down the business of the Senate and it is somewhat similar to a filibuster. We are going to have that occur today when Senator Cruz takes the floor this afternoon to state his position that we should shut down the government if we fund ObamaCare.  That, to me, is an irresponsible position. It is irresponsible because the Senators who support the House position are playing high stakes poker with other people's money. To shut down the government is disastrous, not only for hundreds of thousands of Federal employees who do important work to keep America safe and to keep us a leading nation on the economy but also because it is at the expense of American jobs.  When Senator Reid, the Democratic leader, came to the floor and read a statement from the Business Roundtable, he was reading from the strongest business group that usually, without fail, supports Republicans. That group put out a statement yesterday--the Business Roundtable, the leading business executives in our country--that to shut down the government or to fail to extend the debt ceiling is devastating to our economy.
