 President, today marks the seventh anniversary of the grenade attack against the Khmer Nation Party, renamed the Sam Rainsy Party, in Cambodia.  Recently, my friend from Arizona circulated a letter, which I gladly signed, calling for the Federal Bureau of Investigation to return to Phnom Penh to continue its investigation into the attack. I encourage the State Department and the FBI to coordinate efforts to ensure the FBI's quick return and to keep Congress informed of any progress in this case.  As I have in the past, I ask unanimous consent that the names of those murdered in this cowardly attack be printed in the Record following my remarks. Justice delayed has been justice denied for these victims and their families. They remain in my thoughts and prayers.  There being no objection, the list was ordered to be printed in the Record, as follows:       Mr. Cheth Duong Daravuth, Mr. Han Mony, Mr. Sam Sarin, Ms.      Yong Sok Neuv, Ms. Yong Srey, Ms. Yos Siem, Ms. Chanty      Pheakdey, Mr. Ros Sear, Ms. Sok Kheng, Mr. Yoeun Yorn, Mr.      Chea Nang, and Mr. Nam Thy.                          ____________________
