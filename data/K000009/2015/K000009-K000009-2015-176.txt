Speaker, I rise today to recognize the Donna Smallwood Activities Center and Office on Aging in Parma, Ohio. The agency celebrates its 50th birthday today.  In 1965 the Parma 60+ Club began meeting weekly. Parma Jaycees wives volunteered to coordinate activities led by Donna Smallwood. Donna Smallwood was later hired as the first director when the City of Parma decided to increase services in 1968. Five years later, in 1973, the Sixty Plus Center opened in the newly expanded Memorial Hall with services and activities five days a week. 1973 also marked the founding of the Parma Office on Aging to address the needs of Parma's older adults through an array of supportive services. Finally, in 1991 the Center's current building was constructed. City officials christened the building in 2009 as the Donna Smallwood Activities Center & Parma Office on Aging.  Over 6,000 members belong to the Center. Though primarily for Parma residents, the agency also serves older adults in any community in the region, with partnerships developed with the nearby cities of Parma Heights and Seven Hills.  From its small beginnings to the thousands of people served today, the Donna Smallwood Activities Center & Parma Office on Aging has become an integral part of both people's lives and the community in Parma. Focused always on offering a warmhearted and cheery place to meet, learn, be entertained and find help, the Donna Smallwood Activities Center & Parma Office on Aging is truly a home away from home for area seniors. We commend the caring service of its directors and staff both past and present, congratulate its membership on achieving this milestone birthday, and look forward to the future.  I am pleased to join the membership of the Donna Smallwood Activities Center & Parma Office on Aging and the community of Parma, Ohio in celebrating this joyous occasion. Onward.                          ____________________
