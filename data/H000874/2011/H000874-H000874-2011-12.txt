 To the innocent unemployed and to the Medicare seniors who are seeking services from their doctors, we must not leave this work unfinished just days before the holidays and New Year. That's what the Senate did. They gave us time. They gave the American people time. We ought to be bringing relief to middle class families who are increasingly anxious about their futures during what should be a joyful and hopeful holiday season.  We ought to pass the bipartisan Senate bill. That's what this motion to instruct says. That's what the American people want to happen in Washington: to see us work together, come to agreement, act, bring certainty, stop the blame game. We can send the bipartisan agreement to the President today, and he will sign it.  Vote ``yes'' on this motion to instruct. Vote for the American workers, the Medicare recipient, and the unemployed. Vote for this motion to instruct.  Mr. Speaker, I yield the remainder of my time to my good friend from New York, Joe Crowley, a member of the Ways and Means Committee.
