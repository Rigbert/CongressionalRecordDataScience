Madam Speaker, today I would like to recognize the 25th anniversary of the Arctic Man race, one of the most unique competitive events in winter sports. Combining downhill skiing, snowboarding, skijoring, and snowmachine racing, Arctic Man exemplifies Alaska's rugged outdoor spirit.  Every year, 13,000 spectators ride their snowmachines up to a magnificent alpine setting between Anchorage and Fairbanks, Alaska, to watch this impressive spectacle. The race combines athleticism and horsepower as a two-man team, consisting of one downhill skier or snowboarder and one snowmachiner, navigates a perilous course at high speeds. With the firing of the starting pistol, athletes lunge down a 1,700 foot drop in less than two miles, without the aid of ski poles. As the skiers approach the bottom of the hill, they merge into a narrow canyon and grab a rope tethered to their partners' snowmachine to then be towed at speeds of up to 86 miles per hour for 2\1/4\ miles uphill. This difficult intersection can decide the race, as the snowmachine must perfectly match the skier's or boarder's speed and course while also effectively getting the pull rope into the athlete's hand. Once the team reaches the top of the mountain, the skier or snowboarder releases the tow rope and is slingshotted down another 1,200 foot descent to slip through the gates at the finish line.  When these men and women mount the slopes, they exhibit an admirable model of aggressive athleticism and backcountry moxie to make this one of Alaska's most remarkable competitions. As this year's competitors prepare for the Arctic Man challenge, fine tuning their snowmachines, waxing their skis, and practicing their technique, I would like to wish them all good luck and a safe race!  Having attended this event before, I can attest that it is one of the most exciting and exhilarating competitions which I have ever witnessed. I look forward to joining my fellow Alaskans at this year's Arctic Man to celebrate its 25th year of competition.                          ____________________
