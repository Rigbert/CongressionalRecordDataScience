 Do we have any idea how much that would cost? Are we talking about $50 million, $100 million, $200 million? Can any of the proponents of the legislation tell me that?  Let's say it is $200 million. We will just write that down. It is easy enough to say $200 million. We have something that has been put together in the last few minutes.  So we have a requirement, notwithstanding any other provision of law. In other words, notwithstanding whatever other limits are in here, we shall reimburse for professional liability insurance for what appears to be several thousands of people.  Heck, I would like to add to that maybe we could all get ours paid for at the same time. I know mine costs several hundred dollars a year.  This might be a fine thing, but if we ask the CIA and the Justice Department to do that, it has to come out of their budget. They are all strapped for money to spend on fighting terrorism and whatnot. Are they willing to take a $200 or $300 million cut from their budget? I just ask the question. I have not heard an answer.
