Speaker, with the tragic mass shooting last week at the Washington Navy Yard, our country has again been ravaged by preventable gun violence. America must confront these events and their causes to prevent future tragedies.  Since 2007, according to the FBI, there have been 146 reported mass shootings. Far too often, a large contributing factor to this recent surge in violence is untreated mental illness; and in far too many instances, the perpetrators are former members of our military. Our Nation must bridge the gaps in our current mental health system to avoid more tragedies.  The President recently unveiled his BRAIN Initiative. It calls for $100 million in funding to advance our understanding of the human mind. Supporting this proposal will go a long way to furthering our understanding of the causes and conditions that afflict those who wish to harm others and themselves.  Further, Congressman McKinley of West Virginia and I have introduced H.R. 1615, the Examining America's Mental Health Services Act of 2013. The bill requires the Secretary of Health and Human Services and the National Academies' Institute of Medicine to conduct a comprehensive study on the gaps in our Nation's mental health services and to explore how these gaps increase the risk of violent acts. Experts such as former Army Vice Chief of Staff Dr. Peter Chiarelli, Dr. Joseph Calabrese of Case Western Reserve University, U.S. Army Colonel Carl Castro, and Dr. E. Fuller Torrey, head of the Stanley Foundation, would be prime candidates to lead breakthrough national initiatives on mental health.  Part of our comprehensive effort should focus on (1) accelerating funding for brain research and neuropsychiatric treatment; (2), reforming military enlistment, discharge procedures and integrating the Department of Defense and Department of Veterans Affairs' medical records systems; (3), instituting early childhood behavioral screening in schools; and, (4), restricting gun and ammunition access to those who have serious behavioral disorders.  Additional focus on mental illness and gun access is imperative. The Navy Yard tragedy resulted in the deaths of 13 of our citizens with eight additional people injured. The perpetrator, Aaron Alexis, was aged 34, a Navy Reserve veteran and a contractor to the U.S. Navy. He joined the Naval Reserve and began experiencing conditions that many would describe as related to PTSD, with demonstrable neuro conditions such as schizophrenia or paranoid schizophrenia. However, he was allowed to purchase a Remington 870 pump action shotgun and two boxes of ammunition. Individuals who suffer from these types of ailments should not have access to weapons and stockpiles of ammunition.  Unaddressed mental illness continues to be prevalent in many of our Nation's traumatic mass shootings, and they involve perpetrators who are private citizens as well.  We recall so sadly in Tucson, Arizona, when our own former dear colleague, Rep. Gabby Giffords, and current colleague, Representative Ron Barber, miraculously survived a mass shooting in which six others lost their lives after a deranged gunman, Jared Lee Loughner, opened fire at a meeting at a local supermarket at which Giffords and constituents were gathering.  We saw it at nearby Virginia Tech on April 16, 2007, when Seung-Hui Cho took the lives of 32 people; and we saw it at Sandy Hook Elementary School in December of 2012, when 20-year-old Adam Lanza ended the lives of 20 children and seven adults after taking his own mother's life and then his own.  How many more calls for attention--for help?--does America need to hear?  The killing of two Capitol Police Officers over a decade ago, here in our Capitol, was perpetrated by a man who had been diagnosed as a paranoid schizophrenic who was off his medication, alienated from his family and who got access to a gun.  Congress should be deeply concerned that civilians, as well as our brave men and women who serve or who have served in our Armed Forces, are not receiving the medical treatment required for diagnosing debilitating mental illness and trying to treat it better. An annual Department of Defense report on suicide has shown a precipitous increase in military suicides over the course of the last 5 years. In 2012, there were 349 suicides by military men and women from all branches of the ArmedForces. That is more than all the combat deaths that same year in Afghanistan. This is an epidemic and requires more attention and investment, including the BRAIN Initiative put forward by the President.  In sum, the common denominator with many of these mass shootings is a mentally ill individual with access to deadly weapons who has not been treated properly or, many times, whose mental illness has not even been evaluated. America must address these deficiencies for the benefit of our entire society. We must accelerate research to unlock the mysteries of the human brain.  Mr. Speaker, the only question is: Do America's leaders on behalf of the American people have the courage and vision to embark on a serious national conversation about mental health and mental illness?                                                  The White House,                                Office of the Press Secretary,                                                    April 2, 2013.                      Fact Sheet: BRAIN Initiative       ``If we want to make the best products, we also have to      invest in the best ideas . . . Every dollar we invested to      map the human genome returned $140 to our economy . . .      Today, our scientists are mapping the human brain to unlock      the answers to Alzheimer's . . . Now is not the time to gut      these job-creating investments in science and innovation. Now      is the time to reach a level of research and development not      seen since the height of the Space Race.''--President Barack      Obama, 2013 State of the Union.       In his State of the Union address, the President laid out      his vision for creating jobs and building a growing, thriving      middle class by making a historic investment in research and      development.       Today, at a White House event, the President unveiled a      bold new research initiative designed to revolutionize our      understanding of the human brain. Launched with approximately      $100 million in the President's Fiscal Year 2014 Budget, the      BRAIN (Brain Research through Advancing Innovative      Neurotechnologies) Initiative ultimately aims to help      researchers find new ways to treat, cure, and even prevent      brain disorders, such as Alzheimer's disease, epilepsy, and      traumatic brain injury.       The BRAIN Initiative will accelerate the development and      application of new technologies that will enable researchers      to produce dynamic pictures of the brain that show how      individual brain cells and complex neural circuits interact      at the speed of thought. These technologies will open new      doors to explore how the brain records, processes, uses,      stores, and retrieves vast quantities of information, and      shed light on the complex links between brain function and      behavior.       This initiative is one of the Administration's ``Grand      Challenges''--ambitious but achievable goals that require      advances in science and technology. In his remarks today, the      President called on companies, research universities,      foundations, and philanthropists to join with him in      identifying and pursuing the Grand Challenges of the 21st      century.       The BRAIN Initiative includes:       Key investments to jumpstart the effort: The National      Institutes of Health, the Defense Advanced Research Projects      Agency, and the National Science Foundation will support      approximately $100 million in research beginning in FY 2014.       Strong academic leadership: The National Institutes of      Health will establish a high-level working group co-chaired      by Dr. Cornelia ``Cori'' Bargmann (The Rockefeller      University) and Dr. William Newsome (Stanford University) to      define detailed scientific goals for the NIH's investment,      and to develop a multi-year scientific plan for achieving      these goals, including timetables, milestones, and cost      estimates.       Public-private partnerships: Federal research agencies will      partner with companies, foundations, and private research      institutions that are also investing in relevant neuroscience      research, such as the Allen Institute, the Howard Hughes      Medical Institute, the Kavli Foundation, and the Salk      Institute for Biological Studies.       Maintaining our highest ethical standards: Pioneering      research often has the potential to raise new ethical      challenges. To ensure this new effort proceeds in ways that      continue to adhere to our highest standards of research      protections, the President will direct his Commission for the      Study of Bioethical Issues to explore the ethical, legal, and      societal implications raised by this research initiative and      other recent advances in neuroscience.                               Background       In the last decade alone, scientists have made a number of      landmark discoveries that now create the opportunity to      unlock the mysteries of the brain, including the sequencing      of the human genome, the development of new tools for mapping      neuronal connections, the increasing resolution of imaging      technologies, and the explosion of nanoscience. These      breakthroughs have paved the way for unprecedented      collaboration and discovery across scientific fields. For      instance, by combining advanced genetic and optical      techniques, scientists can now use pulses of light to      determine how specific cell activities in the brain affect      behavior. In addition, through the integration of      neuroscience and physics, researchers can now use high-     resolution imaging technologies to observe how the brain is      structurally and functionally connected in living humans.       While these technological innovations have contributed      substantially to our expanding knowledge of the brain,      significant breakthroughs in how we treat neurological and      psychiatric disease will require a new generation of tools to      enable researchers to record signals from brain cells in much      greater numbers and at even faster speeds. This cannot      currently be achieved, but great promise for developing such      technologies lies at the intersections of nanoscience,      imaging, engineering, informatics, and other rapidly emerging      fields of science and engineering.                 Key Investments to Launch this Effort       To make the most of these opportunities, the National      Institutes of Health, the Defense Advanced Research Projects      Agency, and the National Science Foundation are launching      this effort with funding in the President's FY 2014 budget.       National Institutes of Health: The NIH Blueprint for      Neuroscience Research--an initiative that pools resources and      expertise from across 15 NIH Institutes and Centers--will be      a leading NIH contributor to the implementation of this      initiative in FY 2014. The Blueprint program will contribute      funding for the initiative, given that the Blueprint funds      are specifically devoted to projects that support the      development of new tools, training opportunities, and other      resources. In total, NIH intends to allocate approximately      $40 million in FY 2014.       Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency: In FY 2014,      DARPA plans to invest $50 million in a set of programs with      the goal of understanding the dynamic functions of the brain      and demonstrating breakthrough applications based on these      insights. DARPA aims to develop a new set of tools to capture      and process dynamic neural and synaptic activities. DARPA is      interested in applications--such as a new generation of      information processing systems and restoration mechanisms--     that dramatically improve the way we diagnose and treat      warfighters suffering from post-traumatic stress, brain      injury, and memory loss. DARPA will engage a broad range of      experts to explore the ethical, legal, and societal issues      raised by advances in neurotechnology.       National Science Foundation: The National Science      Foundation will play an important role in the BRAIN      Initiative because of its ability to support research that      spans biology, the physical sciences, engineering, computer      science, and the social and behavioral sciences. The National      Science Foundation intends to support approximately $20      million in FY 2014 in research that will advance this      initiative, such as the development of molecular-scale probes      that can sense and record the activity of neural networks;      advances in ``Big Data'' that are necessary to analyze the      huge amounts of information that will be generated, and      increased understanding of how thoughts, emotions, actions,      and memories are represented in the brain.                          ____________________
