Speaker, It is my distinct honor to commend seven dedicated teachers from Northwest Indiana who have been voted outstanding educators by their peers for the 2000-2001 school year. These individuals, Darwin Kinney, Zita Dodge, Mary Hedges, Judy Seehausen, Sandra Baker, Pat Reyes and Pat Nemeth, will be presented the Crystal Apple Award at a reception sponsored by the Indiana State Teachers Association. This glorious event will take place at the Broadmoor Country Club in Merrillville, Indiana, on Wednesday, May 16, 2001.  Darwin Kinney, from Crown Point Community School Corporation, has taught for 34 years at Crown Point High School. While Darwin carries a heavy teaching load of Biology and Life Science, he has always been dedicated to maintaining personal interaction with his pupils. His commitment to students is obvious. As an educator, Darwin works closely with his students during and after school, ensuring that they maximize their potential. His desire to educate and enlighten the minds of the young adults who enter his room is evident in the way in which he interacts with his classes.  Zita Dodge, from Hanover Community School Corporation, uses several different learning styles to reach every student. The love and care that she shows the children is reflected on every student's face. Zita started teaching in Hanover in 1970, where her career began as a music teacher. She then taught kindergarten and later moved on to teach first grade. During her service as an educator, Zita has served on several district and building committees. Continuing to challenge herself through education, Zita went back to school to become a counselor and was hired as a Home School Facilitator. For the past five years, Zita has enjoyed being back in the classroom teaching first grade. Zita has always unselfishly dedicated herself to the field of education, both to the children who were in her many classes and to all the adults that she helped become better parents and teachers.  A dedicated teacher for 32 years, Mary Hedges of the School Town of Highland is a role model, inspiration and an outstanding professional. Mary is a wonderful caring teacher who frequently creates hands-on lessons for her students. She is always ready to listen to others. Mary is very active in the School Corporation. She is an officer of the PTO, sits on the Science Curriculum Committee and the Textbook Committee, and helps with the Performance Based Assessment.  Judy Seehausen began her teaching career in 1974 in Columbus, Georgia, and is currently employed in the Lake Central School Corporation in St. John, Indiana. When Judy and her family moved to Indiana, she taught at Kahler Middle School. In 1979, Judy earned a life license in English, Guidance and Counseling and began working as a counselor at the high school. Judy returns to the classroom every summer to teach English, maintaining her teacher-student perspective. Teachers turn to Judy as their strongest advocate and her peers describe her as an outstanding and dedicated professional. She is a diplomat, creative problem solver and a mediator for all.  As a professional educator during her thirty years of service to the School Town of Munster, Sandra Baker has been a valuable asset. Sandra is a leader in civic education, and has led her classes to superior rankings in the regional and state ``We the People'' constitutional hearings for eight consecutive years. In 1995, the American Lawyers Auxiliary named Sandra ``Elementary Teacher of the Year.'' For the past 15 years, she has taught a full-time magnet class for academically talented 5th graders. Sandra's greatest desire is to leave a positive mark on the world through her work with children.  Pat Reyes from North Newton School Corporation in Morocco, Indiana, has been a third grade teacher at Lincoln Elementary School for twenty-six years. Pat is conscientious about having her students meet the standards expected of them, but she also gets involved in many extracurricular activities. For example, Pat works with the National Arbor Day Foundation in order to involve the school in an annual tree planting ceremony. She also is instrumental in coordinating special observances such as Read Across America Day, Grandparents' Day and PTA sponsored events. Pat is a continuous source of enthusiasm for her student and others.  Pat Nemeth's high school teaching career is coming to a close as she nears a well-deserved retirement. Pat has taught at North Newton High School, Hanover Central High School, and for 24 years at Lowell High School. In addition to teaching business courses in the Tri-Creek School Corporation, she also teaches courses at Davenport University. Pat is the past recipient of the Inland-Ryerson Steel Outstanding Teacher Award, I wish Pat a long, happy, and healthy retirement.  Mr. Speaker, I ask you and my distinguished colleagues to join me in commending these outstanding educators on their receipt of the 2000-2001 Crystal Apple Award. The years of hard work they have put forth in shaping the minds and futures of Northwest Indiana's young people is a true inspiration to us all.                          ____________________
