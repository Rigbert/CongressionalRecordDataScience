 Speaker, I rise today to call the attention of my Colleagues to the following letter I received from a young Vermonter. Philip Burgin-Young is nine years old, and likes to play soccer, as well as study math and science. At the same time, Philip has to regularly check his blood sugar, take three insulin shots a day, and closely watch what he eats, because he is diabetic. Like Philip, I believe that our government must do more for the 16 million Americans suffering from diabetes by investing in a cure to the disease.  I call the attention of my colleagues to this moving letter and submit the letter for the Congressional Record for their benefit.     February 21, 1999.Hon. Bernie Sanders,     U.S. House of Representatives,     Washington, DC.       Dear Representative Sanders: My name is Philip Burgin-     Young, and I am nine years     old. I have had diabetes almost four years. I love to play      soccer, study math, and experiment with science. To be able      to do these things, I have to work real hard to take care of      my diabetes. That means that I check my blood sugar at least      six times a day (but usually closer to ten times), have at      least three shots of insulin a day (in my stomach, arms,      legs, and buttocks), count every gram of carbohydrate and fat      that I eat, and make sure that I exercise a lot to keep my      blood sugar balanced. My parents also check my blood sugar in      the middle of the night while I am sleeping. But even doing      these things, it is impossible to keep my blood sugar in the      normal range all of the time. Diabetes is a very complex      thing.       It is not easy to describe what it is like living with      diabetes. But I have two stories that can describe it a      little. The first story is about something my sister said to      me. One day my sister said that if she had diabetes and then      a cure was discovered, she would go out and eat a dozen      donuts. She asked me what I would do. I said, ``I wouldn't go      out and eat a dozen donuts. I WOULD JUST BE SO RELIEVED!'' I      could tell that she couldn't really understand what it feels      like to live with diabetes every minute of every day, even      though she does help me with my diabetes. The second story is      about something that happens all of the time, because I play      soccer on a couple of teams. Before I go on the field I      always check my blood sugar to make sure that I'm not too      high or too low. If I'm too high, I can't play and I need to      have a shot of insulin. Even though I do everything I am      supposed to do to take care of my diabetes, this does happen      and I missed the beginning of our playoffs because I was too      high. If I'm too low, I also can't play and have to wait      about 15 minutes for the food that I eat to get into my      system. Then, during half time I do the same thing--I recheck      my blood sugar. At the end of the game I check again to make      sure I'm not too low or too high.       I want a cure for diabetes so that I can do what I want      with my life--I want to be healthy and I want to help other      people by being a scientist who helps to find cures for      diseases. I also want a cure for all of the other people who      have diabetes. As hard as it is for me with diabetes, at      least I am lucky because my mom and dad and sister help me      try to take real good care of myself. Some kids aren't so      lucky and they end up in the hospital often.       Will you please vote for more money for research, to try to      find a cure for diabetes? I know that with more money      scientists will be able to find a cure more easily. There are      so many areas that are being researched and if they don't      have enough money they can't do the research. PLEASE HELP!           Sincerely,                                              Philip Burgin-Young.                               ____________________
